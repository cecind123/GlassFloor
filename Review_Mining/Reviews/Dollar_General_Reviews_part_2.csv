rating,review
good,This was my first job that was not 1099 work and put me into a structured environment where i quickly took a leadership role picking up and leading the members on my team.
good,"Not a good place to start a career.  if you get hired as a DM or hire that’s a different story.  But, even then I hear the hours are long and your on salary"
good,Don’t to much for that little pay. Stocking and running th e register for the same pay. This job isn’t enough to get by in life if you have kids don’t work here
good,"In New York State at least, there are very few hours available across stores and managers are either fantastic or terrible. If a Dollar General has too many employees then Sales Associates are reduced to 4hrs a week and it is not a livable wage. Coworkers are typically chill and fun people."
good,"Starting cashiers didn’t have great hours or pay, and as a college student with a busy schedule, I couldn’t stay there. Manager was kind and coworkers were as well."
good,It’s a good company but you have no work life balance at Dollar General.Its very demanding and stressful for the most part.Their not evolving as to what is needed to be successful in their stores.
good,"This organization provided me an opportunity to excel in the customer service arena. In addition, I also learned to stock and inventory shelf products."
good,"Nice and busy environment, can't say my experience there was all that great but that was just the location I was working at, but other locations I shopped at were amazing"
good,Just thrown into a position without much training. Does not explain fully what was done wrong and how to fix things. Hired for assistant manager took 3 months to get the title and pay that was offered at time of hiring.
good,At Dollar General you find a lot of fun in the job depending on your employees and customers. You will not be able to work at a steady pace because work will get behind due to lack of great store management.
good,"I would say the hours, depending on the store or amount of people at the said store you might not get a lot of hours. I would say this is a good starting job to get experience Within retail."
good,My district manager is a nasty and makes it a bad environment. Hours always get cut and you run the store all the time by yourself. They don’t care about there employees
good,"It was good the manager in painter virgina was good friendly and the co workers were nice there also, Did not have any complaints about the customer service and I was a fast worker but always put a smile to everyone's faces"
good,"They don’t have a very flexible schedule. I aways had to do most of the work and I never got any recognition for what I did. I never got a raise, the pay rate is very low."
good,"depending on store manager, it was okay.  you had to deal with difference rules although rules were supposed to be across the border, different stores had different set of rules. but do your job duties and know your employee handbook."
good,The workers are very friendly when you walk in but it is always crowded with boxes of merchandise for the truck loads. It is hard to see around them and get what you need. The management is very nice and understanding
good,"Good work life balance in my current position however, management's often lack of experience in the remodel scope of operations can cause frustrations in the day to day completion of tasks"
good,N/A Dollar General is a decent company to work for. But managers do not have professional nor the district managers. I was underpaid for hours worked.
good,The work place could be better with security. I've been there going on 4 months and have been robbed three times. I feel like i have to watch myself every time i hit the time clock. There is no safety button to push if any thing happens to the employees there. The work you put in to the company its not worth the pay. The pay should be more for the type of work i have to do. I just feel unsafe when i'm there. i need something better very soon.
good,At Dollar General i performed the necessary skills of communicating and interacting with customers. I also worked as a maintenance guy and helped the elderly carry groceries to their vehicles.
good,"Great job for you if you like to be busy and stay on your feet. Job requires you to pick up on things between 10-25 pounds. When you aren't working as a cashier, you're stocking and recovering shelves."
good,"I started with Dollar General while I was still in high school, and for the most part the job was what you would expect from working in retail. The manager I had during my time there was wonderful to work for. They did what the company required of them to do, and delegated as was fit for your position. Within a few months I was able to go from a Sales Associate to a Key Holder, and a while after graduating high school was able to make it to Assistant Manager. Thanks to low retention rate, if your work ethic is above average, you'll likely be able to find a path to promotion easily."
good,"Ringing up sales, stocking, sweeping floors"
good,Your not gonna learn anything about me reading it off a computer screen your best bet is to call and talk me to personal no one every learned how good a person is by reading about them talk about themselves.
good,It's a great place to get experience in customer service and cash handling. If you like people and interaction this is a great place. If you have the right type of store manager you will definitely go far. Good luck
good,"To much work expected for such little pay, unrealistic expectations from management to employees, and there's never enough people being hired so the current employees are overworked."
good,Barely no management! No support or training! Management changes on the regular.  Poor inventory of the basics! No toilet paper in the bathroom. And they sell toilet paper!
good,"Dollar General provides a low level of upper management support for assistant mgrs and store mgrs. District mgrs make store visits at most 2x a year and regional mgrs once a year. Phone, text, and email communications are rarely responded to in a timely fashion."
good,Dollar General is an okay place to work at. You have to pretty much be someone’s favorite to get anywhere with the company. The plus side is you do get paid weekly even the pay isn’t all that.
good,"- Dealing with customers on a daily basis "
good,"It was a good job, lots of people. The pay wasn't the best, but it was a job. Would recommend for older people because its an easy job. The customer were good people and enjoyed seeing them."
good,"My hours were all over the place. How does one go from 30+ hours to barely past 14? I had never missed a day, and still couldn't get the weekend off.."
good,"Pay is low and you can get a bad management team. Understaffed is always a issue. Not the stores fault, it is all corporate. Can be very stressful if you are in any Key position. I have worked a month straight and because I was a SM, it didn't matter."
good,Only getting 8 hrs a week....not enough.  Good for school students. Been there for three months now a key holder and they are slowly fading more off of the schedule.  Management not that great either.
good,"My biggest disappointment is the amount of workload verses the budgeted salary that they distribute to stores. "
good,"Sales associates are supposed to stock shelves AND cashier, which makes it difficult to please customers when you have other jobs to finish. Breaks were 30 minutes per shift. I overall enjoyed the job, just did not appreciate the stress from customers when you are only one person."
good,"The employees and store manager i worked with were fantastic, but anybody above that was terrible. we had problems n the store that had to be fixed by higher management and it never happened. terrible company that doesnt really care to much about its employees."
good,"The work/life balance is almost nonexistent for me - constantly being called in on my days off and have to work evenings which make doing anything else impossible. The benefits are overpriced. The schedules are inconsistent and posted late. Overall - not a terrible place to work at, any job will have its downside. In my opinion, it’s just not a job I see myself doing for many years."
good,Working for Dollar General was a great experience. Everyone I worked with was very focused and fun. Manager was very helpful teaching me all I needed to know. I moved up very fast thanks to her teaching me and just the fact I was so focused and determined to be the best at the job. The hardest part of my job was the unloading of the stocking the store but even that was enjoyable once you got used to it. I handled   all the money and delegated responsibilities to others in the nicest way possible. Dealing with all the customers was a highlight in my job I loved dealing with the customers helping them get everything they needed and tried to handle any problems they had.
good,Its not a bad job but i am looking for a better job. The people here are nice. I work mostly night shift. Its a small store. We do our so the store and look nice and neet.
good,Work was great. Dealt with the daily thefts as much as possible. Enjoyed customers. Management was extremely poor. I learned that work maybe stressful but there’s always a good thing bout it either who your working with or the customers themselves. Hardest part about working there would have to be knowing people was stealing and there was nothing really we could do about it.
good,I had a good time working there but it didn’t fit what I wanted or was looking for. The hours were Flexible but people never showed up for work and management could’ve used Work.
good,"The schedule, for the most part, was on-time. There was a lot of regular customers. The store was easy to navigate, therefore making it easy to stock and help customers."
good,"My first run was amazing! Great team! My 2nd run was horrible, never enough time to complete the tasks required and always had my position threatened!"
good,I liked it until my hours got cut short when I was a good worker all because I had school to days out the week and the new people had an open schedule.
good,My boss tonya motivated me to be the best worker I could be I honestly really enjoyed working there but advancing was hard and the pay was not enough for the work I put in but over all a great experience because of my hard working boss
good,If you’re looking for a job which has room to grow this might not be for you. It’s a great job if you’re starting to work or a good job to end and head into retirement this is for you. Environment is relaxed as far as coworkers however you still have to stock while you are the cashier on shift which can be difficult when you don’t have direct sight of the register.
good,They were a good company to work for until u get hurt on the job and they make u leave for wanting ur medical Bill's payed. Other than that management as in gmail n grocery was awesome.
good,"The Dollar General doesn't pay you for your experience in retail, the pay scale was low along with not enough hours and are you stocking, cleaning etc... for the same amount a hour."
good,Dollar general was an OK environment. i didn’t have to many coworker friends so it was a lonely environment for me but my paychecks always looked as they should
good,The job itself was easy and never too complicated. Management really lacked. boss was just really negative and rude and often let her outside life affect her work.
good,"A typical day at work, you clock in and work at a register and do other store tasks "
good,Nothing special. This job is easy to learn and keeps you busy. There's always something to do which I liked because your work day goes by faster. Never a dull moment.
good,"would have been if I was passed over for someone not as qualified as I, if I wasn't judged for being $3 dollars short while the Assist manager is 25 minutes late and the Store Manager covers for her"
good,"Customer service was the biggest thing. An the never ending truck deliveries. Huge orders that never got entirely out on the floor. making walking through the store difficult and customers often complained. "
good,I loved my job that the dollar market and most people I worked with the manager was ok. I would still be there is it wasn’t for my kids needing me to be at home with them.
good,"Not enough payroll to give the employees enough hours. Too much work for too little pay. Management at my store was great, but the district manager expected too much from management in general."
good,At dollar General the job itself wasn’t what made it poor it was the management that ended up being the downfall. There were also issues with staffing and having designated days off.
good,my job was easy i left because my manager made me choose my job over my daughter who was in the hospital with double reptured ear drums. the job it self was easy fun. i loved the customers and my co-workers.
good,I currently work there it isn’t a bad job I work with great people but the pay sucks everyone from associate to store manager needs to have higher pay we bust our butts for nothing. I am a cashier (part time) work full time hours and I don’t get anything but a paycheck. No vacation time no insurance and no advancement.
good,"Honestly, I don’t see dollar General as a long term. The pay was low ($8) the store was very nasty & nobody there really cared much for the store. A lot of expired items & overflowing back stock. I would only recommend it if there was nothing better in the area or if you wanted a little extra cash in your picket & and a flexible schedule"
good,"Company expects you to eat sleep and breathe dollar general. they make the store managers work mandatory six days a week, taking away from families. District managers and regional managers do not care if you ;have a family you must work non stop and make sure you stay under payroll hours."
good,"Dollar General is a fast paced customer oriented business that requires managers to be focused all the time, there is always changes in the store to be made."
good,"The management could be better and so could the pay but for a part-time job it's not that bad. I've learned a decent amount from working there but it isn't somewhere I'd make my life career,"
good,a typical day at work for me was coming in at 10 at night start the day off grabbing some boxes made sure the door are lock so nobody come in when they working we have break every 2 and half hour untill 6 in the morning
good,"The Sunbury Dollar General had poor management, with a manager who would change the schedule constantly. She'd always be outside on a cigarette break. The A/C rarely worked. One time we lost all the chocolate in the store due to the A/C not working."
good,"Always only two people work at my store not able to get all of our jobs done based 3400 deposit from my drawer alone. aside from that, it is fast paste so the days go by fast. Luckily my management takes into account how busy our days go"
good,I found them to not care about us workers higher up not caring about us managers and their stores to help be and stay successfully ahead of the game. So I wouldn't recommend if someone is looking long-term career to go there...
good,It's was my first job I really enjoyed it but it was a temporary position. I feel like it help me learn how the company working with product coming in and leaving to the stores. I appreciate the little time I had working there.
good,A typical day of work goes by fast.  I learn how to interact with customers .  Management is very good.  Hardest part of the job is making sure you accomplish everything before the work day is done.
good,"Great working place, with great customers.The management was not so great he barely gave me hours. The hardest part of the job is not making your customers happy"
good,"It was a great place to work at , great hours , the coworkers were great. Very good schedule, would honestly work there again , everyone was very understanding and helpful."
good,"a typical work day involves multitasking, if working the register you were also required to maintain front half of the store including but not limited to stocking on truck day. if working on the floor you were in charge of assisting all customers , assisting in theft control, display and price changes, all stock placement and trash removal; if shift manager in charge of counting safe whether at open or close, running all financial reports at close of shift, opening manager handles drops to bank daily, shift position changes regularly. no set hours ;"
good,"My store in particular I love my crew, well all but one, but its very tedious and stressful being a keyholder not a type of place id want to be ast manager or manager at."
good,liked my job at the Dollar General until my boss got fired. Its really a good job for someone that works 2 jobs or in school. They work with you on your schedule. It's not a really hard job.
good,"Corporate doesn’t knows anything about the day to day operations of the store. A busy store shouldn’t have just 2 employees working one shift. Which means more than 20 customers in line at once, shoplifters walking out without a problem, and customers complaining about empty selves because not enough employees stocking selves. It puts more stress on employees to work even faster and harder because the company doesn’t want to put more hours into a store. Also difficult when a store gets a new store manager every 6 months and the store will not see the manager for 2 and a half weeks."
good,"Challenging work inviroment with poor work, life balance with excellent opportunity for rewards for meeting sales and shrink goals. Pay is very fair. Small box store environment operating in challenging locations where meeting consistent staffing needs is an ongoing process to consistently meet work flow goals and processes."
good,"A typical day at work consists of customer service, stocking, and money handling. I learned how to spot counterfeit dollar bills as well as many retail tips that made the job easier. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you can assist a customer with exactly what they want."
good,"I love working here. I just don’t think anyone is paid enough to if they work here. Believe it or not, it’s hard work. Other than that, Dollar General is a great place to work at."
good,This job is mainly for just out of high school/ college students but not for a cost of living. Its not a bad place to work but it's not great the people who work there make it better
good,"The job was easy most time, stressful with scammers, and the staff was never a problem. However no advancement options and no talk of raises ever. Overall fine"
good,"count in cash drawer check what needed to be done that night then run cash register until cashier come in then recover store and put away reshops, give breaks, answer phone, get paper work ready for closing, count change fund, count down all cash drawers, count deposit, lock up cigarette case and turn alarm on"
good,Dollar General company is a great company! Its main problem is they do  have competive wages! The work load and pay is not balanced! YOU NEVER MAKE ENOUGH FOR WHAT YOU DO! You are basically over the entire store and responsible for everything that happens in your store for a low annual salary! I would recommend them for a temporary position but not for a permanent place of employment!  They pay their managers more now but back then if you were promoted from within you got the bottom base salary in which barely covered living expenses!
good,Dollar General is a relaxed environment but it doesn't pay enough or provide me with enough hours to make up for such low pay. I feel the work they give is not worth doing since I am paid so little.
good,Previous Dollar General management expected unrealistic job performance.  Stocking shelves while working the cash register at the same time.  Took attention and efficiency away from customer.
good,"Decent workplace"
good,Store managers are expected to work more than they are required. Store managers work 6 - 7 days a week and go weeks without days off. They have ungodly turnover and the company does nothing when it comes to competitive pay scales.
good,"Well, one thing I WILL give to Dollar General is that it's a job anyone can get and since it was my first job, I was new to everything. Now that I have SOME customer service experience, I have an idea of what it's like to work."
good,"At the Dollar General, I was a sales associate. As that I had the tasks of running a cash register, answering questions, stocking,recovering, and loading my register."
good,Had a great starting manager who took the time to show you how to Do the job but when he left my DG was giving a 20 yr old child who managed to run off 4 cashiers and  his assistant manager in just 2 weeks. Nothing was ever his fault . Keyholders were written up if the registers didn't balance out problem was that it would be his that didn't balance so we would get in trouble for his screw ups. He would call you in early just so he could go outside to smoke and he wouldn't help when costumers would be lined up  or if you did something he didn't agree with he would shake his head when walking away. I liked work the my old crew and I really did like the peiple who would come in but 7.20 an hour for that headache just isn't worth it.
good,Working there wasn't hard. The job itself was simple. I learned how to drive a RTC. And I learned how to pick in a warehouse. Management could be better. The hardest part was the long hours. I once worked 65 hours in one week with only a day off. The hours made it hard to get through the week but I managed. I loved keeping busy. That was the best part. There was never a time when I was bored.
good,"This job was actually very decent. However the concerns include often incooperative co-workers at times, and much more rude customers than normal."
good,"When I would at night with a specific co worker she would rush me to hurry up and make the deposit so she could go home, there was another night with the same co worker where she just unlocked the door and left, next day I go to tell my manager and he tells me its ok he gave her permission to leave even though the training video says to have everyone leave together. Also I was working there for a couple months and was asked if i wanted to be a key holder at first I declined then i felt like I was being pressured into becoming a key holder. everyone that was a key holder or assistant manager kept saying its a great position and how they wished they could leave on break but can't because i wasn't a key holder and they had to stay at the store with me."
good,"I have learned how to read and understand business reports, trends, and how to effectively lead a team. Pro - customers."
good,"My manager at Dollar General was an excellent person, however the company underpaid employees for the work they required them to do, with extremely high standards that would be difficult for many employees to meet. I enjoy working for my manager, but would never recommend this workplace to anyone, simply due to incompetent pay, and extremely high hours per week. I was struggling to meet my cost of living from month to month due to the pay."
good,"Work almost full time one week; then the next week you're lucky to get 15 hours. Also, the manager of the store had a ""do as I say, not as I do"" kind of attitude."
good,The coming and going of employees was too much. Then 2 of the managers were slow paced or lazy. Worked 50 sometimes 60 hours a week. Not enough pay for that kind of work.
good,"Management never has the schedule out on time. Today being friday, I still dont know when I work this weekend. Constant drama, someone is always talking about someone."
good,they do not pay good for living they don't have enough hours to keep anyone there they also show favoritetism. we had to do so much for that little pay
good,"Most enjoyable part of working is the customers, the hours are variable anywhere from 5 am-10:20 pm , hardest part , closing & back 5 am next day, as well as the very physically demanding part of this job, I have a great store manager, works with us all very well and I have learned allot from her."
good,"You are stocking and organizing merchandise for the store each day."
good,"The manager will make or break the job. Our district manager was always on to us, and we could never keep people because we were paid minimum wage. You stock the whole store, with 2 people, One to run the register and as the higher up you are expected to stock everything in 2 days, when you have no help, and no hours to give for help."
good,Was ok to work there. Upper management seem to have never worked in a store themselves so have to general knowledge how to run their stores. Way to much drama.
good,"minimum wage for a job that is not meant for a cashier. you are required to clean, unload trucks. stock and organize merchandise. merchandize was never rotated so many products were expired"
good,I hope all dollar generals are not the same but better pay is definitely needed for all the roles a cashier has. If it's part time the hours are real flexible and the job is not too demanding as long as you're not a key holder or manager
good,"I would say the working environment was very messy, over stocked not many people worked there so I had no days off.When you ask for time off you have to give two weeks a head of time but they never checked  the calendar so you could never get the days off you need. Not all Dollar Generals are bad just the one in Pelham, Ga"
good,The biggest problem about this job is the hours some weeks you are working 20+ hours and others your working 10-12 hours which makes it very difficult to manage things
good,"There was a high level of employee turnover at the Dollar General location I worked at.  I worked under two different store managers during my time there.  Both seemed to be working under a lot of stress and it became a toxic work environment. The pay was okay and I enjoyed interacting with the customers. The store managers were receiving a lot of pressure from the district level and the passed this pressure on to the employees that worked beneath them. After the holiday season my hours went from at least 40 hours to 25 so that the store would come in under the budget.  I was expected to run a register, stock, and provide quality customer service with fewer hours.  Many times I would be the only employee working during a given shift.  I learned a lot during my time at Dollar General but from all of the turnover and personal experience, they don't treat their employees well."
good,"good for younger people not needing a job, no hours for employees or pay, underpaid management, no support team for managers, company doesn't care for employees , only negative feedback"
good,Couldn't get much over 11 hours a week and it's not worth it. Seems like they over hired  and spread out the hours too thin. Sometimes you would go in as scheduled and they would send you home.
good,I have no good or bad comments to say about the company. They are my current employer and the paycheck pays the bills that come every month like clockwork.
good,When I worked at Dollar General it was very unorganized. Besides the fact that we got paid every week there really weren't any upsides to having this job.
good,I somewhat enjoyed my time at Dollar General but I will not recommend the job if you are looking for long term. Usually I never knew when I was scheduled because it was never long term. The manager was not that great. I was barely trained then I was basically thrown on the register without any prior help. It is a laid back environment but it gets busy during the holidays. The most enjoyable part were the slow days but the hardest part was that they were short staffed.
good,"It's a good job for wanting part time, most of the managers are fine, the hardest part of the job is when hours are cut for extended periods of time. I learned patience at the job."
good,"was required to work a minimum of 50 hours a week mandatory 6 days, but with the lack of hours given to schedule other employees the salary managers are expected to pick up the difference. I continually worked 60-80 hours a week. No work/home balance."
good,I really enjoyed working here the first 4 years I worked in the company. Then took a break and came back a few times - disliked more each time I went back.different manager-  different Co workers .....
good,Hours are typically long. The aggressive growth of the company has produced very high demand. My first couple years were nice. We worked 8-9hrs a day with some flex for overtime voluntarily. Worked around 38-42hrs a week consistently. At the present time a good week is 42hrs and its frequently 50hrs or more. Work life balance has been low for the last couple years and does not look to improve. It seems every week we end up shipping MORE than what was planned. This makes for a lot of inconsistency and disappointing news that there will be mandated hours to work. This happens nearly EVERY week. The work itself is physical and there's a lot of good people to work with. Although the fast pace isn't for everyone and can be stressful.
good,"I did not like working at this particular store. I was getting paid minimum wage yet I was constantly doing all of these other jobs. There were only 3 people working per shift and I was the only one who was at the front of the store working with customers. Management rarely gave me any info about deals or what to do when common things happen. Tried my best with what I had, but I don't recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Expected to follow procedure but when it comes to lunches, you are expected to take them even if you have no coverage and punished by write ups if you can't take one. Supposed to get a uninterrupted lunch break which is never the case. Also some employees allowed to be late or no call no show where as others are wrote up or terminated on first occurance. Favoritism also takes place. Never received a raise, was praised vocally but never given performance evaluation."
good,Great to learn how to work as in its a good starter job for people just getting into the workforce. Great first job. This job helps build experience in customer service and more.
good,Working at the dollar general would be a really good job for someone younger. But for someone that is trying to be serious in a working job then I don’t know of how good of a fit it would be.
good,"Stocking, lableing, taking care of the customers. It was a pretty simple slow paced job except for when it got busy rushes here and there. It was easy to understand and picked up things rather quickly."
good,Easy job for someone to start out. Good experience for first time employee to get the knowledge of how the workplace expects from an employee....not very stressful but has to be in point with cash register
good,"the in store atmosphere was great, the general manager and assistant managers were kind, fair and a treat to work with, but the higher up managers were a different story entirely."
good,Its a good place to start a first job but the pay is very low for a family. Not enough help to get everything done in a day also. Be ready to do more than one thing at a time.
good,"Woring at dollar tree was good if you need the little money to made it . the worker greeting customers. Cleaning , Sweeping , Mopping , Answering phones"
good,"Every week you stock, recover, and clean. You don't even get a store discount. I'm the only one getting paid 8.50 and make 100 and some change every week. I cant live off that its like chump change. As soon as I get my check I get gas and that's 30 dollars gone already."
good,"The stores I worked at were ok, some of the time it was not ok, but I don't really want to go into that. Most of the time thought the customers where always a pleasure to work with, helping them find things also helped me find where things go when I stock the shelves."
good,"I love my job working at Dollar general. As the assistant manager I work long days 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. I received a hour break, but I can't even enjoy my break because the cashier always need a void, or somebody comes in with a return. As an employee you don't get paid holidays. they are only close one day and that's Christmas. They only pay time and a half for three holidays, majority of the holidays you don't get paid for."
good,No hours and poor management  manager was not willing to give more hours and would not work with schedule at all payed weekly but the pay was not enough to live with
good,"A typical day involved helping the customers, working the register, stocking, and facing the shelves. In higher positions you were required to manage the shifts of your subordinates to ensure timely meal and rest times were afforded, while maximizing customer availability. Management varies by person, seeing as there was a rather high turnover rate, however your coworkers are generally pleasant. The hardest part of the job was perhaps the unreasonable expectations placed on the associate, in no small part, because of the unrealistic expectations placed on management."
good,It was a job to pay the bills while I was in school. The people I worked with were enjoyable to be around but the scheduling could have been better. It is typical retail work.
good,"I truly enjoyed helping at Dollar General. It was fun and rewarding most the time. Did not like scheduling  being posted so late. Head of floor did not do very good job at scheduling so therefore sometimes difficult but always made myself available even when not scheduled. "
good,"More Organzation, performance coaching and accountability could change the entire company around. Take notice of those clearly qualified to lead whether new or seasoned and implement them accordingly."
good,I became a key holder (lower management) and had a ton of extra duties on my shoulders to later find out that an employee below me was making a wage comparable to mine. this was the most advancement you could hope for.
good,Multiple job opportunities. Ability to move up from a part-time stocker to assistant manager.  Hours are flexible at times and doesn't require any experience.
good,the job is fun if you have a good team behind you to help get things done. the truck process can get a little tiresome because it’s so early in the morning.
good,"Stressful work environment, no weekends off, low pay range. "
good,"Dollar General is a good place to start working for those looking for a first job or those looking for something fast. There is room for advancement, but it can be difficult to get a promotion and a lot is demanded of you if you do. The job as a whole can be very stressful."
good,I had to quit because it was really bringing me down and on edge all the time. That place was behind so much it stressed out employes. I learned a lot.
good,"I Worker at Dollar General and I had Great Hours and Worker Around Doctor Appointment and got a Great Weekly Pay. However, I was in a Venice Accident and The Store did not want Me to be Kept Overnight for Observation at The Hospital. I was Very Annoyed at Their Treatment of Me."
good,"During my time working for Dollar General, I encountered a lot of different personalities and problems. Some of which I felt could have been handled different by my management staff but overall, the atmosphere was good for the most part, the pay wasn’t bad for the job, but it just wasn’t the job for me."
good,the time I was there it wasn't bad it wasn't enough hours when you have a family tho...but in all you deal with the public so you talk to diiferent people every day
good,"If you're good at multi-tasking and attempting to do the jobs of multiple people as one person then this job will be fine for you. You're often times the only cashier on at the register while doing side-work while management does their own daily routines. There is minor cleaning responsibilities that you must do along with closing. Management is a dice roll, sometimes you get helpful and good management, and other times you get ones that are completely disorganized.  The people you work with you won't see enough to get to know in depth, but generally it's pretty easy to get along with everyone.  The hardest part of the job is definitely being at the register because you are expected to tend to busy lines and put things away too. If you're part-time you don't get benefits of course, but the work schedule is usually pretty flexible and management is pretty understanding. Overall, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either.  There were things to improve, but i would go back if things changed."
good,The work is sometimes too fast paced but other than that it is a good place to work for a little while. Can be a good place to progress in management if you work hard enough.
good,it was a ok place to work I liked stocking and doing what I did there but it wouldn't be a place where I would want to spend the rest of my life working
good,"Most days involved a mad dash to use the one or two employees that were allowed on the pay roll for that day to put up enough stock so that when the truck arrived with the new stuff later that week there wouldn't be a horrible backup. "
good,"enjoyed the work, it was well paced to my lifestyle but management was horrible and there wernt enough hours to live on even with two people working.."
good,"Dollar General is an okay place to work. You have to be able to multi-task and have good people skills. You’re always running back and forth, and will have some rude people daily, but if you can overlook that, it’s okay."
good,Job was very stressful. Was almost always either asked to work overtime or did not have enough hours. Was asked to tasks that the manager should have been doing. Went above and beyond and was not ever thanked.
good,I would love to get another chance to work at Dollar general again.  I just couldn't work with the assistant manager anymore.  And I knew that the manager wouldn't do anything about the issue.
good,"its I nice jobs but doesn’t pay well can’t even pay car insurance "
good,employees at specific job location always seemed more interested in searching for shop lifters or chasing them down after they shop lifted then doing the job of providing a nice customer service friendly environment
good,"I liked this job because at first it was very easy going getting along with your coworkers and I learned a lot about handling money, learning a lot of retail"
good,a typical day at work was stressful because of shoplifters and having to have all the product out on the selves in a certain amount of time. alot of people would call out and i would have to come in and cover there shifts. i learned to manage my time. the hardest part of the job was making sure that none of the customers shoplifted and the easiest part of the job was getting along with all the customers and interacting with new people on a daily baisis.
good,"Great interaction place with other civilians, Learning of New Appliances,Material, liquids etc.  "
good,"VERY LOW PAY!! Like, you can't expect much from getting a job at a DG. There is no motivation for working at this place, and honestly I would only go back if I really needed too."
good,I was in a high crime area. I was robbed by three gunmen. My hours were always cut  I had problems with pay often No consistency in any area. I was sent to multipkle stores and expected to drive 30 miles to work for a five hr day.
good,"Imran the district manager was terrible, he did his job all wrong and was doing inappropriate things with different store managers he doesn't care about his workers he only cares about his self."
good,lots of work and not great pay   no concern for keeping employees not great benefits  would not recommend to people that want long term employment or great pay and benefits
good,I was far happier as an ASM the managers are treated poorly. Getting time off is like pulling teeth they call you even on days off most stores are under staffed. It's all really insane. As a Sales Associate the only real headache is getting called in or not getting holidays off
good,"I've worked at two different Dollar Generals."
good,"I loved my job, and the fast busy then slow . We were short handed most times and over worked with deadlines but i still loved it. i love working with people and staying busy and it kept me busy."
good,"I personally liked my job and the people I met on a daily but I couldn’t stand my store manager, she was lazy and always made me pick up extra shifts so she’s wouldn’t have to and then would give me an attitude when I refused to take a shift."
good,It was stressful due to the management at the time.  I am not sure how it is now.  The co workers were great.  You had to work on your breaks.  The breaks were interrupted.
good,The store manager was always rude and always threatened our jobs. We were understaffed but he wouldn't hire more people. He'd over work his employees and make them do things they weren't trained for or payed for.
good,Hardest part is dealing with rude people nd trying to stay positive you got to keep your eyes open make sure people don't steel but also make sure you get all your work done while running the register
good,It was a fast paced place to work. Lots of responsibility. My only complaint was pay. I did everything I could to better the company only making $8.75 an hour.
good,Worked and enjoyed my work then had management problem where manager would not show up to unlock the door and would be setting there for an hour waiting so decided not was time to quit.
good,I dont know why companies that make lots of money nickel and dime people to death. They never have enough employees and especially at night when it busy. They only are about the.selves and not their employees.
good,"Poor management. They had one good manager, and that manager left to a different store. After that, the whole store started falling apart. The employees will lie about other employees, and openly admit to personally hating annoying customers."
good,"I enjoyed my job, I miss the customers, I love multi tasking being able to accomplish things, but the lack of upper management support and the tools you need to successfully suceed are lacking for postions theynthrough you into"
good,"Loved working with customers and setting the store.  Loved my Regional Manager but not the district manager (she wasn't competent). Company tries to micro-manage the store (so far as to control the heat and air conditioning from corporate office and not from local store, and control the staffing time).  Hourly employees always received a yearly raise but salaried employees didn't."
good,Pay is ok new 2018 trucks but they need to run teams on the unload part 130+ in the trailer each unload weights about 5k to 20k lbs only the driver unloads 2hr to 5hr unload times and avrage 3 unloads per tralier
good,"This is an easy entertaining job for the most part but can get stressful dealing with customers. If you’re a cashier you’re expected to stock the front of the store in between customers. It seems simple but I have approximately 30 seconds in between customers to stock and if you leave a customer waiting for more than a few seconds they tend to get upset. I have to juggle keeping my boss happy with the amount of product I get onto the shelves and keeping customers happy by immediately being available to check them out when they’re ready. Sometimes there will be so many people coming through the check out line that people will get upset and start questioning why there’s only one register open. Dollar general typically only allows 2 people to be working at the same time. One person to stock and another on the register. If you’re up for a challenge, are good at customer service and patient, you’ll do well. The pay is decent and promotions and raises happen fairly quickly. More than likely you’ll get plenty of hours even if you’re part-time. I tend to work more hours than I even want to work. Seeing the new merchandise come in and Having first dibs on them can be exciting. If you enjoy organizing, and staging products, youll find the job entertaining."
good,"Loved the first store I worked at, transferred to a different store to be closer to home and wish I would have stayed at the first one. Management was very poor. Wanted to transfer back to original store but position was filled."
good,This is a great company to work for.  Their problem is some of the managers that they hired. Rude and disrespectful to other employees and customers. When monies starter coming up short that it was time to go. After that manager was removed I reapplied But discovered she put on the do not rehire list.
good,A typical day at work was ringing customers up and cleaning and stocking. I learned how to open and close the store and close and open registers. Management was unfair and treated me poorly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people stealing from the store. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers out.
good,I loved interacting with each customer i came in contact with. The coworkers were good to work with and unloading the freight was the only challenging part
good,"They expect a lot for minimum wage. Stores are commonly short staffed and you are expected to pick up that slack. They want you to stock shelves inbetween customers and stress you about not getting it completed. As a fast paced person, I even found it a challenge at times to multi-task all their desired tasks."
good,"I loved working there at first, then the manager stared cutting my hours I was working 2 days a week, barely getting any hours to work. I did not like that at all."
good,"Your manager makes a big difference on how you like your job.  I liked working there, but there were some stuff that I just could not deal with.  With the right manager, it could be a great place to work."
good,"hostile work environment, but you get good hours but a horrible pay. I worked more than the other employees and did more and got paid less. Files are not secure any other employee who has access into the office can see your pay."
good,Rung customers up and cleaned my work area consistently. Pulled merchandise on each isle to the front of the shelf. cleaned the isles thoroughly each night after hours.
good,"Fast paced depending on where and when you are working. Usually something exciting everyday."
good,"While the management at the time was a nice person, but the assistant manager made the work environment uncomfortable.  I believe that assistant has left the company.  The main problem was that the assistant had too much influence on the manager, and encouraged new, freshly hired people to be given the responsibilities of lead sales associate (like opening and closing the store alone) at commensurate entry pay.  But, again, I would work for that manager again if given the opportunity."
good,You had people who work and then you had people who slack and expected others to pick up the work. Friendly people who seems to care. Hardest part of the job is getting things right to the way they wanted or expected.
good,"regional managers hired with no true experience, Good trainng for dm;s not so much for mangers and associates, Good benifits and good job if you have confidence in your regional manager"
good,"My biggest gripe with this company is that they require 6 days a week for their store managers. Vacation time is non-existent until you've been there a year. The company is also delusional about what they can accomplish with a low-paid, skeleton crew."
good,they want you to squeeze blood put of turnips....Its just not possible. They dont give you enough payroll to compensate for the workload they present..Store Managers are salaried for 40 hours a week but they want you in there 50-55hr. You have no time for family.
good,"DG is easy work. Sadly, business is open 364 days a year 14 hours a day. Basic benefits, but required to work most weekends and holidays. No discounts"
good,Due to lack of training and communication along with poor promoting within. This leaving staff lost and confused about job duties and responsibilities as they promote\place people in there management team.Could seriously benefit from a training program and placement for all levels of management. GMs are not even trained to train there staff.
good,I would only recommend working for the company if you aim to be in a higher level position where pay is higher and benefits are actually available. Any other position should be seen as a part time investment while you look for a better position or job.
good,"While I was employed  at the Dollar General Store, I had an amazing manager and coworkers. They worked with you on your schedule and hours. The customs were wonderful!"
good,"It's retail so there will be rude customers, and customers who refuse to put things back where they got them from. It's fast-paced and often times it's a lot of work."
good,company could do better at rasing morale for employees expect alot for little pay lots to do with little staff or hours so you always feel a bit overwhelmed al the time to get task done in timely fashion.
good,Some managers I have worked under do not know how to run a store. They focus on themself rather than how to better schedule their employees. I think management needs to be closer reviewed.
good,"Working at dollar general did not give many opportunities to to get a lot of hours unless its a manage position. typical work day included facing shelves, handling checkouts and cleaning the area. mananegment was okay for the most part and the job is easy friendly co workers just low pay and very limited hours."
good,The pay isn't  sufficient for the workload I  would say at least 18 but it's not something I would or could see myself doing for a long time it's not a career move it's a very decent job that's it.
good,Only work there if you don't want a full time job or no benefits. They expect you to clean and face the store when you have a continuous line at your register. Worked at 2 different stores and both stores had a lot of theft.
good,"I like working for Dollar General but they need to help there managers out just a bit more. Very stressful job, to many work hours and never get enough help. They expect way to much for only the limited hours that they give you to get things done."
good,"Typically the day consisted of stocking shelves and breaking down boxes. It is exactly what you would expect from working retail in a chain store. But it was not bad work per say, just a bit boring for my tastes."
good,"some days were more stressful than others. at my exact location, everyone did not work together. some of the employees were not treated as others were."
good,Work is very fast paced. Short staffed and no security. This job provides you with management skills because there are no boundaries in your job description. Everyone is trained to do everything.
good,"Although I liked everyone I work with in the store, I do not agree with the way Dollar General treats their employees. I feel that if people are good workers there hours should not be cut to 5 hours a week. A person can not live on that."
good,"Day to day depended greatly on how well your schedule was built. I was alone for hours at a time more than I was with another employee, so I wasn't able to complete store tasks until help arrived. I would have taken advantage of the open-door policy the company tries to enforce, but the passive-aggressive notes left by the store manager told me she wasn't interested in hearing how unhappy I was at being left alone in the middle of nowhere. The work itself wasn't difficult. Most of the time, it was time-consuming or built up from the lack of teamwork and everyone trying to complete more than they were able. Nonetheless, most of the other employees were friendly, and all customers, especially regulars, never really came in too bad of flavors."
good,"Had to learn how to be friendly, some people get mad but you have to stay calm. Coworkers were not the best. Hours were not always the best. Fast pace when running a register."
good,Could be a really great company but needs to advance to modern day technology. 3 days out the week you have to be there for 6am. The culture of your store depends on who and what you are hiring for.
good,"If your single, and have no life, this is a good job for you. You will be asked to go and help other stores all the time. Then it takes weeks before you get paid mileage."
good,"lot of going back and forth, deal with a lot of ignorant people, as well as trying to stock while ringing out customers. The hardest thing is the stress of all you have to do. the easiest is ringing out the customers."
good,"Working here wasn't too bad, i did my work and minded my own busniess and it worked out well for me. The people here are very catty and like to talk about everything and everyone."
good,"very fast paced, always on your feet, hot and muggy during summer time, long hours, different of various ways to earn more money, two different shifts"
good,The manager I worked with at first was very understandable if you couldn’t make it in. Pay isn’t all that great but it is a good job. Loved the customers who came in. They made my job a lot better.
good,"A typical work day is working at least 5 hrs by yourself. Stocking shelves and running register, checking in vendors while alone. Counting register for opening the store, counting down registers for end of day, making bank deposits. Making change orders, processing trucks, setting ads."
good,"Expectations of store managers building displays with plastic crates, plywood and security ties with no instructions was insane.  Trying to find associates that could unload trucks and do a lot of manual labor - as well as run registers and do good customer service on minimum pay was incredibly challenging.  Keeping those people motivated with such low pay and high expectations was almost impossible."
good,Sorry to say but they do not care about their employee's its all about the customers. in turn making the employees look like liars to the customers. When employees feel this way they tend to take it out on the customer and their work suffers.
good,I personally did not like working at dollar general. I especially did not like the management. They did not care about the employees or the job itself.
good,There are too many employees for the hours allowed by the corporation's budget analysis.  Most employees get 2 or 3 shifts a week at 4 hours per shift.  Pay is okay for retail.
good,If you're looking for part time Dollar General is perfect for you. The weekly hours aren't great. But at minimum wage the job is easy and perfect for someone looking for something small.
good,"Alright place to work, although they will hire anybody from what it seems. Some of the stores are just always messy and unorganized. A lot of the Store Managers are very bad at scheduling."
good,"My time working for Dollar General wasn't bad, It was just a bad time for me personally. enjoyed my co-workers and manager. My only request is more pay"
good,Was fun to work at but management demanded to much and took on more work than we could handle along with verbal abuse towards all employees. But I haven't worked there in over 2 years
good,I'm thankful for the experience I gained there. I appreciate the opportunity. If given the chance to work for this company again I believe I would just not under the same manager or location.
good,"A very difficult place to work,managers are required to work with a staff of people that are not qualified to do the employment.  Most employees on staff are under paid for the work load required and will quit within 6 months for better pay and less work.   Learned how to run a store on a shoestring budget without support from upper management.  In 1 1/2 years had 5 District managers to work with."
good,"Put up stock, arrange shelves to display products, sweep floors and clean rest rooms.  Run register, and customer service.  Very competitive place to work."
good,"The hours just dont work for me anymore..."
good,"Short or no breaks, short hours. Management was vindictive and would cut hours if you made her angry. She would tell associates what other associates said about them. Allot of work, always short handed. Most associates only got 10 to 20 hours a week."
good,ran the register stock shelves clean the store balanced your drawer...i love the customers and interacting with them and i liked getting paid weekly.....The management favors certain employees and hours are not given evenly
good,"As a manager, I was not allocated enough hours to keep my employees going. Which meant the store manager has to fill in the gaps. For the pay, I was working 50-70 work weeks...getting paid for 40."
good,"Putting truck away, facing product and setting up new displays is practically what you do everyday."
good,Easy work until it is truck day then you work your butt off. Dealing with customers on a daily basis is the best part when you get to know them day after day.  Small work staff makes for a close and friendly environment.
good,"Although I did well every day at this job, it was rarely enough. Management kept increasing expectations and piling on more daily and weekly tasks, time constraints got heavier, and the business culture is ""change the people or change the people."" It was intimidating and stressful to place those expectations on my subordinates."
good,My manager only followed the rules according to his mood and how convenient it was for him. He was filled with empty threats and inconsistency. He complained about going over his budget with his hours and needing to cut hours but never took the steps to make a proper schedule. The people who worked at my local store where expected to dedicate their lives to the store and try to make a living off of working only 5 to 7 hours a day.
good,"The most enjoyable part for this job was my customers satisfaction, and the school kids would come in after school, i use to talk to all of them and ask them how was they day at school."
good,"The multiple job duties you are required to complete every shift is not worth what I was payed hourly, at timed I would be working on management job tasks when I was only a cashier."
good,i enjoy the work i do...................................................................................................................................................Dollar general staff are friendly and out going. They treat you as family. Whether you're a co-worker or just a customer. When you need help finding something within the store someone will help you find it.
good,Worked constantly all day with no advancements within the company. It isnt a career but will help pay the bills. They should show the employees that they are values in some way.
good,"I was a fresh highschool graduate who just needed a basic job to pay for a cell phone bill and gas for the car while I attended college. It wasn't anything special for a job, offered no benefits, no full time positions (except management of course) and simply required good communications skills and heavy lifting."
good,"I worked there for two years and advanced to the position of lead sales associate. There seems to be a disconnect between between corporate and sales associates, where corporate doesn't understand what their associates go through as employees."
good,"Working in stock requires you not only drag out the roll-tainers (most of which are poorly maintained, having sharp snags and stuck wheels) and stock the shelves, but also fill the role of customer service, and janitorial functions."
good,"~ Typical day: Every day was different. You never knew what to expect, especially with serving many customers. It only gets crazy during the holidays."
good,Working at Dollar general was not really a job for me but it did have its pros and cons. One pro was it gave me register skills and more customer interaction.A con was to me management was not really professional.
good,I think maybe it might have been the store I was working in. There was some deception going on there.They needed better management there. There were problems with the district manager and the store manager.
good,"While the company in general had nothing to do with the reason I left, the management did. The particular store that I worked in was filthy, unorganized, and a rough environment to work in. I have been to several Dollar General locations, and the one in which I worked was by far the worst for the public to enter. While I enjoyed working with the public, the employees made it difficult to enjoy the job."
good,"I enjoyed working there . The management was kind and understanding , and wouldn't mind recommending someone to work for they're company . i wouldn't mind going back to work for  them."
good,"It wouldn't have been a bad place to work if there was less drama and hate from current workers, and was paid better for the hard work and effort you put in."
good,"Management is lacking in most stores. Poor management leads to dirty stores and amployees that do not care. Overall good employer, just have a lot of room for improvement."
good,I had a terrible manager. He was constantly riding me while he and the other employees did nothing and spent most of the day outside smoking. I aced all my management classes in college and the management hired a 'stranger' that knew nothing about the company and didn't even go to college instead because I had only been there 3 months...how is that right??
good,"The job was ok and the workers was the best, dollar general pay is horriable for all the work that is required. They not big on giving raises and promotions."
good,cut your hours and give them to someone else. im a college student and making the amount of money i need to survive is hard to do when they cut your hours.
good,If u have a good team then everyone should their part and help when needed. They need more hours for the employees store and pay needs to be raised. The sercurity system at my store sucks they need more cameras that shows good quality pictures.
good,"In this line of work your day is very productive. Much inventory to put away, rearrange, and distribute. Customer service is a must. Have to be a friendly face."
good,You go in to work every day not knowing what your hours consist of. You are scheduled to work thanksgiving and christmas eve and christmas. You will be scheduled to work on weekends getting in the way of your personal life. And it isn't any better for supervisors either.
good,Working at Dollar General is a job. Nothing to complain about. No issues with this company. If you want to work somewhere that is not overly stressed than this is the place.
good,"Operating all levels of store activity. How to manage all departments of store from cashiering, planograms, receiving trucks, ordering, office work, hiring employees. Keeping store clean and maintained. Providing good customer relations. Insuring store well staffed to keep store running at good steady pace. Best part getting to know my employees and customers to give better service.  Enjoyed working with the customers, helping them to find their needs. I loved my job just got to stressful."
good,"A typical day for a lead clerk includes stocking, being a cashier, voids and refunds, paperwork, training/delegating, customer interaction and  store recovery."
good,Very demanding job plan on leaving at DG if you want a model store.. Never enough labor hours or help usually there alone at times .. No work/family balance.
good,Under different circumstances this company would be a great place to work. The store manager at the time was not good at all. I have nothing positive to say so I am not going to comment.
good,"Stocking shelves, checking inventory, cleaning, making sure the customer has what they need as well as checking them out properly. Other then the low hours it was a good job"
good,This place was not managed well at all. We were always short handed and even though their policy was one manager per store our head manager was forced to work at two separate stores as manager. We never had enough of her time.
good,a lot of unnecessary drama and a bit unorganized but the pay is fair and you can get a lot of hours  if your availability is wide open and aren't on a time crunch.
good,"I am a people person I love making the customers happy. I take pride in my job . I am very dependable . Dollar general is a great task job . Its very different ,and no job impossible."
good,"It was usually slow, but a lot of the time you were stressed because you had to get everything stocked up, be a a cashier, and get everything to stay nice and clean. If you couldn't, most managers weren't very understanding.. A lot to do with little time. Lack of self expression."
good,If you catch on quickly with little to no training then this would be a great position for you.  This is a training store so the General Manager is too busy to train staff.
good,"Never put the box cutter in ya back pocket, get a long with your coworkers its a lot easier to work that way, if you are the main cashier have fun it's sooo much fun"
good,Dollar General is not a good place to work. It does not offer good benefits and not good pay. They do not care enough about their employees and I would only recommend it for someone trying to get their first job.
good,"Dollar General was a fair job but, there were always some issues with hours, work schedule shifts and the problems with keeping the store fully stocked."
good,I liked working here and I worked with some awesome ladies! However there were a couple who slacked and made things unbearable. They never did anything they were told to do and left things laying around and never did their manager duties. Other than those select few working here was a ball!
good,I will miss some co workers and definitely my customers. However when it comes to the stress and time being taking from the family I don't think it's worth it.
good,"I liked working there but Employees are always wrong.there was no consistency in work load, or consequences of behavior tardiness or no shows. Workers being high at work, should have been sent home."
good,"My very first Manager was fantastic and she understood I had a physical limitation, but she retired and I was left with a manager who had no sympathy. One day I was working and I could hardly stand or work at all. I had to go to the Emergency Room. When I returned for my next shift she talked about rewarding my coworkers for their work but not me because I had to leave. It was always busy, short breaks, but loved meeting all the new people."
good,Lots of freight every week barley staff. Great company just need more dependable staff.  Mgr was fair  good place just need more and place will good place to work.
good,This is a good place to work if you don't have children some management will work with you regarding your schedule some won't if you are not fast paced this is not a place for you
good,"For a company that is busy and growing, they lack in pay. Recently, workers were cut with hours even when we already work only part time. I was only working 5 hours a day, 18 hours a week. Sometimes I would get 20 hours or more."
good,I liked working for dollar general. The hours are just bot that good but i like they pay weekly good laid back job. The only reason i left is because i had a baby or i woyld still be there to this day.
good,I would go there for cheap stuff to buy but working there is not a place to work if your trying to get a car. Witch I'm trying to do... So I'm looking for a different job to go with Dollar General.
good,"I have worked for this company for a year and truly believe that with the right management and people who care the job duties, environment and idea of operation can be the perfect job. Short handedness in all areas and inefficiency seem to be the biggest problems. So much to do and little time to get it done. Everyone needs to be on the same page and put in the effort to get the job done."
good,Steady hours as long as your a full time employee. Poor pay for the amount of work managers expect from you. But it is a good job to get by while attending school.
good,"They want you to do everything, like wait on customers, stock shelves and recover all in the same night. "
good,My experience would've been better if i had a better manager. She didn't teach me much. Most things I had to teach myself how to do it. Other than that I loved my job.
good,"Have too many duties and not much of pay. Customers doesn't care what they do with the store and doesn't care about the employees. Mean people, and when trying to reduce shrink by calling the police, it is never a success"
good,I was a cashier I learned how to use the register. manger was cool till the new one came in she wasn't yo friendly or nice but other than that I enjoyed it
good,Cashier stocking unloading trucks plans grams  district manager unfair and don't know how to do their jobs they never worked in the store part time work to full time get paid weekly
good,if you are going to work at Dollar General you must be willing to stay busy and get your assigned job done. You must be able to multi task and work well with others. There is always something that needs to be done so you will never be bored.
good,I was given a store that was over 6 months behind. I worked open to close (6am-11pm) non-stop all 7 days a week and even though I was so dedicated and I worked so hard and never got to see my family and my district manager Just wasn’t satisfied with the performance and expected more so I started having to work from 6am to 3am the next day got the store caught up and in model store shape and I felt unappreciated. So I left the job that I did at one point loved and relocated back to Massachusetts.
good,Very fast pace you stock you do register and you work with one other person sometimes more have to live 59 pounds or more sometimes but its a fun place to work
good,"Customer service, cleaning, and stocking shelves"
good,"My manager was awesome when I worked here. The pay was minimum wage with this being a low cost company and trying to keep their budget in check. This also meant the only people who work for this company full time are senior managers. My manager was putting in around 70 hours a week, but he was salary so he only got paid for 40. Funny how that works. Sales associates are only allowed around 25 hours a week."
good,Dollar General is a good company to work for. They however don't usually give part time associates more than 20 hours a week and usually there were never enough employees in the store to help cover customer demand. You were lucky to have two employees in a store at a time.
good,The store manager was really prejudice. He complained about everything. The work was easy. The hardest part of the job was that they didn't have enough cashiers and the lines always got backed up.
good,"overall experience at store level was fun, but not the best company to work for. most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people and make new friends"
good,Wasn't a bad job at all until you move up and position. Only thing I would have to say is follow the book on everything because you want to make sure your job is secure in every way possible
good,I liked the job but did not care for some of the character of some of the supervisors. One in particular took pride in humiliating employees and i feel that is a terrible attribute to have in a supervisory position.
good,Productive and fun workplace was just the wrong environment i was round ! If i could go back i would not because of the people that work there was not friendly people.
good,"I do not feel that I should comment. I just do not want things to be taken out of context. However after having a discussion. With the corporate office, in March or April of 2017. They have assured me that I am re-hireable."
good,"Good place to work for teens, adults that just need part- time or to gain some retail experience. Learn customer service, time management and cashier experience."
good,"This job was fast past, you really have to be on your Ps and Qs. at time their were heavy loads such as stocking waiting on customers, and making sure that the store was well kept."
good,"My overall experience, the company wants to work the heck out of you but not want to pay you your overtime. The environment is very dramatic and highschool based it seems."
good,"I come in. sign in help customers, make sure everything is neat.  Zone as needed. Report any issues to the store's manager. I cleaned up before my shift is out. lock up and leave."
good,"Decent place to start career, unfortunately career advancement and pay is not the greatest or competitive. Company has a good culture but is often last in field to innovate. Amazon will crush Dollar General in near future."
good,Not terrible. Manager is a good person but its not the kind of place you go for a career or expecting to make really any money. Good for older people or if you're just starting out.
good,"A typical day for me was standing behind the counter taking care of transactions. I very rarely got a chance to stock the shelves. "
good,Alot of work with little pay. Opportunity to advance. Teamwork could be better..hard to get time off. No benefits.Meet alot of customers. Conflicts with working with school schedule
good,"enjoyed working with the public. manager not very nice and wasn't friendly with customers or employees. was very fast paced and competitive. 10 minute break, 30 min lunch. qualify for insurance after 6 months"
good,Working for dollar general was a knowledge gaining expirience. And its failry easy to move up the chain as long as you pay attention and work hard. After moving up you realize you have to do more for less.
good,The managers were rude and not very understanding about me being sick. I signed on part time but they pushed me to work almost full time hours. Got sick at work and they wanted to force me to stay and work while I was throwing up.
good,When I first started for the company I liked my job. Since I've transferred to another store in another state not so much. The management & upper management isn't very prompt or helpful with trying to further my experience with the company at another store closer to where I live.
good,"I hardly worked at the same time as my manager so I would only hear about the things she would do from other employees. She was very strict and accusatory towards everyone but hardly came into work herself. I actually was supposed to work with her on several occasions but she always left early when she did come in. That being said, the actual labor isn't bad at all."
good,"A typical day at work includes working the register and recovering shelves. I've learned how to proficiently use a cash register and work with a general populace. The management is adequate, I have a few great managers and a few sub par managers. The hardest part of the job is either difficult customers or lack of hours. The most enjoyable part is some of the genuinely great customers and the good managers I do have."
good,at work we would unload trucks and greet customers in between and help them if they need to. my most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers because sometimes the job would be real slow so helping a customer was the best part of the day
good,"Depending on the manager that you have is a good place to work. The manager that I had by the time I was there, was great. I would recomed people to go there to work"
good,"I left dollar general the first time to pursue another job that I had a big heart for, coming back the company has turned ugly. Poor Management above store level. Everything is how to make that next dollar. They are not concerned about the managers, their schedules, or anything else. I was told no matter what the store needs to be perfect, even if you have to stay all day everyday."
good,Good job for student not much room for growth opportunity promotions only about $0.50 with triple the workload. Would not recommend for somebody trying to advance in the work field.
good,my review is always being open about different ideas and promotions. making everything easy and simple for customers. maintaining a good and clean work place. Also making the best at what ever it is I am doing.
good,Typical work day would be very busy with a lot of interactions and constant movement. you will learn to communicate efficiently with many people while constantly seeing new faces.
good,Dollar General can be a cool and relaxed place to work if the work environment is friendly. The customers can be a lot sometimes but majority of them are friendly and come in quite often.
good,I've worked at dollar general for 2 years and 4 months and the environment is totally changing! The management cuts your hours when they are upset or angry with things going on in your personal life.
good,A typical day is clocking in early and being harassed by customers that demand their five cent discount that only a manager can only authorize so you have to chase down the manger and run back up to the register. I learned that if you are not a manager or at least have a managers key you will be calling out to a manager ever five minutes for authorizing products and voiding items the customer can not afford. The building can be cleaner and organized. Hardest part of the job was to stay calm when a customer does not see eye to eye with you can wants their penny discount.
good,Dollar general is a place that is very family friendly and has lots of people in and out of it.  U have to b a people person and have a great attitude to work with people everyday
good,"A typical work day at Dollar General includes being at the register and ringing up items for customers. When customers are not at the register, items needs to be tidied up and recovered. I learned about handling cash and restocking shelves. The management is decent but mostly depends on who's managing your current store. The hardest part of the job is dealing with getting poor hours. The most enjoyable part is the people who work alongside and can actually talk to."
good,"the corporate office employees all kinds of managers that will not follow the rules and are extremely rude in the entire north Dallas area. They do not have much job security no compensation or benefits, and little chance to move up unless desperate."
good,"Didn't advance workers to higher positions, 2 years without a raise or being considered full time, no vacation days given, and hours changing weekly. Want to work 40 hours a week but only given between 20 and 32."
good,"I cannot speak for all Dollar General stores, but the store I worked at was overall full of good employees but was also quite a bit out of control. Being a discount store, it does get very busy and hectic and on truck day when there's a lot of merch to be stocked, there wasn't always enough people on shift to get the job done while someone took care of the customers. The store manager had a bad habit of only hiring people of his own race and then they would come in and not want to work, treat the customers badly, steal things, etc.. he would not fire them and would keep giving them warnings instead. I don't think DG is a bad place to work it just depends on the store manager."
good,"I enjoy working at Dollar General. Its a good place to work for part-time high school students. The people are friendly , workers too. Its a well team organization."
good,I enjoyed helping customers finding what they needed and making sure that all stock was put away in a timely fashion. We made sure that the store was tidy and clean so that all customers felt comfortable and confident in their shopping experience .
good,"typical day at work was nothing but stocking, cleaning and keeping the store up to customer acceptence. i learned how to do payroll, make schedules, run a store, stock, take in vendors, unload a truck and be a manager. hardest part of the job was keeping my cashiers and other employees together. enjoyable part of the job was working with different people and my customers"
good,"If you are just starting out and want some experience this would do well to reach that goal.  I would not go into management here, even though some people have been successful."
good,"Certain coworkers are like my best friends, I have met some customers who I had a few laughs with that became my friends also. There were a few rude everyday customers that had problems, but what had me concerned was that I was the only African American working there."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General was busy and customer filled."
good,"It was okay the manger was not very understanding, I didnt understand why they pushed us so hard for working so much, I liked the store itself but jst not the people who ran it."
good,Being and orderfiller is not hard. The job is just constant. The pay is very good in this small town. Some weeks are short due to low volume and some weeks are brutal.
good,was no opportunity for advancement was made to work long hors alone doing many jobs. Little pay for hours and job worked. management would change your schedule at last moment without notifying you and punish you for not knowing. several times i had to call hr to report unpaid wages.
good,Working as a manager at DG is stressful and without the right crew you don't get any time off. They only start you out at minimum wage but there is room to advance.
good,"Opening and closing store , putting products up for the holiday seasons as well as giving cashiers there daily tills. Dropping off bank drops and ensuring the best quality customer service"
good,"Very fast paced, expected to multitask and multitask well. Management is extremely stressed, but treat their coworkers and customers like gold. Definitely not the job for anyone who is not willing to really work hard."
good,A typical day with this job was opening and closing the store. I learned to be more self reliant. Management was alright. Workplace culture was okay. The hardest part of this job was trying to plan my day.
good,The shift availability was consistent.  I don't have much to say and am not sure why this is a requirement to review a former employer.  The work relationship has ended.  I don't have anything to add at this time.
good,It was fine at first worked my way to a key holder. My manger was hard to handle never any compliments just what was wrong with the store. I have never worked for a store where people working there did not prove themselves.
good,"I enjoyed the work i did. Opening and closing the store, unloading truck as well as setting up new endcaps with new product or removing older now clearnace items. The Distict Mangement is what i had issues with along with HR. No one helped me with a problem I had which is why I ended my employment there."
good,"I did not like working there. The manager was never available when needed, and the other workers where rude. I did my best every day and loved the people. I ran the register, helped customers, and did cleaning duties. Soemtimes I stocked as well."
good,"This is an alright company to work for depending on the reason to getting the job. There is room for advancement, but its more about who you know instead of what you know. There is not much time for family depending if you work full or part time. They are open a majority of the holidays with unreasonable hours. More focused on money instead of the employees. The managers all vary with work ethics. Good for a college student working while in school.  Loads of manual labor."
good,"The other employees are amazing including GM, however company itself expects way to much out of individual workers & requires each person to do literally the job of three people, at minimum pay wage, not worth the stress"
good,"I became very bored with the job and it was a pain to have to be stocking shelves and going back to the register when I had a customer. There needs to be more people working at one time.Also, the amount I was getting paid was not worth it."
good,"They pay the bare minimum at Dollar General, at least the one I worked for. They want employees to do too much work and the benefits, at least the ones I got, very few to none."
good,go in at 5am prepare store for opening do paper work monitor cameras count tills clean outside store open store at 7am and assist customers and do daily task like put out freight help customers check in vendors the enjoyable part is helping out customers with their needs
good,I liked being there except for the fact that I was constantly having to work the night shift despite my constantly having to ask her to put me on more days.
good,"High stress levels are caused by unruly and rude customers, which can't be controlled, but not much is done on management's behalf to help alleviate the stress. Store manager does their best to make our work place enjoyable, buying lunch once a week and giving days off when requested, but is tasked with too big a job for a store with only 3 shift managers."
good,The pay was kind of low but otherwise its ok. You gain a lot of experience in retail. Due to the size of the store you do a little bit of everything so you learn a lot.
good,I loved working for this company. We had a family atmosphere for 3 of the 5 years i worked there. The new manager didn't represent the company values though.
good,"You are responsible for everything, I have learned to not stress about being over worked and under paid, did not have manger for the first 3.5 months of being open. The environment now is a bit tense. The hardest part is the expectation with the lack of adequate help. Most enjoyable are the coworkers"
good,"Company has a very precise work cycle that is to be followed.  It work so long as there are no bumps in the cycle,(ie late truck, staff call outs, receiving materials for resets late.)"
good,when i first started my job with dollar general i loved my job. As time went on i really started to hate my job. They don't give you enough hours to run your store and they expect a lot out of their store managers. The dm in my district didn't give the support to the store managers that they need. i was put in a broken store that was suppose to be customer ready before i was placed in it which it was not.
good,"My manager was well aware that I was a high school student and was taking concurrent classes at the same time as working. She scheduled me to work 1pm-12:15am most shifts, I wouldn't get home until late, then I would have to wake up and do it all over. I loved cashiering there but I felt like I wasn't treated as an employee."
good,"A good company if you just need a low cost  steady job.  With Dollar General personal now comes and goes , but a good company to work for in long  term"
good,"I hated working there. boss was rude to everyone, didn't care what went on in the store. nothing that anyone done was right, it was miserable! I wouldn't go back to work at that particular store for anything in this world! Dollar General is a great company, but that store is horrible. I quit because they wouldn't let me transfer, after I told them a month in advance that my family and I were moving back to the Birmingham area. So after we moved they called me anting me to cover a double shift, which any other time I wouldn't have minded, BUT we had already moved.. so she threatened to fire me and I told her she couldn't do that because I was quitting."
good,"I liked working here. I relocated to another part of Virginia. Otherwise I would have stayed. I loved the customers, mu co workers and they day always went by so fast."
good,Company expects way too much for the little amount of hours they allow. The pay is not good for what they expect of their employees. At slow times they cut associates hours down to 10 hrs a week. Nobody can live off that with minimum wage job
good,The company is okay it could be better. I've been there for about a year now striving and doing my best while at work. There are a lot of stores here.
good,does not care for family issues of employees. extended hours on family holidays that should be spent with family.  store management required to work 6 days a week  which is really unfair.
good,"The DC in Scottsville is the 2nd most dangerous DC to work in the U.S"
good,"Needed to be scheduled a max number of hours due to having 2nd job and they continually scheduled me max hours they needed. "
good,"Consistent business flow and  Non Stop customer service. Good company to work with......................"
good,Working at the dollar General kept me motivated and productive. Being employeed at the dollar General help me with improving my social skills and my ability to work alone or with others.
good,"The work load was manageable, and most of my co-workers were easy to get along with. Things got a little crazy when hours were cut, and the pool of employees fluctuated from barely enough people to keep the store open, to more help than corporate could afford."
good,The gm is not a very nice person there was alot of drama in this work place I was promoted to assistant store manager and left to run store my self that same week had no idea what I was doing
good,"A typical day at dollar general is hecked, the hardest part of the job is hiring people at dollar general for a low pay. the most enjoyable part of the job is that i get to meet new people everyday, the workplace culture is great. what i learned was how to manager a team of employees to be successfully."
good,"This is not for the faint of heart. A hard company to work for, as well as follow. High turn over rate with good reason, low pay, not many hours unless you reach upper management, and even then for all that you have to do the pay is still low. There's a reason they can pop up a Dollar General on every corner, they pay bare minimum on labor."
good,"This company tells you perks up front but never follow through with them."
good,"My definition of a Paid Gym Membership...They paid me to show up when they wanted me to, and I got to work out for free! Seriously, I dropped about 30 lbs. over the 3 years I worked here. Inventory was constantly being put out on the sales floor or straightened, so there was never a time when a person could  rest from the constant activity. "
good,"A typical day was working as a cashier, customer service with customers, stocking items on shelves. I learned how to be courteous and helpful to all the customers. I learned how to work with all types of people and how to watch out for eople who took items off the shelves without paying. The management tried to be helpful most of the time. The workplace culture could be better because I feel that a little recognization to the workers would go a long way. The hardest part of the job is having to clean the store up after closing and staying until it is completed usually by one person. Most of the times I did not leave until 12midnight.  I really enjoyed conversing with all the customers who came into the store."
good,"Best part of a workday at dollar general is helping customers with daily shopping and questions, seeing satisfied customers is the best part of my day."
good,I liked working there. It was a great job tell the manager  had to move on and after she left it wasn't the same. I stayed for awhile tell we had a new manager.
good,"I would show up at work, clock in, and count down my drawer. Then I worked as a cashier and cleaned and stocked when we weren't busy. I got a 30 minute break to spend at my leisure. Any items I purchased had to be consumed before I left store premises.At the end of my shift I counted my drawer down and clocked out, The only problem I had was getting on the schedule regularly.I never got an explanation, I was just left off the schedule."
good,"Being a store manager for Dollar General, you learn how to deal with accountability. You have to put your own personal feelings to the side, and sometimes theirs, to be able to get the job done. There are not a lot of hours for payroll, so there is no time for any slacking or playing around. It is very important to stay on your staff and always do hiring."
good,The job can be time consuming and require you to walk back and forth. The customers will usually talk nicely to you. The hardest parts are some heavy totes and maybe working a lot of call-ins. Typically you will stock the shelves and help the customers at the register.
good,It was a decent place to work. Pays minimum wage until a year is hit. No benefits when i worked there. My manager was nice. Store was small and easy to keep clean
good,It was a fun and good place to work. I loved interacting with all the customers and our regulars. Its a small town so most of them are regulars and i always loved putting a smilw on someone elses face.
good,"DG was a great place to gain some work experience and learn how to become a self driven employee. However, DG as a company hardly pays their workers and is very distant to issues in the store. If I had gotten better pay or even a single benefit I may have stayed. It's unfortunate that they don't hire teenagers, because teenagers are about the only people who can justify working for 7 dollars an hour."
good,At Dollar General there is no work life balance and it is very hard for a person to get promoted at Dollar General.  The nice thing is that it is close to home since there are so many stores.
good,"-Management was OKAY"
good,Very hard work. management did not appreciate you this is not a job to stay at for long. The distract manager was not nice at all and did not care about employees.
good,"The truck is unloaded by the drivers, that's the good. "
good,Coworkers were great but not a team working to many hours with to much pressure and manual labor with no pay and no team work
good,Everything at dollar general is pretty repetitive so its fast learning. The most enjoyable is the slow parts of your day and setting out new products. Hardest part is lack of hours
good,Working at Dollar General was decent all things considered. There was definitely room for improvement but it had its good points. Made some friends with my co workers. Pay could have been better for all positions though.
good,"A typical day I would clock in, set up my register, then start stocking or working ""sky shelves"". When the register got too busy, sometimes there would be no one there to help me due to the fact that only 2 people were scheduled for every shift. Sometimes I would spend 1 or 2 hours at a time just working the register. That wan't really a problem unless the machines broke down or we had some sort of malfunction in the system ( which happened a lot)."
good,"terrible place to work I will never go back there "
good,it was very fun working here and also meeting new people made it even better only thing that didn't work would be the pay. my coworkers were like family and always showed respect towards the customers.
good,a tyipical day at work was routine of making sure the tills and changed fund was counted correctly from the night before then gave costomer service to everyone who walked in. what i learned was time management goes a long way. the management and coworkers need to work together as a team in order for things to work out smoothly. the hardest part of the job would be controlling the high shrink and the most enjoyable part of the job would be enteracting with costomers
good,"When I first started DG, it was great! My hours were great for what I needed and my co-workers were awesome. After I moved up to being a lead and then assistant manager, the situation became more stressful than any job I'd ever worked. Even more than McDonald's. The district manager needs to be fired for complete lack of caring about anything."
good,Dollar general was not a very pleasant place to work at all. They had no management at all and all my hours were cut to 1 day a week.
good,"The Dollar General I worked at was the staple for the small area it was in. It was literally the one-stop-shop for everyone there unless they wanted to drive to Walmart in the next city over. It was obvious that no one wanted to be there which actually made it really easy for me to quickly become the favorite among customers because I would always smile and I was a little odd because I wasn't afraid to express my style through my makeup. I always offered to take double or split shifts when others would call out. Honestly, if it hadn't been for me relocating I probably would have stayed there."
good,"This company can care"
good,"When I first started working here, I actually liked it. After some time being there, I felt displaced. Not because of the team, but because I felt that there was more out there for me."
good,If you've never had a job this is a good job to start with or if you like working at a store and stocking shifts this is a perfect job for you.
good,"They are not a bad company to work for but they are focused on making money for the company,where they should focus a little more one the good employees that are helping to make that money. There are no employee discounts given and the pay rate is not real good either for what is expected from the employees. There is room for improvement."
good,I am glad to have had that experience. I left because I know I could have career. Working here was rather stressful at times. I enjoyed the staff and customers. I did not like only working part time for minimum wage.
good,They tend to overwork you for little to nothing pay and expect you to be enthusiastic to work here for them.
good,It wasnt a good expierence and the pay at that time was only $4.50 an hour. The Manager would call me in at all hours and had me working all her hours so she could just hang out and do nothing. The DM we had gave you impossible tasks and was more like a drill sargent on booze.
good,"Basically you would count tills, take deposit, open store and immediately start on truck. All I ever done was truck, or back stock. I went through several managers and about 40% of them were decent. My co-workers weren't bad. They hardest part about working at Dollar General was you never felt like what you accomplished that day was enough. They over stocked the stores to where you couldn't barely move in the back rooms. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job was that I lived right down the street and walked to work."
good,The Dollar General I work for was a great store. we recently went under new management and that is when things started to go downhill. mostly the management its just unorganized.
good,Dollar General is an excellent company once you are hired and learn the ins and outs of your job. Their is room for advancement but DG is known for giving out responsibility without proper training and are stingy when it comes to giving a raise. Most all stores are short handed so hours come easily but most of the time you will get burned out from excessive hours.
good,"work days were typically ok, stocking shelves, cashier work, cleaning and straightening shelves when needed, learned people skills there, my mananger was awesome and fair, co-workers were fun to be around for the most part, hardest part of the job was truck day when you have to unload all the merchandise that was ordered. meeting people and seeing people you know on a daily basis was a enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I learned to be a manage projects and employees, to take care of customers when there is a problem.I learned how to count and manage large amounts of money.I learned how to stock and receive trucks."
good,There were always things to do such as stocking and it was always busy with customers. Store was very messy though. Hard to work.
good,"Several employees were able to do things others were not. One employee was supposed to open in the store, was an hour and a half late;had no reprimand"
good,Working as a cashier and having to stock shelves is very difficult. You don't really have enough time to do everything that management wants you to accomplish. They expect a lot from you in a short period of time. Especially working as the only cashier with no help can be frustrating. But with dedication you can get the job done.
good,A typical day at work was going in working your tale off with a bunch of rude and disrespectfull people. Didn't really learn much basically how to run all over a ware house and grab things off of pallets. The management wasn't bad they were not willing to help you in the sense of how to do your job better and in a more time eficiant manner. most of my co-workers were not bad most of them were nice and willing to help you better understand what you needed to do and a better way to do it. The hardest part of the job was having to basically run through a wearhouse and throw things on top of this 6 foot tall roll tainer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks.
good,"I had cashier and customer service experience prior to Dollar General so I pretty much knew what to expect."
good,"My coworkers were awesome. When I started, the store had no store manager. The assistant manager was pregnant. She was awesome. She just couldn't handle the stress of the job. I tried to communicate with my district manager. It didn't help. I loved helping customers. I loved my job, everything about it but the lack of management."
good,Was always on the move doing work but poor management and poor pay.  Loved working with at a job that i was always on my feet.
good,Loved working there but needed better opportunities. Not so sure about the benefits because I was part time. Love the people and it was fun to be there.
good,"At Dollar General you're expected to finish a hefty workload for minimum wage. Depending on the size of the store, this can be reasonable or very unreasonable."
good,I loved working with and around the customers that came in to the store. The vendors that we had to deal with on a daily basis were also great. The work is very physically labor intensive. The specific store that I worked at was not managed well.
good,Everyday was an interesting experience. You never knew hour many hours you were working or how much the volume was. I learned how to place labels on boxes and send them down a conveyor belt.
good,"A typical day at dollar general for me was coming in checking the money and sales of the store, reviewing the cameras, working stock, making sure the employees were doing their tasks, and helping customers."
good,The environment in which ones creates is the same environment one must inhabit; leadership comes from above and respected by all.
good,"Can be an easier place to work for, will have hard days. Very flexible with schedules and days off. Management really cares about employees and you form a working professional bond."
good,"Yes it pays well, but that is because the work is heavy, hard work. In the summer if is extremely hot in the warehouse and it is war with some people who didn't want fans on messing up their hair. "
good,I think the store could have been a little better taken care of. My manager was very understanding sometimes to much. The pay was not great but it was a second job for me.
good,A typical da at work was busy and kind of fast past. would have a lot of rushes. The hardest part of my job was dealing with un happy and impatient customers.
good,"Basically had to figure out how to do everything myself. Very fast paced and busy place, wouldn't be so bad if I received more training,"
good,"We have a good crew in Lacey Springs, AL. We all get a long along pretty well and can trust each to hold to an honor code regarding personal possessions and cash management. Scheduling is fair according to the classification of the job."
good,"Managed District Leaders and store team members,  Division managers used high pressure tactics and negative feedback to control the team members"
good,Nice place to work for and weekly paychecks. My co-workers were great and would help me with anything that I needed to get the job done.
good,A typical day at work was to run the cash register and recover the shelves on the front half of the store.  Sometimes it involved stocking freight.  Most of the time I was only working with one manager so there was not much of a co-worker environment.  The hardest part of the job was being the only cashier and being told I had to have the entire front half of the store recovered before the end of my shift.
good,Good not great. learned how to get along with different personalities and more patients. managements was pretty good. co-workers got along and had fun.
good,"Worked at a fast pace with customers and employees"
good,"Kermit is a small town in the Permian Basin and most companies are short on employees. During a typical work day, there was only one cashier and one manager present which would require the cashier to stock the shelves when not serving a customer. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday. The hardest part of the job is stocking heavy products."
good,"Dollar General gives you good hours, but they are really not considerate of your personal life. They are really about themselves more than their workers. The workplace is full of drama and mess."
good,Dollar General can be a great place to shop and work if they would only listen to the customer and the employees times have change.
good,"I didn't work there long but as a cashier you get as few hours as possible, the most being 23 a week. more of a job for a high school student as no one can live off of the wage they gave. no benefits to speak of and the manager was lacking experience and social skills but the assistant manager and the key holder were good coworkers."
good,"good work place. co-workers were very nice and helpful. but the manager was very rude to people. if you didnt stock the shelves right the manager would knock it into the floor and tell you to do it again."
good,I would restock the store when the trucks came in every week. Great work crew who always worked well with others and would help anyone who might need it. The specialist team was the fun part to me. I liked coming in and working all night while stores were closed to make them look better and work economically better for sales.
good,"This job just wasn't for me. While I loved the staff and team I worked with; advancement was easily obtained, but lacked in benefits. I need a job that I am able to support myself. With my 20 hours a week, that's hard to do at 7.25! "
good,While working at this place they were willing to work around me schedule with my home life.  My co workers were friendly and willing to help.  The hardest part about my job was wanting to have more hours to work.
good,poorly acting mangers childish harassment textng down talking the employeesnfun co workers just some wilding managers mine told me to work off the clock and everything
good,a typical day at work was basic what i learned was how to stock management was ok co workers were ok no hard stuff about this job the most enjoyable part of this job was going home cause i had school the next day
good,"the company would always have little employees, so the work load was always full a day at work at dollar general includes a very productive busy neat and clean day. You should always have somethings to d bank drops,keeping the store tidy inside and outside restrooms must be and stay cleaned and most importantly to have a friendly and smooth customer service flow."
good,"it only pays minimum wage, and is too short handed. You don't have enough people to stock the shelves, and wait on customers. There was alot of complaints on how messy the store was at all times, and that there wasn't enough workers to help."
good,I don't like giving bad reviews but in my honest view I just can't recommend going with the company. I wish the people that work there the best of luck but it did'nt give me the impression of a good company.
good,"It was the store manager that made it a bad place to work, others may have a different experience. The hours were great; it was easy to go to college and have a family. However the manager made the job very stressful, nothing you do was good enough for her. For example, most customers agreed I was the fastest cashier, but for her it still was not good enough."
good,Coworkers were rude and I felt they didn't care about their jobs and only about the pay check. Work environment was not clean and sanitary. Needs improving.
good,"After spending two years with the company, I would say as a company it is a decent company.Working in the retail side of the company the experience varies from store to store."
good,"DG has a routine which is easy to fall into once you have learned the ropes, and customers are usually quite amiable.  I value the fluency I gained in customer interaction and working a cash register. The manager expected inhuman amounts of output from the cashiers, especially considering that we had to work the cash register while stocking. A lot of the logistics could have been improved upon, but I feel like that was isolated to the store in which I worked and not reflective of DG as a whole."
good,I took the Management job to help my managers. At one point the assistant manager worked two weeks from open to close. She also didn't get a day off for two months. I work well with my co-workers. They perform their duties as they told. The hardest part of the job is keeping workers in the store or getting workers to come to work. A lot of people don't take the job serious. I currently have two assistant managers now that don't see eye to eye. Which makes things worse when it comes to the store being kept up with and things being done right. I often have to cover someone's shift because they have called in.
good,"I no longer work for this company but a typical work day would usually involve complaining customers and unprofessional management. What I've learned is to work hard for what you want in life and never settle for less. The most enjoyable moments were gained throughout meeting new employees, which is always exciting to see a new face in the store."
good,"This can be a great job, minus the low pay and meager benefits. Just hope and pray that you get a cool manager that doesn't want to tyrannically control everything and everyone. Hours can be long, but if you like people and the town that you work at you can make several friends that will love to see your smiling face and you make their day. It's a great social interaction."
good,"Co workers were fun to work with. Come to work. Count the till. Check people out. Make sure work area was clean. Greet people entering the store. When shift ended, count the till."
good,"I had good and bad experiences with this company, I think management needs to focus on who they let run their stores and they need to appreciate all their employees. Dont expect great hours, pay or benefits. "
good,"The pay is great, but not for the amount of work and stress that comes along with it. It's just poor management. On a typical day you never know when you will be home. Your co-workers only care about themselves. Most enjoyable part of the job is working out for me."
good,It's an alright job if don't plan on making a career out of it. They don't pay enough for the work they want you to do. But to each is on.
good,"A typical day at worked dealt with any kind of customer, they were either nice and respectable or straight rude and snobs. I learned that dealing withe general public on a daily basis is hard and you really have to have the patience and temper control to be able to do so. Management they were cool people established friendships with all of their workers. Their work ethics were horrible all they did was basically smoke the whole shift. Some co-workers were enjoyable. The best part of this job to me was pay day."
good,would not recommend working for this company this would have to be the last place I would turn to for a job. Treat you like slaves and do not even pay you to put up with it.
good,"I clock in up to 5 minutes before my shift starts."
good,Great work environment and great staff of employees who are always kind and eager to help also a great way to meet new friends.
good,"Fun place to work, I worked on the floor and cashiering.  I learned how to interact with people. The management is very young some times. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.  The most enjoyable was the friendly co workers."
good,"loved this job, but the management was poor, i was released from my job due to the manager not properly training me on certain things, i was let go from my position for my cash drawer being OVER too many times. i think it should be policy to not only have the cashier count their drawer out at the begining of the shift, but also to be allowed to count their drawer out at the end of the shift. at any rate, i was told that i am REHIREABLE within a year of the date i was let go. other than that, i loved working for the company, there was room for advancement and loved the comradery of the co workers"
good,"the hardest part is you get a store that is in bad shape and they expect you to fix it, they call it impacted, and I worked in at least four impacted stores when I first began working for them."
good,"I was the Manager at the store. However, I had to deal with a lot of problems from the main office that made my job a lot harder. When I was got promoted I was getting the right pay. However once I got promoted again to Manager they did not want to give me my pay."
good,Definitely a great experience if you are looking for your first job. Dollar General helped me create my retail foundation.
good,Employee's were quite hostel towards each other and very anti-corporate management .High School like atmosphere. Inadequate shrink prevention practices.
good,The company had little to no growth within itself. The benefits and financial stability was rallentando. What I have learned that it takes a whole team to have and keep the store up to corporate standards. The average work day would consist of following the pods and planners of the month and maintain stock and inventory. The hardest part would not have a full staff to complete important task and assignments. The most enjoyable part about this position was helping the customers and making a impact on sales increase with promotions.
good,"Arrive early morning hours (6:00-8:00) and put out stock for the day. Continue to do stock until opening. Upon opening, juggle running the register and stock until noon. Leave between noon and 2:00. Do mandatory fridge checks every two hours."
good,Not much different from Family Dollar with the exception at giving the store managers the tools to help control shrink
good,"hard job but needs to be more better, was short handed all the time and management really never listened much"
good,"The job is sometimes easy and helps you develop great people skills but being a sales associated its terrible. I cover all jobs from being a stocker, cashier, and janitor but only make minimum wage."
good,"They expect you to work your butt off for 7.50. They want any and every piece of your energy. Granted I was a lead and basically signed up for all of it. Overall easy systems to learn. I loved my employees and my vendors. I loved the job but when broken down from work/life balance, compensation, job security, management and job culture it really wasn't the best place. The only thing I could really complain about is the management was crooked. They were always trying to treat someone bad they didn't like to make them quit or dig up enough dirt to get them fired."
good,A typical day involves interacting with the customers. I learned what is involved with working in retail. Management is helpful to a certain degree. Co-workers are helpful with other aspects of the store. The hardest part of the job is trying to complete other tasks in the store. the most enjoyable part of the job was working on planograms.
good,"A typical day would start around 5:30 am it would consist of stocking merchandise, daily paper work, helping customers, and cashiering. The hardest part of the job was long hours sometimes with no break, working 10-12 days without an off day, unorganized management mainly from corporate, and there was little or no concern for employees rights or cares. The enjoyable part of the job was my fellow co-workers which I have made lasting friendships with and all the wonderful customers I encountered."
good,"Worked 8-3:30 p.m."
good,I learned a lot about patience and taking my time in this job. Getting to know the regular customers is fun since you already. Management changes from time to time just adjust to the changes and you'll be fine. There is high turn over on the job so new people come in almost all the time but usually everyone is cordial to work with. Knowing what is on sale from week to week and satisfying coupon policy and  is the hardest part of the job.
good,"I was a hard worker and worked hard if not harder than the rest of the stockers, because they slacked. The manager was a slacker. I stocked sometimes by myself because they would not work hard, mainly because I was new. My coworkers were good people. Hardest part was dealing with the lack of hours I received. I received maybe 15 hours a week and driving 30 miles to work was not enough money. Enjoyable part was lifting heavy items, because I loved ""working out""."
good,"I like working here, it's better than McDonald's but it's just hard getting hours."
good,Overall it vaires...I enjoyed SOME of the people there...the upper management on the other hand only cared about their employees...they tended to blame any incident on them no matter what it was.....even if it was a mechanical issue! Their main focus was their bonuses..Plus is was super hot inside the warehouse at all times
good,"Typical day was traveling state to state, setting up and taking glamor shots or doing sales. The hardest part was being away all the time from my kids. I loved doing it and the travel but had a love/ hate relationship with being gone all the time."
good,The prior store manager was not understanding of me needing one day off for my husband to have surgery. He also showed lots of favoritism.
good,"open store and registers,start stocking shelves, keep cashiers relieved for brakes and directions on work plan for the day. accommidate venders customers, filing paper work cloing out and making bank deposits."
good,Management was uncommunicative to their employees. Forced employees to work on their days of and interfered with personal life. Co-workers were not motivated. Was promoted but did not receive a raise.
good,"opening and closing the store was awesome"
good,Numerous assignments within a days time but not enough time.
good,The worst part of the job was having to work lots of hours to get the merchandise stocked to the shelves.  The best part of the job was the staff that I had to run the store.
good,Their word was not 100% to me about moving up in fact they cut my hours
good,i left dollar general to work for united supermarkets-my career was always a office job like accounting-so when united supermarket offered me a job as a bookkeeper-i left dollar general
good,"I love the type of work I do, I also love the customer`s I help, but there is no benefits for part time, no hours available, and I do not like the different shifts."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working with Dollar general is working with my co-workers. On a typical day at work i would run the cash register, work backstock, file invoices, close the store down at night, and do work on the computer. As soon as i was hired the manager left the store, we are currently without a manager but are in the process of hiring one. The hardest part of my job would be not having a set schedule. It is very difficult to make appointments such as doctor visits, attending family gatherings, and other schedule based commitments. I learned many things while working at Dollar General. I increased my people skills, learned how to manage money, to be organized,learned how to filing paperwork, and i heightened my computer skills. All of my co-workers are very friendly and focus on their jobs."
good,"My typical day at work consisted in putting up stock either from the truck or from the back room. Also consisted in doing resets for the merchandise that was either received or that was being sent to the store in the following weeks, Being nice to each and every customer that came into the store and always having a smile on your face in very important in working retail. Customers like to feel like they are appreciated for coming into the store and a simple smile may be the one thing that keeps them coming back many times in the future. I enjoyed working at Dollar General and also my coworkers that i had."
good,I like working at dallor general but have to look for better oppertunitys.
good,"ring customers up, help customers find what there looking for, stock, in between customers. Daily paperwork, banking, ect. I learned how to make my job easier with proper training. Hardest part was trying to do my job plus left over from what the manger wasn't doing."
good,The work was nothing. I like labor work. I like unloading the truck and stocking the shelves. The only thing I didn't like is that some of the customers were a piece of work but I don't let that get to me. Because wasn't nobody stopping me from getting money.
good,"open store. waited on customers, unload trucks, stocked shelves. did paper work, ran cash register, The most enjoyable thing was I enjoyed the older customers and there stories."
good,"I have been honored to work for Dollar General over the past month, but the promotion ratio is small and limited to due the amount of stores in the area. It is a good place to come and work for a couple of months, but for someone with high goals it isn't an ideal career."
good,"Friendly work place, great people to work with.  Management is great to work for and train with"
good,"The best part about being employed at Dollar General is meeting new people. During the time I was employed there, I met people of all races and backgrounds, making some memorable experiences and even friends along the way. Everyday the customers gave me something different to look forward to. At Dollar General, you have to be fully dedicated and committed to your responsibilities or you will fall behind. No, everyday was not pleasurable, but you have to learn to make the best out of the situation."
good,"long shifts , company wont let you move up, management is par"
good,"Customer service was first and foremost,  We can't sell it if it is in the stockroom.  Truck days were very challenging."
good,if you have nothing else to do and no life then this is the job for you but you wont get any home time if make it to management
good,I left as Assistant Manager. It was a very fast pace job that always kept me on my feet.
good,The store I work is very clean and neat but the hours are something to be desired.  This job is perfect for a young person without a family.
good,"Just a week after I was there the manager got fired, and scheduling was a hassle, store was in a mess."
good,"This was a difficult place to work due to bad attitudes within the company. I learned a lot from this company such as patience and tolerance. Most of my co-workers are amazing, but none of them would stick around for too long. The hardest part of the job was having too much to do with not enough time. The most enjoyable part was getting to interact with customers, regular or new."
good,"I was a cashier. I told the then manager I just needed a job. She hired me because I was frank about it. "
good,I put up stock the days i am there once in a while I get to do Plan o grams or other stuff around the store
good,Since its still a new building there are some struggles. Management is fair but the hardest part of it all is the long hours but we get a lot of work done within those hours
good,"this company starts off at minimum wage and part time, shoulf only be considered a in between gig until a real job comes"
good,"Not the best store to work for, I wasnt really happy with the management."
good,My overall experience with this company was okay. The annoying part was that I could not fix my mistakes at the register. Their register system requires a person to unlock the register which is time consuming as well as annoying to the cashier and the customer.
good,worked the cash register and stocked the shelves in between customers. Was a nice job.
good,"This job's pretty much just a regular, minimum-wage, part-time job that a lot of people start out with. Nothing too fancy; just the average cashier duties mixed with cleaning, stocking, and customer assistance. I personally think it's a bit of a ""robot"" job, since you do just about the same thing all the time and there's not much new going on, save for when holidays come and the store gets a bit busier than usual.  Definitely not as bad as a place like Walmart, but it's not the kind of job I'd work at for longer than necessary, since it's a bit boring."
good,"The store was very childish, manager not very childish. Manager had favorite employees if you was not a favorite she made it very hard on you no matter how well you did your job."
good,"- Everyday i worked hard recovering product on the shelves while ringing customers out on the cashier."
good,I enjoyed my time working with my co-workers and getting to know more of the vendors in the area.  I have learned in deep detail on how Dollar General functions.  My co-workers made my day worth while a lot of days.  It means a lot when you have good people to work with day in and day out.
good,"working in retail you are being productive in all areas of the store .i perform the best job i can every day. For two days out of the week i stock the sheves with product.the rest of the the duties of cleaning,daily task as in setting price changes and setting new ads.As an assistant manager i want to teach the associates to be the best they can for the company.I will listen at there ideas or needs to be productive and make the store a better place each day to shop."
good,"My typical day generally began w/ opening the store or closing the store.  I supervised, did inventory, did sales reports, banking, stocking and cleaning.  "
good,"The job was easy and working with customers were a pleasure but the managers were rude and unprofessional many times, not just the associates but occasionally to the customers. I liked the job that I did and I exceed.  I understand everybody has a hard time every now and then. That is not the reason we should take our frustrations out on others.  The strongest link in a company is it's weakest link."
good,I started out as cashier and went to  Asst. Manager and then Manager. I worked in the Union City store as Asst. Manger and then  transferred to Martin Tn as Store Manager. This company really expects a lot out its employers and management team. Im a hard worker and go out of my way to do 100% plus for my employer..
good,the company doesn't treat its employees well. There is way too much loss and the company states that any loss is because of the employees. Company has many thefts and needs to up its loss prevention. Many of the stores need updated and management is incompetent. The best part of the job was helping customers and meeting new people.
good,"all in all not the worst place I have worked for but by far not the best. I took this job because it was close to home in a very small town. I though it would be fun and a good way to meet some neighbors. The pay is minimum wage and if you step up to a management position under the store manager it is a whopping .25 raise. you get another .25 every year you're there. I have never seen a company that demands so much of it's key holders and offers so little. Unfortunately it also seems that only the worst people make it to store manager so if you are under them prepare to work night shifts every week and be blamed and responsible for your manager's short comings. They also give very few hours to the store for employees so you may start out working 25 hours a week and then down to 5 or 10 hours the next week because payroll was cut. They do offer health insurance, 401k, and tuition assistance if you can afford it on 5 hours a week at 7.25 an hour."
good,"I would come in clock in and count my drawer sometimes, then if vendors or someone came in I would have to have a key holder or manager check the vendor in. The hardest part of the job was when management would get into it with every vendor or delivery driver. He would do this in front of customers, not professional at all."
good,I am learning a lot about customers and people. I enjoy being friendly and talking to customers. I also enjoy the people I work with. I am not saying working at Dollar General is absolutely terrible. I am just saying I don't like that I am only getting 2 days a week. I just need something more stable as well as more hours to support my two little boys. This would probably be a good job for anyone who doesn't mind less hours.
good,"i learned the importance of costumer service, learned how deal with cash, the hardest part of the job is being able to balance work and family life.. ive also learned this job isnt for everyone"
good,"It's a pretty easy job with not a lot of responsibility. If you can count money, you can do the job. The best part about the job is the customer interaction, otherwise it is a pretty boring job. The thing I hate the most about the job is that there is no notification whatsoever of your work days or hours. The weeks go from Saturday to Friday and the schedule doesn't come out until Friday."
good,loved to interact with people in the workplace. good communication skills.
good,"I only worked here part-time and I liked stocking, the management was good, I got along with my co-workers but there is a bad turnover rate."
good,"many customers and opportunity to build relations with customers. I learned cashier skills and handling money, most enjoyable part of the job is providing great customer service and making people happy with their service."
good,"Was a cashier.  I also put freight on the shelves."
good,"Not the best place to work but if you need a job to start with or just in need of money, its an okay place to work."
good,"My typical day at work was cleaning, customer service, cash register, deposits, running for change at the bank, opening procedures, ordering trucks when needed, stocking, setting plan-o-grams for new merchandise or remodeling in the stores."
good,Loved the customers I had they were the best people ever! How ever the upper management was not very great or helpful.
good,"pretty easy to work there."
good,"Great inventory staff, learned a lot about data entry and inventory management."
good,"-Opening or closing the store, such as dusting, moping, sweeping. Price checks and changes, date-checks on expiration items. Donation fund asking, and reminders for surveys on tickets. "
good,I liked having a stable job but I did not like the fact that you could only get part time hours even though I was hired as full time. This job was not a hard job but it required a lot of hard work and dedication to a team that was not very dedicated to this company.  I really enjoyed getting to know my customer and being able to help them every day in any way that I could.
good,I am looking for an opportunity that I can grow with and make the money that I am use to making.
good,I considered myself a very hardworker for Dollar General. I love working with the public and interacting with my coworkers. I learned that you can make your job as fun and as easy as you would like it to be.  My coworkers loved me and we got along very well. There was not anything hard about the job because the customers made it easy to want to be there and I just loved being there everyday.
good,Shopping is convent when I worked there. The shelves were never stock.
good,"The job working totes, customers, putting up freight and co-workers are great.  As a manager the job is demanding.  When you make salary the demands are higher."
good,"A typical day at work depends on who I am closing or opening with.  My manager now, I am comfortable with except for minor details.  Her assistant manager seems to choose her days when to treat me well.  Now the others, I get along with just fine and can get through a work day or night just fine.  I have increased my speed at this job and knowledge to an extent.  I have learned a lot more about sales than what I ever knew.  I have also learned that Dollar General is not like all the other stores.  There are some things that I don't believe are necessary.  The busy times that we have is as hard as I can think.  I have a very good friendship with a particular co-worker/manager on duty that I just love to work with and, the relationships and friendships I build with my customers give me great joy."
good,"Good place to get a minimum level of experience, day usually consists of standing & waiting for customers to select items, helping customers select items, & stocking shelves. I have learned how to read a planogram. Management is not the best but also not the worst. I enjoy my managers, & I learn things sometimes. Co-workers are competent. We all know know why we are there & what we have to do while we are there so we all get along & get the job done. Hardest part of the job is getting more hours for the week. Enjoyable part is when I complete a task & can move on to the next."
good,Many times during the week you are working alone and never have enough payroll to function.  Definitely a challenge.
good,"open the store greet customers,help them find things in the store ,stock shelves,organize stock room"
good,"In reorder, I ordered HBA items for 10,000+ stores"
good,"I would clock in, get myself a drawer and count it. Log into the computer under my numbers and let the other cashier go home for the day. I would greet the customers as they walked in the door with a smile on my face. Checkout customers and bag their items. when I did not have any customers I would sweep the floor, mats and wipe everything down. Aways keeping my work area clean. At the end of the day I would have to mop, take out the trash from my registar and the bathroom, count my litaracy that I have collected from the day, then recover the store. I enjoyed working with many different kind of people and learning about them."
good,"A typical work day includes being the face of the company. When working at the cash register I am the first face people see as they enter the store. Asside from being a cashier, I also stock product and check in weekly shipments. However, the main job of any associate with this company is to provide top of the market customer service. We strive that every person, who walks out of the store, has a smile on their face."
good,"A typical work day is fairly simple, I just have to make sure the store is in presentable order. I have to check customers out in a timely manner and handle customer comments, complaints, and concerns. The management for this company could be better. It seems the most they care about is the money coming into the company and not much about their employees. The hardest part of this job is trying to get through to the management in any way. You make suggestions and they blow you off, you have complaints and they push them aside saying they will take care of the problem and nothing gets done. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the customers and fellow employees."
good,"Low work ethic of both management and coworkers. Out of 7 others, myself and another were the only ones to do any work while the others took 45 minute smoke breaks"
good,the new management that dollar general has. is very rude i have had runins with her and i have been told from other customers how rude she is
good,The customers are wonderful and the environment is very friendly. Dollar General has great managers but overall this was a great work experience
good,"assisting customers find what they are shopping for, up-selling when possible"
good,"Typically worked 10-12 hours daily. I much improved my ability to manage without essential tools to get the job done. Working with minimal rate of pay the employee base was limited and training, coaching and mentoring was ongoing, often dealing with basic life issues. I really enjoyed helping the associates view life from a different prospective.Mandatory 50 hour work week, which is not unusual. Scheduling program will schedule you for 6 days. There are multiple must be present days. Scheduling is based  on dollars not hours needed to operate a specific sales volume or square footage. As an example, about 80% of the schedule has 2 people on staff, the manager and the cashier."
good,"I liked the job because you get to know the customers , the employees where really cool , I loved getting paid every Friday the hours where good until they got cut ."
good,I come in for work and it is set what I'm suppose to be doing during the day. I either stock one day or Im a cashier handling the stocking medicine or stocking things around the register.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Dollar General. I'd probably still be there had it not been for personal issues.
good,Kind of a boring job at times. Just ringing up peoples items. Stocking some and putting items back in correct place.
good,"Easy job, laid back work. Good math skills required. Nice people to work with."
good,Low chance of raise and getting full time. Hours were flexible and management was helpful.
good,"A normal day at Dollar General would include restocking the shelves or depending on the day, i would unload the shipment."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of standing at the register and waiting on customers. I could also be responsible for stocking and recovering the store as well as unloading trucks. You learned how to take credit cards & checks, also money handling. This job involved working with the public and alot of customer service. You had to be friendly, outgoing,& patient. My management there was good. I got along with them. As for my co workers they were the best group of people I have ever worked with. I gained alot of wonderful friends that are apart of my daily life. I loved working with them. The hardest part of my job was the schedule, it was unpredictable, one week you could work 5 to 6 days a week and the next week you could work 2 to 3 days a week. The most enjoyable part of working there was the experiance I gained & the friends that I made."
good,"a regular day at the dollar store consists of: working register, helping customers, find products that need, answering phone and greeting people. Sometimes even changing planograms, stocking shelves, and working with the hand held terminal scanner. i have learned alot working with dollar general. Ive learned all there is working as a sale assoicate and even some of the lead sales associates duties. The thing i like most about my job is changing planograms for new merchandise."
good,"Every day there was a new challenge, always a busy environment with plenty to do."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers and helping the customers.
good,"Learned a lot about office work, and also plenty about runing a retail store. I opened and closed the store daily, did change orders, made deposits, supervised employees, ran cash register, stocked shelves, checked in vendors, and recieved shipments. I also preformed the assistant managers duities while she was on extended leave. "
good,Very fast pace worked days with great co workers and store manager.
good,depends if its not a truck day then its doing task around the store like recovering placing things back and making sure the customers questions are answered.
good,Hardest part of job was finding right employees to staff the store. Handled all day to day operations of store.
good,Undercover slave factory!!!!!
good,"Working at Dollar General is an easy job. Having regular customers that know your name and enjoy talking to you is always a plus. Management is a little iffy because not one person in management does their job like they are supposed to. I learned that every job is different and with Dollar General, as long as you come in and do what you are told, your day will go by just fine."
good,"Come to work, Stock shelves, handle safe deposits and cashier and customer issues. Love working with the crew we had and neeting new people and the regular customers that we have, Hardest part is the non-dedication from others that others have to pick up and can cause people to be away from their families and it dont feel like a team environment at times."
good,my experience at dollar general was not a pleasant one. i was thrown into a position without training and promised better pay for my position witch i never received.
good,"Easy job and people are great to work with, It is well organized. It can be extremely busy or nothing at all."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of Myself and one or two more people working while everyone else including management sat around and laughed and conversed among eachother. Throughout my time at Dollar General I learned unless you have a STRONG team, productivity will be minimal. Management could have been better, im not going to go any further into that. The hardest part of this job was doing everything on your own, trying to run the register, run the sales floor (recovering, stock, helping customers ect...), and help other cashiers who could not work the register as well as they should, became very frustrating at times especially since they refused to make me a manager. Alot of my co-workers were ""cool with' and/or ""related to"" the managers so they did nothing and all the slack fell on myself and two other co workers, which was frustrating but we pushed through it and made it work with what we had. the most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my customers. They were all so funny and to be honest I miss them. They taught me alot."
good,"Assist with managing all operations and store functions including hiring, scheduling, payroll and nightly deposits. Supervise employees’ day-to-day functions including stockers and cashier. Ensure that store is secure, clean and properly stocked at all times Back-up employees in their functions to ensure that our customers receive excellent service"
good,"Smiling and providing the best customer service you can. Maintaing overall operations from open to close, stocking shelves,registers and balancing at the end of the night."
good,"I would stock shelves and do refunds ,exchanges and resets and checking in vendors such as coke ,pepsi, etc. then general night duities sweep mop and count down all money and do deposit."
good,A typically day is good and easy. We are opened late and I have to small children that have to stay with someone till I get off.
good,"job duties essential to the shift, i learned to stock items by code numbers. co workers adn management works together as a team. the hardest part of the job is to control an angry customer and help best way we can. the most enjoyable part of the job is regular customers comming back."
good,"Leared management skills. Co- workers were fun to teach and work with. The hardest part of this job was major resposibilty, Alot of deadlines that have to be met. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and seeing there happy faces walk through the door."
good,I loved this job and the co workers. I learn to better my customer service and interact more on this job. Before i moved forward on. The hardest part was the truck we had every monday. I had to unload it myself. But i enjoyed it hours got cut from time to time. But it was a fun job and the managers were fair.
good,This was my first job. So it was hard for me at first but eventually got better. Work was hard and stressful.
good,"most weekends were busy, with lots of people coming in and going out. the location of this store in particular made it prone to shoplifting so as a head cahier i had to keep a keen eyes on suspecious customers. some customers were hard to deal with so one needs lots of patience to have a good day. my manager was one of the best bosses one could ask for, he was very kind but firm when needed, he took time to explain things to his employees and was great with customers as well. i have learnt a lot from this job and hope to incorperate this in my future jobs."
good,"spent the day ringing up and helping customers. Stocking shelves, and redoing shelves. We had some great customers and some very mean customers, i alwaysed tried to make those mean customers alittle nicer, that was a hard part of my job, i loved all my staff and what i did."
good,"Always something to do, get to meet new people,learned how to run a check and credit cards hardest part of the job working a 14hr shift when someone called out"
good,"internal theft , high consumer theft. Professionalism from regional and local management teams were poor. ."
good,Clerk checked out merchandise and pizza sales. Cash register. Co-workers were nice. Enjoyed the public.
good,You were scheduled 6 hours and you would not be able to have a break.
good,I feel like this company needed improvement. There were often times that the management did not give me the respect that I gave them for no reason. They did not compensate the employees as they should have. There was not a lot of appreciation shown to the employees.
good,Not enough hours at this place but all in all a wonderful job It took a while before my information was process and they make you go way across town for a drug and alcohol test but the good thing is they pay for it and if your a stocker you can forget about getting more then 2 days of work because they rush you to clear your rotainers and when you do they say they dont have any work for you so you have to be trained as a cashier to get those hours but you have to travel to different locations to get hours they only give you so many hours
good,"Of course their is not a perfect job, However I just do what I am suppose to do recover, Greet the customers, clean, same as any retail store, I have learned to manage my time better, the mamagement could be better with how the place is run my co-workers are easy to work with the hardest is the negative energy in the work place, the most enjoyable are the customers."
good,Took orders cleaned my area cooked on occasion .Served customers there food . ran cash register .
good,"Ok enviroment, no surprises, every day same routine, not a long term career"
good,Dollar General hleps the community. They donate to school and church in the neighborhood. they have reading programs for adults ands and kid who cant read.
good,I loved helping customers find something or take care of a problem they had. I always had something to do so time just flew.
good,The people that I met there are really good people. Dollar General as a employer needs work. The employees are underpaid for the duties they perform and they treat there employees like there replaceable.
good,"Otherwise, working for Dollar General is not sustainable and in no way a means for a living wage. However if you're just getting started in your career it wouldn't hurt to start with a basic retail facility such as Dollar General. Locations vary and are easily accessible via public transit and or usually would be within walking distances within a mile."
good,It was a easy job. I worked the cash register so my job wasn't hard. Most of the time the customers was vary friends and the other employees was vary nice and friendly also. Over all it was a good job to get me throw.
good,working for Dollar General taught me a lot but it also taught me that most thing u learn as u go. its a great company to work for but could use better communication
good,"Did not feel cared for. Only replaceable. So much theft and robberies occurred in my area, yet never could get any security or and other protective measures taken."
good,"I am giving 3 stars just because the manager at my store made working awful for me. She made me do her jobs, over worked me, promised a higher position to me so I worked harder & then gave it to someone else... the company cares more about their money than your personal life.."
good,"If you have a family and are the depending on the income for this job. It is not for a person with responsibilities."
good,It's ok starting off had a good training manager then it went down hill from there my manager I got now just don't care he lets the store go down hill
good,Is okay there could be more improvement..there could also be less favoritism even tho the employee did something bad and shouldnt be rewarded for it..
good,There are ups and downs working in retail. The retail aspect is very high paced and very stressful as you try day to day to keep customers and employees happy in their needs.
good,Should pay much more. Ask you to do way too much for the amount they want to pay you. Keeps stores entirely overstocked a d should donate more of it's pulled merchandise to help those less fortunate instead of discarding it.
good,"I’ve been working for dollar general 2 years. It’s not a bad place to work at all. Plenty of room for advancement, friendly customers, and good employees. It was the perfect for to get me out of being a stay at home mom for 2 years. Now it’s just time for me to move on to other things. It’s a good starter job or for someone who needs something part time"
good,I liked some of the customers who came in. i was the main cashier and i had to restock. i like making small talk while i checked them out. its an okay job
good,They never had set scheduals and the work felt like it was worth a lot more than 8.25 an hour they slacked on training and kept putting it off. They expected to much from certian employees and very little from others
good,"The company culture is garbage. By far the worst place I have worked outside of TJ Maxx. They do not offer employee discounts and you only get a voucher during Christmas that can be used during the day before or the day of. Managment was garbage save for my assistant managers. Specifically, my GM was an avaricious, misogynist scumbag and the DM did NOT care about anything other than statistics and appearances rather than the people who uphold them, ie the employees. If you need a check, this is a great place to work to get retail experience but don't expect anything more than a place you can walk in, work your shift and go home."
good,They will work a lot of hours with only 1 day off with huge trucks of new freight to work and new seasonal sets to be completed.They will have to work a lone and be able to take care of customers and check in vendors at the same time
good,typical work day was great.  i enjoy interaction with customers and coworkers.  there was always something to do.  i had 3 managers in the time i was at dollar general.  3rd manager is there on a favor and shows time and time again he doesn't want to be there.  makes it hard on employees. most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
good,There was so much expected of a cashier abd was noy explained before hire. And to be honest fron being in alot of the stores think its an overall problem in every store.
good,"I enjoyed the community feel at Dollar General seeing and serving regular customers and getting to know them was nice. I felt however, the advancement opportunity wasn’t there in the district and the pay was unreasonable for the duties and responsibilities of the job."
good,I enjoy working here but there is a lot to get done and not enough time in the day to do it in.   The first 2 days after truck which comes weekly are hetic
good,The company is not supportive but the McEwen store team is amazing. The pay is not competitive but the manager at the McEwen store is outstanding and supportive.
good,I would go in and clock in. Then I would get my drawer and count it to make sure that it is at the right amount to start off with. After I do all that I start recovering and making sure things are in the correct places.
good,"I was a Lead Key Holder at Dollar General and loved going to work. I was only to work 18 -20 hours a week, but ended up working between 30 -35 hours a week. Then they brought in a new manager. This manager was very disrespectful to the employees. I spoke to the District manager and told her I quit because of the manager. I have been in the store to buy products and have seen the way she is rude to customers. She made it very clear to us employees that she wanted us all gone and demoted from being a key holder, she stated she wanted her own people in there. The district manager backed her. I don't think the District Manager even questioned her about anything because she said she would call me after speaking with the manager and I never got a call."
good,"When you clock in, you are in a rush from start to finish to get everything done. You're normally short staffed so you have to take on a lot of extra work. if you keep your head up with a positive attitude and get the job done, there are  always advancement opportunities. "
good,"If you are looking for a career, this is not a job for you unless you come in as a part of management. Regular shift work would better benefit high school/college students looking for part-time work. Also anyone who is simply looking for a second job to make ends meet, this is that type of position."
good,"I would open the store or close store.take inventory and truck orders.operate the registers and override if necessary.count safe and make drops.complete necessary paperwork for end of sales,etc.count drawers,stock,clean and close the store.then I would set alarm and lock up for the night."
good,It's a decent place to work. They set my prior manager up for failure. Telling her we had a certain amount of time to fix up the store and they came 10 days early. They demoted her and moved her to a different store and brought in a new manager. So I have mixed feelings about the place.
good,It’s an okay job. But the people that come in can be rude. So can the manager bit it’s okay.  But it did help me with certain thing and I did enjoy it to a certain part.
good,The one I worked at had terrible management. Most of the time you couldn't find the managers. Even when they both were working. There was one way to get ahold of them and that was IF they took the store phone with them.
good,"The Dollar General that I worked at was not managed properly and therefore made the quality of the job low. The pay was not worth it, and ultimately, I did more than what I should have trying to be a good employee."
good,A typical day at work is me being on the register all day with this being said I learned a lot more about counting money. My manager was a pretty good boss was very flexible and worked with you when you needed days off.
good,the management needed improved very badly at the time. she was taking merchandise and money! the store was in process of being cleaned when i left. i also went to itta bena location and helped redo their store!
good,Dollar General looks at their employees as bigger thieves than customers entering their store. They spend more money putting cameras in direct angles to watch their employees than they do at the customers. They never appreciate extra time out in but r the first ones to be very. Angry if u don't cover for someone else ni matter how many times u covered in the past. Do not pay wellpwewellemployees well
good,"Was promoted to Assistant manager at another store when I asked about the position, had to be the store manager for a few months (with none of the benefits) while the actual store manager was out on medical leave."
good,This job is a good way to get into retail and the management is very nice. The hours are not super early in the morning and don’t end really late. The managers are very nice and patient.
good,Love the environment of working with people.. and the customers.   Alot of hard work .  Maybe need to pay more than what now . Good work team to get along with
good,Would consider going back. Enjoyed meeting new people everyday. Liked keeping busy and always having something to do.The employees were good to work with.
good,You learn as you go. It is an easy job; you just have to deal with some annoying things to get through it. What I enjoy about my job is helping and meeting new people.
good,"The manager fired me wrongfully fought for job back, got it back, only to be terminated once again wrongfully, now having hard time getting back in, even though a different manager wanted me back in, sounded positive only to get my hopes up!"
good,"Too many turn overs. expected the cashier to wait on customers, clean the store, Do recovery, put up the sales signs with just 2 employees in the entire store. too much turnover"
good,I liked working at DG but my manager at time showed extreme favoritism to certain people and cut my hours back to 10 per week and it wasn't worth it...
good,It was an okay job. I would return if I had to. Wish they paid more because I did enjoy it sometimes and met some great people there and customers were sometimes amazing.
good,"A place where you can learn and grow."
good,"Training was very minimal for employees as well as the manager. They need a better training program for all new hires, communication was not a strong point in this company"
good,"Although I like shopping here because they have a lot to choose from, i wouldn't recommend working there unless you don't plan on moving up the ladder like they say you will from the beginning! The pay is ridiculous and could not afford to live off the pay there!"
good,Good company to work for under the right management. Plenty of opportunity for quick advancement. Fast paced. Organizational skills helpful. No drug test required but there is a background check so that can hold up employment.
good,"At dollar general you are no paid a whole lot and you do the job of multiple people at other agencies. While the work is difficult at times, if you have a good team to work with the job is not so terrible."
good,Work to life balance is terrible and you will be worked every Sunday. It can be stressful at times because of it being a small store there aren’t many employees per store. So you are required to put in the effort for everything to go smoothly. It can be very quick to get promoted inside of the company quick if you work hard and put forth the effort
good,"Working at Dollar General helped me grow as a person. Due to me going back to school I had left that job, but I would go back because it was a great place to work."
good,I really liked it except the stocking part it was difficult but I was catching on quickly we always stayed busy closing and opening was a good experience for me
good,"No hours to work with. No payroll. You work alone a lot and have to be the epitome of a multitasker. It's not good for the safety of the employees or customers. Oftentimes you are the only one receiving stocking and ringing, it cant be done."
good,"The employer should follow through with meeting the employees work availabity and work hours earned once that employee has completed his/ her training for etc. Job title/ position, upon reaching the discrition for the work hours for the available work job title."
good,"As long as you stay on task it’s a simple"
good,"Care more about the money than their people, and it shows at different points in time but th weekly pay is nice but that’s the best part about the job"
good,Yuh ou sometimes  ne er knew when you were getting  off the shift were long pushing  freight  and running  the  cash register  was no fun you had be 3 people  Into pne.
good,"Dollar General is an energetic work environment, that is never full.  There is always something to catch up on.  Management has as many things to do, so you learn to self motivate in order to get the job done."
good,Not enough help with unloading and putting inventory up. Usually at the cashier register its just one person the other person is organizing the store. I feel there should be more help at night.
good,I loved the people I worked with and the manger was super sweet and always helpful but the pay wasn’t enough especially working part time but like a full time person!
good,Some of mangement are great. And some of the mangement care only for themselves. But it is a ok place to work the pay is low and hours can be very little
good,"That specific store was terrible. The manager was a bigot, and extremly rude to both workers and customers. He was accusing multiple members of the staff of things that didnt happen. Cussed at patrons who called, or showed up at the store if they said something he didnt agree with, and spread vicious rumors about some of the staff members."
good,"Regardless of your title you are required to do almost everything..from stocking, conditioning, cashiering, etc."
good,"The store was cluttered and unorganized. The pace was chaotic and there were only two employees a shift. For customers to get the cashiers attention, they had to squeeze a dirty squeaky dog toy that although we cleaned often never really came clean and so customers chose to wait instead of using it. Customers were free to do as they pleased despite any signed rules to enter the store such as no shirt no entry, etc. I would ask them to follow the signs orders on their next trip to the store. I got positive feedback for this and double bagging heavy items that, as I was told, other cashiers never did. I was never mistreated and was appreciated. Only one incident occurred with an assistant manager who never did his job and simply did not care, saying so in front of my line and I did have to stand up to him ( I’m usually quiet and shy). The customers actually cheered for me and he had never acted that way again. I only left due to a better job opportunity with better pay and benefits."
good,Dollar general is a typical place to work and great if you want something consistent. Pay can be negotiated based in experience and position you’re applying for
good,"Our store had a lot of problems when I all of a sudden was forced, due to employees quitting, to be in charge. I did what was needed for the company. "
good,My time there I made more friends there than any job. Working with them was great. The job was easy. In a year I got promoted from the bottom. Do not regret working there.
good,"Overall, it's a good place holder job to get you through the day. It teaches customer service and the importance of working hard and money management."
good,Rude managers lead to my leave and unconcerned about my human welfare. I am pregnant and still expect me to lift heavy things. My hours keep getting cut and I'm suppose to be full time.
good,"Managers and co-workers were very nice and supportive, but the job itself is quite boring and standing at the register so much hurts your feet. Most of my gripes with the job was the social interaction, I don't like it very much and I'm very anxious. If you don't have social anxiety this is a pretty good choice for a first or second job. My managers were very kind to me and understood whenever I needed certain days off or if I needed to take a break to sit down. The hours were generally very flexible if you needed to request certain times off. The stocking and interacting with customers is still pretty boring though, but sometimes organizing the shelves is fun if you like organizing things."
good,i enjoyed working for dollar general for the most part. i enjoyed bonding with my regulars and providing them with great customer service. working for dollar general was easy as far as work wise. if offered my job back i will provide great customer service as i did before.
good,"Management wasn't easy to communicate with, their scheduling was poor reviewed for students. Coworkers were easy to get along with and train. Customers were very friendly and it was easy to show them around the store to help them locate items. The hardest part of the day would be when the store system would go down when you had a store full of customers."
good,Loved my customers management is no help when ya need them. Nothing is done to people who steal and caught on camera. I really loved helping my customers and the ones that came everyday. You get use to them and know them.  Sad I won't see them anymore.
good,We got new management and some people left. It is taking forever for our new manager to hire new employees. It is hard to get time off with only 5 employees.
good,"Okay place to work temporarily, but permanently stressful and constantly inconsistent through out locations. Management okay depending on District assigned by area."
good,"I got demoted because I'm too old. Don't think that is right or fair. I'm a hard worker.  I always work when I am scheduled. I even come in on my days off, when I am needed."
good,I loved the company when I first started working there but the higher up management is becoming a joke. They don’t care about when people all they care about is making money and they are terrible when it comes to training their employees.
good,Just need better management and more rewards for achievements. Had a great staff at one point in time. District manager never helped me when I needed help with the store due to being short staffed.
good,Dollar General is an okay company to work for I don't think they pay the key holders enough money hey basically dothe exact same as an assistant manager does but I did like the job duties I was responsible for.
good,Too many expectations and not enough staff due to minimum wages. Management often had to work double shifts to cover employee absences. No breaks when working alone which happened a lot in the morning.
good,All was good for the most part. Pay was sucky. $7.25 an hour. no benefits. no nothing. Still liked working there. Busy at times but it made the day go by faster! I just enjoy being a cashier and stocking the shelves.
good,"It's not a hard job at all. You just have to stay on top of things to make sure everything in the store runs smoothly. I'm at a plus store so it's pretty busy all the time but it makes the day go by fast. You just work on truck, do your weekly scans, and set planograms. Sometimes management can be a problem with all of the favoritism that goes on in the store but otherwise it's a pretty good job. Our regular customers are so sweet."
good,"work is not bad, shifts are somewhat flexible. pay is garbage, at all position levels. DG’s customers are mostly low-income people, so the environment reflects that. very high employee turnover rate."
good,"The job was very easy, I just rang customers up and stocked the store during downtime. I left because I was forced to work 6-7 shifts without breaks because the assistant manager refused to come in and cover the shift."
good,It was ok place to work and meet new people and lean thing i never new and it a good place to move up in the company and become a manager and one day be more
good,"I feel the company doesn't care about there employees as they should but dont get me wrong... I absolutely love my job as a sales associate at DG!   I feel I always go above and beyond my duties as an associate because its just me and how I do things.  I find it at times overwhelming as so much needs to be done with very little time.  In my location our floors are so bad, dirty and cracked because they don't and won't give us the time to clean them without rushing in between customers, which is frustrating!  1 day a week and 30 minutes after closing would be enough time to do this and make the store somewhat acceptable for our customers."
good,"The pay for working this job is most certainly not enough. You have to do so much for holding the title of ""cashier"". This job is really for teenagers in school or getting out of school."
good,"My manager was kind and patient. The job was laid back, and it taught me how to properly deal with people of all kinds of life styles. I enjoyed my time at dollar general."
good,"The job itself was fun the people I worked with not so much including management. They were rude and very unfriendly, to much gossip not enough work. I had to quit."
good,The job was retail which I have 20 yes experience I have great customer service personality fast learner willing to train if needed .. bialingual. Great with numbers ..
good,"Dollar General was a sturdy job.i think it's more fit for college students and retires, not people who need money now . The environment is great.Its dependable,if I had to I would definitely work with them again"
good,Management didn't keep up with the schedule correctly. I learned a lot though about the register. The job isn't hard just a clustered mess of customers.
good,Dollar General must change their system. The system on the store for store manager is horrible its a stress for job with system that don't work for large high volume stores. 70+ hours a week
good,Really easy job. The hardest part was dealing with the really disrespectful customers but that is to be expected when you are working with the public. People expect service and they expect it to be proper
good,"I was a Lead Sales Associate (starting pay $8.50) at a store which is basically just a shift manager. I applied to this position without any experience in management and got hired two weeks later. When I was hired the store manager told me that I was really only guaranteed 3-20 hours a week. Yes, three hours. You do some CBL's on the computer that takes a few hours to complete and then you're ready to work. "
good,"I loved working there, I did not like the unfair treatment that the management gives each employee. Dollar General is a great place to advance in and the customers were amazing."
good,"In my experience Dollar General is an easier job to work for. The 2 big things wrong with DG is the management is always sub par and of course the customers! Customers will make or break your day and it is usually the latter of the two. Management isn't very helpful to it's associates while Dollar General is most definitely a top down organisation. Sales Associates have very little to no authority at all (no refunds, price adjustments, etc). If you want weekly pay at minimum wage and generally 10-20 hours a week, then this is the place for you."
good,Recommended for students or retired people raises are slow very little room for advancement hours are not that good employees are not trained completely to do job
good,"Not a bad place to work.  I loved my job, my team, my managers, and the store itself.  The district manager was extremely lacking in his managerial skills, knowledge, team building, and people skills."
good,"Living in a small town means it is difficult to find gainful employment.  Dollar General initially hired me as a part time cashier.  Within 3 months, I was promoted to Lead Key.  Within 7 months I was promoted to Assistant Store Manager.  In retail, it is difficult to find reliable employees so you do find yourself working double shifts when employees call in or fail to show up for work.  I did enjoy the complex duties assigned everyday and talking/helping customers.  The pay for an Assistant Store Manager was only $11.00 per hour and you are given the work load of 5 people, so it is very easy to get behind and get written up for it.  Opportunity for advancement is plentiful but the pay does not compensate unless you make it to corporate levels."
good,Overall the job at Dollar General was a good job the pain could have been better but the hours of operation a great for my life and the amount of work I could handle so it was easy for me I really like the job really not fond of the pay but overall I like my job.
good,I learned how to stock shelves and how to work the register. Typical day at work is usually full of me stocking shelves and moving heavy things however i would sometimes had to work register.
good,"I provided and completed many managerial duties which I enjoyed. I always like learning new things which they recognized, but they did not provide enough hours."
good,"Worked for 3 years being called in early. You as an employee have to do multiple jobs.  Some Dollar general Policies are being broken."
good,There are few breaks if any for short work hours. There are times when it might be helpful to have more people on registers. It might also help if sales associates could cancel items that were rung up without needing assistance.
good,the Job and the first DM were fine then they realigned and i got a net DM that tstarte making changes thae had a negative impact on my earnings. and had no personality to discuss what was happening. was his way only and no room to discuss any better plans.
good,"dollar general was my first job at first is was nerve wrecking, but as I progressed through my time working i was helped a lot with learning how to my job. i was pretty laid back sometimes drama but other that pretty good."
good,My review at dollar general is its an okay place to work at to help ends meet. I would like if we had more help and more people doing there job before they clock out.
good,"Decent work environment and pay, job could flow a lot better and keep turn over lower if they had better management. They have started advancing employees into other positions instead of hiring from outside as things should have been, could do better with this situation as well"
good,"Dollar General does not offer many hours of work per week. They are very low staffed, and offer low to no benefits to their employees. I would give them an over all rating of 3 out of 5."
good,"I've worked for DG for 3 years. I've noticed that everything has to do with your manager. It's a great place for students to work , if management is good."
good,"Great to learn from. Not the best place to work. You deal with alot of rude customers, so you have to have patience. No Mayer hope much you dislike someone you still put a smile on and tell them to have a great day. People skills is a must."
good,Its alright if your manager is willing to help you and work with you. But overall it's not hard to do and easy to move you up in a career for management if needed
good,"The job is very rewarding, I just feel that I am ready to get out of retail.Ive enjoyed the last 4 years growing with Dollar General. I am ready for a change"
good,It was too stressful and was not guided as needed for first time retail. Would often take others shifts due to them leaving or quitting on the spot...
good,"Dollar General is an easy cashier job where you dont have to stand in one spot, you will be doing more than standing in one place, you can stock the shelves clean the counters and so on"
good,"The General manager is stuck up and out dated not a nice person thinks she’s better than everyone else, they need more outgoing and younger people in higher positions   but my manager was awesome !"
good,"This was a Retail job, meaning long hours and being on Salary was rough. Store Manager gets blamed for all and is responsible for all. I would say good first job for someone but not a forever thing."
good,"Thecjobs fast paced, stressful & there is a lot of turnover in employees. As a key holder if someone calls off you have to cover that shift if no one else comes in. There are several hours you work the store alone. This includes assisting customers, checking Vendors in & processing their orders, running the register."
good,"this company can be very stressful and demanding.  when fully staffed the stores are very manageable. when understaffed its a struggle, but overall not a bad company."
good,"-Typical day of stocking or recovery every night along with working the cash register sometimes by yourself."
good,"Management sucked, most dollar generals have went down hill and are disgusting, a new way of doing things would do some good for the store and the customers"
good,"What I like most about Dollar General is there is room for growth and advancement.  There are sometimes stressful days and long hours but if you have the right staff, it can be less stress"
good,"this Job is very fast pace and this job is a lot of lifting and walking. management wasn't the best and could have been better. training wasn't very good so therefor, advancements weren't easy to get due to the pickiness of the management. You have to kiss butt in order to get anything of an advancement from this company. Don't go into this company and think it will be easy. Judgement is everywhere"
good,"I would personally not recommend this to anyone. The first job I ever really had was Dollar General and the one I worked at was lacking room for my own improvement. I was unable to be promoted due to not having a vehicle, though my manager deeply wished to give me said promotion."
good,Not appicable due to the reasons I was forced to leave has not clouded my judgement of the overall expience and knowledge I had gained from working there.
good,"as a store manager you are over your store.  Making the schedules.  Making daily"
good,Worked by myself most of the time with no one else there. Learned to be quick and some what efficient. Hardest part was trying to get an overwhelming amount of stuff accomplished with little time to do it. What I enjoyed most about it was the customers. Yes we had a lot of unpleasant people come in and out of there. Although I feel that most of the people were great people and they were regulars.
good,"It is a stressful job, nut it can be a very fun place to work. Stay on top of what needs to be done and it is not that bad. Management is everything, without good management it is a horrible place to work,"
good,"A good first job, not many responsibilities and a slow work pace for somebody not used to the job market. I would recommend if it was one of your early jobs."
good,Worked part time. Learned to stock and customer service. Management was helpful. Culture was easy going. I enjoyed being busy and getting to know and help customers.
good,"Typical retail job. No perks. No full time. No benefits. Understaffed, and no protections from harrassment from patrons. I would not recommend this job, if you are looking for a career."
good,Due to the supervisor at the time of my employmentit was very stressful and I was lied to about being promoted to the assistant even though I was doing the assistance job.
good,No support from upper management for employee performance.  No consequences for not completing scheduled tasks.  No ambition from employees to do their best.
good,"It's been 10 years, I hope things have changed. I enjoyed my time there, but it was very trying for my family. Long hours and the model was something that was difficult for me."
good,"No set schedule"
good,worked many hours sometimes 50 others 20 fast paced never slow people good to work with 7 day work week or 1 day week we were always polite to custmers
good,Application process and back ground check take too long. Also too many hours is required for the money they pay. Makes too many demands for one person to handle with out actual help.
good,"My time At Dollar General wasn't horrible. I worked at three different stores and each one had its challenges. All in all though, the expectations that corporate puts on stores is realistic. The expectations some managers have isn't for all employees. Just like any job you'll have problems and have to find solutions. I do not see a lot of advancement opportunities here though."
good,"My typical day was from open to close most days. I ordered inventory, stocked shelves, made deposits, wrote schedules for employees. The hardest part of my job is being away from my family 12-16 hours per day and working on holidays."
good,my main role was working the front of the store.a typical day would be counting down your draw making sure the draw was correct before starting your day. while  i am waiting on customers to purchases they're products .I would restock or face shelves by moving items forward.cleaning .anything that i could find to do as i wait on customers.
good,"I would say it was a great experience, but I would have rather worked with people who actually did their jobs but not Eveyone is that lucky. I loved the job experience though. I loved meeting the new/ old people who came in all the time and learning how to run a store."
good,customer service was a good experiment for me. Think it'll be a nice starter up job for anybody. Also people are nice and mean at times. But other then that its good co workers!
good,"You should only work here if you are a stay at home mom and only want to get out of the house a couple days a week. Actually, I can’t think of any pros to working with this company. The pay is an absolute joke, only paying $7.50/hr, they promise you quick promotion and opportunities-which is absolutely non-existent. The hours are about as inconsistent as the weather in GA, 20 hours one week-4 hours the next. They act like their company is a kingdom, and trust customers a whole lot more than the employees. Any bag or wallet of every employee is searched every time you walk out the front doors, either to leave for the day or to go on break- and right in front of the customers. The manager or supervisor will literally step away from a long line of customers and make them wait, only to come go through your purse. Also, they think a whole lot of their $7.50/hour, employees are constantly expected to run the cash register and stock in the back of the store at the same time, if you’re lucky enough to hear the bell ding, you literally have to run to the register and yell “I’m coming!”, so the customer doesn’t get upset for waiting. Honestly I can’t really think of any reason to work here, unless there is nothing else in the vicinity of where you live. For, there are a whole lot of other places where you would get paid $3/hour more and not have to put up with the the ridiculousness. Thanks for listening"
good,"Working for DG is fine, until you become a salaried employee.  You can expect to work between 50-70 hours each week and one scheduled day off.  Your day off does not change, and if you have something to do on a different day, it is treated as a huge inconvenience.   Payroll is usually cut 2-4 hours at least once a month, and it gets worse the closer you get to the end of the fiscal year.  There is a very high turnover rate due to not enough hours and low pay."
good,I had a lot of stuff I needed to pay for and the pay wasn’t high enough for me to make any money to do those things and live at the same time. I’m also trying to get my degree for teaching and coaching basketball so they didn’t help with my schooling at all.
good,the work day was either busy or it was slow depending on the day and the time of day. The hardest part was dealing with the customers that was rude or just disrespectful.
good,"Alot of Drama an management cut throat in the location that I worked at , Other than that would be better place if everyone was on same page, Stores are always unorganized"
good,"For a starting position, or for someone looking to enter the workforce. Pay rates and benefits could definitely use some improvement, and my manager is amazing. She has always been willing to work around my school schedule."
good,How you will do here is highly dependent on how much you are willing to take and how good/bad your managers are. I've worked ina  few stores now and you know which ones the managers are really trying in.
good,"the training is better , there more helpful if you don't no where things go , the co-workers are helpful. you stock , clean , help customers. busy days are around the holidays."
good,the pay was very good but over on year the store has gone through 3 managers and 4 temporary managers from other stores. Employees are quitting very often due to lack of hours. the managers show a lot of favortism and all cashiers have 2 days a week. Ive seen over 20 employees quit or get fired in the last year.
good,"Working at Dollar General was just what I expected it to be. Not enough pay for the work your are expected to do. The store management in the store I worked for was pleasant and easy-going. My co-workers were slightly grouchy due to low pay and low hours but overall good to work with. There is a high rate of turnover, however."
good,"A lot is expected and demanded when it comes to orders for inventory and stocking shelves when working in stores. The scheduling is pretty flexible and the team's usually tend to concerns of conflict and discouragement in the work place very well, so settling in as a new employee is a pretty smooth transition"
good,"Managers could do there jobs better. Never had good hours, someone always calling in and getting away with it, pay isn’t good. Stores are cluttered. Most employers had a ugly attitude."
good,Its good for a starter but no room for advancement. Not many hours managers show a lot of favoritism. Managers are hardly satisfied can be hectic at times
good,"I enjoyed working here. I got along well with my coworkers, and managers. I enjoyed getting to know our customers, and helping find what they needed for that visit."
good,"A typical day at work was just going in and running register and if you had no customers you would be working truck. I learned a lot at this job, like to pay attention to detail, and to be fast paced. Management was good."
good,People you work with are nice and fun to talk to. Management was poor and showed favoritism. Costumers were sometimes rude. Fast paced and up beat environment
good,"I only ran into problems with a few managers and other coworkers."
good,"Most days were great, there were some flaws but every workplace has them. I just wish I had gotten more hours. That was really the only complaint that I had as an associate"
good,It’s a fun environment to be in but only when you’re not falling over stuff in the aisles and having to go around aisles just to get to the register because they are full of crud and things in the way
good,"Expected to quickly checkout all customers while also communicating to them. Got practice at being more outgoing and talking to strangers. Busy days were always better than slow, quiet days."
good,Job requires long hours and mandatory 6 day work week for salaried managers.  Limited payroll allotment  for job standards to be achieved. Paid weekly a plus
good,The management spent more time trying to meet sales goals than worrying about their customers and employees. Turnover rate is quite high. Never fully staffed.
good,"Working in for the Iola store was okay. However, when you needed to take time for family issues the manager was not very understanding as she thought that a child should be able to go the doctors alone. I did enjoy working with a few of the co workers that I worked with. The stores should have more space for all of the products that they have vs just smashing them in as best they can."
good,Manager is brilliant and work is easy and straight forward. Stocking is simple and easy and keeps you busy while there aren't any customers. Other than that it isn't bad.
good,Dollar General typical day at work was cashiering cleaning and stocking shelves. I learned how to deal with the public and fellow employees. the hardest part of the job was the hours I didn't have a set schedule
good,I loved working there but gave me a manager position but not manager money and wasn’t willing to negotiate I would still be there if it was considered I made manager in less than two months
good,I don’t recommend this job to someone looking for a first job. The job isn’t fair to anyone but higher ups. They yell at workers if not doin job and hardly write anyone up
good,"Shady supervisors, sketchy pay, but although you will learn about the retail and financial aspects of the store/ company. All in all, this is a real nice job to get you back on your feet, but it is not a occupation to stick around for too long."
good,Little to no support from the Corporate office. lots of work but not enough hours to assign to achieve the projects given. Job its self is an easy one if you follow the procedures.
good,Dollar General can honestly work on some things management and employees. I can say they are very consistent when it comes to workers coming in and workers calling out.
good,"Part time work during college. Worked a little bit around my schedule. Was paid minimum wage. Was cashier,and stocker. Also sweeped, moped, inventory,"
good,There is no work life balance. Managers are required to work 6 days a week and if someone doesn't show up and you can not get a replacement then you need to work the additional shift and come back and work your regular shift. No balance at all.
good,"Stocking, taking care of customers,cleaning store, handling all monies,deposits. I enjoy stocking product, and helping my customers.I have worked in the food service industry most of my career, I enjoy working in retail ore than the food service."
good,It can be very slow paced sometimes. During the slower hours you are expected to stock the shelves and unpack the boxes from the truck. During face paced hours you are responsible for trying to keep the line down while unpacking boxes from truck which an be stressful.
good,"Based On my experience, it was VERY cliquish. I did love meeting the new customers and seeing familiar faces again. The store that I worked at was a bit unorganized but we always managed to come together as a team despite the unorganized environment."
good,This corporation continues to add more stores each year. Career development and promotions are available within the system. Part time and full time positions are available.
good,"Dollar General is a hit or miss depending on your manager. There is room for advancement not just at the store, but the corporation as a whole. Pay is not competitive compared to other retail locations, but raises seem to be slightly more frequent. You have to learn to multitask in order to be successful within the company."
good,A day at Dollar General is always busy. There is not down time. I learned to multi-task even better. The hardest part of the job is dealing with out rate customers when you are very busy. The most enjoyable was working with public and working someone with their needs.
good,"It was fun working at Dollar General, the employees were hard working. Some days were super busy and some days were slow. Everyone always pulled together to get the job done."
good,"I enjoyed my time working there I learned a lot from the old manger about being a great manger, got to meet and serve the great town that the store was located"
good,"Corporate expects u to make the store perfect , and does not give u the hours to do that, the customers and employees that u hire becomes a extended family ."
good,"Was a hard place to work for. The manager was rude and mean. The assistant manager  was a loner. The district manager was very turn an eye away from problems unless it was to get rid of the one rocking to boat so to speak."
good,"Everything was great before. Learned where to put products, how to pack out boxes. All day I would spend fixing shelf's depending on the time. The most enjoyable was the people i was with."
good,"Depends on the store. I've worked at two. One was a great one the other left a little to be desired. So I guess I turn that boils down to to the immediate management staff,not so much on the company as a whole."
good,Retail hours and duties can be tough. Dollar General was not bad overall. It was difficult with a young child to mange the hours but that would be true as a retail manger almost anywhere.
good,Have good people to learn from. Have to learn how to deal with the public if you don't know how. Have to stay calm through everything. Have to love the environment. I learned how to not take everything to the heart. One of the hardest parts of the job was for me to take the negative comments from the customers.
good,"As a cashier you will sweep and run the register. Running the register is easy until you have to void an item. For voids and returns a manager needs to come over and use their keys. This hold up your line, and can get frustrating after a while. I became a key holder to avoid this. "
good,It was good for the most part besides the drama and bickering back and forth between co workers  but hollidays are really busy times so you get alot more hours but you must keep yourself busy
good,I enjoyed my time working here. I had an issue with the ASM abusing power and harassing me. The Store Manager kept asking me to wait until she transferred but after 3 months I was unable to keep waiting.
good,it ws ok working here until they cut everyones hours i went from 38 hours a week to 12 i cannott live on 12 hours a week paycheck so i had to leave and find a new job
good,I would the job was mostly easy and very well handle. I did my part and went home. Nothing else much to say it. The hardest part of the job were the people who are impatient and in a hurry but mostly that was it. Most of my co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The most enjoyable part of my day was listening to the music they had on.
good,"They do not give enough hours. Don't pay enough for the job. Taking care of the customer, stocking selves and working with other employees. Management if very fair. Hard to work with difficult customers."
good,"No real attachment to the job other than the amazing team of women I worked with. I learned a great many skills from them as well, and became the youngest manager on my work team because of my highly trainable nature. I handled large deposits at the end of each day and prepared them for bank runs the following morning."
good,"Dollar general is an okay industry to be involved in when it comes to getting work experience. Personally, for the first parts of my career as an faithful employee at a location, I enjoyed it. But, the staff, General Manager and even District Manager you have to look out for. They can be cutthroat."
good,"Part time and good people, just don't break down in there parking lot. They will send you home, Dollar General is not very good at keeping employees. Especially if they are in hardship."
good,"Regular cashier dealt with rude and nice customers at times. There was nothing new that I haven't known already besides stoking new merchandise on the shelves. place needs some new management, The workplace culture is quite good I'd say. The hardest part of the job would be trying to wear the same color uniform over and over. The one thing I've enjoyed about the job was that it is quite laid back."
good,"I'm either stocking, working cashier, cleaning or helping customers throughout the store. Id prefer a flexible schedule with regular hours and a maximum of 20 hours a week."
good,I enjoyed working at DG. It was a great experience and was a very easy job to maintain. The staff was great and treated me well. I wouldn’t mind working their again.
good,"I started doing a training session online first. After, I started cash register and mostly just stock until I got  comfortable with the tasks at hand. They have very good trainer/manager, I caught on fast and they was always helpful. By the end of week one, I love it. Plus, they had extra hours if you needed a little more than scheduled. The overall work duties in the store are organized and your day is almost like going by a schedule."
good,Typical day is just working hard and moving fast. Learned how to be quick at anything I did. Had to be. Management depended on which manager. Not every worker got along real well. Hardest part was mainly doing everything. Most enjoyable was some of the workers I worked with
good,"Customer service is a big key to your day. You have to be able to work in a fast paced environment during busy times of the day. At my location, the customers sucked and I couldn't transfer to another store, so I left."
good,Typical day at work is pretty slow except for when the truck comes. We would have to work in the truck and also be around to do register. The manager expected us to  get all the totes done while being on the register
good,"Some employees don't do their job and as managers you have to pick up their slack and more, every one deserves a chance but not with this company.  The pay rate is low especially for someone who worked to get a degree. They also bypass someone who has been there longer than others for a position that has been applied for."
good,"The coworkers were nice, kind, and wonderful to work with."
good,A typical day at work involved working the cash register or helping put product on the shelves.  The workplace was okay.  My coworkers were good people.
good,"I would love my occupation, management has made the job less then enjoyable though. Either your on board or your not, a lot of upper mgmt are jumping ship due to one individual."
good,It’s okay I would recommend to someone who wants a quick and easy job. Don’t expect too much compensation or advancement opportunities.  This job is for high schooler
good,It was always pretty quite in the mornings. They seem to get a lot of displays. The store was fairly disorganized since it had just opened. I was not there long enough to learn much of anything
good,"I loved working for Dollar General. I am just wanting to see if there something else out there, new adventure. I will give 110 percent . I would love to have interview."
good,"Dollar General is a great place to work if you have the right people that are willing to work. Great customer service goes a long way, makes the customers feel welcome and want to come back."
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,This company is a bear to work for the hours you put are hard ones you work your staff and your self to the bone then come back in the next day and do it all over again . I worked in a very high  thieft area and lived over 40 miles from the store . Had to be there 12 hours plus a day to keep track of everything.  District managers Changed like 5 times while I was there .
good,"Couldn't really rate managers, because they were in and out every two months. No matter what hours I asked for they never got set correctly even when I wanted more. Almost ended up barely working twice a week. Lots of gossip between all employees. Everyone was a bit uptight."
good,"It's a nice place to work,  if you can get hours. There is room for advancement. Only thing I don't like about it is,  you have to be in two places at once.  You have to stock the shelves and also be at the register at the same time, when the customer(s) are ready to checkout."
good,Dollar general taught me tons about retail management and working directly with upper management gave me the boost I needed to let go of my shy ways and become the boss I am today.
good,"Enjoyed working with the people - however, the hours were very few.  Could never get enough time to become full-time.  No benefits.  Manager and staff are great people."
good,"There was a great deal of work to do. You would usually stay busy between working rolltiners, helping customers and recovery. i learned that keeping a calm mind and settng a realistic goal is loads better than rushing in a panic. The evironment is very inviting. but the management suffers due to lack of understanding each other."
good,It was part fun and part misery. The company didn't treat me as well as I feel I deserved. I worked very hard and was very productive. Did any job needed in store. Loved coworkers.
good,The environment is fast paced yet enjoyable. Must be quick and efficient at putting truck away. Must be organized. Customers were great. Management not so much.
good,"Dollar General isn't a bad company to work for, however their method for promoting is lacking badly. They tend to like to keep people in their current positions instead of promoting the ones who are deserving of the position."
good,It is an good place to work for. I am leaving because I am moving and want a job closer to my home. I do not mind a little drive but when driving and spending 12 hours a day at work is a little much for me.
good,to make my store and my job and  a better place for me and my staff.
good,Does not like to promote from within. Sends enternals through hoops to move up past store manager. No work life balance not enough payroll to run stores correctly
good,"I travel distance to work daily, even an 8 hr shift is a 14 hr day from the time I leave home till I return to my driveway. Very fast paced with exceptionally high demands."
good,Dallor general was very laid back. Worked on unloading truck and restocking. Cash handling and bank runs. Got to know your customers personally. Family friendly
good,I learned a lot from dollar general. Learned how to manage a team and handle customers very well. Learned how to manage money for change orders Dunbar and the bank
good,My experience at Dollar General wasn’t too good because the manager was very rude at times The Co workers didn’t really get along and was always fussing with each other .
good,"Scheduling is not consistent,  Everyone brings their drama to work instead of leaving it at the door.  There is no communication between employees.  The Assistant Manager and Manager say different things and are not on the same page."
good,"Fellow staff are amiable, but management has unrealistic expectations in most areas. Hardest part of job is when your superiors expect you to give up your free (non-work) time to assist them. Management does not seem to care about health of employees or their needs outside the workplace in regards to respecting work/life balance."
good,Hard to keep good help. Consistently retraining new employees when you can find good ones.  High turnover in management as well. Typical retail hours. Work weekends and holidays often.
good,"I would run cash register, if you made a mistake you would have to call for a manager which made you and the customer have to wait and the manager would get upset."
good,I started as a cashier and ended up working my way up to keyholder. My pay went from minimum wage to eight dollars a hour for a manager which I felt was very low. Being a manager was alot of work and I feel like they should pay better. They wouldn't ever let you get over fortt hours in a week because then they have to pay you time and a half. Very strict on rules and regulations. Seemed like you had to constantly work and hardly had days off. I just did my job the best I could everyday.
good,"Greet all customers, scan, process payments, give change when needed, bag items, stock shelves, clean  store."
good,"My team was great, but the pay was horrible. After two years, I only received a $1 raise. Not possible to rely on "
good,"I started working here a few months after turning 18. With this being my first job, I was going in with no retail experience. Retail is definitely a lot harder area of work than some people make it out to be. I moved up fairly quickly since my manager needed people as the workers who had been there for awhile either were quitting or were planning on quitting. As I have gained more work experience I realized the job paid a bit low for the amount of work that was expected of us. Rude co-workers and customers were something to be expected, but some of the situations were pretty nasty."
good,always busy never have time to take a break  great co workers  great manager other manager at the time was not a great manager i learned alot some customers were amazing other was no so much.
good,I worked very hard and was a very great worker and i was never help or told job well done. very bad management they did care how long i worked nor cared if someone came in and helped. very stressful
good,All that standing makes my back hurt.. The hours were not too flexible.. Employees do not receive discounts.. My supervisor ignored my calls and texts..
good,"Working at Dollar General typical day was stressful with the long standing and stocking. I learned you have to have understanding for unorangizing operation with items in the store, if the customer pick up something and put it somewhere else. Management was awesome very understand manager. Workplace culture were different culture. I enjoyed the break time with other coworkers."
good,"Corp. Office doesn't allow enough work hours per week for the whole team, and it was never enough.  So stock was never able to be worked completely, but very enjoyable working with customers."
good,I was assistant manager doing all the duties of my position and the manager. But my employees made working here worth while. I didn’t have any problems getting them to take there jobs seriously.
good,If you are not a part of management there really is no future in working here. The company wants you to be flexible but does not want to compensate you for it. They hire sales people only as part time and they don't offer benefits for part time staff.
good,Come in open the store count down money clean the store give breaks and lunches and take care of customers with a smile. Make sure that if a customer needs anything you don't point an tell them the ile that its on you show the customer to the merchandise an then ask if there is anything more you could help them with. The hardiest part of the job is to make sure you do the end of the day process right.
good,It was ok. Its good for young students in school. It was really messy to me. Very dirty and very messy. The pay is not too good. You got paid every week.
good,Dealing with people is always a day by day basis. One day you could have a great experience and the next the first customer could come in and yell at you for something that someone else did hours prior.
good,good place to start out and learn the basics of retail the only down side is most of the time there is only two people working yourself and a manger causing stress when customer traffic is heavy
good,"Usually come in and stock or work in the coolers and freezers, jump on register to help ring out the customers and try to make sure that they are having a good shopping experience"
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General until I transferred stores. I was unaware I was transferring into a full-time position (which wasn't problematic), and I had no idea how different management was. I was less than half trained when I transferred from one location to the other but learned the rest of the job expectancies within a matter of weeks. I was on closing shifts 90% of the time, which wasn't ideal due to having a family to raise/care for and not being able to tend to them as needed. Once I requested transfers or to step down from Lead Sales Associate to Sales Associate, both requests were denied without good reason. About two weeks after I left, someone else got hired in for the schedule I was asking to step down to."
good,"I loved my job, but the pay was not what I felt was deserving. I spent many hours performing the tasks that belonged to the manager, but he was always gone. So the other asst. manager and myself were left with the responsibility of making sure the store ran smoothly."
good,"It was basic, easy daily responsibilities of recovery, go-backs, and cash register use. Also applied a lot of customer service skills in helping customers find the best products at low prices throughout the store."
good,"The store stay cleans and is organized, speedy fast checkout , wonderful customer service, great management. Sales associates and managers are delightful."
good,"Over the timeframe I was employed with D.G. a number of stores was robbed, they were unstaffed. Work culture was pretty much ""Think tank"" mentality. Certain employees were lax in dress attire. Workload was tremendous. The customer base was great. "
good,"It's a good company but they need to pay more than min wage.And they expect to much from their managers . Work comes first family last,my family is important to me and I want to spend time with them ."
good,Fast paced environment but the stocking is hard physical work. The customers are generally very friendly but they do not give you enough hours or enough pay for the work they expect.
good,"My typical day was opening the store, getting the cash draws ready for the day, stocking, helping customers, closing the store, closing all cash draws and getting deposit ready."
good,"Working here couldn't get more basic between running register and stocking shelves, the shifts fly by.  Sometimes your scheduled very unfair and repetive hours compared to others, which interferes with personal life (wake up everyone else is at work, get home everyone is in bed). The hours are truly the biggest down side to working for this conpany."
good,"Your typical day at Dollar General depending on when you come in can involve pulling out roll containers to stock the shelves as well as setting up displays for the storefront, helping customers find items, performing transactions, bagging items, taking out trash, general cleaning around the store, collecting baskets and shopping carts, and mopping the floor at the end of the day. Management is very helpful to newcomers and very personable. The workplace culture may not always be perfect but with a positive attitude it can be made enjoyable. The hardest part of the job can be making sure the store is well stocked, depending on your area you may receive larger shipments. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you'll meet while working as well as performing you duties in a timely matter."
good,"I worked for DG for 8 months. I started out at the bottom making minimum wage. Ended up in 8 months becoming a store manager. The job is very demanding but if your looking for a future with them, they are a good company to frow with. My only downfall was they would never do anything about my complaints. And my hard work was never appreciated. I was just always criticized about any and everyyhing."
good,The job starts out annoying and very frustrating. It gets better after a few days. Eventually the job does stall after a while. With items being sold they need to be restocked just to be sold.
good,After expressing issues of finding good candidates for employment and reason for having problems getting processes completed no real assistance was given. Worked 60 hours or more a week to attempt to complete stocking and cleaning. Had to leave do to lack of family/work balance.
good,"First  management job and I absolutely loved it. I learned everything I know about being a manager from being at Dollar General. Some of the district managers could use some management training themselves. Hardest part of the job was trying to do everything that was needed to be done on an everyday basis, helping the cashier when needed, and being expected to get a majority of the freight done in one day."
good,Dollar General  could be so much more  but the leadership is caught up and seems to be stuck in micro management of their workers. it only takes a few hours of work to get the vibe that you are the sole cause of shrink.
good,you will definitely do more than what u get hired to do. but thats because of the lack of employees. the coworkers are really nice except onne of the managers assistants acts like she owns the place.
good,If you want to feel like a slave and work there many years and get paid the same amount everyone else gets for just starting then so be it. I have been there 3 years and i think i should of been offered the assistant manager position and i was not. Someone was brought in from another store that has been with the company less than a year.
good,A typical workday consisted of getting a register and signing in. I checked out customers and the cash register. I also stocked the shelves and cleaned the store.
good,It was an ok place to work. There were no pay raises nor vacation time paid. You are expected to be cashier and stocker at one time. They also had no alarm system if the store was robbed you were at the mercy of the thief. The manager carried the phone on his hip and there was no panic botton
good,"There is no growth, no communication with Superior management, no understanding of the business and the customers they services. No equal opportunities with male and female Management"
good,"but he was great. Other store managers seem to be on power trips from my observations. I only worked a short time though. If a manager works like a servant to others than you will like them, if they work like they are only for themselves then you won't like them. That is anywhere though. Other than that, the pay is not comparable to cost of living and my education and experience meant nothing to them."
good,"The company standards are demanding, but advancement is quickly and easily obtainable. The customers are definitely the best part of the job, making each day interesting."
good,"Very caring customers who visit regularly. Yet, management is very lacking, Hardest part of this position is being expected to be at two places at once."
good,"I learned how to be patient with customers. I learned how to work the register while putting out stock, recovering the store, and cleaning the register/ windows."
good,"Go to start up meeting get the assignments for the day, check in truck drivers, pick up guards paper work, inter paper work into the system, but trailer into bay doors call them out once the are empty, make sure all the reports match"
good,"its a fast pace simple job where energy, multitasking and patience is a must. you get to meet new interesting people and interact with colorful personality."
good,"I learned that working at this business you need to be able to work flexible  hours, and you need to know that people like to call in a lot. You do not get paid based off your experience and the manager(S) might take in consideration what you can do.  My experience here was ok and Its not a bad place you just have to have a open schedule and I would not recommend anybody with a fixed schedule apply here. They want you to have a open schedule and want you to work your hardest for minimum pay."
good,My manager knew I was in school and did what he could to work around my schedule to give me the hours that he could even though I was part time. He was one of the coolest!
good,"Dollar General is a good place to work, the pay is not quite enough, but they work with your schedule. i enjoyed my time there, and the frequent customers."
good,It was an experience. Training could have been better. Not team oriented. Staffing wasn’t an easy task having to get pay approved for each person. Poor communication from Dm
good,I had to unload the trailer to 3 stores i was gone from home alot it was not a bad company to work for Us express is a good paying company and the people i worked with helped me alot
good,The store is always busy your Always moving around barely have time to take a break most days. Overall not a bad place to work. The staff were very friendly.
good,"I was told I would be getting 35+ hrs a week even with my hours available restrictions. I'm not even getting 10 hrs a week. I dislike being told something is going to happen a certain way, and it doesn't."
good,"Difficult to move up or receive a pay raise unless you ""know someone"" Cashiers are often required to do manager work without recognition or compensation. Unstable hours"
good,Was a good place to work. Managers and co workers were good. But the pay only went up 75 cents in 4 years. The work keeps you busy and going and old hours
good,Very busy at times.  Learning how to stock and unload trucks while assisting customers at the same time.  Cleaning and fronting items and making thw store presentable for our customers.
good,Severely underpaid for the duties of a Sales Lead/Key Holder. Basically as a key holder you get paid the minimum wage ad have to do all the duties of the Assistant Manager plus more.
good,"I was only here for about a month training to be an Assistant when I was held at gunpoint at my store. "
good,When I worked there people made me feel like I was the greatest. They would tell the manager that I need a raise for my kindness. Customers would call corp. and tell them great things about me. All and all Dollar General treated me good it was just my manager didn't want me to move up because she would loose me.
good,It was a fun good learning expirence I enjoyed the team I had at my location. My manager was great he was understanding and hard working I learned so many great skills and traits from the staff and employees while I was there.
good,The store i was working at shut down it was a nice second job during the time.They pay rate wasn't the best at all and sometimes you would have to do multiple jobs in one shift.
good,"At This job i am a Lead. I manage the shift, give breaks, open and close the store. I have to count money on a daily basis. the work culture is very stressful, very poor management at the company."
good,The store keep switching hours of operation. They do not care if your kids or sick or not. They still want you to come to work. They hire to many people and cut back hours a lot.
good,No pay raises during time in which you are employed by company. No bonuses provided unless you are salary. I would recommend another company that provides that type of incentive that will motivate the employee to excel for the company
good,"The pay was decent, the management was very inconsistent. Upper management was good, but the district manager I was under managed with bullying.  I would still be with the company if not for that reason.  Benefits were great. The best part was my staff and my customers."
good,"The work load was not heavy and you could work at a steady pace. A typical day would include stocking shelves, operating the cash register and general store upkeep. Although store management was helpful, upper management displayed discourteous and unprofessional attitude on a regular basis. Customers were generally friendly, however continued break-ins and theft created an unsafe working environment."
good,"Learn how to run a store as if it was my own."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me opening the store and getting the start tasks and paper work going for the day.  I spend the rest of my time scheduling out hours for my employees and working stock.  When needed I also run the register.  I have learned a lot about managing a team even though I don't really get to manage the way it should be done.  I feel like I am manager in title only.  The work place culture is one of walking on egg shells.  The employees call HR anytime they get written up, and even though I only issue a write up if it is truly deserved, they tell me I have to let it go.  Once they do that my power of a manager is gone because they just go running to HR simply because I want them to do their jobs...or at least show up for their job.  The hardest part of this job right now is the lack of respect and the lack of time I have left to spend with my family.  I use to enjoy working for this company but due to the actions of some others my joy has been sapped.  I will still work hard and do an amazing job for them...that is just who I am."
good,Its a fast paced environment occasionally but a decent job for a part timer or someone who simply needs a job quickly. Coworkers are very kind and helpful as are some customers.
good,"Always getting drowned with lots of work (ordering, receiving, stocking, money management, and employee management. The hardest was always the new set ups for sales with the customers always complaining about new sales."
good,"Dollar General is an ok job. It's very easy to move up in the company as long as you are a good worker. DG needs more people working on each shift. If they did this, the stores would be better organized"
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced and busy stocking shelves, providing customer service answering phone calls. Maintaining company funds. i enjoy working with people."
good,I wouldnt work there again but it was ok for a beginner. Some customers you get are rude and try to bully you into lowering their prices on merchandise.
good,While working at dollar general my everyday routine was to stock shelves and assist customers. The job was pretty much laid back. Was fairly boring and there was no where to go with the company. So i proceed else where.
good,"The stores are great but the management they get in are something else at least in Va. I worked in several in hampton rds area and from the DM on up, they are the worst."
good,"No one can make a decision for you working at Dollar General Dollar , everything is based upon your own opinion and what you want out of a job.."
good,"Everyday was different working at Dollar General. The people there are nice that you work with, but the customers could be very rude. It can sometimes be stressful or overwhelming when the lines get extremely long. Overall, it was a okay job, it wasn't easy but it wasn't hard either. As long as you keep a positive mind, you will be alright. The most enjoyable part of the job though is making customers happy, and being able to actually talk to the other workers. This makes time go by. There were both good and bad days working at Dollar General, but I learn to make the best of it."
good,It is a fast growing company with plenty of opportunity to move up in the company quickly.You get what you put into it. I would recommend anyone to work for the company.
good,"Definitely have to be a hard worker. Organized,  customer friendly.  Employees have alot of work to do but I personally don't think they get paid fairly."
good,It is fun to work here and you keep yourself busy but you don't make enough to pay bills. I don't mind working here but I just don't make enough to pay the bills and take care of children.
good,as a lead sales associate you get to learn the basic requirements for management with out all of the responsibilities of being the store manager. You are able to make store decisions with out the mangers approval and have some responsibilities that are independent of your self.
good,It an ok job if you can't attain a better one at the moment. I was attending college at the time so I just needed a place to carry myself through but I do not see anybody living well on the low pay that they provide.
good,I think I just had a bad experience personally. They weren't very flexible at all for me. The assistant manager was always rude and liked to undermine the new employees.
good,something always went wrong to keep you there for 12 hours. Most people slack in departments requiring people who work hard to work twice as hard keeping everyone there longer.
good,"Dollar General is mainly the only job I have right now and Is a necessity, it is not a job that i love doing all the time because of the environment and mostly the lack of a weekly schedule that is made and ready for all the employees. None of us have a set time that we go in so, most of the time we are texted in or called in because someone else didn't show up to work. It is very aggrivating not knowing when or if I'm going to work the next day or the next week. I do enjoy some aspects of my job such as helping customers and showing them courtesy and friendliness. The hardest part of the job is keeping the store recovered at all times because we never have enough time to do it because of time limit and hours being cut. What i've learned in this job is being patient with customers and knowing what they need when asked. I have learned that the priority is to keep the customer satisfied."
good,"Not great about rewarding the good workers, high turn-over rate. Have to stand for long hours and do the same things over and over again. Also have to do pointless computer training sessions every now and then"
good,"6-8 hours a day, no sitting, 30 minute break, basically stuck on the cash register all day, walking back and forth recovering items from shelves, half the store is yours to clean.  Mondays truck delivery day, restock supplies in a quick period of time while your helping customers, may become a bit of a nuisance without help.  It was a very repetitive job, for most people it wouldn't take long to get the hang out of it. End of the night clean and mop, but overall a job and not the worst job.  The company only benefits people that move up in position, as for cashiers, .25 cents a year no paid vacation, no benefits."
good,The hours were never set the schedule was very inconsistent. Never enough staff for all the work that needed to be done in the store. Managers didn't rotate holidays. Always open on holidays. Never time off to spend with family
good,Enjoyed working with staff and the public. Busy work was comforting - there was always plenty to do. If they offered better pay and offered more hours and benefits I would still be there.
good,I enjoyed my job at the time. My hours were great until the FORMER manager decided she was going to take me off the schedule for 9 weeks with no warning or explanation.
good,Loved it at first until we had a new manager. She was awesome at first then started showing favoritism to other employees. The ones who bust their butt still gets knocked down and the ones who don't do their job gets nothing done to them.
good,I can say this job is for high school students only. Don't go in thinking you can make a career out of it . it's good for if you where looking for a second job maybe
good,"Dollar General is an o.k. place to work, you learn a lot everyday (i.e. planograms, merchandising, stocking, receiving and customer service.  The management is not for the employee, the workplace is o.k.  when the flow is good.  The hardest part of the job was Standing on my feet all day"
good,"Dollar General is more suited to people that have never held a job and just need experience to get a better one. The job itself gives minimum wage, no benefits, and hardly any hours. Great if you have 2 or more jobs and/or have school classes. Not a good job to pay the bills."
good,the job its self was good not enough pay. I did not have a very good manager she was never in the store and she always expected us to get ready for management visitors at the very last minute. she didn't care how bad the store looked. she is no longer working as a manager where I worked at.
good,This place is fair from what I remember from it. I had a simple job to do management was alot better than current job. It's a fairly easy job to do. Pay is about fair for the job.
good,"It was a very simple job, the hours weren't giving me enough pay to make any bills. I loved being a cashier , I just felt as if I wasn't ever going to move forward with any kind of carreer working there."
good,"At the time i worked there the manager was really nice. this was my first job and they were willing to train me on the cash register.i also put stock up, planagrams, and recovered. i think that the most enjoyable part of the day was the morning and seeing the eldler people come in the store. they were always the nice folks."
good,"it was not a bad place to work just working for the wrong management, if the manager could do her part of the work and not have everyone else do it for her and actually showed up to work, it would be better"
good,"Not bad for a starter or entry level job, but you don't really have that much chance for advancement.  The job I am at I am only given about 1 day per week and at the maximum amount about 3 days.  They are very strict with working fast and efficient.  Deadlines are very important.  It's a nice quiet workplace and you always have something to keep you busy in the store."
good,Good company if you like people. Work is hard when deal with stocking and cashiering. Most of the people you meet are friendly. I liked most of the job just sometime closing up store then open the next day was hard.
good,"Helping customers was a great part of this job.. Management was decent  , workplace was diverse, promotions are granted, the hardest part of the job working all holidays"
good,"You would work about a 10 day but at least you did get an hour lunch and the weekend off,Hardest part of job was the continues weekly trucks of stock coming in about a thousand cases per week to get on the floor,once again had a really great group of people to work with"
good,You bust your butt for this company with no appreciation unless from your manager. It's tough unloading trucks stocking shelves waiting on customers keeping store clean all at same time.
good,"A typical work day "
good,A typical day on the job is fairly busy with many customers and a need to stock merchandise. The best part of the job is the other employees. The hardest part of the job is understanding some of the customer.
good,"No quality of life to be had here, you worked 60 + hours a week, and were always being subjected to a new district manager every 6 months because of the high turnover in the .the company was great the upper management DM's and the worst. our store was robbed at gun point and no one called or showed up all they said on the phone was I'm glad they didn't kill you"
good,I was young when I had this job and it was great. did a lot of different tasks and learned new things. made many friends through the costumers and employees. pleasant environment
good,"minuimum wage, hard work, friendly regular customers, staff is good and fun loving. But hours are hard to come by you either have just enough to make 39 hours a week. Or the complete opposite, one week I worked 2 days and had 12 hours."
good,Most customers are a pleasure to interact with and the work is not to bad. The manager is a good person to work for. Fellow co workers are fun to work with.
good,Opened and closed store. Hours were changed every week. I started as a Cashier and became the assistant manager within a few months.The hardest part of the job was communicating with Management. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers and the regular customers.
good,One thing I have learned working with the public is that you make a lot of friends and meet a lot of new people. It is very rewarding for my to be able to help people.
good,I worked at dollar general for 5 years and was never promoted at all I kept getting passed up because my manager liked boys so she moved up the boys and not the females but I am willing to back to work for them if they need help.
good,"Managers play favorites!! Always expect more, more, more with no compensation! Willing to teach you how to do more work and lead you on to believe if you do the extra work you will be rewarded for it, but it never happens!! Checkout registers and credit card machines are always messing up, way out dated! Loved my customers tho"
good,Needs to improve on amount of people working each shift.  Customers were upset when product was not available.   Needs to improve on quality of products.   It is a great place to work .
good,"Management is poor, pay is poor, customers are concerning.They don't pay enough except for the Store Manager position, but that requires you to work like 50-70 hours a week on average. It's a stressful environment that isn't maintained well."
good,As a manager you are a salaried employee and are expected to work anywhere fro 55 to 90 hours per week. Most of the district managers don't do their job which makes it really hard to do yours. there is very little support from upper management and when anything goes wrong its the managers fault.
good,"When I first started here, it was okay. But when I became an Assistant Manager, all that changed. It's a lot of hard work with little compensation. It was very stressful."
good,"Dollar General doesn't allow enough payroll hours to maintain a well stocked and clean atmosphere.  I spent many hours working alone trying to stay within the payroll requirements.  Managers work an average of 55 hours per week, many weeks it was much more which allows for no life outside of the company."
good,Busy place. Either running register or stock shelves  we're cleaning it's not necessarily a hard job is just constantly moving and keeping yourself busy to make the day go by. Although poor management can make it stressful it seems to have gotten better since I left
good,"The employees that I work with are great people. It is a stressful position only due to high turn over rate, but you get that in most retail jobs. We get regular customers that you grow to know and enjoying seeing daily."
good,Dollar general is great place to work . I really enjoy the costumers and I have even grown to love some of my co-workers like family but every job has its ups and downs .
good,"This job is not a long term one unless you can deal with the stress, doesn't matter if you're in management or just an associate the demands of a dollar general are very crazy and if your team is not the best it just makes the store more stressful and harder on a day to day basis. Could get career advancements early on and quickly if you push for it."
good,There is little labor to go around the store so employees must be able to handle a heavy work load and multi-task but it is still manageable to the hard worker.
good,Good place to work at to make decent money for the area. Management is terrible! Dollar general is a self run place. Workers know what needs to be done without management input. 75% of management couldn't do the job if they needed to but I guess that's why they make the big bucks.
good,More paid Holidays and more hours I enjoy my job and I truly feel appreciated with all the positive comments I receive from my customers on a daily basis.
good,"I would come in and the manager didn't have a clue at what to do. On there phones telling cashiers to do all the work. Not being a leader but a follower. The Key Holders and the rest of the crew would have to take up for each other because the manager wouldn't do there job. Would treat the Assistant Manager bad because they would make more money than the manager due to the low salary and hourly pay that the assistant manager was making. The assistant manager would have to come in a lot for people that would call out, which would make them have overtime and make more money. This has always been a conflict. "
good,This place is an okay place to work does not have great pay for starting out especially if you need it store was fairly hard to keep clean and organized but it was an okay place for work
good,"I got to see several customers, I learned how to manage multi-tasking well. Hardest part was trying to stock the shelves while trying to help customers. Most enjoyable part was working with the public."
good,I began working at Dollar General thinking it would be a good place to start a career. After about 6 months I began to realize I was stuck in one place and not going anywhere.
good,Easy job to have but management is not good to work for. They have favoritsim  and make those work on hours that you should always have to. Not treated well with the higher up.
good,"This job hours are few, No benefits or compensation. The management was good and the work environment is friendly. The pay is on a low level.Good for part time job."
good,"I was lucky to have a good staff and store operators to work with while working there. I was able to grow as a person, gained new experience and skills to better myself. You will have awesome customers some you will never forget, and some you wish you would never see again. The hardest part about working a place like that is time management, and dealing with angry customers. If you can manage that you will have no problem working there."
good,"The one I worked at I got promoted pretty quick to key holder that was a plus. But my boss was lazy and horrible. She always trash talked me to the assistant manager and in front of customers. She would make me do all the work including what she was suppose to be doing. My boss would never let me off and always called me in on my days off."
good,dollar general was an okay place to work for someone fresh out of highschool or still in highschool no good growth opportunities though always felt overworked and underpaid
good,"needs improvement, more pay, needs improve job site, everything can always be improved upon. great employees, store operational hours are great. need more holidays."
good,"A typical day at work consisted mainly of customer service. I learned a lot about cash drops and deposits, management was different as the store went some time with no management structure. The hardest part of the job would have been stepping up to management duties until one was assigned to the store, the most enjoyable moment would be helping others."
good,"Recently our general manager was transferred and replaced. I feel as though her replacement has taken on more than what she was truly prepared for. The new general manager most certainly has the best interest of the business at heart but in the same manor fails to tend to the needs of her employees. As a third key i have been there a little less than a year and am the senior most customer service employee including the GM herself. By not listening to the employees and there needs she has had several people quit without notice, thus hindering her from accomplishing tasks in the store itself."
good,"Fast paced at times, slow at times, customer service a plus within a company like this. Would have been nice if upper management acknowledged the store employees also, not just the store manager."
good,Great Benefits. They really show concern with your needs and wants. You have a great chance at learning different positions in different areas. Overall a good Job.
good,"Pay was not enough for the jobs we were doing"
good,"the job is like any other that has its pros and cons but for the most part there is always work, and that allows the time to pass by quick. the hours are not that good because i prefer a 8-5 job."
good,For me this company was not so great. However different people have different opinions. Don't let my outcome make your decision for you. There are different stores and different managers. I just happened to be in the wrong store at the wrong time.
good,Dollar General is a job!!!!! The best thing is that  some of the other store managers are willing to help as much as possible because they understand the pace and stress that comes with the job.
good,I  a lot has changed in that store sense I worked there. But when I did things kinda happened day by day some of them would be great others kinda chaotic.
good,"Corporate culture regarding investment into employees was a big turn off to me. Training, Payroll support for stores to have a neat, clean operating store needs to improve."
good,"a typical day is constantly ringing customers, recovering the store, i learned to deal with customers more, management not so good. not a very organized work environment."
good,I loved my job and the district manager but the managers over the store no. They showed favortisim in others and made the schedule based on what they wanted to work. Loved my job just not some of the people
good,"you just go in and start working from the cash register to stocking shelves, cleaning or mopping the floor and helping customer to find what they are looking for."
good,"I like working at Dollar General, im just looking for a job where i can make more money and have better benifits. I feel like i have went as for as i could working for Dollar General."
good,"Very friendly employees and very helpful,also a very clean environment,customers are treated as friends or family.Holidays are the worst part of the year for the store, very busy but still managed to get the work done that needed to be done."
good,A great job for students out of or in high school. You learn alot about retail and the in and out of sales. Easy to move up so long as you do your job.
good,"It's more of a highschool gossip setting, than a professional workplace. Each keyholder tries to tell you how to do something a different way, always confusing the cashiers and other key holders. There is way too many lies and unttrustworthy employees"
good,"It is very easy to move up in the company. I have been working for this company for less than 3 years and I am already the Assistant Store Manger of my location. Definitely not a career job unless you are coming in as top management. Even the store managers don't get great compensation. The pay is poor but you are not doing very much for the money unless you are a manager, The managers do not get paid enough for all that we have to do. Not a TERRIBLE company though. BUT I definitely not plan on making that 3 year mark. Also managers have to work on their break because there is usually on 2 people working in the store at a time. I hate that. Cooperate is just unacceptable."
good,"I loved working at Dollar General. The only reason I had to leave was because I was only recieving 5 hours a week. You constantly meet new people, and even have regular customers. The shift hours are great, especially for someone that has problems being on their feet like me. One of my favorite jobs."
good,"Fast paced work environment, learned how to use a cash register, time manage and many other useful tools necessary for future jobs. Management changed a few times with my time working with the company and each one was hard to grasp at first but once they were it was an enjoyable experience."
good,Only Issue I ever had with this place was the manager would schedule me knowing I worked my other job the night before and didn't get off tell 6am. I worked 12 hour shifts at my other job and the manager was well aware of my schedule there.
good,"It was a nice place to work.  I just had a bad manager. I'm sure other Dollar General's would be Great to work for.  Always busy, so the day goes by quickly"
good,"The company exercises poor business judgement. In seeking to be a low cost operator, they have cut in the wrong areas, making the job a very unhealthy situation on many of its managers and hourly workers.  To increase one's profit and success, you must also increase the payroll and manpower needed to keep up."
good,"It was a positive work environment. The manager was very involved and engaged with his employees. Dollar General is a easy place to advance. Unfortunately, they don't pay very well, nor offer many benefits."
good,It was too slow of a job for me. I prefer a fast paced job that challenges me. My co-workers were nice and friendly. I just felt like I was not being utilized
good,I have learned geeat social skills wile working for dollar general   I just think its time for a change really 7.25 a hour can not pay the bills and i been there 3 years
good,"Needs to improve security for better safe working environment. Other than that, its a good place for people that's in school to go to. Not recommended for people to look for full time jobs."
good,"Structured computer based learning"
good,"A typical day normally went good not many complication. I learned how to handle upset customers, and facing products. Some management is good others are not as good. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part was stocking for me."
good,"Customer service, hours are hard to work with schedule and wages is not enough to provide for my family. I learned I can take on more responsibilities and still be able to keep a happy work environment"
good,"The job wasn't hard, just very unorganized. You were expected to stock shelves when you were in the store alone, but customers had no way of letting you know that they were ready to check out at the register, so they would have to hunt you down in the store to get help."
good,"Working with the public is always a struggle, but I've enjoyed working here and getting to know our ""regulars"", as well as learning all the duties and responsibilities associated with this position. "
good,"They do not pay enough, do not provide enough hours, and do not appreciate the good employees that they have and have had. It was the easiest job, but the toughest psychologically."
good,Dollar General can be a fun and diverse place to work. The job can often times be challenging but rewarding at the same time.  People skills are a must have as well as problem solving ability.
good,The only saving graces of working here was that I liked my coworkers and got a lot of hours. I don't believe the company cares much for its employees at all. A lot of customers are rude as well.
good,"A typical day here was cashiering and stocking shelved along with cleaning the store. I didn't learn much about retail other than I already had known. The management wasn't the best here, but that problem had gotten fixed by corporate. The place was laid back, and not too busy, or stressful. The hardest part was not getting a lot of hours and being paid little comparatively. I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. The hard part was one day after I had started, I suffered a heart attack, and when I tried to come back a couple of weeks later, I had been replaced and had to find a place in another store."
good,As previously stated it is normal and average as it gets. I don't think that it was as terrible a job that it can be said to be. However it was also a cutthroat job. Your job is based on basket size and your cash register. If it is so much as a few cents off when you count at the end of thw night you get marked a thief.
good,The job wasn't bad but the management sucked. I was only getting 9-16 hours a week making $7.25. Maybe it wouldn't have been bad if I had more hours and the workplace was neater.
good,"I was very fortunate to work at a store that was very well maintained and in good shape. Management was great and I loved my coworkers. I also liked stocking and recovery. However as time went on it started to become very tedious and, coupled with a rather unpredictable schedule, made it less fun to work. I also wasn't too crazy with the customers, most asked for way too much and were very shady in nature. In all I enjoyed how I learned a lot given it was my first retail job, but it lost it's luster fast."
good,dollar general is alright. not too bad and not too good. if you need a part time job or a job in general dollar general is an alright option to work while you look for other jobs.
good,"A typical day consisted of stocking shelves as well as sky shelves. I learned how to do those such things there. My manager that I was hired under was good, however the manager that took over was not. She typically called customers annoying on a daily basis and always talked about them in a negative manner behind their backs."
good,The store I worked in was in a small town. All the employees were friendly. Manager was awesome. Loved this job. Only reason I left is because of  a family emergency.
good,"Dollar General is not a good company to work for. A typical day at work is checking customers out, recovery, and working on totes when truck comes in. The hardest part of the job is when other employees do not do their job. I like working there because I can do my work and not bother anyone. I love the job because I like being around people."
good,"A typical day at work for me would consist of either opening or closing the store, stocking, setting ads for new sales ,being back-up for my cashier and performing regular manager duties. The hardest part of the job is the late nights due to the location and the time the store closes."
good,"Typical days at Dollar General are pretty slow. You'll do a lot of recovery, stocking encompasses your entire shift usually and it's a good place to learn that you can't please everyone. You've just gotta be courteous and continue to be a calm, collected associate who's willing to help and has a consistent motor."
good,"Working at Dollar General was not a overall bad job. I learned a lot working their as far as being a supervisor. the days were pretty smooth. As a lead i handled money in the safe, counting it every night and getting money for my co workers cash register. I also would have to do a little data entry at the end of the night to make sure everything was how it was suppose to be and the counts were not off. The hardest part of my job was dealing with shoplifters. in today's world you never know what someone is capable of when you approach them for stealing. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing happy customers come in daily leaving with smiles on their faces. I had a lot of good days working their..the only time things would be a bit difficult is when you have other co workers not really wanting to be at work."
good,"I got pregnant with my first child while working at Dollar General, I was let go due to not being ""able"" to perform work duties. They were not supportive."
good,"Good place to work. But have to be on your toes"
good,They're always taking away hours but expect 2 people to get the same amount of work done in a very short time. Most management tries very hard to help get it done.
good,"I managed all employees on my specific shifts and assisted the store manager in daily operational duties. I really didn't find any part of the job difficult ,"
good,Pleasant place to work. Co-workers are fun and all get along well.I have learned a lot about retail. Now have very strong customer service skills. Stock shelves  but the main part is making the customer happy.
good,"it was a very annoying place to work I diddnt like the long drawn out hours and mpr did I like the way we were treated I liked the weekly pay I learned how to deal with other people ,different attitudes and I enjoyed being around others as well as being in a leadership position."
good,I had a blast working here until a certain manager came in and started to call me uncalled for names and telling me to do what the crew the night before should have done when I was opening the store.
good,"Didn't like the new store manager. He was rude, accused all customers of stealing. Didn't work very hard at all. Had set schedule but refused to work with the rest of the staff on their schedules."
good,"I feel Dollar General would really be a great company to work for if only they could find the right people to manage the stores. Their turnover rate in district manager position is high. No one is capable, I feel somewhere, someone is lying about their work experiences. I would love to be a wonderful employee for Dollar "
good,"I basically just run the register at dollar general, the company keeps cutting hours so currently I don't work very many hours."
good,I'm a manager at this company my job duties customer service unloading and stocking shelves make the store is safe and clean environmental place for customer and also staff
good,I liked working here as far as the decent public guests were concerned. However this place was frequented by a lot of unsavory characters and basically was not a safe environment.
good,"Management may be friendly on some days, and horrible on others, not much room to advance, a lot of gossip and drama on a daily basis. Not very organized at all. Most enjoyable part of the job is when i get to interact with the customers."
good,"A typical day at dollar general starts with a boatload of work that includes constant over stock, conditioning, truck drops, cleaning . All of which have been pushed back do to priorities taking over priorities. It ends with the knowledge of there only being more coming in through the back than there is leaving the front.This job has taught me that staff is important and that without a sufficient amount of people working daily you will quickly become overwhelmed unless you can find work-arounds or solutions. The store held a capable manager who didn't have the manpower to support the actual needs of the store. However, the DMs do next to nothing in terms of trying to help stores succeed, often shifting the blame on lower management for things we have no control over. My coworkers (4 in total, including the store manager) who did work there were lovely people and great work with. However, most (not including me and the SM) were incapable of pulling of tougher jobs liking unloading, stocking heavy objects, or even helping customers with grabbing things from greater heights. This essentially led to what is the hardest part about the job, having very little support. This ranged from minor things such as cleaning stock or conditioning but got as serious as not being able to have the store open till close because no one was scheduled to work it. Despite the workload and harsh dealings, my work life is nothing short of enjoyable from my standpoint. You're never sitting and you're always helping customers that are lovely and associates who care. The environment isn't for everyone but"
good,"It is not a full time permanent job nor was the owner willing to give me more hours, which I required. It is a small town store that is friendly and helpful. Coworkers were friendly and helpful."
good,Loved the customers and workplace. Did't agree with some of policies. Didn't feel I was compensated for work and time spent at store.Worked up to 14 hours daily .Spent more time there than at home with family.Very challenging.
good,Dollar General helped to give me experience in stocking and working with other team members. Overall. My work experience at Dollar General was rewarding.
good,it was a nice place to work but the management wasn't really great. the hours given wasn't really much. made some friends at work and the daily job was hard but was worth working.
good,"Dollar General cares about their Dollar and not the employees. Many of days and nights we are scheduled being solo in the store to keep with-in their budget hours, despite having lines a mile long with customers. And they still expect everything to be done. The pay is very low, being one of the lowest paid employees in the US according to Indeed national survey."
good,Lack of any real training. If you can't figure things out for yourself then you might not want to work here. Management can be hit or miss especiall when it becomes a revolving door of managers.
good,"I have learned that if a store has a good manager and fairly competent staff it is most definitely a decent job to have however, if a store lacks these things you and the rest of the staff who try to make the work place a clean and functional environment will not succeed."
good,"It's not all that bad.  you have to be able to pull some weight. . Be strong & independent. "
good,work is hard but the customers are great. money handling on a daily basis as well as customer service skills. Have to train new employees when they start work.
good,I really enjoyed the costumers and the work setting. Unfortunately i worked under a manager who i clashed with. If it was for that i could absolutely see myself staying with the company for a long time.
good,"About what you would expect in a retail environment. Management wasn't too bad, coworkers were generally good. Only major complaint was low wages, otherwise could've been worse."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my job with Dollar General, but the pay was low with only .25 increase per year so I resigned. If Dollar General increased the pay wage I believe it would be a great company to work for."
good,"Working the cash register, putting out stock, and helping customers.  How to communicate with customers.  I had great co-workers"
good,"I was hired as an asst manager, my duties included opening and closing the store various stocking projects, price changes, returns, and loss prevention."
good,"Pay isn't very good."
good,"It's a job and it pays the bills kinda. The schedule so post at last minute.  It's posted Friday and it starts Saturday . They have no maternity leave pay or benefits,"
good,Your typical day is very stressful. Never enough labor and so much work to do you have difficulty getting it all done. Hiring is always a challenge as the company is a low pay employer.
good,"tend cash register"
good,"Did not enjoy working there. They care more about the moneyI they can make, then the employees that make that make that money for them. They also don't allow employees time for customers, you need customer service to keep and to recieve more cutomers"
good,It's fun at times and others it's not. You really have to do your share in order for it to be a fun workplace and for everyone to get along if not then you really won't like the job. You also have to be able to deal with any kind of customer because you get all kinds.
good,"In my short amount of time, the best part of my job was, without a doubt, the customers were the reason I enjoyed my job. Providing the customers with the help they needed to locate the products they were looking for as well as helping to resolve issues with payments in a calm, friendly manner, always making sure that they were made comfortable, and never alienated. My typical day at work would be to count my till before shift started, making sure that the correct amount was there to start my shift with; from there I would work between the register and making sure that the shelves were recovered and stocked. From this job I learned how to work under pressure and to make sure that I did my best to keep my attitude friendly, no matter how difficult or stressful the situation. My co-workers were of various ages, so it was a breath of fresh air to work with a variety of people from different backgrounds. The hardest part of my job was that I was away from home most of the week and I had to work every weekend, as I was the only full time lead associate. The most enjoyable part of my job......the customers."
good,I loved the job. I learned how to work with others . I learn alot of different things . I learned how to work a cash register. Iwwt alot of different people. Some good some not so good ..
good,I think my biggest problem with DG is they don't treat the employees correctly I was told I wasn't fast enough to be a asst manager but I was good enough to be lead sales associate go figure
good,"I enjoyed working here, I learned how to count inventory, end of day sales reports, banks drops and much more. I assisted in unloading inventory as well stocking/receiving."
good,"There is very little advancement available.  This company's expectations are unrealistic.  On a typical day, you are tasked with an enormous amount of work to do while attempting to be the cashier as well.  A minimal cost of living raise is awarded on the anniversary of your hire date.  Raises are never awarded based on merit.  This company also frowns on employees working more than one job however the salary is not enough to make a living and the only employees to work full time are the managers."
good,"*Come in at 5:30 a.m. to stock."
good,The place was great to work in but between the management and the employees it was very disorganized there was no respect between management and employees. The security was bad people would steal constant and nothing was being done even when reported to management. The best part of the job was getting to know the customers of different cultures and helping them.
good,"While the coworkers are fun to talk to and easy to get along with, the schedule never gets done until the day before the next week starts. At times it can be disorganized but mostly it's a clean and safe environment to work. The biggest downside is that there are no benefits for part-time workers. There's other things I could say but I don't think it's really necessary."
good,not  a part of dishonesty and wages not compatible .had to quit was making me physical and mental ill . they need to increase pay very low wages
good,The dollar general is not an easy job. You must work hard and try to achieve the goals given to you. With the right co workers and the right state of mind the dollar general is a promising place to work.
good,great co workers   A typical day is trying to meet store Quality standards while serving customers with great customer service was trying because they expected alot.
good,As I tell everyone unless your ready to dedicate your life you dollar general don't take the job.Dollar General is a great first start for someone as young as I was but they really don't care about their employees health or their time with there familys.
good,"Overall ok company to work for. Hard to met your weekly goal. Based Off Science. Work 4 10 Hour shifts. Good pay, hard work"
good,"Dollar General wasn't my idea of compliant work ethic. The job was very demanding and stress-full. However, customers always seemed appreciative and understanding."
good,A typical day is coming to clock in and go right into working. It was my first job I learn how to deal with customers question and handling money. The management was okay . My co-workers were great and I became friends with a few. My co-workers were the ones that made working their much fun that it has ever been. The hardest part of the job is was nothing I actually caught on to everything very fast. The most part is that enough hours were giving and people have to work harder to get enough hours to survive.
good,"Over all it was a nice place to work. The management team at the time was inadequate to say the least the store was so filthy and they didn't want cleaning the store and store front as part of a daily requirement, it made the employees very lazy and they didn't like me very much as a manager because i made them clean,stock and fix the overall store."
good,"I enjoyed working there, but it wasn't a safe environment. I loved my co-workers, everyone got along very well. The most enjoyable part of my job was communicating with regular customers every day, and seeing smiles on their faces. I loved stocking and doing my daily activities every day."
good,Fast paced and hectic. often unorganized. Co-workers are great. Management seems to play favorites. Does NOT pay a wage that is worth the stress that comes with a heavy workload. Needs to offer more to their employees.
good,"They just don't care. Its so easy to tell the company only cares about their money and making a profit. Repack is a joke. Always rude coworkers, always on top of one another, constantly getting written up for an unrealistic rate number, etc... I felt like I was going nowhere with them, and it mentally and physically drained me. it made me physically sick to even think about coming into work sometimes because of how awful days could be"
good,good for people just starting their job experience. very laid back and easy going. get alot of the same customers so you get to know them very well
good,"work 10 to 14 hrs a day 6 days a week."
good,"Not enough pay for what is expected of their workers"
good,"Answer customers' questions about merchandise and advise customers on merchandise selection"
good,I enjoyed waiting on customers and being a part of the team.Some of the co- workers were great and others were not. The District manager at the time in Elmira was to easy on the manager. The hardest part of the job was when i did most of the work for the manager not getting noticed for it. In south Carolina i was noticed for my hard work. The manager there was very kind.
good,"4 Day Work Week"
good,"I was the lead sales associate/ key carrier. I opened or closed the store, counted cashier draws and stocked. I learned how to direct and lead a team. With my experience, I was able to get an assistant manager job at another retailer. Management was fair towards me cause I worked hard, minded my business and never caused any problems. Some Co-workers were cool, others complained way too much. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people and having to stay calm in certain situations. But the best part was building relationships with the frequent customers."
good,"Pay good work is very hard as a manager you do more work than your employees,you have to be a hands on manager not the clip board manager."
good,"Retail in general is interesting. The relationships you make with the customers and fellow employees is well worth the hours you put in to the constant battle of picking up items and finding where they go, front facing and making the customers experience in the store a good one."
good,"The Dollar General located at E. 51st & Superior Ave in Cleveland, Ohio was a very fun place to work. Co-workers & Store Managers, including Assistant Managers were very friendly and helpful."
good,"Meet a lot of great people. Learn how to multitask. Job itself is not bad, but corporate expects way too much from the individuals that work in the stores. They need to be more competitive with their pay for hourly employees to keep more loyal associates. Overall, it's an ok place to work temporarily."
good,"Working for DG can be very challenging at times with the work load and expectations. Co-workers are good, and have learned a great amount."
good,"Fast paced work environment since the company has over 12,000 stores.  Good company to work for.  Company does a bunch for adult literacy."
good,"managing two to three people a shift, cleaning, stocking, providing customer service, handling credit card and cash transactions, and closing the store with deposit at the end of the night"
good,I have only worked at this business for a short time but I have gotten to know the customers and other associates well enough to call them friends.
good,Work a lot of hours with horrible pay.  There is no flexibility and management are just as clueless as the average employee.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is usually very busy, I am constantly moving whether I am stocking, recovering, assisting customers on the sales floor, or operating the cash register. Working at Dollar General I have learned to have patience and to work diligently no matter what the task may be. I have a wonderful and trusting relationship with my manager as well as my co-workers, I am very easy to get along and work with. The hardest part of my job would be having to assist angry customers or defusing situations that occur with the customers. In conclusion I think the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing satisfied customers that I have had a part in helping."
good,"While the pay is garbage for the amount of work you put in, the staff and management were always friendly, and helpful. The company itself doesn't seem to value it's employees very much."
good,Store manager and below are good people Lost prevention manager power went to head. Easy going job can be frustrating at time sense pay is so low.
good,the job was decent. The policies were good. you worked hard you advanced. But sadly the managers were not appreciative if you came into their store and made them look bad. i improved the stores sales. but because the store managers felt threaten they would do anything to make you look bad.
good,This is a fast paced retailer. Customers were greaat but the employees had poor work ethics and tried to step on toes to climb the ladder. Company expected too much for the pay. 60+ hours per week
good,"Worked a lot and a few times the state made me go home early because of overtime and legal reasons.  Dg pushes the state laws are far as it can, so watch out for that.  If you are used to an easy job because the corporate office is out of California your gonna have a hard to transferring to other states and so forth."
good,"It isnt a place to truly begin a career. i would say it is a place for high school students to work part time. Sure, if you are in management then you might get somewhere, but it isnt something that gives enough pay to make it a career. However,  I loved my coworkers and it was a fun place to work"
good,"Good part time job, doesnt pay much for what they expect you to do. Fun to meet customers and nice co workers. You can move up in a position fast but still not very good pay"
good,"The customers were usually great and really fun to help them out and make sure they leave happy, The job itself was incredible but the upper management drove their managers into the ground.  Typically I work 60-80 hours a week, and they expected more hours than that.  Wake up, go to work, go home, go to bed, repeat.  If you have family that you care about don't work here.  You won't be seeing them again."
good,As far as retail goes dollar general is very customer oriented and truly cares about the people who come into the store. The manager worked around everyone's schedule and was fair to everyone.
good,"Stocked items 90% of the time and cleaned the parking lot of all the trash the other 10%. Didn't get many hours and the pay was minimum wage, but we all must start somewhere, right? Other than that, the customers seemed to be really friendly."
good,"I began work for Dollar General under the assumption that I would get around 21 hours a week. For a first job, this sounded perfect. Instead of that I ended up working nearly 80 with no overtime. I was worked everyday. Every time I was told to take the next day off and relax I would get a call around 12 p.m asking me to work there or another store. I understand that they needed help, but why would none of the other 20 employees go and help out? Then when school started back they refused to schedule me around my school and I left."
good,"The job itself was great. Some of the management team, even above the store level were just unbelievable. Though most of the time we were like a family."
good,"A typical day at work dealing with rude customers while trying to balance running the register and stocking shelves. I've learned make sure you go at a slow pace with each task to make sure everything is right. Management is poor, don't inform employees much about nothing. Co-workers were nice always worked as a team. The hardest thing about the job was performing many tasks in less than a five hour shift and it has to be completed by the end of the shift. The most enjoyable thing about the job was meeting new people."
good,This company is a fast paced production oriented compant. Its sole purpose is to make sure merdanise is handled with care and is out in a timely order.
good,"Worked part-time while in high school. Never would give me very many hours, always hiring new people and cutting my hours, then they would quit and I would get more hours until more people were hired."
good,"Typical work day consist of regular customers, fun atmosphere, stocking shelves, ringing and scanning item. Cleaning the store up for the next shift."
good,Good employer and work scheduling. This employer can provide a person that requires it an opportunity to gain great management experience.
good,Dollar General is OK for a college kid trying to make a little bit of money and start out in the working field while in school. However I wouldn't advise working for them long-term
good,"Not as easy with the the lack of security. More dangerous than it should be, no mater the position. Wouldn't recommend the job to my worst enemy."
good,"Exciting everyday, meet new people and work with a diverse group I would highly recommend this job for experience in retail to start off."
good,Dollar General is a good first job for anyone. It will teach you the basic of working with a company and when dealing with customer services. But be prepared to work and be on your feet.
good,a lot of work is required with this company. Nothing else should be required to answer for this company out of the respect for the employer.
good,Work Life Balance can be an issue with this company.  Pay is a bit on the low side.  You will likely spend several hours working by yourself on many days.
good,these are the most disorganized company and most of them are dirty and messy and for most of the store you cant even get threw them in a safe manor there always cluttered and are unfair to most of the employees I would never recommend  them for employment
good,"Everyday I would start my day off by stretching before heading off to work. Then I would be responsible for inbound shipments to receive in a correct and fast paced manner. "
good,Was suppose to be just part time but would be scheduled full time and over time.  Was told I need to work those hours or leave.
good,It is an alright job.  It is the same as any retail job.  I make money.  The hours I get are alright. The pay is not good.  You do not get compensated fairly.
good,"I am assigned as primary cashier throughout the day."
good,"•	Greet customers as they enter the store.  Unloaded & stocked products as they came into the store every week."
good,"hard work"
good,"A typical work day is a delicate balancing act between ringing up customers and stocking shelves constantly through out your shift. I learned new skills related to inventory controls, weekly advertisement set-up and take down procedures. Managers take a very active roll in keeping the store clean, well stocked, and ready for business. The retention level is very high, so you will have an opportunity to meet many, many short term co-workers as they come and go. The hardest part of my job was rationalizing valid reasons to stay on just about a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job was the friendliness of my regular customers and being able to interact with them so frequently. I truly miss that."
good,"the company was alright to work for pretty flexible scheduling, however, it was repetitive work and customer service was not a big deal to the company when I worked there, at least not where I worked at. good job if you just wanting part time work"
good,"Making sure all merchandise  was   properly checked out  at the cash register "
good,Hardest part of the job is the physical portion. You never know how long your working until you walk in. Co-workers are not friendly.
good,A place that expects hard work and helping people and the health care needs to improve. A great place to work and concern about the community.
good,Its an ok place to work if you are just getting out of highschool but for a high paying job and to pay bills not so much. The staff are great but the corporate management can use a little work.
good,"The job was easy, stocking the store, keeping customers happy, interviewing, hiring and training new employees are all things I can do without effort.  The company is growing, improving and since I left has fixed the budget issue by replacing upper management. The hardest part of the job was being given so very little money to work with weekly to pay employees, then to be expected to work yourself 96 +/- hours per week to make up for the lack of employee payroll. I did enjoy the ""family"" mentality of the employees I had, their willingness to work more hours whenever they are available. I did not enjoy working open to close 3 - 4 days a week but just being a manager of a retail store would be great with a reasonable schedule, I wish my most recent experience with retail had been a more normal one."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Dollar General, i loved my coworkers and i love all the customers i helped on a daily bases. Just needed lots of improvement on wages, promotions, and management."
good,"A typical day at work is cashiering and doing totes. I actually learned how to have patients cause dealing with those customers are not easy. I have a nice , kindhearted manager. My co-workers are easy to get along with. There is no hard part about the job , and there is no enjoyable part of the job except going home."
good,"Scan some items, count back change, constantly berated by other cashiers, Going to work everyday was the hardest part, Leaving was most enjoyable, Co-workers poked fun at those on food stamps."
good,"From my experience with DG, I wasn't valued for my opinions. I tried to go though the proper chain of command, but nothing was ever done about any of the issues. It wasn't a one-time thing, it was all the time. It truly seems as though the opinions of the employees didn't matter. DG does not hold true to their values. I will say that the money is the only good part of working there."
good,"A typical day at work:  I go into work and get a till if I am to be on the register or as a backup person on register. For me as an Assistant Mgr. I would be supervising the cashier and overseeing any tasks that needed to be done that day.  Most of the time I would be stocking the shelves with the merchandise we had in the receiving room. Some days I would have to set a new mag; which is setting the endcaps to a new display, or maybe having to do a new planogram; redoing a whole section because we have new products and discontinuing others. Almost everyday we have vendors coming in and I would check the merchandise coming in and going out. I learned a lot about managing a store and what it takes to get the job done. Receiving a truck of rolltainers of merchandise and getting it out on the floor in a timely manner, and working with all the employees. I worked well with all my co-workers, each brought there own personality to the job. The hardest part of my job was firing someone. The most enjoyable was all the customers I had met and some became friends. It was nice when a customer came in and was glad to see you."
good,"This is a typical retail job with where you spend the day waiting on customers, stocking items and maintaining store appearances. The best part of the job was meeting some of the most interesting people, such as customers and your coworkers. However shifts were all over the place and schedule can change at a moments  notice."
good,"I work off a conveyor belt where I will take all the cases that contain all the product for the stores and sort them into different RTs depending on the number (1-6) on the label, 1 being food, 3 being chemicals, ext. I learned just how much work I am capable of doing. It is a very demanding job with very random work loads throughout the work week. The management at Dollar General isn't the best management I've worked for. They like to promote people who have family in the company despite the individuals personal work performance. If you're a hard worker and do your job to the best of your ability they will give you the harder and more demanding workload. By seeing your co-workers everyday and being together in your department you really get to know everyone individually. I personally don't care much for the lazy people that don't care about doing a good job and meeting all their job requirements. The hardest part of the job would having a larger workload without any help while they turn up the speed of belts to try to get the work done all soon as they can. If i had to choose one good thing to say about Dollar General Distribution it would have to be they have great pay and great benefits. Despite how demanding the job is, you will get use to it and once you do you will find yourself spending a long time with the company."
good,I was placed in a store in a rough part of town with limited staff and sometimes I was the only one in the store. NOT SAFE there was no support from upper management
good,"Typical days work would be running register, recover aisles making the store look good for our customers, Sundays is our truck day so putting out stock for two days to then over stock. Enjoyable part of my day is the customers they are like family especially the regulars. Hardest part of my day depends on if someone else slack is being taken care of."
good,Left this job due to a personal conflict with my employer.  The schedule would keep changing making it difficult to have a home life.
good,I was a cashier and stocker. I would Stock the shelves when there was no customers and when there was I would wait on customers it was an easy job.
good,Dollar General is a good job but they do not pay well in any position. You will work long hours because they will not allow the stores the hours they need to run the stores properly. It is very easy to get burned out here.
good,"Responsibilities include stocking products, working the cash register, and basic cleaning duties. Sales associates will learn valuable conflict resolution and cash handling skills. Management, at least in small towns, can be a bit unprofessional, but is always friendly and eager to help. Co-workers are generally kind, though often too personal. Stocking days are, quite frankly, the best part of the job. There is something calming about learning the layout of the store and the repetition involved in placing products where they belong. The worst part is the hours; mainly, that so few are available. In smaller stores, management may only need two or three employees on the floor on most days. As a result, part-time employees are often scheduled for no more than fifteen hours per week, while full-time employees are working the maximum number of hours allowed. In other words, employees are either under-worked or overworked, with no happy medium to be found."
good,"I was a 3rd Key Management worker who supervised employees, opened/closed store, ran cash register, balanced till money and deposited them in the bank.  I also helped unload trucks, stocked shelves with merchandise, watched potential and real shoplifters, "
good,easy job alot of rude and bothersome customers hard to move up in the company. you dont have to be full time to get health insurance 401k plan
good,"a typical day at work was fun, meeting new people and gaining new customers who came in the store quite frequently. I learned that customer service is the main key. Management needed to be improved that's why I decided to resign. My co workers were nice and very helpful we all worked as a team."
good,"Starting there I was hired under a different store manager."
good,Unload totes or rolltainers of freight. Then go to cashiering for the rest of day. High paced customer service. Merchandising and resets of hard and soft goods.
good,"Greets customers, promotes company products, and sells them to the customer. Responsible for handling payment, and thanking customers. Communicate with customers, teammates, and managers in a respectful manner.  Solve customer queries or concerns        related to the products that they purchase. Ensure customers satisfaction and safety at store."
good,"There is usually one cashier at a time which is what you need for the majority of your shift, but when it gets busy is when it gets really stressful on that one cashier.I had to learn to be productive and how to multitask. The management wasn't the greatest in the few months I was there they had 4 different managers at this location.The last one was the reason I left. Other than the managers my coworkers were great and helped with anything they could. The hardest part would be the stress of trying to multitask and get your ""duties"" done on time. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the customers they aren't all bad and most of them make your day better."
good,"I have learned so much from my job experiences like good and proper customer service, stocking, inventory control, merchandise review, patience, work with others, team player, great organizer..."
good,"There is never a single down moment at Dollar General. Everyone, from the store manager down to the cashiers, is multitasking from the time they walk in the door. You will find out a lot about yourself working here. It's not for the weak-willed."
good,waiting on customers and putting stock away cleaning making sure everything was done the right way showed others how things was to be done the boss was great
good,"This was my very first retail employer. I enjoyed the experience and the knowledge I gained. How to handle money, on hand experience with customers, re-pricing, and restocking items. I was expecting so I didn't get to stay as long as I would have wanted to. I enjoyed the time there but there weren't any benefits, nor room for much of a promotion."
good,"A typical day would be going in to work setting merchandise up and/or taking it down. Running register when a lunch needs to be covered. I will check in vendors being Pepsi, Coke, Bimbo, Berkely, or any other vendor"
good,"Typical day multi-tasking from the time you come in to the time you leave.  Things not completely explains or training not always completed before you start something new. Busy with register, stocking, sign changes, and customers."
good,This company is focus on team work projects. There's no employee discount program.
good,A typical day would be working the cash register and assisting customers.  I learned what it felt like to be on the other side of retail.  I had ok co-workers.  The hardest part of my job would be having to stand for long periods of time.
good,At first it was a great place to work but then management changed and it all went down hill.
good,There are only seven total employees most of the time and many customers come in daily. I was able to build great relationships with everyone. As I moved up the manager taught me so much. this made me want to continue to learn and make my way up the latter so I can someday make a real difference in the lives of co-workers and customers.
good,"cashiering, stocking, greeting customers, cleaning, doing truck"
good,I loved my management team. They were thoughtful and wonderful people. All have sense left the company. I learned how to create planograms and work side by side with nice people. The company does not give compensate its employees good enough for the work that the managers do.
good,A day at Dollar General can vary in both directions. If you have good co-workers that do there part work is never to much for anybody. But if you have employees that don't work and sit around all day the work they don't do you have to do plus the work for your shift. the most enjoyable part of the day is interacting with customers as you check them out.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Dollar General outside of manager. Hours are generally flexible and pay is good.
good,I was hired as a key holder. The manager that hired me left me the first day I started by myself. I had no idea what I was doing. A customer came in for a return I had not been trained on what to do. I had to wait for the manager to call me back because he was playing golf. When this manager left we got another manager who was very condescending. The assistant manager ran the store for two months after the first manager left. There was no guidance from him either. The district manager was crude and rude. It just depends on what store you are working out. A terrible experience at times. Just no real training and treated like you are suppose to know what to do.
good,Pretty good job to work for while I was on summer break from college.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General Is very unpredictable.I learned to most definitely ""leave my feelings at the door!"" Management taught me that you can never give up.You must have integrity and make it look easy no matter what. My co-workers stuck together. We picked up each others slack to get the job done. The hardest part of this job was dealing with 40 different personalities(5% positive) and dishonesty daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was recommendation and promotions."
good,"Enough said, unfair decisions in the corporate part.................maybe they should put people in their shoes and walk a mile and see how they feel."
good,"Here I started off as just a Sales Associate and worked my way up to Key Holder position. Which gave me the experience of having some control, but unfortunately it came with lesser hours due to the number of key holders."
good,I learned a lot at Dollar General. To doing Deposits and handling money and the safe. Also to doing plantograms etc.  I also learned how to be a wonderful manager and get our store customer ready. The hardest part of the job would be to get the other part-time managers to do their part of the work. The most enjoyable part is working with the people that like to work and obey and follow the rules. We actually can get stuff done. Depending on which dollar general you work at depends on how the management is. I know I am a good manager and one of the hardest working managers at my store. If they know you are a hard worker  they will try to use you and abuse you.
good,"A typical day at work was somewhat tedious at times.  However, the interaction with people was rewarding in knowing that you helped someone today, whether it be making them smile, or finding something they were looking for."
good,Store Manager for difficult store settings in three separate states.
good,"cashiered and assisted with customer service"
good,NEVER enough hours nor employees to properly maintain the store at 100% shopablity.
good,"Worked open to close nearly everyday to ensure coverage, payroll  hours for store associates was not equivalent to sales volume. invested more time in 80% physical actions of the store verses the ability to properly balance one's day. Upon accepting the role of Store Manager in Peckville, I found multiple acts of internal theft. spent more valuable time terminating cashiers for till theft, taking merchandise out back door during smoke breaks. Managed two stores in a seven day work week without relief by District Manager. lost two District managers to attrition in 12 month's. Conducted 3 or more visits with Regional Manager on a monthly basis to discuss progress replenishing terminated associates for theft/prosecution ."
good,"I look at every job as a blessing. A typical day at work was very busy, at times chaotic. Nonetheless, I enjoyed being a part of their team and I took a lot of lessons with me."
good,I enjoyed working there but it's only part-time and you make min. wage. It's a great job for someone who is going back to school and needing extra money.
good,"I am on the road 6 days a week, traveling to different stores, I never know my schedule and where I will be. I have learned to be very very flexible with not knowing who I will be working with, what the challenges will be and how long I will be there. So it is very hard to plan for anything.  But I have met some really great people along the way."
good,"Kept the store stalked and recovered for the entire shift. Also checked out customers and collected donations for charity."
good,A typical day consist of greeting customers and restocking shelves. I learnt how to properly work cash registers and restock shelves with goods. Management was decent. Co-workers were great. Most enjoyable part of the job was to help customers.
good,"Inconsistent schedules, low pay rate and no foreseeable future within the company."
good,"I Loved my customers but i had a terrible mnagement team , who didnt believe in my advancement in the dollar general corp.  who also made this location the worst place to work ."
good,"Co-workers are awesome. Manager- not so much, however she is very organized. Low prices on whatever you need. Could be stressful due to customers' impatience. You learn you can't please everyone."
good,everyday i would go in with the store manager an count my drawer an get ready to open. most days was bout the ssme. rein people up an break down stock
good,Customer Service relations makes your work from day to day so enjoyable. As a manager you strive for your store to be providing to the customer.  I love to hear and see the customer leave with a satisfied visit.  My goal is to have the store/stores completely customer ready at all times with exceptional value and easy access to items.
good,"Co-workers are amazing. Easy job and amazing customers. Pay should be more, but other than that i would recommended this job to others."
good,"I start my day by getting my paperwork in order and reading all my emails. setting up the task for the day. I find starting the day knowing what needs to be done and getting the task ready for the day makes the store run better. A typical day customer service, lost prevention, cash management, inventory, stocking, training. The most important about being a manager is knowing how to hire and to train. A manager is only as good as its employees. If I have to come up with the hardest part of my job is we get no training hours.  I really enjoy all parts of my job."
good,Make sure cashier count down their money in their drawer before starting register. Watch video cams of Customers keep a close eye for theft. make sure the store is running nicely and in order. solve any  Customer  complaints. Count deposit at the end of the night. Complete all assign paper work.
good,Basic paper work and customer service. Didn't stay long because i helped build the store but it wasn't all that I expected it to be
good,A typical day at work is running the register and putting out a lot of heavy stock. Cleaning and organizing the store. My manager is the best and is always understanding of situations. The pay is TERRIBLE. Who can live off of $7.50 hour? No body unless you work 24/7.
good,Lousy hours and environment. To much drama from non dedicated employees.
good,Opening and Closing procedures; stocking shelves and managing inventory
good,"Over stressed, over worked, not enough pay. Too many responsibilities, not enough support from higher ranks. They want everything now, but when the manager needs something, their is very little rush."
good,"Dollar General has developed me into a exceptional leader. Establishing goals, being more productive, enforcing rules, establishing relationship with employees and employers and  management skills."
good,"There is always something to do here, whether it be stocking, cashiering, setting up displays or recovery/straightening.  The hardest part is having enough time to complete tasks while handling cashiering duties at the same time."
good,This was a job that is good for teenagers or young adults that are fresh of high school that is looking for a job. At my store the store manager was great. Typical day at work would be helping customer's look for items and working the register. As an assistant manager at the time I learned alot about closing the store and closing for the night. The hardest I would have to say would be truck day. That's when we would get the new shipment in and would have to unload the truck. Over all the job is ok.
good,"I liked the fact that this store was just opening, It was a ""model store"", that made everyone take a little more pride in the work they did. I learned just how much loss and prevention really cost companies and what that effect has on our customers. It seemed like there was always something new  from corporate as to increase sales."
good,"Just not a good work environment. A typical work day would be miserable, the store manager watched as everyone else worked. I learned management and the responsibility of money counting and overseeing other workers."
good,Great chance for advancement if you do the right things. Company still learning how to properly run inner city stores.
good,A typical day at work consist of run a cash register and put items on shelves an keep floor clean. Try to make the customer happy. I learned that trying your best is the best u can do.
good,"The job was good, until a manager from another store came in during inventory week. Just didn't work out overall with dealing with her attitude. Plus I had personal business to deal with."
good,"Management wasnt very good. "
good,"I love working with Dollar General and interacting with customers."
good,The hours for me ranged from 5pm & close. The management was decent. It was kind of hard to monitor checkout lanes while stocking shelves & it caused a lot of angry customers because of how far back they had you stocking shelves so it made it very difficult to pay attention to if you had a line or not.
good,"Though the company has some great potential to be one of the nations largest retailers, it is plagued with some inconsistencies that may lead to a possible downfall. The company shows great sales growth, however, this is due to the store growth rate and not same store growth despite the company offering a tremendous more variety in its selection each year. The company has become a bit of a ""head-hunter"" in terms of employee selection which plagues its customer service and customer retention. Pay is also inconsistent in line management as every level is paid on different agendas. This creates a disparity amongst every level of management as each level of management focuses on divided intentions rather than teamwork objectives."
good,A typical day at Dollar General was depressing. I had to work extremely hard only to make minimum wage. I learned that all jobs weren't perfect and just because a company makes good money doesn't mean their employees do also. The manager I had at Dollar General was a rookie. He didn't last long. The hardest part about the job was dealing with all the overstock. It seemed like it just kept piling up no matter how hard we worked. We had a small team handling stock.
good,everything was uncoordinated store was never right because of management just didnt really care.
good,Management sucked. Co-workers were awesome and customers were ok.
good,"I enjoy working at Dollar General because of seeing the people, "
good,Hardest part of that job was putting all the inventory away. Co-workers where all good. I learned how to do inventory a little better then I already knew about.
good,"Great people and great times, clean and friendly"
good,"Wasn't able to work there long, but while I was there it was nice"
good,Checking out customers and keeping the work area clean. While trying to stock as much as you can.
good,"The job is great and I love it and wish to move forward in the company but the turn over ration has gotten too high with upper management so the constant fluctuation is making it difficult to promote as promised, and constant delays between fully staffed crew and short staffed is also making it difficult to single handily keep the store up to par with only of an allowance of 40 hrs a week. I have perfected a paperwork routine and my co workers are now motivated by me to be productive which is great.The job has taught me better indicators of shrink and asset protection, and the importance of dedication to in-stocks by all. The hardest part of my job is not being legal able to do more responsibilities I know I'm capable of such as the schedule and working more than 40 hours, and filling out some specific store monthly paper work. The lack of trust as well, stores are monitored constantly and even as a manager I'm not allowed to complete simple task such as take out any trash, and there is a belief that 65 percent of shrink is internal, so the trust level is almost non existent that doesn't create a good environment and too many bad attitudes with all workers."
good,"I gained so much experience as an Assistant Manager with Dollar General.  I learned how to take multi-tasking to a new level. A typical day would be to make my bank deposit, open the store, tend to customers and vendors and stock product in a very busy store.  Management was very hands on in a smaller box environment and my co-workers were relied on heavily to keep the store running at its fast pace when their additional assistance was utilized daily.  The hardest part of my job was assisting the vendors with product on days when we were short handed on coverage and customers were heavy in volume.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the neighborhood families and people and getting to know them and what products to possibly order extra, also encouraging  loyalty  to shopping with the company."
good,"It was good at first, but management kept switching. You don't get a lot of hours unless you're a manager, and though they paid you every week with a card I felt was pretty nifty, it wasn't enough, bringing home about a $65 a week. Then you have the catty women you were dealing with. Eventually, it just got shady, so I left."
good,"The job itself was okay. Very stressful environment and understaffed. Had to be expected to complete a long task list while constantly being taken away to assist customers because you have to do it all, which is understandable, but it makes it nearly impossible to complete all of the day's work. I was fortunate enough to advance in the company, so I got to stretch my capabilities. With that said, working for Dollar General became more of a life lesson in what I am capable of handling and it helped me to build more confidence and authority within myself."
good,"The manager taught me, by example how to hold the company line by doing it and verbalizing it, always reminding the employees. She dug in and worked along with us always and managed to do the scheduling, closing, and some training. The hardest part of the job was trying to notice some of the minor detail differences in products, thankfully only a few. My coworkers were a good group and we got along fine. When the day was done, the tired was good tired. Looking at the statistics of the day was satisfying."
good,i was stock and cashier i learned to work a register the boss was cool and helpful hardest part of my day was setting up the best part was working with customers
good,"good company. not to family orientated"
good,"I loved working at Dollar General. The hours were good, the pay was decent and the co-workers were awesome! Wonderful, fun and professional work environment. Learned so much so fast that I was in the process of being trained for a ""3rd Key"" position, until there was a change in management and the new manager pulled the promotion away from me."
good,"This is a diverse place to work, you deal with all sorts of people. From coworkers with different backgrounds to the customers you serve. There is a lot that you have to do, including taking side walk sales items in from the patio on the storefront to the interior of the store. The hardest portion of the job is maintaining a constant watch on the merchandise and customers that turn into thieves. The most enjoyable part of the job was having coworkers you felt safe with."
good,Run the register converse and assist customers.  Always smile.  The hardest part of the job was doing your job with little information as there was no positive communication. 
good,"My typical day revolves around the register as a cashier. While ringing up peoples items, i am also expected to stock shelves with merchandise, recover items, and help customers with finding items. My co-workers are pretty nice and really haven't had any upset customers. One issue I may have is if we lose a co-worker for whatever reason without notice, it seems a little unorganized with how schedules work. "
good,"The Customers are fantastic, the work is never overly stress full on the body or the mind."
good,"Dollar General was a very fast paced environment.Every day was very busy.I learned alot about running a store from this job and my manager.She was very patient and showed me what my duties were as well as hers.I enjoyed the people I worked with there,we all got along and worked well together.The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks.The best part about the job was the people and the knowledge I gained"
good,"I personally enjoy the fact that dollar general allows me to have a flexible schedule. its a great job to learn work ethic. A typical day at work for me would be coming in at 1pm-6pm running cash register and putting items on the shelves from totes when there arent any customers waiting in line until 3pm, then I recover my area of the store instead of putting items up from totes. sometimes i go in at 5am to throw frieght until 12pm with the standards of emptying one rolltainer per hour. Throwing freight is the hardest part of the job because plan-o-grams are constantly changing through the seasons making it a little difficult to find some of the locations that the items go but after you get the hang of it it gets easier. but if you do happen to fall behind while throwing frieght, it can push the whole stores weekly plans a day behind which can interrupt the work flow when the next truck comes in."
good,"the managers weren't the best at training"
good, Very tough at times to accomplish tasks with little or no help.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting and helping customers, answering phones, making sure the employees I am overseeing are doing the same. Also running my register, cleaning my sections, stocking product as necessary.  At the end of the night counting all cash, entering the data properly and logging correctly are a must. The hardest part of the job is working family time into a constantly changing schedule.  The best part is always being able to talk to and meet different people."
good,"The Dollar Store was fun, especially the people I worked with."
good,great management team. work with life schedule. stay busy.
good,i uloaded truck witch is a physical job i enjoy. i learned how to use several styles of forklifts and stowing equipment.   the hardest part of the job would have to be the lack of patience when it comes to managers. they seem to be under alot of stress all the time and it shows.. the best part of the job is the people you work with the people there usualy are happy and giddy. it outs a smile on your face in the morning.
good,"It is hard to move up at this store because no one that is higher up is going to quit. And other stores are already filled."
good,It is hard to run a store with a low budget.  Good job when you are fully staffed.
good,"Opened store, did all start-up required; reports on cash registers, set up drawers, inspect store, ready for employees - schedule. Check in vendors, make change and pickups with cashiers. Do exchange and refunds as needed. Cashiered as needed. Stock and inventory daily."
good,"Opening store duties include cycle counts,moving frieght from backroom to sale floor.I learned alot about getting the most out your employees ie keeping them motivated and productive.Again I think one of my strengths is having a positive attitude.keeping up with the ASRs ,the automated ordering system.And working with the customers is the best part."
good,The dollar general store is a busy place to work but can be fun. Working at a fast pace makes the day go by quickly.
good,A typical work day was very productive with a lot of re-stocking and customer work. I learned how to work a cash register and customer service. Management was not well staffed and not very capable of a healthy work environment. The hardest part of the job was standing for 8 hours straight. Most enjoyable was having something to do at a constant rate.
good,"A typical day at my job is very busy. We are a high volume store with a lot of shrink. I am in management, I love being able to help people (customers), I love being able to tell my crew at the end of the day how awesome they were during the shift. The hardest part of my job is being away from my kids so much in the evening."
good,"A typical day at work for a closing manager consists of one thing and one thing only: Recovery. All I do all day is move stuff back to the front of the shelf and pick up what people leave around the store. I'm trained in multiple other things, but the only thing I do is close. I finish the day by counting all the drawers, change fund, and end of the day deposit."
good,"Something different everyday.allowed me to help customers ,and grow my stores sales and customer base."
good,"No work life balance, upper management doesn't care about employees, salary store managers work 90hr weeks Everyweek."
good,"Price and stock merchandise, break down boxes and take trash out to dumpster, Assist customers with choices, run register, unload truck"
good,"A typical day at work would be going to the office and ask what they wanted me to do for the day. Then, I'd log on and start scanning customers items and excepting the payment given, and navigate through the system at the cashier station. The management as well as co-workers were helpful and made sure you knew everything you needed to know for the job. The hardest part about the job was when our shipments came in we would have to unload, price and stock merchandise as much as possible within 2-3 days The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet some great people and learning skills that I used in the next job."
good,I take care of the customers who need help. I learned store management. My co-workers are always nice. It is hard when the customers lie about prices. I like it because i have a bigger responsibility in my store.
good,"Productive, always busy, hard work! They don't let you work 40 hours a week, because they don't want to give you benefits..."
good,"Dollar general is a good part time job, however full time is not guaranteed at all. Good job for a student. Very few hours and no benefits."
good,Huge expectations with little resources. To complete required tasks in the manner that was expected one could barely leave the store.
good,"I was hired in as asst manager, all the employees had been there a year or more, they were good employees. Every day was putting stock away, paperwork, going to the bank, working the cash register, fixing others mistakes, doing returns, helping customers. this is a very busy store, they never had enough help, there weren't enough hours in the day to get things done. there was always stuff to do. I liked being busy, but the hours i worked were crazy , like noon til 11pm, i had no time to do my school work, or have a life of any kind. i loved the customers the best."
good,"A typical day at work would include cashier, customer service, stocking merchandise, and sanitations. I learned that the customer is my number one priority. Management at this particular place of employment was questionable, although I had better experiences from other members of management from other store locations. The hardest part of the job is trying to complete tasks while trying to assist customers with daily needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the cutomer."
good,its ok it takes alot of time away from trying to be a good parent and/or spouse
good,These stores are not supervised and the people who work there are doing whatever they please. I gave up trying because I was taking on the work of multiple people.
good,Manage the business. control your shrink. being able to follow the company guidelines in a timely manner. providing great customer service. going over and beyond to meet a customer needs.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a fare share of rude and polite customers, all throughout the day. However, I learned new things such as how to spot a shoplifter and how to approach them without making a scene. The managers were polite enough. Most of my co-workers kept to themselves and didn't socialize. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude and/or aggressive customers."
good,"The people i worked with was great, The insurance was to high for medical, when ever i needed manager, we had to yell through the store to get help if the manager was not right there with you, When it's time for your review they don't do one until a year i think it is and it's hard to advance in pay."
good,I started at Dollar General as a cashier and within a month was offered a posistion as Assistant Manager because of my impessive work. DG's problem is that their register system is outdated and they have no computerized office equipement to make your job easier. Everthing has to be done by hand which takes forever. Now I understand how they can sell at such low price points.
good,"I went in on my schedule time, wait on customers, stock, sweep, mopped the floors, face the shelves. When I became a key holder, I would count the drawers for the next shift, count money and drop it in the safe, from the cashier that was working, when the store close for the night, I would take the drawer out and count them for the next morning shift, make out the deposit slip out for the bank, go get change if needed. Help the customer find what they was looking for."
good,"greeting customers, stocking shelves. helping the customers find what they need the people i worked with were all kind and friendly"
good,"i liked this place but it was just time to move up, it was more of an after school job."
good,As a store manager you are responsible for everything going in and out of the store. I learned a great deal about time management more so with this company. My co-workers were over all really good people. Hardest part of the job was balancing home life with work. It's a very high demand on management. You do have to invest alot of time.
good,"Helping out the customers who are polite is very rewording but unfortunately most are not. Learned how to operate a scan gun & check in incomming deliveries, ASM paperwork & procedures. DM's who we delt with at the store level are OK, most of the co-workers are nice, but usually not very reliable. The hardest part are the late hours & not seeing your family on several days. Most enjoyable part is helping out the customers when they appriciate the assistance."
good,"I was the manager so i made schedules, did inventory, cashier. I learned alot about responsibilities . I really enjoyed it because it was no stress and alot more relaxing."
good,Handled customer purchases and cleaned and stocked shelves
good,- Perform manager functions of daily operations and merchandising
good,Working at Dollar General Store was my first job in working in retail. I was able to help customers out when needed. I think the hardest part of the job is you have to keep the shelves stocked at all times.
good,Managed daily functions. Store never was furnished with an Assistant Manager so I worked 7 days a week open to close. I was bit by a thief. Fun with what I had to work with at it but it would have worked out better if they furnished me with a complete management staff.
good,Worked here awhile. Started out as cashier and worked my way to manager. The pay is not worht it once you see how many hours you actually have to put in.
good,working with staff was really great. it was a family like atmosphere.
good,"No stable management. It was a great environment, untill my manager was sent to another store. Then it became a competion."
good,The job was exciting i learned how to do cashier i mastered it. i also learned how to count stock inventory. my co workers was as fun as i was my job was not hard at all it was fun. the most enjoyable part of my job was going there everyday just working doing my job.
good,"Very relaxing but fast paced work environment. Co-workers are great, earn life-long friendships. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with irate customers, but the best part is satisfication of helping someone and carrying on conversations with your regular customers, who show you respect and gratitude."
good,"Come into work, either to re-stock the floors or to be a cashier and stockboy at the same time."
good,i come in count start a money count down or restock
good,"A typical day for me at work f (since I primarily was the closer of the store) would be a sales associate and I greeting customers just getting off of work around 4 pm and providing exceptional customer service. We would be in charge of sweeping and mopping the store and recovering the entire store. Lastly, we locked the doors and the sales associate continued to recover the store and I counted all the store's money. The change fund must remain $350 at all times, all cashier drawers (2 typically) and the deposit, the money the store earned. Run all cashier reports through the Dollar General computer system, locked the doors and left. My typical day. I learned a new level of responsibilty and seriousness by that i mean, everything must be accounted for, everything must be traced, everything has to be in line and if not most consequences will trickle down from the DM to the SM to the AM so on so forth. when things are ran correctly things runs much smoother. Management is good because everything is hands on learning and the rewards are real but the consequences are to. My co-workers were great but in management you learn employee's you supervise tend to have mental lapses, they forget stuff so i learned to not expect my employee's to do anything but inspect everything they do. the hardest part about the job is it can be so much work but so little time and the challenge comes in when have to get every team member to understand this, when they dont, repricutions ensue and that eventually lead to the firing of team members. The enjoyable part is talking with and getting to know the"
good,"went in and worked, I learned how to do all sorts of things and alot about people. I managed several people at once, everyone acts as a family till one does something wrong then the gossip starts. Greeting and getting to meet all different kinds of people."
good,"I was really close with my manager, she was a friend of my family and always helped me around the job and gave good advice when it came to career choice, at the time i was going to college."
good,Management in stores are primarily women.
good,"There were long days, anywhere from 10-12 hours, 6-7 days per week. I learned a lot about running a retail store. Upper management had their own agenda.toward the end of my employment there. my co-workers were a joy to see and to work with. The most difficult part of that job was pleasing upper management. The most enjoyable part was the day to day interrelations with the customers."
good,I would come in to work and count the money. Then I would open my side and would get busy and the manager wouldn't help as much as they were told to. The manager was hard to work with on some days. The hardest part of the job was when I would get busy and couldnt keep up with everything and the customers would get mad.
good,"helping customers, helping cashiers through problems, stocking. learned management and productive skills. i get along with all of my co-workers, we all preform great team work. the hardest part of the job is working all types of differant hours everyday. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to maintain a good relationship with co-workers."
good,Has a Manager with Dollar General a typical work week is 60 to 90 hours. You are very busy at all times which makes the day go quickly.
good,"Excellent training, long hours, little pay,minimum benefits."
good,"I had one of the best DM's you could ever ask for but, I was working almost everyday, working 64 to 75 hrs week, because of employees not showing up or remodels. You are manager you make sure your store opens and closes at all times. Even if that means you have to do it yourself."
good,If you have a great staff it will help here. They are stuck in the stone age as far as tech.
good,Coming into work early on weekends stocking
good,"Basically the job was okay,management right beside the enployees"
good,Loved the customers. Management had a tendancy to not back up stores in need of extra help if store had loss due to employee illness/accidents
good,"this job was a fast paced job,and had different jobs to do so you didnt get burned out by doing the same thing each and every day. from manual labor, to operating fork-lift and stow-jacks."
good,"Its always busy  and you learn a lot. management could be better as far as SM and up, but customers always leave satisfied. i enjoy my sales associates and we work well together. The hardest part about my job and trying to balance personal and work"
good,I enjoy working with the public!  I make them  smile and they make me smile!  I love when i can help them find what they are looking for.It feels good to help make someones day alittle  brighter!
good,"A job that was used to get me through hard times, the position was good for the time being I would not go back willingly, but thankful nonetheless for the opportunity"
good,No time for family life. Not enough Labor hours to schedule/pay employee's.I Generally would recommend this Job for someone who doesnt have anything to do in life.
good,"This was a part time job, should had been  an easy job. Coworker came their to play on their device talk to each other. Therefore store manager and myself were about the only ones who did any work to the store ."
good,the overall job was great plenty of opportunities to grow and expand within the company they're flexible and just a great environment I liked it there.
good,It's not horrible and it really does depend on co workers and management. Not to mention the customers you frequently get. My store is definately one of the best in my district
good,A typical day at work consists of 11 to 12 hours of work. The commute to work takes another 2 hours total. The hardest part of the job is managing the store with no associates because of the labor restraints which makes the workplace culture more difficult.
good,The overall work life balance is horrible. Some people love it and some people hate it. It depends on location and how much payroll that you receive weekly
good,The job is not that difficult. You come in and do as you are assisgned for that day.  You will enjoy it there as long has you have the right store manager and district manager.
good,"The staff are friendly and there are many chances for advancement. The two biggest issues are lack of hours, and lack of pay. You do have the chance to build customer relationships. You also get to learn how to do almost every position available."
good,"It's mundane work, but they do a good job of at least building a decent team.  The training isn't too bad, but the opportunity to use any next level training is few and far between."
good,"Good company to learn with advancement opportunities are always available for those willing to work hard and grow."
good,I enjoyed working at this company.But most of all I enjoyed making my customer's experience good enough for them to return. I also enjoyed staying busy
good,They do not care about them r employees and do not follow policies. Also under paid and short staffed. Scheduling is a joke my schedule was never posted like it was supposed to and you are lucky if you know your schedule the day before.
good,They need to up the pay we need help on benefits hours and we also need discounts I love shopping there more than working there we need security for our own protection
good,My manager was a great person. The hours are very flexible. Like if i needed to be off a certain day I more than likely got that day off as long as I told them ahead of time. It’s a good experience in retail.
good,This company is not a good one. If u are just starting out then it would be okay to start. This company does not think of its employees. They believe that u are only a number to them. They are not fair about anything. They change things all the time. They are barber happy.
good,"Their attitudes were fair. The problems were secret. Overall, I learned a lot from the experience I had with them. They taught me a lot about the inventory and how to treat the customers."
good,Manager is friendly and truly looked out for workers but overall is an average job. High turnover rate and many workers that only give 50% effort. The pay is low unless you find a good manager willing to give you raises whenever possible.
good,"I ran the register, stocked the truck, price changes, checked in venders, customer service, clean the floors, as well as ran the store as a Asst. Manager, made the deposits."
good,Was not the best place for me to work was my first job though I did enjoy meeting new people when I could I loved to make others happy and the management was not that good in my opinion
good,"Very easy job but not very exciting , regular customers are friendly all the time and pay is fairly good. Managers is always there to help when needed the most"
good,with lack in management run with super happy attitudes and helping others to provide great service and goals to assure customer happiness and a clean suitable store
good,"I will do more then my dutys ,and I always put the customer first I never have  a unhappy customer.i always made sure that they had help when needed L"
good,"The people were sometimes rude and the supervisors were never around when you needed them, but I enjoyed my job and helping people out.  I worked mostly closing shift and enjoyed being able to stock the shelves and ensure that things were where they needed to be.   But I didn't like the favoritism that the supervisor showed toward the employees especially when you needed certain days off."
good,Honestly my reviews completely depend based on store managers. My manager was amazing and from what I've heard from everyone that works at the Dollar general they feel underpaid and over worked I also agree with that. If I wouldn't have had such a great manager my stars would have been lower. Good luck
good,My time and experience at this company was a good learning experience learning new things everyday enjoyed making customers and the store look nice for new and upcoming products for sale and pursuing a higher position entry level for a key holder but due to upcoming personal thing had to leave but I did enjoy itworworking
good,If you are just out or looking for a second job Dollar General is a good place to work. It's not too fast pace but still fast enough to get you the experience you need to start out.
good,It was a real slow paced worked environement. Management was not up to my liking and needed a change of scenery.  it was inconsistent with the scheduling.
good,Had a bad manager and they could not keep employees.  Manager has since been fired.  Lost alot of good employees because of her. Would work there again now she's gone.  She really did co-workers wrong
good,DG is a nice place to work. If you are very flexible to work any hours. They have a lot to offer yet to often people don’t come in for there shifts and you have to stay. As a store manager you are obligated to stay when no one else does. Your open to close and that gets hard. Even good employees get sick. The need to balance work and home can get difficult.
good,"As a base level cashier, you are tasked with doing everything as far as stocking needs for the store, handling paperwork, maintenance of the outdoor and indoor areas and, of course, maintaining customer relations and the register area. I think it's a bit ridiculous to not be able to hire stockers and it makes it very easy to fall behind in terms of work flow"
good,"It’s an okay job if you’re looking for something temporary. A typical day at work is having to watch the cashier and also having to put stock the shelves. You’re running back and forth throughout the day. You are going to be on your feet a lot so I would recommend having good shoes. You learn how to manage everything over time, but you got to be patient, do not stress too bad."
good,Good place to work if your girlfriend dont get jealous of your job for no reason at all. Then when you quit for her she kicks you out outta nowhere and bangs another dude in YOUR BED you're not supposed to feel blindsided? After all that she holds your kid from you and lets her new bang be daddy to her and the kids. If all that didnt happen to me I'd still be working there because I loved working at Dollar General.
good,Your pay is based off of everyone elses pay. Even if you work hard and good if there is 5 key holders and your a new key holder you'll be paid less than a sales associate. First i made $9.50 then i left and came back and made $8.25. The benifits is unclear there is no clear way to sign up for it so everytime I tried to sign up for the benifits they said I was not eligibleeven though I worked my 30/90 days.
good,Good first job for someone who is just starting off in the retail world. It's fast pace at times of the week and has a risk of theft almost everyday. Good first job.
good,"I liked working at Dollar General. Its really not to bad of a place. It all depends on which store you work at and who your upper management is. They are really bad with communication between district and store managers. There isn't much room for advancement either, they hire people with no retail experience for higher management instead of moving people up who have been there for a while. Plus they never paid me for my vacation pay I cashed in. but other then that it was an okay place to work."
good,There was too much roll over with the district managers. They hired district managers to lead that have never worked for company before and couldn't help you properly. There was no work life balance at all. Mandatory to work 6 days a week. There was way too much work load for the payroll that was given. And did not pay enough for the work load
good,I transferred to Colorado springs and it was ok not what I was expecting so I decided to look for something that would take my skills and experience more serious.
good,This job I had during college and was an okay place to work. Granted I got hired on and then my store manager and basically everyone else quit one day leaving me the only employee in the store. I had to bring in help from my regional manager thank goodness she was able to pull two people from other stores and we kept the place running. Unfortunately it was just three people working for a few months till we got more help.
good,Customers are wonderful and making people happy was the best job. I would be scheduled to work 10 hrs and would work 12 or 14. The managers where disrespectful and two faced.The store was not properly taken care of.
good,"I really LOVED working for DG! It was just my style; fast paced, multitasking and customer service. It was also a plus that there are opportunities to excel in the company. I went from Retail Associate to Lead key Holder in little over a month. It was pretty good pay and consistent hours. Each location, unfortunately is different and inconsistency makes for confusion and the particular location was a very hostile environment."
good,Working at Dollar General was decent it was a good job because it was close to where I live and was a good learning opportunity but in the end it was the job for me
good,"I liked a lot about my job there, but it's hard to balance getting done everything you need to do, due to volume of customers and workload. Everyone is very helpful and courteous."
good,"management is either going to be your best friend or worst enemy, on top of the fact that the upper management is absolutely terrible. your tasks will be the same every single day and if they're not completed, you won't hear the end of it from anyone."
good,"Management was okay, hardest part of the job was the fact you usually only had one person on the register which made stocking difficult at times. They time flies pretty quickly though."
good,"Overall, most days it was pretty laid back and simple, some days it would be a little chaotic and stressful but that’s most places when it comes to work. Interview was casual easy manager was friendly. Did run into an issue where the change fund came up short and everyone got written up for it, even if you didn’t work that day. To try to scare everyone into being more careful about the money. I understand it’s an issue when money is short but I don’t feel as if the people who do their job right should suffer from others mistake. Pay is really unfair I believe. Minimum wage for sales associate. I was let carrier and only made 10 cents more an hour. I know DG can afford to pay their employees more, at least close to what almost any other retail store pays.. they just don’t care about the employees lower than them in the company. Sad."
good,"I was a manager for dollar General there was many times I had to work alone due to being under staffed, and no one wanting to come in . When we was fully staffed I enjoyed working for the company and enjoyed my team."
good,When I first started dollar general I was excited to begin working there. I have always been excellent on retail and as I started the job things was great and I ended up quiting due to poor management
good,"It's good pay, but the management is terrible (where I worked) The Store manager favoritize workers and wouldn't do anything about problems mentioned."
good,You walk in and do the same thing every single day your not promised days off they hire you pt and they work you ft they aren’t really flexible on hours
good,DG need to go back to keeping the work simple. Need to pay the managers and team members higher wages. Managers need 2 consecutive days off. And also be realistic about the truck getting put up.
good,Great way to meet people in your community.  A typical day is waiting on customers and stocking product.  Cleaning as much as you can. Very fast paced.
good,"Management makes or breaks the experience. The manager I was hired under was great. The one after was horrible. "
good,I strpped up and voluntarily worked more than my part time hours. Then was asked seversl times by other employees to work their shifts.( ESPECIALLY WEEKEND'S)
good,Aside from the work load being impossible to complete in the set amount of time allotted it’s an ok place to work. Pay could certainly be better. More hours to have more employees for night shift is needed.
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General, it was hard work but worth it in the long run. The  team we had when I was there was great, we all got along well. I sometimes wish j was working there again."
good,A typical day at work consists of stocking and supervising employees. I've learned at this company is how to manage a hefty workload and become a leader.
good,it was an okay place early in life but as a career its not for someone who vant put a few years in. most start from the bottom and work their way up. if you have a degree in business it may work but ive seen far to many district managers to say their jobs were safe.
good,"Most of my short time at dollar General, was a consitent movement of people quitting and getting hired. Not many people stayed long mainly for the lack of pay."
good,"I was hired for full time position, but I only get 15-20 hrs per week. The Store Manager said it is because of labor issues and will not likely be fixed until sometime in December. Full Time employees are to get no less than 30 hrs per week."
good,"I feel DG waa a pretty good job. Although Non Con was a harder department, I got used to it pretty fast. Production was the most challenging task, trying to keep up with the production score."
good,"Working there, is however you make . Not the best place to work to be honest, but is convenient when juggling life and work. Management is not the best, and you need to be able to cash register alone. Management tends to get annoyed when you can't handle the cash register yourself."
good,"Customers keep you busy all the time,gotta be able to throw freight,do planograms,and keep up with everything.....your definitely on your toes at all times...."
good,"It really all depends on the crew you have. If you have a solid crew that works hard for you then life isn't hard. But it you have a store in a ghetto neighborhood don't expect for life to be easy. Constant call offs so if you can't get coverage you will be the one working those hours. Stores don't shut down you are paid the ""big bucks"" so it's your responsibility it doesn't matter that you have children."
good,"Unfair management, no air conditioning in store. Was not treated equally to other associates. Also treatment for me was different than for some co workers."
good,It gave no time for a family life. It works people to the breaking point just to knock them down later on. They expected you to do all the work and get nothing in return.
good,"I have started off as a part time cashier, then got promoted within a year, then 6 months to next position then a month to assistant. They offer 401k, benefits for full-time and vacation pay for full time"
good,Dealing with rude customers on a daily basis sucks. Theft is also extremely prevalent in Dollar Generals so dealing with that daily is no fun. The best days are stock days where I don't have to deal with customers just stock the shelves.
good,Glad i got the chance to work there. It was a learning experience for sure. Hated leaving when i did but life happens. Would possibly go back if offered.
good,I have a lot of retail and management experience and I was hoping to make a difference in this particular store but once joining this team I find that this is a work in progress in this particular store which I like challenges
good,I would stock and face everything on shelves daily and make sure all customers could find what they were looking for. While reorganizing products so that the sales could be met that were expected but was never given opportunity to move up or even thought about because the manager didn't like men.
good,Alot of drama within Associates which made it unprofessional. Customers are well mannered and understanding. Low pay but the work was fairly easy and most days were slow .
good,"Only store managers make good money, the job could be better if the company were closed or at least closed early for holidays. Also they dont give enough hours for the amount of things they want done."
good,I've been with the company for a while now and it's been pretty much the same thing since I started. It's a great company for a starter job but it's difficult to survive on the wages if you are lower than a store manager. We need more intrapersonal communication training along with more physical and legal support.
good,Before the company overworked me I did enjoy the job. But when it came to being short staffed they over worked me because I was the cheaper labor. Because of this I was failing classes at college
good,"Greeting customers, running cash registers, stocking freight, zoning merchandise on shelves, customer assistance, mopping and cleaning at night before closing store."
good,The hardest part of my job was that we didn’t have security at night and it was scary when they would rob us. And the list enjoyable part of my job was talking to the customers and making them smile
good,"Staff and beginning management were great. Issues with stocking, rotation, and culling resulted in long work hours. Six weeks over time to get store in shape for inventory."
good,It is a hard job. You unload trucks once to twice a week. You unpack and then stock the products. Then rest of the week you run register until truck comes again. They pay min. wage sometimes $8 even as an assistant manager. It is not worth the pay for that amount of work.
good,"Inconsistent hours, fairly easy days at work unless we’re extremely busy with so much to do. The work is not hard but coworkers could make things a little difficult at times as well as the customers if you don’t have patience."
good,"I like DG. It's fun and room for advancement always. You can work from store to store up to 40 hours."
good,"Personally this job wasn't for me. The work environment wasn't very presentable nor was the customer base. I did take in a lot from this job though, I learned how to deal with customers in difficult situations and how to defuse a negative situation."
good,Even though I was a Part-time worker and this was also my very first job. I was not given enough hours from either one of the dollar generals I worked at. I would typically work for two or three days for less than 20 hours every week especially at the second dollar general location I worked at.
good,The work is considerably easy at most parts when trained properly. But your fellow employees in my opinion is what makes the work harder or easier. The job can be enjoyable if given a pleasant work environment.
good,"Everyone does everything. No task is exempt for any position. Cashiering, stocking, cleaning, scrubbing, bathrooms, trash.  The entire store is your responsibility.  If you want to work hard, for little money and little recognition, this is the place for you.  The larger the company got the worse it got, they seemed to forget who got them to the place they are and are going.  I did not want to leave but was forced to leave."
good,Dollar General was  incredibly un organized  and not well kept together and clean.  Management is good but the sales associates don’t pick up on their end. Also very low staffed. Commonly looking for employees to Cover other shifts.
good,Part time position only good for young kids starting out in the real world but not for a mother of 3 needing to pay bills buy groceries.  Manager was a great person but coworkers didn't do much.
good,"Continuously multitasking, several projects going at one time. Always maintaining safe environment. Managing the team at the store. Delegating tasks to the team.  Most importantly keeping customers happy and satisfied."
good,This job required long hours and a lot of hard work. It was a good job. I just did not like how night shifts were forced to work longer hours than the day shift.
good,It's an ok place to work at but have a hard time keeping employees most of the time because they don't always make a smart move half the time and can't always be flexible with employees who have kids. And someone that does deserve to keep advancing and move up with a promotion get over looked and someone that has less experience gets to move up to the higer position then you is not rite really
good,"Not bad for a first or side job, but that's it. Low pay and short hours make it impossible to survive off alone unless you are a store manager. I've worked at 3 different stores and there Is always a rude or lazy employee that never gets disciplined. Overall not the worst job I've ever had and certainly not the best."
good,"A typical day at the Dollar General is checking out customers, assisting customers, stocking and facing merchandise,  cleaning, and counting your register. I learned to work a register, count a register, face and stock merchandise, and open and close the store. The management, when I was hired in 2014, was young, inexperienced, and liked to cut corners. The hardest part of the job is multitasking between checking out customers and tending to the store, especially when it is busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is closing and getting to go home."
good,Benefits offered. Always something to do. Flexibility. If a Manager you will work alot of hours. If you have a good team it will be fun fun but if not its miserable.
good,Once or twice a day I am getting yield at for something other employee's are doing wrong. Work on frat and cash register. Cleaning the store and providing good customer service.
good,I love my job but I work so many hours that I don't see my kids or family. If your sick you don't get paid sick time. If someone calls in and you can't find coverage you have to work it.
good,very long days. store is understaffed. not much team work. managers are thrown into stores with no help. district managers don't listen to issues with stores.store managers are dont work hours they are supposed to but get paid for it
good,Running the cash registers. Stocking the shelves. Cleaning and mopping the floors. Hardest part about the job is trying to get out as much product as possible.
good,"All around good place to work, the managers are great. You can travel to other stores to get more hours. Pretty good job as along as you can follow directions."
good,"My manager at the time was very friendly. She was flexible with the schedule if we needed a day off. Took our break when we wanted or needed to. "
good,"I've been working at DG for almost 3 years now and I hate it, I love my coworkers but we get people stealing stuff multiple times a day, we were robbed 3 times with a weapon, the management is terrible and doesn't communicate well with the team and they expect to much out of you in so little time, you aren't appreciated in this company and it shows. If you have school they do put you on shifts after class but you get no time to do homework or even have a life."
good,They don't run DG like a DG the distric and regional run it as they see fit... I loved working there til they changed  RD and DMS. Make it hard to have a life outside of work.
good,"This review is in regards to the old Dollar General building."
good,"I thought this was going to be the perfect place for me, Honestly never have I been so disappointed in a place of work than I have since I started here. No matter what I still give it my all never call out nor am I ever late. I give my 100% as with all my jobs will continue until I find something better."
good,I enjoyed my job at Dollar General even though the store manager was not that great. I had experience in retail before and enjoyed the field. The experience I had with Dollar General was a sub par retail opportunity
good,"They tell you they'll give you like 15 hours a week but then they slowly go down to 0 hours to 4 hours a week. If you complain about the hours they will just say that corporate is cutting everyone's hours."
good,"Customer service"
good,I really loved my job until the manager turned out to be crazy. She even laid her hands on another employee but nothing was ever done about it and she screamed in my face.
good,We are expected to maintain the stores in pristine condition without the payroll needed to do this. Cannot take lunches more than once a month because i do not have time because of the workload.
good,okay for starter job in sales can learn form bottom up.  part timers have no insurance. trucks are easier to unload. hardest part is trying to put up truck in small aisles with customers trying to shop
good,"This particular store (and manager) did not staff well. And could not keep employees, for the manager at the time did not have very good people skills what-so-ever. It tended to make everyone else work too hard. It did not make for a good work environment."
good,understaffed and rules that slow down checking out customers. its not the worst job but it can improve in several areas. just need to staff better. its not difficult
good,Don’t pay very good but a relaxing job.I recommend working there just to get started and not looking forward to good money coming in unles you keep moving up in the company.
good,Dollar general put a lot of pressure on their employees to accomplish tasks and regular day functions with little work hours provided.  Seen alot of stressed out store managers.
good,As a manager I wasn't getting the right pay that I deserved. Work there is good at times it gets super busy that the day goes by fast. Wish the pay was a bit higher.
good,most seems more interested in passing the buck and saving their own skin than working together to solve problems or help bottom line. the most enjoyable part of the job was the actual job itself; as long as you stayed off managements radar and stay in the central area of expectations you should be fine
good,"Mandatory meetings. Had to watch a video for the company that was so many hours long. Run cashier mostly, work totes if I had time, straighten up product. Sweep and mop floors by the time you close."
good,It was okay for a first job but the manager was rude and the pay sucked for the amount of hours that had to be worked and all the work you did by yourself.
good,Working at dollar general it was never really no team work or communication. It was always somebody had a problem with doing something or they didn’t do it at all. Sometimes they would ask others to do their work for them.
good,I love the people I work with and the regular customers but I need something that pays better and better hours and something where I'm off on the weekends some missing out on my kids life cause of dollar general
good,"I enjoyed the fast paced, on your feet work. Although i was not trained properly. I wasnt even given a name tag for 3 days, about 30 min before the district manager walked in the store. We were 3 weeks behind on stocking the store and i had only worked there for three days. It was more than obvious to me what was going on. The store manager and assistant manager were skimming money and finding poor video footage to blame other employees. After talking to the district manager about it ( of whom acted very professional in person and over the phone) i did not return to work... I did not want a mark on my record for theft when i did not do it. So i didnt take the risk."
good,I was hired the same day I was interviewed. I like the work and I still work there.  They do require two people to run the store at night and that puts a lot of work on your shoulders. You are expected to do a lot. The healthcare plan is expensive.  I have worked at this store for almost two years. Our core customers know who I am and they are friendly. I like the friendly atmosphere at the store. I like the recognition.
good,"Good management. Wonderful environment. Great employees who care. Fast and efficient. Coworkers are friendly. Job is challenging, but not over bearing."
good,The management was good and I had decent cashiers. The store manager and the stockers did all the heavy stocking while the cashiers and assistant manager did all the plastic crates up front. The assistant manager also did a lot of the resets. The work was hard but the people were great.
good,"The work wasn't hard. I did learn a lot being an assistant store manager, more so than just being a regular sales employee. The pay wasn't ideal for what I was doing and in the location it's in."
good,"The store level operation is usually ran on 4-5 people daily. I have learned to execute every decision made by the store manager. The responsibilities constantly grow on a daily basis, from vendor scanning to employee training.  Management is challenging but not impossible, the only frustration is that Assistant Managers do not earn anything comparable to the store manager. In other companies, Assistant Managers earn $25-35 an hour, yet most are only at 12-13 an hour. The most enjoyable part is the work ethic, and the ""down to earth customers"" you meet every day."
good,I loved the people who i worked with however there was never enough hours to give me full time and that is exactly what i needed to take care of my family
good,Working for dollar general was a slow pace and tedious job you have to be willing to do the jobs no one else wants to do the top management is horrible and only cares about the bottom line but you're store managers are almost always very nice and friendly people if you work hard you can move up pretty fast
good,I loved this job i would of stayed but the manger was  a mess. she would hide the money in the safe then come at me talking mess or i was to slow closing up . She would sit cross the street and watch me or have other people watching me. She made me fell out of place at times.She would leave me in the store by myself with a long line of people. Know this is a job would of never left.
good,Stores are usually always under staffed and hard to hire quality people which makes it very hard to keep store NCO. They expect the store manager to do all sorts of paperwork and trackers on the employees which takes away from acutally being out on the sales floor and assisting employees.
good,"Due to the constant cutting of hours, on an average 40 hour week you have to work half of those hours alone in the store during peak hours. Including checking in vendors working the register and checking in the truck (very stressful). DM was not very helpful in resolving issues and only had something to say when a complaint was made.DM cares more about facing store shelves than restocking shelves. The stores and backroom are very messy because of hour cuts. Can't get stock out of backroom and on shelves because of lack of staff. There is a great comradery among co-workers because of the working conditions. If you have a great manager, which I was fortunate, they will work with you and make working at Dollar General bearable. "
good,Overall this was a great olace to work the pay wasnt great couldnt live off of it bit the job wasnt hard got to meet different people and work with great people
good,"Dollar general was ok to work for, i was with them for 8 years.  At the beginning it was ok but they started hiring district managers who did not have a clue how to run a store or stores.  They take away a large store hours and give to these brand new remodeled stores who shouldnt need help because its new.  They want employees to work for two days and be satisfied with what they make.  You have no employees discount and when you do get a discount its crummy.  Its with food and with there brand.  Corporate doesnt have a clue how it is to run a store they only go by numbers and its much more than that"
good,"its okay, takes a strong person to work there, the management needs work, the rude and inconsiderate of their employees, not given enough hours, cut hours"
good,"always stocking shelves, doing planograms, checking in venders and running a register and cleaning. You run with a skeleton crew because dollar general is worried about being over in labor costs."
good,A typical day at work for me was usually busy. I did not get many hours though most of the time it was only 4-5 hours a day and only like four times a week.
good,"dont ask questions unless you have a really secure manager or they think your questioning they them when your really just wanting to make sure YOU know what YOU are doing , not near enough training until you do it wrong and then your in trouble and finding out the right way ."
good,Working at Dollar General is a fast-paced but fun environment to be in. Mostly good for high school students or college students looking for part-time work.
good,"For starters they need more workers. It’s super stressful when there’s only two workers working one day, a manager and a Sales Associate, and you have to continuously travel back and forth from the shelves to register to work. It’s extremely unprofessional and it makes us look bad when customers have to wait for us. Plus the manager wouldn’t allow us to get a bell or something to ring that way we could assist customers more efficiently. Next, they need to pay better and give out better hours. Only $100 a week isn’t going to cut it. Pay bi-weekly. That way you have more than $100 a week. They also gave me less than ten-fifteen hours a week. And that for sure isn’t fair."
good,Dollar General is a decent place to work for but the managers seem to be under too much stress and there is a constant urgency to get things done yesterday. The way scheduling is done you will more than likely never work the same hours or have any form of a set schedule. The pay and benefits also need ALOT of improvement.
good,"Worked there for 7 months. Got a lead sales position after a few months, but due to bad management, 15 days without a day off, and no breaks, I quit. It was just me and another girl working and management was not communicating with us."
good,"The store I worked at went through 3 managers and was one of the most busy stores. You was always on the move, especially if you was a cashier. But other than that, i enjoyed the job, was no crazy costumers at least not alot. Manager was nice and helpful in most cases. I would definitely work there again."
good,I was at work when I had nothing to do I tried to help the others they don't like that at the end of the day we clean up but I guess you are to know what to do on day one cause the manager over that department was very mean about the fact that there was bad training and I cant do something right if I don't know what to do
good,It can be a fast paced fun place to be where you get to see all the local people and have a laugh.  The hardest part of the job is taking the required 45 min lunch!!
good,"I enjoy working there but I really got tired of it I got payed a little of money per hour and didn’t made enough to feed me and my daughter , also I felt uncomfortable in the dollar store."
good,"typical day start 5 am review Salary, and other business areas"
good,Not much needs changing. The staff worked together to perform daily duties. Customers needs were meet each day. Store remained stocked and cleaned. Dollar General is a good place.
good,"For me personally, I had a stressful time there, constant nosebleeds. Management and coworkers were very good though. Customers were a pain. Part time at minimum wage left a lot to be desired though."
good,To long hours with no break no days off and I'm never home with family. When a problem arises it's hard to get into contact with DM. When your doing a good job you do not get the recognitions for that it's always negative.
good,"You work all the time, no time away, even if scheduled off your store will be calling you several times to ask questions that they already know the answers to. Overworked as salaried employees must always be available to cover their stores."
good,It was a somewhat good place to work. After my boss left on maternity leave. There was a temporary boss that was a complete jerk. She was gonna take me off the schedule for calling in one night because of having strep throat. But other than that I liked it most of the time
good,"When I first started out on the job, I liked it, it was good, but a new management team was brought on, and everything changed. My hours for the week could only be 27, and I was part time, but the new manager just did not understand that, he kept insisting that I work over that, but seeing that I'm on social security disability, I could not not work over those hours, he told me good luck, and let me go. He also used a grading system on his employees, which was very unfair. If that's how Dollar General runs their business, I was better off elsewhere."
good,"In my role as a Store Manager in Training at DG, I was in charge of the schedule for my associates. I was given an arbitrary number of hours to spread across my staff in a given week. Often, the number of hours did not come close to matching the work that needed to be completed, so it became incumbent upon me to be 2 additional stockers, and cashiers, We were lucky to have the store stocked to company standards due to the lack of hours alotted."
good,"Its a good job just not a goid paying job. Only 9 and hour it's just not enough to try and save for a car, college and pay bills. Whats left is not enough to have fun with."
good,Was fast paced and needed to be able to multi-task.I learned how to open and close store.Counting and running registrar.The hardest part was keeping store in order.
good,Dollar General is a well-known store that everybody goes to but I think it's temporary job for students just getting out of school but I don't prefer for it to be a career job you also have to be 18 years of age to work there.
good,I like the people and the manager but not enough hours or money! its a good work place it keeps you on your toes! I wouldn't work there again unless theres more hours given out or a higher pay per hour.
good,loved where i worked and who i worked with. the customers came in daily and were all very nice people. we all worked as a team and helped each other with any situation.
good,Great team members. Fun work place quick pace. Not a hard job at all its a very relaxed work place. Great community connection and great and respectful customers.
good,"I enjoyed the majority of my time with the company, up until we had our newest Store Manager after our then-DM made it his mission to get rid of the best SM we had the pleasure of having. Depending on how the management is at each store really depends on how well most associates are going to enjoy coming to work."
good,a typical day at work is where you have 4 isles backed up full of people and no one is there to help you so you are stressed to the max. the sales associates arent allowed to void things out without a manager on duty
good,Working at Dollar General was not a horrible experience. As assistant manager I feel as though I was treated fairly well. If it was my last resort I would go back and apply for a Dollar General
good,"I loved my work family, but it’s nearly impossible to have a full time job with the company. There was no option for overtime and the pay was minimum wage."
good,I learned at lot about stocking and running a register i stocked all the department's shelves and i ran the register at the same time alot of days it was a fun job
good,Management treated certain people better than others.  They treated the employees like they didn't know how to do their job right and treated the better workers unfair.
good,"I liked working there as a cashier (7.25 a hour) but once I was promoted to manager and received a dollar pay raise; I quickly released it wasn't worth the extra dollar. The job should have been paid 10.00 a hour at a minimum. Cash Management, Cashier, Stocker, Truck Delivery Manager, Janitor, and Loss Prevention becomes your job all at once. Management is typically iffy, depending on the store. Only good side was flexible hours but that disappeared once I became a manager."
good,"I have always loved to work in retail. However, DG was the back breaker for me. They pay you pennies and do not hire enough crew to get the companies expectations met."
good,If your not checking out customers then you are stocking shelves.must stay on stocking schedule otherwise you will get behind. Usually not enough workers to keep the store nice.
good,"Working for Dollar General isn’t easy work. Sales associates often multi-task with stocking, greeting customers, and running the register area along with answering any product knowledge questions in between. Management has always seemed to lack in care for their employees and/or their demands, but the opportunity for hours and on-job learning is applicably available. There are opportunites to further education through available programs and if intereted the opportunity to move up in the company is a high possibility."
good,"I asked for set schedule prior to me getting hired and she agreed, but once I start working she had my hours all over the place and then when I said something about it she cut my hours and I was only working one or two days out the week. And everything in the store was a mess. I was trying get it together but it was hard when it seems like you the only one care."
good,enjoyed the retail and customers. Long hours I worked all weekends and holidays.  co workers were great. I think that with a different manager i would have stayed
good,"The job is a lot of responsibility for not a lot of pay. They are pretty relaxed about most things, but it comes at a price. I always get called in. The hours aren't consistent but if you show them you can work its not hard to move up."
good,"When I was first hired, the manager when I was there gave me little to no training & was always in her office. She put me on the register my first day, expecting me to know what I was doing. She was barely out on the sales floor because she was either in the stockroom, in her office or outside taking a cigarette break. I recommend not working at this location."
good,Falling behind with set freight or anything will mean you won't be able to catch up easilyxndndjsbdksdndndjfnsnfnsjfneidngnsvosnegkgmfngjsnvnrkcjddmgmdkvjf
good,"Most days are centered around in-stock and customer service. Store managers have a required minimum number hours to be in the stores, but the tasks to be done require more time than the schedule allows so most managers are in the store far more than what the schedule reflects."
good,You will love to work here depending on the manager. You can advance with this company easily. You will be over worked if the store does not have enough employees.
good,"Say goodbye to your life however, also depending on DM, much more. Decent Pay at management levels but way too much work and standards for what's given to you. Very stressful, may ruin relationships at home."
good,"they need to hire more help.  they expect you to stock the shelf and wait on customer at the same time,  most store are to busy to get the recommend stocking done,"
good,The company needs to understand that you can't run a store on 131 hours a week with seven people working there and expect everything to get done. The employees want to do a good job. No one wants to go to work there low pay not enough hours. When you apply for a job you are wanting to work to make money for your family. You can't do that on 10 to 15 hours per week. To much freight comes in our store for the space we have.
good,"sometimes it was fun but other times it was tiring and seemed pointless. it also depends what location you work at. mine unfortunately needed people and I had a second job so I could actually support my family. "
good,Job is ok but can be a hostile environment at times but the people are ok sometimes. I work with my district manager at times going to other dollar generals making sure planograms truck etc is completed
good,I liked the atmosphere. Just not enough hours. A typical work day had many priorities to take care of. There were alot of staff just not productive enough. Very behind on work
good,"Hard work, lot's of things to do. Mostly the same things every day. Lot's of customer service via direct communication as well as backroom work and stocking."
good,I enjoyed my time working there.  I miss it so much. Each manager I worked for was very accomodating to different scheduling restrictions. It was very fast paced and I truly enjoyed interacting with people on a constant basis.
good,over works managers not enough employee hours. work load is to much for some managers thats why they burn out. pay to low cant get the good employees.
good,Suits a younger person who needs or wants to work part time. Not a great fit for someone with big bills. it is a decent paced place to work and it changes everyday.
good,"Constant change of managers."
good,"Unless you are upper management or working full-time, this job won't pay all of your bills by itself."
good,I worked at Dollar General just for the summer and the work is easy but the hours were too much and never had any free time to enjoy my summer. The other coworkers were great.
good,"A typical day at work would include taking care of customer issues, checking in vendors and unloading our freight. The best part of the job would be helping our elderly customers, they are genuinely appreciative and usually have a great story to tell. All in all it's a great place to work. The downside is all of the heavy lifting involved, it really takes a toll on my body. The pay isn't the best."
good,"I worked at dollar general for a year. I did not see any advancement of any positions or a pay raise for anyone, including myself. This was a problem for me because I was attending school and could have used the extra money. the work atmosphere was good though, my manager was nice and so were my co-workers, so that made the job worthwhile to me."
good,"i loved working here, i met new people everyday. I was a cashier for 6 months and then offered an ASSISTANT MANAGER position. Great position, however the pay wasn't great at all."
good,"I took the job at dollar general because I was a college student in need of work. About a week into working there, the manager who hired me quit and we were without a manager for about 4 months. During that time the store was chaotic and the customers were terrible. My co-workers were pretty ok, but once we got our new manager things turned around (customers were still terrible). Even though the asst. managers and key holders didn't like her, I had no problem with her. "
good,The employees will never disappoint you . The store is up to par to their best advantage. The manager will take good care of you and make sure everything is handled .
good,"The management team was harmonious and kept employees busy. There weren't many workers at the store because corporate wanted the bare minimum amount of employees so, work could become stressful."
good,no work life balance. no payroll hours to get the job done they way they would like. upper management only wants to hit a number so a store can be a mess but if they look good on paper they can careless
good,Its average company to work for not much benefits and not much support within also managers work alot in the back so they cannot be up front with customers
good,A typical day was 2 registers. Constant customers and lack of support from other management team. Very short staffed when in need of serious help. Management switched up a lot
good,Strong customer service skills required due to dealing with customers and co-workers from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Teamwork is a must with this job to be able to perform daily tasks of running the store.
good,"Not enough help,the Point of Sale System is always breaking, high turnover, needs better managerial skills, less drama.  Very busy store, need good customer service people.  "
good,I don't really have anything to write about for this company but to stay it was a experience hat helped me grow in many ways. There was some hard time with doing things myself most of the time but I got through it.
good,It was hard work. You have to be up for that kind of work and no leniency from the management when you are sick or hurt. There is very little time off options in the first 90 days.
good,"It may seem like a small job, but once you're there you are tasked with many things to do. You never stand still for too long. "
good,"Hard work. Standing most of the day. You have to be able to multitask. Have good customer service. Able to lift heavy objects. You got to cashier, stock, make sure your area is clean and neat. Help customers. Not enough appreciation."
good,"A typical day at work starts at 7am, You get your load plan, talk man, and an electric pallet jack. We have a morning meeting and then go to work. We push roll containers of product into trucks and then top the roll containers with loose product. After getting our containers sorted from when the pickers just place the product anywhere around the truck, we load under the red prarie system. Their system is broken and wont admit it. Your expected to put 27 container in the truck in under an hour but still make it neat and use a step stool to make it high and tight. The hardest part of the job is that everything is done by hand. When I was at previous jobs and I loaded trucks, we would use stand up forklifts and stack pallets on top of each other to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people inside the job. With a job that everyone feels under paid we do help each other out and keep each others happiness up until we leave. Management is not the best in the world. They bother you just to bother you."
good,"A typical day includes stocking merchandise that comes in on totes and running the register, going back and forth from each task. There really isn't anything very difficult about the job other than just having patience with difficult customers, which can happen often. On days that totes are done I either work items down from skyshelves, work rolltainers if there are any left and reset planograms if they need to be redone. Management follows guidelines and always ensures that things run smoothly and the customer's needs are met."
good,"Dollar General was a semi fair place to work"
good,Easier for younger people. Very physical job. Must be customer service friendly. Needs more opportunities for single parents. And stricter guidelines to follow as far as store presentation
good,"The dollar general is an okay job to work at. The pay starts around $7.50 an hour. When I got promoted to assistant manager the pay went up to $9.00 an hour wich I believe is very low i asked for a raise and i got it but how the company trained people was not right and that's why i left, no proper training."
good,They basically train you for everything you have to do there. If your a cashier your also a stocker/straightener . And if your boss takes interest in you and you seem to show  and interest to move up you should be able too. They have 3 key holders and those are basically little supervisors. All in all it's a great job for young people starting out but hard to make a living making minimum wage.
good,"it an ok place to work, If you had more than 2 people working on a shift , Needs more People to watch the store I think it kind of dangerous for 2 people to be working alone at night. Like the job overall."
good,"Benefits are ok, not enough time with family almost impossible to get a weekend off. Pay is not that great at all for the amount of work and responsibilities they put on you and they almost never give raises"
good,"Dollar General, although I liked being a cashier, was a very hard company to work for.  You were a cashier, but you were also expected to stock so much merchandise at the same time. It is hard to be in two places at once, and it took a tole on my body."
good,"Opening store, Receiving truck and placing items on shelves, receive vendor products, closed store, bank deposit, cleaning of the store daily. Fun place to work most of the time."
good,"Pay is definitely not enough for the work you have to do. Fast paced, I think they need to change their hiring standards.  "
good,Dollar Tree was a fun place to work due to the fact that family an friends worked there an that the customers an worker always had a smile on there face all around good work environment
good,"Most of the time only two are people working even on busy days like Friday and Saturday, the lines would get so long and most of the time I would be by myself at the register."
good,It was a good job there was a little bit of favoritism but besides that everyone was friendly and would stop what they are doing to help you out and help make sure your doing your job safely
good,I'm a student so having a little bit of extra cash every week is good.Usually getting enough money for each week and extra goodies for if i;m hanging out with friends or buying something for myself.
good,In my time at Dollar General I was able to sharpen and develop my managerial skills as well as find my strengths and weaknesses and grow both personally and professionally. I will always be grateful for every lesson learned there. Even the difficult ones.
good,"If you are management the pay is pretty decent, if you are hourly the pay is terrible.  It is a good company to work for, however if you make a mistake you pay for it, if you make someone upset it becomes hostile."
good,I had a lot of problems with my job at Dollar General so I just continue to do my job and go home there was a lot of misunderstanding and it wasn't that good pain I have kids I was only getting 12 hours a week so it kind of sucked a little bit that's why I looked for a new job but I liked working there for one again there was customers and I like working with people
good,"After many years with a large retailer, who was going out of business, I took this job to fill a gap.  It was not a good fit for me, after being in a much larger scale environment.  Sometimes the managers were cliquish."
good,Not pay enough it OK for part time not full time can't make no live off it they want to much from you and don't want to pay you don't give out enough hours
good,"Didn't get along with boss, she was rude sarcastic, and would call you out in front of employees if you make a mistake very unprofessional, not at all trained to be a manager."
good,"A typical day working at Dollar General varies from day to day, but is stressful, learning to deal with unhappy customers was common and something I got good at, management needs fixed and not just managers but the management of each store and how the main headquarters needs to focus on its stores and not sales sometimes."
good,The work is very physical and the people are kind of friendly. the hardest part is not knowing when you leave at night and not being able to walk because your body is aching.
good,"A boring soulless job and get paid slightly above minimum wage I.E 20ish cents. I had a great time with my fellow team members but the hardest part of is dealing with the stupidest people. "
good,"room for advancement, no so great for a single mom trying to keep an apartment."
good,"I loved it at first, moved up to key holder within 2 weeks, everything was good  until I transferred and new manager came to work for DG for first time, then wouldn't do their part at all, just watch out for certain ones..."
good,Dollar General isn’t the worst place to work. The wages are low for entry levels but there is room for advancement with hard work. I was able to move up quick due to my experience and hard work
good,It was ok but the area that I happened to work in wasn't the greatest but not many are. The managers were all pretty cool people and theres is a lot of room for advancement.
good,"Not enough hours, not enough pay per hour, company had a very high turnover rate. Constantly had problems with the store managers quitting out of nowhere."
good,Rand cash register scrub floors put stuff away did whatever they told me to do make sure the stuff is looking right on the shelves when you got it looking at it and making sure it was in the place
good,"Working here was fun and great , I enjoyed it but the responsibilities did not match the pay . there was so much work they wanted you to do such as stocking, and unpacking items all the whilst you have to check customers out"
good,"Working for this company was great and I loved my customers more than anything. My manager at the time was not the best and treated unfairly. There was definitely favoritism shown. I learned to always be there on time, show excellent customer service and how to be a great worker. The hardest part of the job was unloading all of the truck and zoning the store before closing on our busy days. The most enjoyable part was speaking with my reglar customers."
good,If you like fast pace work that will keep you busy you will flourish in this company. Must be able to lift at least 20 pounds to be able to stock and perform job duties
good,Dollar general was slow paced market store. I was responsible for ordering supplies and stocking shelves. There was opportunity for career advancement.
good,Retail job with flexible hours but that is the only positive thing about it. terrible pay and higher ups are very demanding and never reward you for over achieving with creates a hostile work environment.
good,Working at Dollar General was an adding experience to my work statues. I have learned to building my communication up more on working as a team with my associates.
good,"Working for Dollar General is great as a part time job."
good,I would be happy if we could get more hours.Some kind of bonuses would keep more people.The turn over is crazy.Have my key holders then sales associate.
good,"expect you work any shift, store is dirty and dusty, some management aren't very nice.  it is a cut throat business, where you get it or you don't.  hardest part of the job is there is a lot of heavy lifting. I loved my customers, some of them I have created lasting friends."
good,"Basic store work. Stocking shelves, working with customers, running a register. "
good,I did unload trucks at 5:00 am and stock most everything before customers came in.I cleaned up the boxes and debris from the store worked on the cash register.cleaned up the bathroom.
good,"At the start of working at Dollar General was the most enjoyable part of my job. I was working in a store with a great manager and employees and customers. A typical day at work went smoothly. I was then promoted to Assistant Manager after learning under my Store Manager at the time, and excelled at this position. I was then uprooted out of my city and I moved home to change my major at school, and was moved to another district. I was then unhappy with job for the inconsistencies in management, employees of certain stores I was put in, and discrepancies within the company."
good,"Kept busy between stocking the shelves and running the register."
good,"Really enjoyed working at Dollar General because of my regular customers.  Otherwise, there were a few problems with management at Dollar General and even though they claimed to be team oriented, it was a dysfunctional team."
good,"*stocking/checking costumers out"
good,"Dollar General can be a very stressful place to work when you don't get any hours to do the work, on top of your pay being bad. Coworkers are great though, as well as the manager I have worked under. "
good,"I already had experience in retail,so the manager tried to exploit that for his advancement. I in return received nothing,so there forth i didn't stay long."
good,This is an ideal job for a retiree or a student. I would not recommend this job to anyone who had to support their household on this salary. The key holders and store manager are the only people that receive more than 30 hours.
good,I first got the job because I was looking for something part time while I was going to school. My part  time job ended up as me working full time and pretty much running the store.
good,"I mainly run the register and stock the the first 30 feet of the store in between customers. What I have learned while working here is how to use the hht/ scanner. It helps me with pricing, and location. I don't believe there is a hard part of my job as long as I slow down and think about what I am doing. What I love most about my is the register because I can interact with the customers and help them if it is needed."
good,"It was a minimum wage cashier gig. What more do you want me to say. Imagine a cashier position. Yep, that was it. You nailed it.                     ."
good,"Typical day at work would consist of running register , stocking product , and recovering as you go. I learned how to check in some of the vendors as well as using a ""thu"" which was used for scanning in inventory and writing off expired or damaged items. The job for the most part is easy and you should pick up quickly. You just have to have a great vibe and personality. I ran into lots of nice customers."
good,"Stocking, price changes, plan o gram resets, register...cashier as well as anything cashier needed ie void, refunds etc., opening store,  closing store, monies.  Whatever the store manager delighted."
good,Working for Dollar General was a bit difficult. Trying to handle the customers along with keeping the store tidy was a difficult process due to the lack of people working.
good,Dollar General was a good experience first time training for a manager position.just had lack of training from managers.and the manager excepted more putt employees but gave lack of training.
good,Job was stressful and unorganized. The customers where my only thing that kept me going since I developed a relationship with every customer that came in on a daily basis.
good,"I worked there on and off for about 3 years. A typical day there was stocking and operating the cash register. I learned time management, the importance of organization, and the importance of maintaining a positive and inviting attitude. However, at my particular store days could be rather hectic at times due to a lack of employees. Also, the hours were constantly being adjusted, and gave rise to annoyance and frustration among my coworkers, myself included. Overall, my experience working there was decent. It was nice being paid weekly, but work would have been a lot more enjoyable if there were more employees to work when the store dealt with a day that was busier than the norm."
good,"the experience for working at dollar general depends on what store u get put at. with some stores its easier to work with, not as busy but when u work at one of the more busier stores ur on a strict time deadline to get things done or you will have corporate breathing down your back. Worst thing was that they wanted tasks done fast but never gave hours to do it."
good,"Great to work at, unfortunately new management came in and did not follow any kind of store policy. I feel I just got a tough break otherwise I think I would still be there."
good,Decent staff. Moved up quickly. But I don't see any further advancement there and there's just not enough hours or high enough wages. Too much drama in the workplace in my opinion but I guess it happens. Management is OK.
good,"I enjoy my coworkers and some of the customers, learning how to do everything is fairly easy. Our hours get cut by corporate a lot and maintaining the store is difficult as a lot of the customers trash it without any consideration. The management is okay, things could be a lot more organized."
good,"Typical day at work greet the customers do whatever the manager tells me to do , run the register."
good,"It’s only minimum wage most times depending on your region and store managers rules, But it’s not a hard job so pay is as expected. Good place to start out as a cashier or part time for college. Don’t expect many hours with this job unless you get hired in as full time."
good,"It was a well kept place and always had you doing something. There never was a dull moment while working there, it's a great environment to work in once you get to know all the workers."
good,"I did not like the district manager that was there at the time. The company is ok to work for, but they micro manage everything and it makes for a very stressful place to work."
good,"Not sure you will get forty hours, some week you're lucky to get 10 hours. great people to work with, some time will move you to a different store to work,"
good,It's a good company to start off with but not one to make a true career on. A lot of stores are very disorganized and filthy  They also cannot keep help.
good,"Under the right management team, this would be a fun and productive place to begin building your resume. I would also, allow you to be around a lot of different situations and people."
good,"Very very very easy job. The hardest part of the job is handling rude customers. Extremely low pay and no benefits. My manager was amazing, understanding, easy and fun to work with.  Moral was pretty high and everyone enjoyed working there despite the pay."
good,"My experience as a cashier at Dollar General was not the best but I do appreciate being hired at all. Definitely not my first choice but I would still recommend it to others. I never got along with the manager, and I tried so many times, but work is work. The other employees were really great people, though!"
good,"I started at Dollar General as a cashier and despite lackluster training it was a pretty simple job. Cashiers are mainly in charge of keeping an eye on the register and checking customers out. In between customers they are expected to stock and recover the shelves and alert their MOD to anything they are not allowed to handle. The most frustrating part was having to page a manager every time an item needed to be removed from a transaction, as only a keyholder is allowed to do so. It was also a pain to walk all the way around the L shaped register area only to see that yet another customer had walked up and you had to walk all the way back around (ad nauseam). But I never worked alone and my hours were kept part-time."
good,"The team members and manager were amazing, great customers that become like family. I enjoyed the fast-pace environment  just pay and hours were not cutting it at all to provide for a family of 6"
good,Dollar General is not the best place to work because they have bad work to life ratio and pay for work ratio. The culture isn't bad but you rarely get to work with more then one employee because the payroll is so low. Along with other mostly negative traits that could be improved compared to other places I have worked at.
good,"It's a good place to work if you want a part time job. I applied to be full-time but the most hours I got in one week is 22. The manger is really nice, so were the coworkers I just wish I had more hours."
good,Company often doesn't allocate enough scheduled hours to accomplish job tasks for associates. As a manager your responsibilities are extensive for a 8-10 hour work day. Often times no coverage if associate calls out therefore leaving mgr to cover shifts
good,I had to pretty much take merchandise off of the trucks if the come which is usually on a monday. Then i would work the register b handling money and sacking merchandise. Next i would stock the shelves and last do maintenance on the store before we leave.
good,I hated my job at Dollar General. You are over worked and under paid. It was fun while it lasted but I was ready to get out of there. I left Dollar General in September 2015 and went to Walmart. I have been at Walmart ever since.
good,No regular shift. Not enough employees. Poor pay and raises. Hard work. Generally friendly atmosphere. Decent opportunity  for  advancement  if you work HARD.
good,"Doesn't provide enough hrs, and it offers no opportunity to advance, this would be a good job for someone who doesn't have a family, for the most part the community you serve can be rewarding."
good,"Nice, family oriented company. Should look into paying their sales associates more, other than that its decent. 1 hour lunches while working an 8 hour shift is nice too."
good,I enjoyed working with customers that loved to see me when they came inside. very sociable with people and I got along with my employees. it was a very good working environment
good,"You get to meet different people everyday. Make a difference in your community, by providing a service. Be able to make people smile. Get to know your customers like family."
good,"typical day as a manager..stock, attend to "
good,Was a decent place to work. You had to work 8 hrs an order to get any break. They do not give any 15 min breaks. Had to pick up slack from others. The smokers could take a break whenever they wanted to. Key holders would be on the phone all shift.
good,"Has a wide variety of merchandise, low prices. Flexible hours. Fast paced sometimes real busy. Some employees take too many smoke breaks.  Some employes can't handle the stress."
good,Most days consisted of work not being done to fullest potential... And when you the worker didn't complete an assignment of a managers work you were blamed for it.
good,"I was lied to by managment,company can't keep employees,i would not recommend anyone to work there,nobody wanted to work as a team,was not trained enough before i was left alone for the first time"
good,"it's a good starter job but on the managers make any money, i was a 3rd key, opened and closed the store made bank deposits over saw the cashiers did daily paper work and only made 7.50. but the job isn't hard"
good,It was a okay place to work. It had it's up and down at time. I enjoyed working there but thought I was going to something better. The only thing about D.G. was they never give a person a 40 hour week and a single person just can't live on that.
good,I would check out costumers an I stocked shelves and I opened n close store I would do returns n refunds I was a lead key holder I loved working here it was awesome
good,Unrealistic expectations between hours given... and tasks assigned... no work /life balance... expect to put your life on hold if you are a store manager..
good,Dollar General is a great place to work but the management Is not the best . You not really have much of a life outside of dollar General. Some days can be more stressful than others
good,I was happy in the beginning but I`m not happy anymore. They always ask to much of us on night shift. Plus im tired of working nights. The worse thing about the warehouse is that whatever the plan is either we never meet it or do more than we are asked off. I just want to leave and find something different and that is Monday-Friday.
good,I enjoyed working for this company..location was just a lil different and wasnt so comfortable...i would love to work for this company once again at a different location
good,"Unless you plan on moving up in the ranks, this is not a place that you should really stick around in. It's work. That's all there is to it. You go, do your job, and that's it."
good,"I enjoy working the customer service aspect, however I am in a new store with a manager that has no structure and doesn't follow company policies. For the first 1 1/2 months the store was open we had no store manager and this was my first retail job. A new store was dropped on me with only 16 hours of register and stocking training, no managerial training and I was expected to know everything about the job."
good,This job is for someone looking for fast cash and not having any aspirations in life. You have to deal with rude customers and work inconsistent work schedules.
good,"A typical work day for Dollar General would be showing up to work on time, counting money for cashier drawers, manage the store, stock products, and display great customer service."
good,"In this atmosphere, employees never stop. On the go at all times, which I enjoy a fast pace environment. Dollar General provided me with more management experience, than I would expect at that type of retail outlet. I enjoyed the social interaction with customers. I believe that customer service is paramount to the success of a store. The customer should feel comfortable and relaxed with communicating with a retail employee."
good,"If you are looking for a good amount of money, many hours, raises, or being able to move up, this isn't the job for you. If you are looking for that then the Dollar General would be perfect for you."
good,We had a horrible manager which is the result of my input.....Overall company is good....Management was beyond unacceptable. I love meeting people and building repores but not at this cost.
good,The manager always had a attitude and she always brought her problems to work and put it on her staff and she don't properly train you on the job she leave you out to dry
good,"The job at dollar general was great when I first started. Fun co-workers, very easy job. After a few months I noticed that I wasn't being paid for the hours I worked. Old manager was fired after I left for that reason."
good,Love working here but need something more for my family.  As of right now the people who I work with are great people and the customers we have I enjoy providing a service for them.
good,I work 70 Plus hours to keep up with the pace because there was not enough hours to get the job done I even spent the night there and worked seven days a week and had to cancel vacations because nobody would cover them for me
good,the general manager was unfair and i personally thought that they chose favorite whenever it came to giving more hours to certain people. It is a decent first job
good,"You get close with the workers and  customers. Its alot of work, depending on the day its fast and slow. Caring and understanding management. Would recommend this job to anyone looking"
good,Dollar General is a good company to work for. The only down part about it is if you get a sorry manager. Poor management makes it hard to get the job done properly.
good,I liked working as a cashier just speak to everyone and keep a smile on yo face enjoy the company of your coworkers everyone is there to help each other
good,"Great place for a college student. I checked people out, stocked shelves, and resolved customer complaints. Hardest part of the job is working truck and dealing with unruly customers."
good,Have to put in too many hours for the pay received.  It's a good company but you do not receive many hours for the staff.  This causes a high turnover rate.
good,"It was a job i would recommend if a person was in need of work, it wasn't a bad job. It was very fast paced and there were a lot of expectations put on a person. Which can be a good thing."
good,"The job was good itself, but there was a lot of confusion because of what the responsibilities were that day. I was very used and burned out quick because nothing was consistant. The rules changed everyday based on how everyone felt that certain day."
good,"The work flow was very structured.  The management salary was fair among other companies, however I think the hourly pay for employees is very low compared to other retailers."
good,"This was my first real job. So I did enjoy it in the beginning, and I'm out in the country so most of my customers are regulars. After having been there a while, you get to know a lot of customers and enjoy to see their faces. I do like working the register and whatnot, it's all the excess that I have to do while working the register that gets annoying. While working register, a cashier also has to work out totes, recover the store, and on any other misc. tasks M.O.D. has for you. Just irks my nerves when I walk halfway around the register just to have to turn around because a customer just walked up, and then do it 10 more times. If I tried to wait for another customer to walk up, and my boss happened to walk by and see me then she'd scold me for not doing anything, or she'd give me some random task that she never would have done. It's not really a hard job though, and the most enjoyable of the job would probably be the regulars."
good,"Its all about the people you have working for and with you. Surround your self with quality minded associates, like goals and a team that thinks like family , is the key."
good,"Throughout my time with the company I have met a huge amount of amazing regular customers and vendors. While they are a huge part of the reason I am still with the company, there are plenty of reasons I plan to leave. Truthfully, if you want a store of your own to manage, hard work doesn't cut it. It's rarely ever recognized. You have to suck up to your District Manager in order for that to even be considered. The pay is not worth it, regardless if you do get paid weekly. It's hard for people to want to stay with the company if the team that is there doesn't want to work together."
good,"Never a dull moment. Always, recovery, stock, cashier...High volume little retail here. Corporate doesn't allow enough cashiers in order for the supervisors and managers to get their daily/weekly chores done also. Keeping it maintained takes pride...I took that pride, it's job security though."
good,I believe it's a great place to work if you're in retail but I would not recommend it if you have a family and you need to pay bills because the pay rates aren't very good and it is very hard to move up.
good,Working for this employer was nothing but stress on a daily basis. Definitely not the type of company that cares about it's employees. District managers are pretty much invincible. So either you deal with it or you're out.
good,"A typical day at work included checking out customers, and assisting customers with any questions or concerns they had.  Also, at the end of the shift we would recover the shelves, clean the store, and count associates cash drawers.  While I was in college it allowed me to develop the appropriate work ethic needed to do well in a career of my choosing.  When I was in undergrad I worked two jobs for a period of time which allowed me to learn great time management skills and how to plan with my two respective supervisors to make sure I was not scheduled at both places on the same day.  The workplace was very enjoyable as I encountered a diverse customer base and learned how to deal with people in the most effective way possible.  There was not anything difficult about the job and the most enjoyable part of the job was receiving calls from customers commending my customer service."
good,"Working for Dollar General was fun in it's own way, but a lot more fun than Car-Mart. I loved being able to be on the floor with customers, helping them find something. I also liked the people I worked with."
good,Over all it was a good place to work and get to know new people and great people to work with the management team was good most of the time the work place was fun and got to learn a lot
good,"This is a company with potential growth, however due to certain locations, there was so much theft. I found myself being  more of a security guard than a Team Lead"
good,"daily activity's but not limit to open store, registers ready, checking in vendors, customer service, stocking and recovery. Working for this company has been a very big challenge."
good,dollar general was a good place to work. friendly people good work environment and the benefits were okay. they are very good to college students and they are good with elderly.
good,"Get store ready before opening to customers. Stock shelves while supervising employees. Provide help to customers. Clean store and count down drawers after closing doors for the day. Take deposit to Bank. Learned to manage time, supervise others and handle unhappy customers. Head manager only came in for a few hours most weeks. Assistant manager did most of the work such as changing Front ends, making schedules, ect. Relaxed environment most of the time. Hardest part of the job was satisfying a unhappy customer. Most enjoyable part of the job was the employees."
good,"This is a great job if you would want a lot of free time and can handle not getting many hours due to being hired part time until you move up. Also, the manager was very great and understanding."
good,Probably a good job for a student but not live off of. Raises are yearly and only a quarter. Promotions may occur but the raise is only .50 cents with the responsibility that is inequivalent. Very high-paced at times but slow as well. The expectation were quite off when only skeleton crews are provided due to low budgets.
good,Very Unorganized Store. Management was never Constant. Mostly Smelly. The costomers Were rude. Poor Benefits. No garenteed hours. Hot Enough Money for the work
good,"I learned to count down the registers, count the deposits & make deposits as well as locking up the safes ,back office, doors to the building for the night, receive the delivery trucks & stocks the shelves. I enjoyed meeting knew people & building relationships with my more frequent shoppers. The hardest part was having a costumer trying to cause a scene when returns do not go their way & theft."
good,I have had the privilege to work for the Dollar General Corporation over a year and have met some truly inspiring leadership over my time there. However most of the managers the company is able use are from outside of the company and have a complete lack of what is necessary to deal with the demands that our locations need.
good,"Good place to work good company, good pay and benefits. Very stressful work by good otherwise. Stock days are hard because stock rooms are small. Good environment"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stock recovery, costomer service, cashier and cleaning. The most enjoyable part of work in my opinion was probably the costomer service."
good,"You start off minimum wage, have to run the cash register and try to stock shelves at the same time. You don't get any benefits. You do get off at the time your scheduled to get off and the manager does work with you on your schedule. You don't get any discounts"
good,I didn't have the best experience as an employee. My hours were cut because I was sick and couldn't come to work for one day. I was given attitude from then on.
good,"I worked for the company for about a year. Through out the year, I had more problems than success. This company is very flawed. IF you ever have an in store issue, any complaint filed, unless it is a dire emergency, is ignored. The shifts are long, and turn over is high, so days off are rare."
good,"In my short experience working for this company, I have to say this is a job for people who like slow paced environments with multiple slow points throughout the day. Pay is decent, although my hours were cut exponentially without notice, and for that reason I terminated my employment."
good,"dollar general is a chain of small stores"
good,"There was stocking the shelves in between customers.  It was heavy lifting and harsh chemical cleaning.  If someone needs a job and is desperate, it will give you a job but unless you can move quickly and have everything done in the time allotted, it's not the best place to work."
good,expect to much for the little amount of payroll weekly. they need more hours to get everything done that needs to be done. Expect manager to close 2 times a week and be in store at 6 am 3 days a week.
good,"If you need a job that has great hours and great pay, this is it. It can get a little busy at times but overall its a decent job. My only problem was the management. The management was poor. They didn't care for their employees. I think the management left, but it didn't change the performance of the employees."
good,Dollar Gerneral I really enjoyed working there but the biggest problem that they do not have security in the building which is a big mistake.Management was really cool. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some customers that would actually take items and run out the store with out paying so with us not having security I guess they would expect the employees to run after them or even keep them away from coming inside the store.The most enjoyable was seeing our regular customers and meeting new customers helping them through out there shopping experience. Other that working there was cool..
good,"Pro: flexibility "
good,I enjoyed helping guests find what they needed and helping them purchase the items. The job wasn't hard but management wasn't good so it made it hard to always know what you were doing every day.
good,Relaxed but still a great place for those getting into the workforce. The co-workers made the workplace very enjoyable. I would recommend this job to young teenagers entering the workforce.
good,Management needs to do more training. when the District manager come in for some reason it puts everyone in panic mood. What I enjoyed was my co workers always there when you needed them or if you had a questions. Con would be that Dollar General does not appreciate the loyal employees who come to work when they are schedule and even worked other peoples shift because company short staffed. Customers were always great even got to know the regular customers. Another con would seem like managers seems sales associate stealing.
good,"The managers don't help new employees know what to do"
good,"The location I worked at had many issues with lack of organization and training was not a priority as it should have been. On the plus side, there was a strong sense of community and locals were kind. The dollar store was located in a remote area in the desert. People were frequently on the store at least more than once a week. I enjoyed getting to know the locals as I was far from my hometown in Alabama."
good,"Overall the environment with Dollar General is ok, but there are some exceptions to this rule. Sometimes the employees get treated poorly by Management, and sometimes the employees treat the customers with disrespect."
good,"Never really had trouble with my customers, nor with any of my coworkers. I enjoyed the interaction I had with both the most, and loved getting to know the people if I had the time."
good,"It was a nice place to work, the only problem I had was with management. The customers and employees were nice and fully of energy.  It just needed new management."
good,"Can be pretty fun, depending on who you work with. It is simple enough to do, as long as you put everything in the right place and have good people skills. The manager of the store I worked at was a good woman, but the new one they have doesn't know how to do her job at all."
good,"Overworked and underpaid"
good,"Stressful, tiresome workplace no team work lack of respect for others. The manager was a little rude at times I dealt with it for awhile until I became tired and put in a notice."
good,"It is fast-paced when busy, and requires some lifting of products like dog food bags up to 35 pounds, the experience was alright, but I was not given the hours needed in order to really make it till the next payday when only being paid $7.50/hr"
good,Enjoyed working for this company. A few problems with management due to variety of different managers. Team oriented work environment. Felt like a extended work family.
good,"A typical day consists of a goal at the start of the shift that changes constantly during the day. Overall, the job is okay. It will keep the bills paid."
good,"This job taught me a lot about the duties of the manager, running a store and team. The over all feel of this store was not so great when I arrived and even though it got better when I was there, it never reach a level of a place that I wanted to have a career at."
good,"I didn't care for working here when I look back. At the time I enjoyed it so much but looking back they made you work stocking, unloading boxes, and run cash register. I think they would do better to let cashier watch for customers instead of leaving register."
good,the job is not hard at all one you get the hang of how to work everything you will be able to be successful. also it is a that has flexibility for the workers
good,"I learned much about low level retail; how to run a cash register, stocking shelves, assisting customers, and even basic janitorial duties. "
good,Low rate of the place less pay  for the casher  period no job security when closing at not . but  other then that its nice to meet new people and help them with things they need to but from the store and maybe put a smile on some people face
good,"No matter how,hard or how much effort you give it is never good enough. Lacking in the training program for store managers by only have one trainer per 17 locations."
good,"Loved my job, just didn't like the way the manager ran things her way!! And I clarify her way. My customers came first! My customers asked where something was I could tell them, and for the most part would show them, or go get it for them. I've learned a lot , but I've been in retail for many years so I knew a lot going in. The hardest part of the job was being by yourself and having a list of duties you were suppose to fulfill. My customers is what made me get up and go in everyday."
good,"Cashier, put away stock. Needs to have more employees on schedule at one time. Hardest part of the job is to get all stock out on the floor because of small stock room."
good,Its ok if you like to work long hours. a days work requires a lot of stress and movement. Its ok if you don't have a family to maintain and if you don't mind not having an opinion
good,DOLLAR General is a good company to shop from but to work for it was heart barking stressful demeaning of my self worth. I did enjoy working for the company the customers was nice got to know some on first name baises others not so well worked at all 3 stores in the westend. Never again
good,"It was a typical day at work , I clean behind the register, and I deal with money and stock inventory. The hardest part of the job was dealing with very rude customers the like to pick fights and try to argue"
good,"Learned things I never had a clue I would ever learn."
good,I enjoy working there but the pay is not to good and not everyone is on the same page. I see that there in organized and it's time to find a better paying job.
good,"The customers you meet are very nice, and the work is not too hard.   The trucks can be sort of a handful, and the computer doesn't always take off coupons."
good,A typical day at work is very busy filled with multitasking. I learned to just get the job done. The management is very unprofessional. You meet great people from all walks of the world. Hardest part of then job is working til 10.30 At night with no security or protection. Most enjoyable part is seeeing the smiles on your customers faces just for being there working that day.
good,"I love my job , but you work your butt off for little pay , got to  pick up after customers , and you have to deal with people stealing stuff. love working with my co-workers and my boss. I have learned a lot at my job being an assistant manager like how to stage the backroom for inventory ."
good,"very good job to work for, a great job for a first time cashier. be prepared to work by yourself for the first hour of your shift.. overall I enjoyed working there."
good,"a trpical at work would be helping people to what they need in the store. clean the store, the management is resally helpful too there really nice, fast pace,"
good,Its good pay but not worth t work irregularities and damage on your body. Just dont do it.. Ne employee empathy. Tell you we are all expendable.  Clerical only if you can help it
good,I have been working for this company for 3 years . I've been promoted within my first month or so. I got the job down packed an work very hard in the store. I work long hours sometimes no breaks and im just trying to expand my management skills.
good,Great company for advancement and great wages lots of overtime. Training issues and lots of turn over of managers I had 9 different ones in the 2 years I worked there including 4 different district managers.
good,The Most Enjoyable Part of the job Was going into working in the mornings knowing that I had very loving and caring coworkers Feeling confident about my works space . I Learned many thingsAt Dollar General Such As Dealing with a very busy day and how to communicate with others . The Hardest Part of the was keeping up with the company .
good,Not an ideal place to work but it wasn't too bad of a job experience. Like many jobs I'd say it's the people that you work with that effect your time there.
good,I love meeting new people and working with people .. I LOVE working with dollar General and hoping I get the chance to be a member again
good,"I learned how to work the register and stock. The management was horrible and could have been way better. The workplace was some what average. The hardest part of the job was the extra rude customers, but i managed. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers in a timely fashion and manner."
good,"At times i's been great, at times its been a disaster, when you're a normal worker its simple enough, as i progressed through management i find myself at my most stressed out, the company meta currently is to save money on hours and only have store managers do most of the work while being there, working 50-60 hours a week, as a store manager, you get paid salary at 40 hours per week, when a store manager quits, the pressure gets bumped upon the next member down."
good,"I like the environment, my co-workers and I get along great and are upbeat and ready for our shifts. However our bosses higher up than out store manager do not treat us with respect and are constantly rude to us as employees. I learned most of my management skills from working here. My customer service skills have improved tremendously. As a manager you deal with theft and confrontations in a very respectful manner. The hardest part of the job is staying on your feet for 10-11 hours at a time. The best part of the job is having those conversations with customers and getting  to know them on a deeper level even if it is just for 5 minutes. They can put the biggest smile on your face for the rest of the day."
good,I loved the job until I got management change that only wanted to jump you instead of help you. We have recently cleaned up a lot of our stores with new direction but the new direction didn't give the teams any extra time to fix them so it was on the manager to work the extra hrs since they are salary.
good,"Dollar General was a great place to learn how to work a cash register and be a part time cashier. Not very hard day to day work and your co workers are usually very nice and easy to work with. Although Working your way up is very difficult due to the pay they give you for what they expect you to do. Going from cashier to manager I got a 50 cent raise (From 8 to 8.50.) Especially since there are always only 2 people in the store. You're expected to run the entire store, keep it stocked, keep it clean, and open/close (Which includes the deposit) all for less than a cashier job next door at the supermarket."
good,"DG Was An OK Place To Work, Quick Money To Make. But The Management Wasn't All That Great. Learned Quite A Bit About Warehouse And Stocking, But The Environment Was Ok. Some Customers Are nice, Others Come in to The Store To Complain, And Even If We Helped Them And went Above And Beyond They Still Didn't  Appreciate it."
good,"Not a horrible place to work for. Not stop work, management was not very good in my opinion, they don't work with family situations, they expect you to work over no matter what the time or situation."
good,I have learned that you dont get much family time being in management in retail. The best part is the people you work with. The hardest part is actually finding good workers and getting everything to flow together.
good,"Store managers are expected to put in countless hours and become more of a sales associate rather than a manager.  Available man hours flucuate drastically from one week to the next, making it hard to complete all assigned tasks.  Micro managed from top to bottom."
good,"Decent place to work. typical day you are constantly moving and helping others. Management is willing to listen to your concerns. Good workplace atmosphere, friendly people. Hardest part of the job is getting used to working Sundays. The best part is the people you work with."
good,"Things were great when I started here. Supervisors and managers were respectful, and the hours were steady. However, when business picked up, the increased workload was mismanaged. We typically worked 60 hours a week, sometimes 6 days a week, for months on end. The hours were long because they couldn't keep workers, and they couldn't keep workers because the hours were long."
good,"Its a job for a student that cant work alot of hours, but for someone that needs hours and needs to provide its not that kind of job."
good,Dollar General is a good work place for someone who needs a first job or already has experience. It also provides you with training within the first week or so of being hired.
good,"good first time job "
good,"This is not a very good company to work for, they do not value their employees at all. They ask to much of their employees for the amount of money they are paid. I had 3 different managers in the time I was there and none of them did as they should have."
good,"Hard working fast paced, fun environment, very busy, long hours, very rewarding, room for advancement, stores all over the United States, growing daily."
good,"Pretty terrible job if I'm honest. I would usually hover around 15-20 hrs a week. even the full time employees only got around 30-35. They cut hours if you worked through your break. have to call a key holder to the register to do anything but ring up items (remove an item, ect.) Really just not worth the hours they give and money I made."
good,"Dollar General is an okay place to work. Starting pay is not all that great, but job/life balance is okay. They work around almost any schedule and are pretty god about giving you hours as long as you don't go over 40."
good,possibly the easiest going place ive ever worked. the benefits were nonexistant and the pay was low for a knock-off walmart. co workers were great and people stayed busy. justy a typical department store.
good,"Always stayed busy and had something to do. I learned how to balance work and customers. Worked well with co workers and enjoyed the interaction. Hardest part of it all was getting truck unloaded and cleared out in timely manner, but never gave up."
good,The job was ok in my book. It was somewhat easy but there was a lot the people I worked with were great but the company didn't really care about you. They never acknowledged when you did good or when you stayed late or even came in on your day off . For example 2 leads went out for some fun the  morning before their shift and were no calls no shows I was called on my sons 1 year birthday and to be honest no looking back I should have said no but I was the only lead in town .
good,"At the entry-level position, this is a great place to work. Lots of hours available sometimes. However, being a manager, expect to never have a social life/home life."
good,I love my employess and customers the hardest part of my job was letting it go i had very loyal customers that i loved seeing everyday and i learned great leadership skills their manager training program is great.
good,"Very low pay, less than 20 hours a week if you were part time, but the environment was fun. Very slow paced job normally. As fourth key carrier I learned how to close the store and also management skills."
good,Its not a terrible place to work but plan on spending most of your time there. You also do not get uninterrupted breaks and you aren't given enough time to complete all they require in a day.
good,"not a good place to work, no one was on the same page, bad management. mind you this was when i worked there a while ago. It just wasn't a pleasant place to work."
good,Dollar General was a very successful store when it first opened in January but after a sudden incident our store manager left which caused an assistant manager who was very lazy and inexperienced to run the store. From that day on the store went down hill no one was working everyone was coming in late or not at all there was no structure at all.
good,"I enjoyed my job, but was unfortunately fired for no reason. I loved working with  the customers. The problem is having to be security, stock person, and cashier for minimum wage. I loved my job, but the pay sucked"
good,"I love customer service so this is a great job for me store manager is very conniving and talk about her employees to other employees. A day at work is very good,fast paced,always something to keep you busy and customers you get to see on a daily basis. The store manager talks to the employees like a drill sergeant and belittle them on a daily basis. Most of the employees are scared to stand up to her because she will cut hours,threatened to take away pay for less and positions, she also have favorites and not mutual"
good,Unfair termination. Got fired because a customer gave the manager a dirty look after leaving the register where I was working. Co-workers also brought drama from outside of work into work.
good,"Dollar General a flexible Store with training programs for managers with this position comes stocking, scheduling, planograms, recovering merchandise, handling money, inventory, receiving vendors, hands on and making sure all paper work up to date including store charts are up to date, but Looking for Better opportunities."
good,Only had one district manager that was not helpful to your success.   Very rude and belittling.  But I also had some of the most supportive and positive District Managers.  Made your job so much easier with their support.  Just not enough payroll to have the coverage you needed to complete projects and give great customer service.  Miss my customers the most
good,"Steady work, education on communication and a learning experience. The pay wasn't the greatest but the people I worked for are amazing.  Communication skills are a must."
good,"I enjoyed the many people who I worked with during my short time with the company. In the month I had been there we have had many employees in and out of the store. The biggest problem I had was the late hours. Some nights we had to stay up to an hour late after closing, or our scheduled time, just to finish up last minute items."
good,"Usually very stable to work here. They do start you off at minimum wage as a cashier and you cannot receive raises unless you are promoted. Managers are generally helpful and know what they are doing. Very tedious environment. This job would be perfect for someone who is retiring or wants to get their foot in the door. You are not able to really advance quickly. The hardest part of the job would have to be working with people who do not want to really be there. They can really drag your team down especially during sales month. I suggest you ask all of the W questions before you even apply here. Why do I want to work here? Who will work with me? What am I willing to do for minimum wage? Where will I be placed? When will I receive a promotion? To be quite frank, you really should not work here if you want to advance quickly. This job is for a slower paced type of person who wants a bit of pocket change"
good,On a day of works your eather stocking shelfs or doing tots but there are times when you have to do cashiering then you sweep the floor and clean up c
good,Good workplace for anyone who is looking for retail experience good management nice co workers and good interaction with customers on day in day out basis
good,Short staffed but overall easy and a nice job. I was left at the store for long periods of time alone with a list of things today even though I was on the register.
good,"I learned a lot at Dollar General since it was my first retail job. Unfortunately, the company doesn't well compensate their employees so after my learning experience I felt I was worth more and started looking for other employment."
good,"A typical day here as an LSA starts with counting tills and assigning tasks for the day. Bank runs are easy to forget, but they are essential...so don't forget. The management team here will quickly become your friends...But don't forget they are management! You'll have fun and joke around with your co-workers, but don't get off task! even one minute of fooling around and you may fall far, far behind. The most enjoyable part of the day is always folding up that empty rolltainer haha."
good,"I am a fast learning hard working mother of 4, trying to provide for the most important people in my life, my family! I also work good in a team, and work best solo. I enjoy the felling at the end of my day of accomplishment and self worth. I have wonderful organizational skills and love to teach others to find easier and faster ways to get the job done on time and done right!! I am willing to do whatever it takes to succeed in what i do best and that is everything!!"
good,you go to meeting see how big load is and then you load or unload semi trucks. itss very fast pase. its weekly pay bring home between 5 and 900 every week
good,I really do not have much to say about this job besides it was fun interacting with the customers on a daily basis. I learned how to deal with customers that was difficult and I did not find anything hard about being cashier.
good,"For the most part, you get out of dollar general what you put in. If you want to advance, there are opportunities if you apply your self. no not every day is fun, no the pay is not that great, but for some one just starting out, or wants something low key, Dollar General is a good place to work for."
good,I done a lot of different type of jobs and learned how to do a lot of the managers job .I liked everyone that worked with me we had fun talking and working together.
good,Running on a skeleton crew staff leaves management overworked. Management spends 60+ hours in store every week. High turn over rate due to very part time hours available to anyone who is not management.
good,"I would supervise the front end and cashiers. I had complete control the office from answering all phone calls, check all invoices for accuracy, and count all monies."
good,i work hard at any thing just not making enough money love my job helping and severing customers love opening and closing
good,"I accumulated more customer service skills. My co-workers (team member) was amazing, because we worked as a team to complete our projects. The job was not hard as long as you knew how to do your job successfully."
good,"A typical day at work is productive. I've learned how to have a lot patience. The work is easy if you plan out your day and take your time. Around the holidays can be tough because that's when it's the most busy. Being the assistant manager was nice. Its a laid back job. You do the same thing as the cashiers really. The hardest part is dealing with some of the customers. That just takes time to get use to. Even though the the customers can be the hardest, some of them can be the best and make your day. Its a good job to start with but the only way to make a living is to be a store manager or higher. You can't make a living being the assistant or anything less."
good,"Fast-paced career that is sure to keep you busy. However, little room for creativity. The location I'm employed at in particular is a high traffic area, so basically a crash-course job in customer service."
good,"A typical day at work would be cashiering and then after closing hours sweep and mop. I learned how to take my work serious and the manger call me to come in when somebody calls out, she told me i was very dependable. My co-worker were a lot of fun, that might be the enjoyable art of the job."
good,I as a store manager love my job and my co-workers the only thing that was stressful was the hours. We were doubling our sales from the previous year and the budgeted hours were not increasing. The pay isn't the best either considering the responsibilities and job duties that are expected of you.
good,"Hours in the payroll budget kept shrinking, but the tasks did not. Virtually impossible to stay up to date on the tasks expected"
good,good company to work for. hours are sometime to few but if your willing to work you will make up for it. they try to work with you if you have a second job or if your in college. its a great starter job for young people its fast money because your paid weekly.
good,while working at dollar general there were a lot of kinks and crooks. i learned a lot about what you are not supposed to do in the workplace.
good,My typical day at work begins when I walk through the door.I go to the wharehouse begin loading my cart and just start working freight.My management teaches me alot of stuff than what is in my job description.I always ask questions on how to learn how to do different things.I learn alot of different things at my job everyday.My co workers are awesome I just love working with a group of people that are hardworkers.The hardest part of the job is when a customer ask for something andwe either dont have it or it is out on the shelf.I just would like to make sure everybody goes home happy at the end of the day.
good,"I started out as a part time cashier. Though I was working full time hours. This particular store was going through a lot of changes from management to cleaning the store up to be a better customer serve store. After about a month I moved up to a shift manager/Key holder. Though you have to have open availability, I couldn't keep that up so I had to leave."
good,"Work hours varied throughout week Shifts may be morning noon or evening. Get to work, clock in, get cash register drawer, count till, customer service, stocking, general clean up."
good,"Dollar General pays there employees $7.25 an hour, including me. That is not enough to pay your bills or get your own place. I quit because that was a low minimum wage. I couldn't do it. I'm 18 years old going on 19 in August. I need a higher pay so I can do the things I need to do."
good,"As the newest employee, you go in to work get on the register then find maybe a cart or basket full of things that need to go on the shelf, you then spend your whole shift just checking out customers and stocking in your free time. No matter how busy they are they expect you to get a whole cart done in your shift. Managers were not rude, but one other cashier i worked with was very rude and would talk to me as if she was my boss. At the end of the night as the newest employee you get to sweep and then mop the whole store. Which I could understand but while you're doing this there are at least 2 others in the store, one closing and doing money things and the other just sitting around rather then helping clean. Also would get called in early and had to work a double shift or asked to stay late about everyday i was scheduled. Then on my days off id get a cal asking to come in. Very unorganized scheduling."
good,I was promoted to asst. mgr within a month of starting employment. Then a month later my mgr. quit and I was put in postion of mgr without training. I worked 60 days straight as mgr fill-in and then after working hard to put the store back in shape with a crew of 4 including myself the mgr. position was given to another person.
good,"If you can't manage your time well you shouldn't work here, between trucks, stocking, and checking your customers out of the store there really is a lot more to do than meets the eye."
good,"A typical work day consisted working the register, stocking merchandise, and keeping the store organized. The co-workers were exceptionally nice. They were easy to get along with."
good,"In my opinion the Job was very tough to work for and most times it required to work on holidays which I did not prefer. A typical day would be me walking in, getting my till, counting the till, standing behind the register for hours then go on to fixing up the store. Long hours especially on holidays or during the month of the holidays, Horrible management, she was rude. semi-long lunches. not enough employees, I was always in the front alone most of the time. They did not work very well with my school schedule."
good,"Experience to have great customer service, work in a fast steady pace, handling money, Merchandising, cleaning the store, keeping stock room organize, make sure inventory was up to date and correct."
good,The way the higher ups run the stores in MI is not the same way they run them in IN or TX. I find that to be somewhat questionable. I've seen manager set up employees just to get ride of them. I've seen store manager cheat on store audits.
good,"Working at Dollar General is a reletively easy experience. My coworkers are respectful and proffesional.Through my time here I have learned how to calm down, or talk to an irate person with better rationality and efficeincy. The downsides would have to be the lack of security and inconvienent scheduling."
good,"It was a good job, but they were in the middle of management change. They have a up pace work environment with great customers"
good,My typical day would be to help customers find what they are looking for. Stock shelves and clean up if closing the store.
good,very busy and fast paced environment. I learned a lot as far as inventory and daily store functions. Upper management was very supportive as well as co-workers. hardest part of the job is the home life balance and keeping employees due to the fact that they only hire part-time four hours a day. enjoyable part is the customers and watching your store come gether
good,Being a store manager has benefits but is very exhausting.  They expect you to work 6 days a week for menial salary but it is a great experience.
good,"A typical day at work was the same, at the beginging of each shifts counting drawers making sure shelfs were stocked correctly and neat."
good,The best part about working at dollar general was being able to meet a variety of different people. I also enjoyed the flexible hours.
good,"I use to work at Dollar General a few years ago, and the one that I worked at wasn't in the best part of town. I only got paid minimum wage because I was only a part time worker."
good,It's a great place too start if it's your first job. The environment was always changing with new co-workers and managers. The particular store I worked for never really had  successful management. I did learn a lot from that job about the world of retail. My co-workers were ok. The hardest part about the job was the constant changes in management. I really enjoyed the customer atmosphere and duality of the retail workplace.
good,"Operating cash register and assisting customers."
good,"Supervisors work you til they see fit to quit.  Shift is supposed to be 4 10 hour days, but typically we work more than 10 hours each day and since Jan. 2016 we have worked 8 5 day work weeks at 10+ hours per day.  Again it's supposed to be 4 days and only 10 hours. We usually work 10.75 to 11 hours a night.  This week not being any holiday or any thing coming up we're told we will be working 6 days 1 day off then our work week starts again so that's 10 10+ hour work days in an 11 day time span.  They don't care about our personal lives, time or responsibilities.  It's just work work work because the stores have got to get their shipments.  Oh by the way one of my Supervisors to yesterday and today off.  So he will not be putting in the hours he is forcing on us."
good,"Everything was great when I started, the people were nice and my coworkers were great! One day the CEO came in and he was great too but my boss chose to pick me and yell at me for NO reason just to empress the CEO but he later found out and she was fired."
good,"The pay is not necessarily good, especially for as busy as you stay. If management likes you you can move up because they cannot keep help in the stores. Being understaffed means management misses a lot of breaks and lunches. You do meet a lot of great co-workers since this company is always hiring. Part timers can be taken advantage of. They will give them full time hours but keep them part time so they do not get benefits. You can learn a lot because you have different experiences everyday with customers. The hardest part of the job is trying to get all of your tasks done in time. Usually only two people run the store at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting many new co-workers."
good,"Work tasks included socking shelves, cleaning floors and restrooms, and running cash register.   Management was dependable and relaxed."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General was pretty chill it was a cool enfviorment through out of the day. All through out of the day I take care of needs for the customers as in stocking, cleaning, helping the customers if they need anything like getting something they need or solving something for them. i learned how to be patient, and how to work with others. the managent was very really good when i worked there, it was pretty easy working with my co-workers it was like we all was a family. the best part of the job was dealing with the customers i love talking to the customers every day its always something diffrent."
good,"Typically I would clock in, count a drawer into one of the registers, then check the manager's log for the tasks for the day. Usually it would consist of stocking from truck, or setting up a seasonal area so I would start on one of those projects. Some days there are new planograms that need to be set or some other random project to be done. These tasks usually take up most of the shift. After I am finished I either count tobacco, or recover the store. I would finish the day by counting deposit and preparing it to be sent to the bank the following day. I learned how to use a register, receive vendors, count deposit, as well as some customer service skills. The management was okay and the co-workers were fine. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing deposit because I enjoy handling money and doing math."
good,They need to improve the managers and district managers. They don't know how to talk to there employees. Some of the co-workers are very hard working and some of them just stand around.
good,"open the safe pull drawers, deal with customer complaint, give cashiers breaks, count down drawers at night, stock shelves"
good,Very positive workplace and enjoy meeting new people. I learned how to manage the store keep the store running smooth. Stocking the store throughout the day and assist with any questions that the customers had.
good,"Management are very pleasant, plenty room to advance if there an opportunity, Long hours for management, very few hours for cashiers or stockers. Salaried managers, low pay for cashiers."
good,It was a fun but hard working place. The only downfall was not having enough hours for all of the employees. Other than that it would be a great job for someone looking for a part time job.
good,"Hard work, you practically had to everything, stock, mop the floors and clean the bathrooms and cashier, and try to give good customer"
good,"Early start days, which I like. My store had Great Associates with excellent customer service skills. New District Manager did not live up to his promises of getting help into the store which made us work 7 days a week for over 2 months."
good,I work with a great team that I and my assistant's have put together. Team members have room to advance. Love being able to make a plan and see a display or a goal come together. Its difficult to make a schedule on such a low budget.
good,"Difficult to hire quality people when starting wage is 7.25 an hour.  There is however always something to do, like change endcaps, planogram resets and seasonal resets. The most exciting part of the job is training and developing people. The most difficult part of the job is running the store within the budgeted hours while maintaining a customer ready store."
good,Dollar General is a great company to work for part time or when starting your work history but low pay and the lack of consistent hours and schedule makes it difficult to stay career wise.
good,The hardest part of the job is all the overtime that you have to work. There is no time for family or a personal life outside of work.
good,"I was not fond of the Dollar General in Lauderdale, MS. Poor management and almost always has inventory on the sales floor in the way of customers and workers."
good,"Great place to work, you get paid weekly but you work very hard for your paycheck and are constantly given a hard time by upper management. I have worked in several stores and all of the store managers were rude and lazy."
good,"You not only cash people out.... You clean, you stock shelves, you go to the back of the store, AND you have to leave your register if a customer needs help finding something. God, is it hectic. They have a list of things for you to do everyday, and if it doesn't get done? you get written up. I was told that cleaning was to be done every day... So why when I do, do I find cobwebs and mold behind most of the displays?"
good,"Community involvement/giving is a big part of the culture. Nice working environment with covered parking, fitness center, on site day care, full cafeteria."
good,"Typical days include maintaining the flow of customers and customer satisfaction, maintaining the cleanliness of the store as well. I learned that I am capable of running a store by myself and is hard, but rewarding. There isn't much management, so I manage myself and other co-workers. I enjoy and get along with everyone that I work with. The hardest part of my job is managing the store and getting projects done in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job are working on those projects"
good,A typical day at work was running the cashier to check customers out and making sure the items on the shelves were always in line and not thrown on the floor. I also stocked and had to maintain the daily shift deposits and make those deposits and make sure the cashier always had the proper funds to give back to paying customers.
good,hated working here the manager was never there to help hired her sister when she didn't have a spot to giver her or the hours to give so she took hours from the rest of us and gave to her sister
good,Too much stuff in a little store. Not enough time to unload a truck for the store either. Hours were great thou. and loved my everyday customers.
good,Decent workplace and standards. Low paying for someone with experience..Stockers were dedicated to getting job done.. Bigt turnover in cashiers.
good,"Fast paced environment , where people skills is a must . Inventory , product and sales habits must be second to none and Customer care is number one ."
good,i liked working for dollar general. i learned alot of new things. the hardest part of the job was maintaining a nice friendly and clean environment for the customers to feel welcomed in our store. it was a leaning experience for me but after i got the hang of thing and a feel for the store everything ran smoothly.
good,"Overall decent work place, somewhat decent hours, good for a school student, or stay at home mom. In my opinion a little biased on men and women in the workplace, as far as register and stocking goes. Every place is different im sure, but i feel as though management is not very helpful with training properly unless you constantly ask questions."
good,I can say that Dollar General is an alright job. The hours are okay but no rotating shift. Breaks are short and heavy work loads
good,This was my first job in customer service. Manager was a little bit too hard on me for being new to the work place and just learning how things are to go in a business like this. Did not train me very well.
good,"I enjoy my job very much. I'm good with customers, I get along splendidly with my co-workers,  and I enjoy feeling productive when I'm stocking or cleaning. The management, however, is lacking. Inadequate training, frequent schedule changes, inconsistency of hours, and an inability to move forward in the company because my manager wants to keep me in my current position because I've proven to be good at it, is why I am seeking a new job."
good,"As a sales associate, I interact with many people on a daily basis. We always work the sales floor to face/recover products and restock between customers, but this often results in little progress away from the registers. Coworkers are often kind, understanding, and personable. Management is often strict and ensures that a number of tasks are carried out each day."
good,I dont miss the days of unloading a truck full of inventory and the employees here then gone but overall it was new for me to become a 3rd key holder in such a short period of time so i was thankful.
good,"A typical day at dollar general consisted of preparing the store for an awesome work day starting with counting the tills & setting up the first shift register, pulling the outside merchandise for the front of the store & continually stocking the front end of the store while working the register. this typically continues throughout the day until about 6 pm when the cashier on duty is tasked with store recovery which implies that he or she must pull items forward / fix item facings in their pre designated store space (cashier is given a set number of aisles to fix each night"
good,"As a Sales Rep its pretty easy work. You stock merchandise and you ring out customers. As a manager on the other hand it is a very grueling yet rewarding job. The company does not provide enough hours or pay for its entry level positions so you are constantly having to hire and train new employees as most do not stick around very long due to the lack of pay and hours recieved. All tasks must be completed by set due dates though so the responsabilty falls onto the management, which is a salaried position. As a store manager I averaged 80 hours a week keeping up with all the frieght, planograms, and general maintainace of the store since overtime was not allowed except on extreme circumstances."
good,"Dollar General was a very fast paced hard working job, However they didn't really treat their employees with as much respect as they deserved for the amount of work they were handling"
good,"I was the go-to person who was promised a promotion and never received it for four years. I learned to count down drawers, order products, set shelves as per corporate guidelines, do price changes, stock shelves, and run a cash register. I liked my co-workers, they were all very nice. The management played favorites. When I was a favorite things were great and I did not see that they treated anyone badly. I then was no longer a favorite and could see how terribly they really treat people. The best part of the job was the learning opportunity and the customer interactions. The hardest part of the job was working for management that did not appreciate anything that was done and working with a manager that had anger issues."
good,"I go to work on time everyday. clock in get my till and count the money. put till in register. straighten my counter put candy in it's place. wait on customers until closing bring items that are for sale back in store before I close for the night,  clean bathrooms, straighten counters and shelves after store closes and clock out. What I have learned is that this is a job that requires you to be on you feet all day and that it is rewarding at the end of the day. The management is good but could be better. The hardest part of my job was bringing in the roll tainers at the end of the shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was making new friends and getting to know some of the people that I have lived near for the past 12 years."
good,If you like staying busy...this is the job for you. You need good people skills and good communication. Also be ready to stay on your feet.
good,"Taking the responsibility of safe deposits, running to the bank, spreadsheets at the end of the night, calculations, time management."
good,"-a typical day of work was very productive "
good,good company to work for but the  turnover rate was very high.  I enjoyed working there with coworkers. The hours were good not much overtime. Looking for a permanent position where I can take care of my family
good,"I was a supervisor so I received a little bit better treatment than some of the floor employees and loaders,  But they only cared about the bottom line, not the employees at all.  I was working 12-15 hr days on night shift, there was little to no chance for advancement.  But that was years ago, the environment may have changed now. Hopefully it has improved."
good,"Our group was responsible for removing product one section at a time, rebuilding that section and restocking the merchandise, Was supposed to be a temporary job, but the manager kept me on to help with stocking and assist customers."
good,A typical work day was always very busy so I was always doing something. I leaned how to multi-task better and my social skills increased. I got along with all my co-workers. the hardest part about the job would probably be the constant amount of work with no breaks. The most enjoyable part about the job was the new people I met.
good,learned how manager and key holders operate  nice hardest part night shift mop and clean  fun part not many cut up with customers
good,"Dollar general is an ok job if you just need something to get by. Do not expect to get More then 20 hours a week. Everyday you will do the same thing, run a register or stock shelves. You will learn the basic skills needed to operate in a retail environment."
good,"The job was easy, the pay was good, and the hours were manageable. However, the management didn't know how to run a store. they were very immature, didn't care about the store or their employees, and never wanted to work."
good,"An o.k. place to work. Management is great, but very short staffed.  NO help from other employees. Cashiers are alone to run the whole store."
good,"Was able to grow my skills in Management, customer service, retail, and light accounting. Offered room for advancement and some what flexible hours."
good,"I really liked working with my co-workers. We had a great time. I was the only male who worked here but it was fun. I struggled with how many hours I was able to work due to there not being enough to go around. I was working one day a week, 5 hour shift, which didn't cover my gas to drive there."
good,I liked the mamager but her management skills were lacking. Otherwise I enjoyed my time at Dollar General and would have stayed long had health issues not come into play
good,I was an unloader at dollar general warehouse. I had to maintain a good work environment. Drive equipment and work with other workers
good,its a good place to work you meet new people everyday you learn new things you had your good days and bad days but that's with any job
good,Each dat at dollar general was productive. Trying to increase in sales each day and keeping the store clean. The work environment was decent.
good,"From my experience working for Dollar General, I have been able to hone and refine my skills as a successful manager.  You get to do everything that is done in the retail world, just on a smaller scale.  I supervised an average of 8 employees.  The best part of the job was working together as a team to accomplish goals.  And of course interacting with customers and exceeding there expectations was very rewarding as well. "
good,Started with a empty building. Helped to set up whole store. Got lots of hours and worked hard. When hired to work store was not given enough hours for the drive. Was given 10 hours weekly and had to drive at least 10 hours to get there. Manager was not trained very well but she tried and was easy to get along with.
good,"Focused on simple and hassle-free shopping, Dollar General is the nation’s largest small-box discount retailer, and ranks among the largest retailers of top-quality brands made by America’s most-trusted manufacturers."
good,Dealing with freight and customers and maintaining cash. Stocking and facing shelves and various minor cleaning and maintenance.
good,"I had to do everything from cashier, to janitor, to manager job responsibilities. not a high enough pay. would not recommend to others."
good,"5am trucks unload 1600 pieces.  Then put on a smile for the customers, take care of them while trying to process a truck withing 48 hours which is truly 16 hours because thats all you are allowed to stock.  The rest of time has to be spent on recovery.  If your location is doing well you get pulled to go to another store that is not doing well and endure their issues.  Hardest part of the job was the 5am trucks no matter how cold it is you had to be there unloading, customers were the most enjoyable."
good,"Your typical retail career. Your enjoyment will mainly come from your relationship with the staff. Company as a whole is not hard to move up in. Expect usual retail pay i.e minimum wage w/ yearly raises. Relatively easy work, just have to keep productive and moderate time. Not the worst company to work for, not great either though"
good,I was promoted quickly but the pay wasn't worth the responsibility. Basically good company with opportunity.
good,"A typical day at work is a lot of back and forth between running the register and stocking up our shelves."
good,"A typical day at work consists of a lot of standing, a lot of lifting and carrying things.Depending on your coworkers and management team you can either have a productive day at work or a meaningless day at work.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and lazy coworkers.  The most enjoyable would be the product knowledge that you leave with."
good,"A typical day at work included being a cashier, counting down the register, keeping a clean work environment and closing down a store. I learned how to stay positive under stressful situations. Management and co workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of this job was dealing with rude customers, I was able to keep a smile on my face and do the best I could under stressful circumstances. My favorite part of this job was keeping the store presentable and restocking the shelves."
good,It was an unpleasant environment in which to work. The customers were very grumpy.
good,"Day starts with balancing previous days shifts, cash, deposits, reports, etc..."
good,Busy day i learned how to work gas pumps and lotto machine and how to do money orders.My manager was awesome. Loved my co workers. The hardest part was dealing with alcoholics and shoplifters.  The most enjoyable part was all the sweet customers .
good,people I worked with were nice and the work was enjoyable. i liked that they were family oriented. It was a great job to communicate with people and make friends.
good,"As a manager at Dollar General a typical day at work is productive.  The store is always busy and there is a constant battle between helping the sales associates, customers, and maintaining the store.  Altough it can get overwhelming, it is enjoyable.  The most enjoyable part is meeting customers and developing a relationship with them.  The hardest part about the job is training an individual who may not comprehend the requirements of the job, but it is apart of my position as a manager to train so I have no choice.  My co-workers have outgoing personalities and outstanding customer service skills."
good,Its a laid back atmosphere to work in and supervisors are very nice and approachable.
good,"My final retail job. After 25 years in retail, I was burned out. Worked nights, holidays, all weekends, in short it was the begining of the end."
good,"-My day would consist of greeting customers, restocking merchandise, recovering merchandise, unloading trucks, and providing the best customer service that I could."
good,"Its a good business to work at the other employees were great and helpful when i first started. The management was great too they helped me gain alot of customer service skills needed for future jobs. I went into work in the morning and counted my cashier drawer then "
good,"A typical work day for me is opening the store at 7:30am, walking the store and making notes of what tasks need to be completed that day.  Opening money counts and beginning til for associate drawers.  Doing bank run.  Making sure associates are aware of tasks to be completed and completing those tasks. Focusing on customer service while completing daily tasks. Closing the store at 10:15pm."
good,"They treat you like they pay you more then what they do."
good,The management at this particular place of business is a very sorry excuse for management. He does no work but takes all the glory. The store is always a mess and there isn't anyone that is hired that's willing to go the extra mile for the sake of the company.
good,The hardest part of the job not being able to please a customer. The most enjoyable was seeing the new items come in.
good,thumbs down it was a terrible job and the pay was the same way.  it was gross the people were nice but the company didn't care about the employers more hours and better pay would have been nice and better security would have been nice also.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of talking with the customers about their day and checking  their items out and collecting payment. Sometimes i would help them to their car and wave at them as they drove off. Our management is very laid back and sweet hearted. My co-workers were very fun and caring. The hardest part of the job was having to ""kick out"" our customers at the end of the night. The most enjoyable part of the job was basicly the entire store itself."
good,"This job was ok at best, but mostly do to area. Otherwise, I enjoyed talking with customers on a regular basis and getting to know those who came in regularly. Job duties weren't ever too hard, although at times I did feel overworked."
good,I liked it til you getting called in or working sick. Can be a good job if needed something for short term
good,honestly i think this is a good workplace i have no problems really here
good,"Hard work but rewarding. Management was great to work with. Kept you busy all day, so time flew by."
good,Stocking and over seeing the store's operations. Really easy going and laid back. Everyone helps everyone in the District!
good,Dollar General is a great place to work. I have enjoyed my time here at Dollar General but the lack of hours can hurt. The management at my store was great.
good,at dollar general i would stock and run the cash register management was really good my co workers where easy to get along with and the hardest part of my day was moving roll carts the easiest part was running the register.
good,"This job requires energy, because there is always something to be done, manuel labor and otherwise."
good,It was a fun place to work. Everyone chipped in and helped others if they were behind. I was able to work in a variety of departments. Some managers were overly strict but overall the management was good. Employees had good benefits and good pay.
good,A great place to work.  I would recommend to anyone.  Management is wonderful and willing to work with you.
good,Enjoyed Dollar General for the most part but didn't like the short hours!! Enjoyed the co-workers
good,average work environment. not much room for promotion. most enjoyable thing is being left alone to do my stocking. made few friends
good,A Typical Day at Dollar General Consist of stocking shelves for the entire shift when not ringing up customers.
good,You deal a lot with the public and learn how to handle them in a professorial manner. You have to be very helpful with the customers.
good,"Normal day at work consists of punching in and starting to count the money in your cash register drawer. After then you check out customers remembering to do cash pick ups with quantities of about 300 dollars per pick up, depositing it into the store safe slot."
good,I was lucky to get a great boss and great people to work with. The bad thing about them is they don't pay very well at all.
good,"Dollar General is a good company to work for. You have to option to advance quickly,however it is hard to find a home life balance."
good,love the job and coworkers. I even love the PREVIOUS store manager
good,Loved the job and would of stayed if it had not been for poor manager. She was the worst I have ever had.
good,I worked as a cashier when the other cashier was busy with other customers. helped customer find what they needed or there returns. I had to help unload the truck when they delivered to the store. Straitening up the store at end of shifts. Count the deposits and cashier drawers at the end of shift changing or end of the day.
good,"Friendly customers that came in to see you every day, i learned to be more respectful during the job, the management was ok but nothing to brag about, some coworkers were ok others waited around for you to do their job also. Nothing about the job was hard and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"This was a good first job. Taught how to handle multiple responsibilities in a timely manner. Worked with some awesome people and even made some good friends. Not a decent rate of pay for anyone trying to make a living. Also, not good promise for advancement,"
good,"Dollar General is a great place which allows awesome contact with customers. Employees wear many hats and are responsible for every department in the store."
good,"I was responsible for the day to day operations of the store as well as hiring, firing and training."
good,"I liked the people I worked with, enjoyed my regular customers. Love working in customer service. Learned how to do returns an refunds."
good,"I liked the job, i just needed something a little more full time"
good,"Started out as part times, help unload truck twice a week, was a great place to work, everyone got along treated each other as family."
good,A work experience that further adds my retail experience. A goodstore that had good prices from food to cleaning supplies to hygiene
good,"Keeps you on your feet always something new to learn, learned a lot from working there, had a chance to become a assistant manager and that was fun to learn everything it takes to be apart of management. Also was nice to know there was room to grow if you wanted."
good,"A normal day working here would be a race to try and cram every item's place into my head at once and it became quickly overwhelming. I received low hours each week and was hassled constantly because of my inability to memorize the entire store in a few days. When I needed help trying to figure something out, either the managers were nowhere to be found or they would complain that I bother them too much. My co-workers all kept to themselves, so nothing special from them. Overall, the stress was not dealing with when paired with low pay and low hours."
good,"Daily routine and tasks completed."
good,It was a fun and learning experience. The only downside of the company was when this store closed it did not help associates relocate to a different job or offer other positions within the company.
good,Pay is rather low for GM's and turn over is a problem. I enjoyed the great benifits and the pay was good. Benifits started day one.
good,I have learned a lot while working at Dollar General. I know how to stock shelves and set plan-o-grams. I have learned good customer service skills. I am usually the cashier and I usually stock shelves at the same or clean or recover at the same time while being on the register. Most of my co-workers are nice and I  enjoy working with them. Management is average. If I work four hours I am not allowed a break. Most workers smoke and take breaks when I haven't had one. I have worked there for over a year now and I am only working one day a week for like 4 hours. People who were hired long after I was work more hours than I do.
good,"it was pretty easy, but the management was horrible and unprofessional."
good,"A typical shift, the store would be a complete wreck. Customers would defecate on the floors of the restrooms and smear feces on the walls. Theft is a definite problem, but in the evening there are usually only enough personnel on had to run the register, not to monitor the store AND prepare it for the morning overstaffed morning shift while customers are shopping and undoing whatever is being done. The morning shift would is usually overstaffed, but not responsible for store maintenance. The evening shift does a higher rate of business while understaffed, but is expected to ""front and face"" an entire sore while a high volume of customers are circulating through the store. Write-ups of new staff members are abundant in lieu of training, no matter what the position or proper response entails. The job, to do it well, is very physical. I usually have bruised swollen knees WITH the use of kneepads. My training was never completed and relevant questions were always offensive. The management was lazy under he guise of ""busywork"" and smoke breaks. I wasn't paid for an entire month after my initial hold period because of improper management and incomplete paper submission by the store/hiring manager along with other staff members and as, in fact, told by management that, ""It's not my problem, you shoulda done you paperwork."" To begin work, all paperwork mus be completed DIGITALLY, therefore, it was done and completed. I was also told that the resolution could not be achieved during business hours, which was the only time that anything could be done. However, with due diligence and dedicated"
good,"Always have great customer service and a smile on your face nomatter what your mood is,i enjoyed every thing about this job! including the people i met and worked with"
good,Bosses and employees are easy to work with but they don't always follow Texas employment laws. For example not providing lunch and 15 minute breaks. Retaliation towards employees complaints against the company.
good,"The greatest part of my job is customer service, love taking care of my customers needs..typical day is very active physically,learned that people should come first over anything else, must treat people the way you yourself would like to be treated, customer satisfaction is extremely important to me,making it a great place where people want to come to work,hardest part of the job is unloading trucks physically...making money for my company is important but overall the customer satisfaction was the most rewarding for me."
good,"Overall, it was a pleasant place to work. Don't try to make a living there though, they only pay minimum wage and unless you're full-time its hard to obtain any hours."
good,"A very normal work day. You come in to work, clock in on the cash register, begin your shift and do whatever may be on your list of duties for the day."
good,"Run cashier, stock shelves, clean and help the customers with their needs."
good,"The first Dollar General I worked in  was a great place to work. The days were busy and the people I worked with were great. The hardest part of the job was controlling shoplifters   Managers, in that store were great to work for."
good,"Stocking, scanning, stopping thieves, changing prices, and doing planograms."
good,"I liked working here, but the pay was very low.  I moved on for more money."
good,"Great work experience, advance in the job quickly. I moved from cashier to lead sale associate in 3 months."
good,I advanced quickly because I went in every day and worked my butt off-it paid off.
good,"A typical day at work involves customer service, counting stock, and handling money transactions. I learned patience, great interpersonal skills, and how to tactfully resolve issues and concerns. The most difficult part of the job was the employees personal issues with one another. The most enjoyable part was interacting with cusomers."
good,"I go in help some customers, stock some shelves, clean the store, count the money and go home."
good,"Greeting customers, money handling, cleaning, and stocking.  The management was poor though it was wonderful working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was making sure they left the store and I didn't give my customers good service. The most enjoyable part about working for dollar genera was getting to know regular customers and meeting new ones. I learned how to deal with different personalities. "
good,"A typical day at work started with me coming into the store, opening up the doors. I would then put the outside decoration and sale items outside and begin to stock the shelves that needed stocked until a customer would need assistance. When a customer needed assistance I would drop what I was doing to assist them and once done with that return to my previous task. Later on at night I would be charged with sweeping the floors and cleaning the bathrooms. Then pulling the things from outside into the building once more and locking the doors to go home. While working there I learned many things, but the best of all was learning to communicate and serve customers. I absolutely adored working the cashier and getting to help all the people. I am however very sad that I was forced to give up the job due to moving to a new city. "
good,"learned basic cashier skills, and stocking and interacted with customers on a daily basis"
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is crowded. "
good,"It really depends on WHO your manager is. I learned that it isn't fun having just one person on the register when you have a line literally going about 30 feet into the store due to the fact they WILL NOT HIRE anyone else to help out in the store. My co-workers are amazing people, they do what they can to help. Not knowing when you are going to work till THE DAY OF the next week is NO FUN at all. "
good,"Very good place to work if you stay out of the management part."
good,"I liked my job with Dollar General Store for several reasons - the people, the medium to fast pace, the exercise, stability, etc. I was made Assistant Store Manager after only five months.  The pay was not good at all, especially since I was acting Store Manager for 12 weeks at no additional pay but with plenty of additional responsibilities.  I trained managers for other stores.  I enjoyed that, but it was irritating to be paid less than those you were training.  I only made 7.55 per hour after over two years of employment, over one and a half of those years being the Assistant Store Manager.  That may have been the hardest part of the job - working so hard and not feeling like I was being appreciated or properly compensated."
good,"This was a great job, I enjoyed working there. My coworkers were all very nice, as was management. I got to help customers get exactly what they wanted which was the most rewarding part."
good,"I enjoyed working with my employees, we had fun and really work hard."
good,A typical day at work was sometimes a good day and I've learned how to use the cash register on my first day of work. The co-workers was good to work with. I think that the hardest part was stocking shelves and running the cash register all at the same time.The most enjoyable part of the job was that they gave me days off I really needed or switch one of my days to a different day.
good,promotion with no actual training. DM's don't respect the Store Mangers do not appreciate the dedication that one is doing to run their business
good,"I was just a cashier for a year, then became a 4th keyholder. I would open the store on saturdays, get the cashier his/her drew, recount the safe money(to make sure it was counted right) take deposit to bank and get change for the weekend, set ads, take vendors in, redo shelves, stock, clean, and if cashier needs change, for me to do return, or help with customers. I learned a lot of retail skills. i loved being a 4th keyholder. I got along with my co-workers."
good,"A good company to work for as manager if you don't want a personal life. The position is very demanding with decent benefit options, average salary and task lists that keep you moving. Physical demands are overwhelming."
good,"A typical day consists of serving customers, working cash register, stocking shelves, and managing employees. I have learned how to work as a team and how i should handle customer complaints. I enjoy working with employees and serving customers."
good,"Was not the greatest job, was thrust into it with very little training, if not for the knowledge I had prior to the job I would have not made It as long as I did"
good,"Customer Service, cashier, money handling, Stocking, inventory."
good,Opening store and getting it ready for that business day.
good,"I was located in a very at the time run down part of town. I was not impressed with the crew I was working with and therefore felt the job un acceptable for me. I have been in several Dollar Generals that are nothing like the one I had. I had the grew already there and to get them to work, was a full time job in itself. They mainly just wanted to show up and get paid."
good,challenging to work there as goals were unrealistic. some team members were resistent to change. archaic system.
good,"I worked for dollar general for two and a half months. The district manager hired me because the store i was being hired to didn't have a manager only two assistant managers. After i was hired there was a total lapse of communication and training. I still performed my duties and did my job well, i thought. I wasn't paid for the first four weeks of work and finally on the fifth week i was paid out of the drawer. They continued to pay me this way until i was called into the office one day and was sent home by the new manager, who was just promoted from assistant. The reason for termination was that dollar general had lost my hiring paperwork, even though i completed it twice. It was not a performance based issue just a paperwork issue. I was told i could re apply for my job after a few weeks but no one with goals would walk back into a job like that. I called dollar general corporate office to complain and they told me there is no record of me working there. Over 3200 in wages with 25% held for taxes and no record of me working there? I just want a real opportunity."
good,"Opening up store. Turning off alarm counting drawers and safe. Doing deposit and paperwork making sure deposit is right. Taking deposit over to bank before store opens. operating register and taking care of customers, intill my employee comes in. Putting out stock from truck. Working on endcaps and doing plannagrams. Taking care of vendors and customers throughtout the day. The hardest part of the day is when the store gets really busy and vendors come at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the day is being able to help customers,and getting a project done. I started as a cashier and watched and learned how the store was run, and moved up to management."
good,A typical day consists of helping customers find the items they came in looking for and conducting weekly plan-o-gram changes.
good,overall good job but the hours were to far streched out between the workers.
good,"Made sure store was stock , ordering cover shifts,and run the store. The area was the hard part.I liked it most of the time.Only left because my mother had a stroke."
good, Insure customer check-out with accuracy;
good,"I hade a great time at this company, had some of the best employee you could ever know we stayed on top, i took another job when dollar general sold I went to fred's"
good,"Typical day at Dollar General would consist of running the cash register and keeping the shelves stocked and well-kept. What I learned when I worked for this company was that working retail is so much fun. You get to talk and interact with the customers face to face and I would ceraintly consider myself to be a social person. You constantly have things to do even when there's no one in the store, such as stocking, cleaning, or setting new planograms. I found out by working at Dollar General, that I really enjoy being on my feet and staying busy-it helps the day go by so much faster vs a sit down job. Management needed some work and the store needed someone to come in and clean things up quite a bit; things had gotten out of hand. The co-workers were fun to work with and for the most part they were productive. The hardest part of the job was dealing with ""unhappy customers"" and also dealing with thieves. It was pretty scary when you had caught someone and had to call the law to come down to the store and take your statement; some people did not handle that well at all. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to meet so many different people. After a while, you would get used to ""the regulars"" and they were almost like family."
good,All in all Dollar General is a very customer value based company to work for. Although I would like more work/life balance with my family. I am a great person for working with the public I have a great attitude and Im always trying to get more business. I have learned alot from dollar general my past cpl years I have worked for them and I have been able to move up in the company which is great for me I love getting new experiences. A typical day at work is I come in early to get all my paper work done to check around the store from the people the night before to make sure the store looks good and is ready for the day for business to start. The hardest part of the job is I guess finding good people who want to work and thats being honest. The most enjoyable part is having ur repeat customers and hearing what a wonderful job im doing and how the store looks great.
good,The typical day at work was easy and not too hard.
good,"Make change for cashiers, supervise cashiers, cleaning, stocking shelves, checking in freight and vendors, running register when needed, open/close store. Started out a great job but only went down hill from there. They are constantly doing budget cuts which means less hours. With that, the hours you work are so sparratic it is impossible to have a normal life outside of work. Constantly switching between first and second shift. With my mother in law having breast cancer I was not given the time I needed to take care of her and this didn't seem to matter to anyone."
good,"It was very nice working with the public, But it was not very"
good,This my first job and it was okay to start with as it was close to home and allowed me to work after school and on sundays. learned how to use p.o.s and general customer service skills. management was helpful to certain degree.
good,"A typical day at work would be to arrive 15 minutes early, take the bank deposit to the bank, open up the store, check the daily emails to see what gets executed for that day, give all employees their assignments,and check all tasks before I leave for the day."
good,"This one company I gave my everything for, and as most say"" you don't leave the job, you leave the boss"" Some people should never be in charge of others."
good,"We did a lot of stocking shelves, customer service, sales transaction."
good,"At my location a typical day was pretty enjoyable because of my co-workers, the main management was bad, pay was terrible, even for management positions. If your a teenager looking for a first time job this is the place to go."
good,it was busy most of the time so i was at the register for most of the day except for sundays. i stocked early in the morning before we opened.
good,I enjoy working for dollar general i learned how to do stocking and shipment by restocking the shelves with new and arrived merchandise and how to properly put prices on the items.
good,A typical day at this job can be stressful.I learned how to multi task successfully.Managing is rewarding if and when aloud to do the job.My co-workers and I worked very well together. The hardest part of this job was doing the assigned projects in the amount of time that was allowed. the most enjoyable part was knowing the customers appreciated the work and the service we provided.
good,"Job had its good days and bad days, but overall a positive enviorment, i usually checked out customers with their merchindise with recovering an area in the store. The pay was good, it was above minimum wage, and you got time and a half for holidays."
good,"long hours , customer service , assistant manager , lead a team of 6 , being alone at peak shopping times ,"
good,"Nice, hands on work environment. Never a dull moment, keeps you on the go... which I loved"
good,They just need to get with the times and this could be a ok company to work for.
good,On a day to day an associate will run register while stocking.
good,planograms being set a lot and helping and assisting customers telling them about the cheaper sales and what product is bettter and great team work.
good,I worked for dollar general for a very short period of time. I had to have kidney surgery and couldn't lift over 10 pounds they wanted to replace me because I couldn't do freight.
good,"On a daily basis I would stock shelves, run the register, and clean the store"
good,"You go in for work every day but come out really tired, which is not a problem, unless you get the night shift and have a family to take care of."
good,My most enjoyable part of working for this company was dealing with my every day customer and co-workers. Some management wasnt respectful at all.I leaned alot.
good,"When I first started at Dollar General, I was just a cashier. Then, I was promoted to a 3rd key. The hardest part of my job was as hard as I worked, I never felt appreciated for what I did. The most enjoyable part was being around people, talking to customers, and getting to know them."
good,"This company was a little unstable for me, because everyone wants to be promoted and sometimes their work ethics were not up to my standards."
good,Dollar General a great company to work for I been with them for two year and about 4 month.
good,"On balance Dollar General has a good market concept that they stick to. It has made them very profitable. They however struggle to keep up with their own success, at times they suffer from poor follow up with HR. Communication at the cost center level is poor, and one often wonders if the company realizes how large it is to maintain such an outdated support system."
good,"The company has grown since i have worked there, but they are a good company to work for. They have pretty good benefits and they have no problem rewarding you for your hard work. thats when the job advancement comes in."
good,"This wasn’t a great job. Managers change every year or so, employee moral was very low. I loved working with the customers. I would not recommend applying for this company"
good,"Dollar General Warehouse is located conveniently in Zanesville, Ohio and has an upbeat friendly atmosphere. The wages are decent and they often reward employees for their work."
good,"I enjoyed working there. Easy, fun a good place to start work. Would recommend to a first time job searcher. I will go back and work there anytime. Very clean place good merchandise."
good,I worked less than 10 hours per week. The work load is heavy with limited available hours to accomplish tasks. This was a temporary job for me while I waited to start college.
good,"Customer service and store presentation (stocked shelves, clean store) is top priority. Cash handling and product handling constantly. Handling totes of product and stocking shelves, facing shelves. Keeping a clean work environment (cash register and behind the registers)."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting up with new and current everyday customers. Seeing what they were you doing that day or just to make conversation with them.
good,"It's a matter of state of mind as workers, if we are wiling to learn to what task assigned, each new position and you are not familiar with must put a room for improvements, skills and techniques to observe and adjust in the work place assigned, and put your heart and soul to what things i do then all comes naturally and spontaneous."
good,Typical day at work busy during truck. The management is very flexiable and has a open door policy for everyone. The hardest part of the job is patience. The most enjoyable part of job is a few of the co-workers that work there.
good,Sometimes some of the people you work with are not so good. And their is a high turnover. Retail pay mainly and fairness with schedules and some favoritism.
good,"Pretty decent job, not a lot of hard work. Customers will be difficult so your customer service skills has to be in tact. My learning experiences there helped better my customer service skills."
good,"It was a very interesting place to work at, you would do all types of work. you would never know what would be thrown your way. every customer is different so you have to adapt to each and every single one of them"
good,"Most of the ""jobs"" given are easy to accomplish. The only thing that was really frustrating was that you never know how many hours you'll get. It could be anywhere from 4 hours a week to 24 hours a week. And with the pay they offer those hours don't make it worth working there at times."
good,Great place to work..management is awesome!!!  Only bad thing is.......... They cut your hours whenever they hire too many people because of pay roll.
good,Advancement is quick but training is not thorough. High expectations with  no guidance. Low staffing budget making it hard to maintain store. High turnover.
good,"At dollar general i learned alot, i learned how to check in vendors on a daily basis, bank deposits daily, daily opening and closing. Stock the shelves with new merchandise."
good,low paying not very stable as far as upper mgmt staying in place...the culture there is not a good work environment. the rules and regulations of the stores functions change regularly
good,Information will be giving upon interview. I do not feel it's appropriate to share this information online. My experience at dollar general is confidential to online sites. I do not give out personal information or consent to them.
good,"The job is not easy at first but you get it in the end."
good,"Great customers, bad management, never enough hour, yet understaffed.    Enjoyed the job but didn't feel advancement would happen anytime soon.  I woul like to advance in a job"
good,"Most of my shift was spent in the front at the register.  If i closed, i would sweep and mop the floors, and help straighten the shelves.  I enjoyed this job."
good,"Replen driver, drive highlift pallet jack move pallets with product and empty pallets."
good,"It certainly wasn’t a bad company to work for. Upper management could have handled in-store issues a bit better but the same can be said for working anywhere  "
good,It was a good place to work at. But if you dont like to stay on your feet then it's not a place for you. The pay rate could be higher then what it is  .
good,The upper management is horrible and cannot keep help. The hours are not flexable and the employees are not appreciated. Overall unstable environment.
good,I’ve worked for Popeyes 2 years I enjoyed being there.Pay started off 7.25 a year later it went too 8.05.Its a good place too start working they are very helpful with there customers.
good,I love working there the people was good to me the customers love me when they need help I was always there for them and the customer's where real nice
good,"It was my first job ever and it was a little overwhelming being a cashier with a long line, being the only cashier open. It was a struggle trying to stock shelves and work at the register at the same time."
good,Not a bad place to work. Get to help  customers. Learn how to stock shelves. Work woth sone nice people and meet some interesting customer. Could have better pay.
good,"just a job that doesnt pay very well for the amount of work you do, and the constant rude customers you had to deal with on a regular basis. management picked their favorites and if you are not one than good luck."
good,They will work you hard but pay so so little. I think it was like 7.25 what they started me out at the time. The business environment was okay people was friendly
good,"Dollars General is a great job that pays well. Very flexible hours. Customer service greeting customer when they need assistance. Scheduling, payroll, inventory."
good,"Schedule could change without much notice, but management still continued to work with you.  Able to learn other areas within the store to help you grow and develop"
good,"This was a simple job. Ran register, stocked shelves, cleaned store. Great coworkers and managers. The day usually went by fast if you went down your check list and got things done"
good,"i became a store Manager in a short period of time and i had a great District Manager. I worked hard to keep everything in order i was Store Manager trainer for new Store manager, Old District Manager transferred under new Districts Manager and everything changed for me.  i am not with this company anymore."
good,"Great job and experiences always active and on my feet always get the job done cleaning and neat , organized and in place great customer service multi task"
good,"My experience working here would be okay overall, I didn't really get the motivation and help that I needed but overall, enjoyed my time working there."
good,"Fun to work with customers everyday. Easy to get along with other Co workers. Everyone appreciated my work as an employer. Every customer I had worked with, showed me the respect that I gave them."
good,A typical day at work was face paced and had to multi-task. The management and my co-workers were friendly. Overall the job was great but it just lacked hours.
good,No flexible hours. You have to work what they say you work. I was stuck closing overnight and it wasn't fair to my son. Employees were nice but they never lasted.
good,Under new management. Customers are very unhappy with all the changes. Store often has stuff in the floor blocking isles. Working for dollar general has its up. But this particular store is all about community.
good,Took 5-8 years for cooperate to see processes producing positive results. Over last 3 years those policies and processes began to fall apart due to reduction in sales associates and increasing tasks and processes which have taken the company back to unorganized and filthy.
good,the staff was very friendly and helpful with customers needs and the store was always kept clean and there was always a manager around for anything anyone would need
good,"Needs improvement , they don’t really pay attention too a lot that goes on in the store and they need more people that would actually wanna work the hours giving"
good,Family oriented place to come shop an get what you need an then some. A place where there’s always a sale an you can find things that are interesting. Working there an meeting new people an having long life customer is the best.
good,The job is ok just dosen't pay well. And not enough employees .just time to find something better in life .I am just not satisfied with the job or the company
good,"I actually advanced quick to a assistant store manager, I think the pay as assistant store manager is awful any other job would pay a little better than that, it has its advantages like getting discounts and stuff Dollar general does have good deals, but overall very disappointed."
good,"at dollar general i loved the work and the employees but i hated i only got paid seven dollars and i was still in school, my manager was mean and rude and fired me cause i went to prom"
good,"lean staff, abilty to move up, growth within company. good management leads to good staff. hiring and training are key in order to do job effectiviely"
good,"The job was okay as previous management helped you learn the job fast, and was great at making a schedule for everyone, then new management took over and changed the  daily tasks even though everything was fine, it only made the job more difficult for everyone, the job was more simple before new management came."
good,When I started to work there I was really happy because it was my first job but I realized that I was the only one doing most of the work and I felt a bit alone.
good,Only thing i didn’t like was the pay for all that work that had to be done and most of the time so was working in the store by myself and the manager never wanted to rotate the morning shifts
good,I like my job working there it a good place to work I like the peopleand it close to home and it nice to walk there and getpaid once a week every friday
good,Not enough staff long hours bad communication always getting robbed and things stolen from the store very dangerous place to work no security no help.
good,That reason is because I know I can do more then what I was doing. I have experience in tons of stuff. Standing behind a counter just wasn't enough for me.
good,"The amount of labor hours that Dollar General gives you is SO minimal, you can't run efficiently with the amount of work load that is expected to be done."
good,We never have same hours. Did not care for closing one night and opening the next day. They would have you close at ten pm then be back by six am. Other times you would be closing almost every night   I want a job that you have better hours. Not
good,The people that I had the chance to work with were super nice and I enjoyed having the opportunity to work with them. The hour though were sometimes not what I wanted them. I can't not complain to much I really enjoyed working there.
good,"Need more communication . No one like to show up for work & co workers and managers don’t like to clean in the mornings, but want to put it all on night shift."
good,Working at dollar general made me learn how fast pace things can get because we were always busy and short staff. It was times I had to step up and do things I wasn't trained on at the time just so we could get everything done.
good,"Even after always coming in of extra hours anytime I was asked and always performing my duties and trying to complete more tasks, I was not accepted into the managers 'club'."
good,Working over here is nothing special but it was a job they pay OK the hours are OK the bosses are OK I guess if i had to I would work here again it wouldn't be my first choice though
good,Work always kept me busy and i learned new things everyday. There are a lot of different customers everyday that are mostly kind and funny and great to speak with.
good,Your expected to do quite a bit of work for the amount of pay you receive.  One thing that is nice is being busy all day long makes the day go by faster.  If you have trouble bending or lifting this probably isn’t the job for you.
good,I love being a Keyholder Gained to the ability Learn different leadership skills as well as open and closing the store. I enjoy being a leader and teach others
good,This job wasn't fun bc the manager had at time she had favorites and didn't pay enough and I worked alot hours and didn't pay me enough every week.i wouldn't go back to this job .
good,It can be extremely difficult to cope at times due to being severely understaffed. I remember being the only person working for hours 'cos we simply didn't have very many employees. Co-workers were very friendly and helpful. It is sad that everyone that worked there for the last 3 years has quit. Hopefully they will be able to hire new employees. .
good,"I left because i had little hours in the first place, but afterwards they still cut me to around 12 hours a week. This was not enough, even at the 10 per hour wage."
good,"I was a picker and learned how to properly label containers to ship product to the stores. "
good,The manager I had was a self righteous sexist racist pig!!! Called himself a man of God.. But yet acted like me behind of 2 races and a woman should be seen not heard
good,Some of the staff are friendly and helping with customers.  The shelves are always stocked. If you can't find what you want ask and they will go look in the back.
good,My manager would never give us our breaks but would put them in like we took them or made us work off the clock. She also talked about us behind our backs and would try and turn other employees against one and another.
good,Great place to work would go back to work there had a great experience with this company  etc they need to pay more and have more employees for stocking and registers
good,"I worked as a cashier, but I spent a lot of time stocking. As a cashier your required to run the register, help customers, stock, zone and then clean the store once you close."
good,"Management was okay. Employees were okay."
good,the company was a good one to work for. i enjoyed my time with them. employees and management were very helpful in my learning process. i would work for them again.
good,Enjoyed most of the people I worked with. Customers could be stressful. Did give any chances. Seemed to be under a microscope. To much work for two people.
good,"DG has an on-site gym, that I use when I'm not working from home, which I get to do 1-2 times per week.  When I was part of the development team, we were required to be on call, and we were called 1-3 times per week.  Now that I'm a Product Owner, I'm not on-call which is a very good thing! I reported to the same boss for 8+years, and he was great...one of the main reason why I have stayed at DG for so long."
good,A fair fast pace work environment fair management and flexible schedule. Its a good place to start if you have no job experience they are open to give
good,awesome work environment i left because my hours got cut back and i was not making enough to support my family i did not want to leave i loved working there
good,"Weekly pay starting at minimum wage is nice, helping out customers felt rewarding most of the time, but most of my coworkers weren't the best to work alongside with."
good,"I’m a part-time sales associate here and get on average about 13 hours of work weekly. Hours tend to be scarce if there are a lot of managers. The company seemed to be pretty cheap as they do not pay for uniforms, security guards, and do not replace necessities quickly such as shopping carts, mops, etc. This is a good job for students who are looking for extra cash. Would not recommend for a long term job unless you plan on moving up positions."
good,"It was the little better than Family Dollar, just did not pay the employees what they were worth. But on the upside it was a lot fun times with coworkers and the customer which I like the Best."
good,Working at Dollar General has been an amazing experience. I have only worked there for  7 months and I have learned and had a great time at work! I dont have crazy hours or hardly any time to think. It's been a great job!
good,"Didnt stay at dollar general long while i was working the night shift i was robbed at gun point. Was always on the register wringing customers up, or stocking the shelves."
good,"Working at Dollar General, I had the opportunity to meet new people and help them as well as better my customer service and retail skills. My managers were amazing.!"
good,"If your looking for a nice steady job, Where you can make some nice money this is the place for you. There hours aren’t as good as you’d want them to be but it’s better than nothing"
good,The pay isn't that big and the hours are not making it any better but the environment is very great i just wish i had more hour because i'm a college student thats trying to get on his feet. Doller general is an excellent company but I'm getting paid less then what part time workers are supposed to be paid
good,fun workplace to work in but it was also very busy. Around holidays it was busy plus we also needed to keep some extra eyes on the store because many people had sticky fingers.
good,No room for advancement. Management were not big on seeing employees advance or encourage them to do better in one plans to be at Dollar General forever
good,If ur just starting retail that is not the place to go start off with price chopper or weis I like the people I worked with the job just wasn't very organized
good,I don't have anything to add other than I would not work there again!! The manager at the store I worked at was not a very good one and always blames everything on her employees.
good,I have worked in many places and working at dollar general was really a great experience. I was saddened to leave but I had to do what was best for me at the time. I would definitely work at another dollar general again.
good,Fair job do work in for to meet a lot of new people and learned a bunch of new things from their great first job to work at or get experience at forsure
good,No one wants to work and all they do is try to lay the blame on someone else. It's not worth anyone's time and it would be better for the economy if she just disappeared
good,job is pretty cool kinda stressful at first cause your body has to get use to working like this nice pay every friday very dirty place rats where every where management works you like crazy.
good,"Dollar General was a fun environment. The Manager was a very fair leader with delegating task, and on time with schedules and performance reviews. The long term staff was like family."
good,"A typical day at work was busy."
good,I enjoyed working here but management was bad at the end. In the beginning the management and staff was awesome. Its not that bad of a job. I really enjoyed it.
good,It was a good opportunity to work there and it was a rather calm and laid back environment to work in. Everyone was nice to me and the managers got along very well.
good,worked very hard daily always throwing boxes on conveyor belt. to me this job was meant to be done by a younger individual due to the rate a speed one must keep up through out the day
good,"Its a great place to work if you are in the right store. I started as a sales associate making 8 an hour to becoming a store manager making 41,739 salary in one year. It was great until i became a Store Manager. It was hard to keep sales associates because the pay was so little and they only give you enough pay roll for them to have 10-15 hours a week. I ended up working lots of doubles and not being compensated for the over time because i was salary. I used to love working for them but the culture changed. They dont care about your well being anymore. All they care about it sales. The only good thing is you can move up fast because the turnover rate for Store Managers is high."
good,"Each location is different, let's be honest here. The one I worked at in Louisiana was ALWAYS busy and couldn't keep staff. You were meant to put out stock and handle the register. By the time you walked to the cart and grabbed a box, someone was at the register. It was near impossible to do anything and then you would get an earful for not having stock out. Choose your location wisely is all I can say."
good,Must handle employee tasks and allocate them. Oversee receiving and maintain stocking procedures. Assistant manager was responsible for payroll and scheduling. Provide excellent customer service.
good,Wasn't worth my time or work ethic I Feel The Service Should Have Been More Formal When Inviting guest and vendors . Everything there seemed like a different type of environment
good,I wouldn’t recommend them to anybody unless you are willing to work with people who are rude and unhappy no matter how hard you work. Getting wrote up for every small thing that is accidental.
good,Good job but they hire lazy people . These stores need to hire security officers to bring down theft rates and upgrade a lot of there stores. Stores are understaffed.
good,"If you are looking for an easy job for when your looking for a second job or just for high school job its the best kinda job to work at, the managers were nice as well"
good,"the job itself wasn't bad, however the manager at the time didn't know how to respectfully communicate with her employees. so the job was literally was what it was A JOB, in a somewhat hostile environment."
good,"Working in Dollar General can be a good place to work at if they could make a few adjustments. Personally i may not have liked it that well, but it doesn't mean its a job to shoot down. I believe if they work a little on both satisfying the customers and being fair with the crew, it would be a good place to work."
good,Pay  should be more than $8 an hour! It should start off at least $9.00/$9.50 people have families and $8/ hr is not enough to raise a family on. The cost of living is too high
good,Not going to lie dollar general is a great place to work but the manager on the boulevard is not a great manager at all. She’s rude and makes her own rules.
good,"I have loved this job. We have had 2 managers in a month and I'm not satisfied with how they haven't tried to work with the employees much. We are supposed to be a team and there is no ""I"" in team"
good,"The money doesnt pay bills , the manger doesnt care and acted  as if we were in high school , the customers made it worth while but they seen the problems with the store as well."
good,"Its a good place to work. Stressful at time with some loud crazy costumers. Otherwise its easy work running register, stocking, and cleaning inside and out."
good,I just feel like I was working a lot of hours no benefits the shift leader was rude to not only me but customers as well I needed something with more benefits
good,lots of physical Labor they treat u like a number Managers Lack experience and alot of People make there way to the Top following the supervisor around being the do boy i wouldnt recomend working here
good,"I got a long with the customers and the employees very well. Until the new manager started to work there. He cut my hours real short, I used to work 22 hours a week sometimes 18 hours a week, but he cut my hours down to 9.25 hours a week."
good,I was a manager for almost two years and you do way more than expected for very little pay and not very many days off. I was unhappy so I did what I love to do and that's tattoo
good,It is a busy job that keeps you moving. There is always things to do and inventory that needs to be stocked. The best part of the job is getting to meet interesting people.
good,The store i was at was not a great experience due to the constant thieves and drug addicts that would come into the store. Management was lackluster and the hours were very sporadic.
good,Started at expecting to get 18-24hr per week anything but that. Lucky to get 10 unless pick up hours at other DG. Not what I wanted. Had to fine work else where.
good,"Great place to work, opportunity to move up in the company. 401k, profit sharing. Work with the employees hand and hand. "
good,Great job and good people to work with. Hardest part was all the heavy lifting and pushing of carts. Hours wasn't steady and didn't always get the amount of hours needed.
good,Short staffing due to the lack of pay.  worker turnover is high. a lot of work left undone due to the lack of workers arriving on a daily bases to work.
good,"Overall, it was a good experience. My people skills increased significantly and it taught me that patience and a good work ethic was key. Some days were more stressful than others but my drive to be the best and do good didn’t allow me to give up. I felt that continuing a career at Dollar General wasn’t the direction I wanted to go in."
good,Dollar General is a wonderful starting job. i enjoyed working here. i was able to see new faces and i was able to grow my people skills while also learning how it was to be in a work environment
good,Sometimes it was slow and you would have to look for things to do to keep yourself busy. Most the time though you were busy running the register and putting away truck. If the line got too long asking for backup could be difficult at times. Could be stressful and fast paced. But it helps the time go by fast.
good,"I liked my team and the customers I worked with ever day, but the overall experience was not that satisfying. Corperate never wanted to fix issues, it just depends on the management team you get and how enjoyable they make it for their employees."
good,I worked here when pregnant and it was ok. They helped alot with my condition. Other than that it's an average job. Helps pay the Bill's. The staff was great to work with.
good,"The supervisors and co workers are the most important aspect of any job experience. I have a wonderful manager, so that goes a long way in coping with any problems on the job. Dollar General is one of the lowest paying retail jobs anywhere, but I’m 52 and had absolutely no retail experience, and this is very near my home. I could drive a little further and make more per hour, but I am satisfied for now."
good,I worked  at Dollar general but before I was let go the DM and I had words and the next thing I knew I was accused of not ringing up merchandise when asked I was told. It seemed to of had looked like I didnt
good,"From the time you would clock in, to the time we closed we were always so busy. Always shocking in the store but running back up front to ring customers in."
good,the job intelled alot of walking being on your feet for long periods of time the people were friendly and helped when you needed them it was not a bad place to work
good,"It was a great experience to have but I was happy to get a better job come available that was able to give me full-time, better pay and benefits from passed experiences with the company Franciscan Physicians Network."
good,"The company has a lot of turnover so there is a chance to move up, but almost not worth it based on how much work is needed. When you get to become a store manager, you have to work a minimum of 6 days a week, and not enough hours to have enough workers work for you. So sometimes you have to work by yourself in the mornings."
good,"love working here, but want to explore other options. learned a lot about customer service and dealing with different kind of people. Dollar General is a very great place to learn retail."
good,"Employee responsibilities continue to grow after hiring, the training was not thorough and enough, employees expected to work on their own, employees required to drive to other stores for work"
good,Bosses don't think where is best to put you for you to excel. You get moved around so much it is hard to make the rate they require. Many people bid out of an area they dislike but are sent back there ton
good,"Typical shifts for me in a management position include money accountability and making sure different tasks get done. Along with waiting on customers and making sure they get what they need. If you find the right manager things will work great, but there are some that make it really rough. The hardest part of the job is how they keep cutting our hours and adding more to our work load."
good,Waiting on customers refunds voids  deposits closing stores stocking shelves cleaning work where needed in other stores reports training mark downs reciev
good,its a good job high starting pay and bounses  a lot of paid time off .its really hot when the temperture is above 72 outside .the dresscode is relaxed  but you want to be saftey minded .
good,I have been in the Hospitality Industry for over 30 yrs. Customer satisfaction is my #1 priority. I have worked in the Food and Restaurant Industry. I am a team player.
good,I like what I did there but there was time were they work you to death but other then that I really like my manager and there were cool and always try to help you out if there was a problem.
good,It was a good job and I liked working there. I learned how to make drops and having neat and clean work area. Stocking the items and meeting different customers.
good,"Very busy at times   very strict on cash over/under  pay needs to be adjusted  co workers friendly locations clean "
good,"It is a face paced environment with wonderful customers and plenty of training opportunities. I learned a lot, sharpened and added to my skill set. Starting from a sales associate position and working hard to get to a management position affirmed my leadership and helped me treat everyone with respect. I am cross trained for every position and am able to run the store."
good,The store I was at needed a lot of work done to it the manager was great but the store it self needed work but we were only doing what we were taught but it was a good job
good,"Typical workflow was questionable. I've worked here for 6 months and have witnessed 3 managers quit and or get fired. Store had a few good employees but be ready to be left alone on occasion. Much is expected of you as you'd typically be doing many things at once whilst expected to get everything done in a timely manner. You'll need to stock shelves, work registers, and watch for customers who often steal from the store. Career advancement is nearly non-existent because the store follows a strict schedule. The greatest part was weekly pay."
good,The manager at times seemed more interested in looking at his phone than looking at you. Some of the people working there are really good at their jobs.
good,"This is an alright job to get off your feet. Decent pay, average shifts, and paid weekly. It is a challenge learning to balance stocking and working the register because it is a more laid back environment."
good,"It wasn't that bad for a starting job."
good,"management overturned quickly often a lack of communication"
good,"Initially took a part time night recovery position to supplement my college attendance. Was asked to take a full time Lead position after 6 mos., when I had to take a break to take care of a family member. Went back to school the next year after finding out the company offered a tuition reimbursement program. Met all requirements but was told a month before ending my semester, was sent an email saying I was exempt because of changing from full time to part time, which was not stated anywhere in the stipulations. Long story short, I had to withdraw because I had no time to prepare for non-re-compensation of the first semester. I did not receive any help from anyone, management or corporate. Stayed on a while because I was hoping for some type of reconciliation. So, don't count on the perks of going to school while working there."
good,"i loved working here at dollar general ,but they were not giving enough hours to any workers .so i had to make a change so i can further my development in my career ."
good,"It’s a good “in-between” job. There isn’t room to move up in the company, even though they sat there is, and the pay isn’t comparable to the amount of work you’re expected to do. It’s good for young people just starting out and older people after retirement, but that’s it."
good,"time consuming, fast paced, got to be quick, lots of work, nice to customers, kind employees, understanding of inconveniences, cared about their own employees and customers"
good,"I liked working at Dollar General. There were a few things that didn't seem right though, mainly the fact that something came missing, couldn't ""find it"" and i got fired for it. i was wrongfully accused also took way too long to get my last check"
good,The job was a good experience with working with the public.  I would have to keep the shelves stocked and I also would help customers whenever they needed help finding an item.
good,"General managers are selfish and very self centered, as in, if it's not about their well being they do not care. The job is easy but due to the slack on general managers, it can be very stressful."
good,"My time working at Dollar General was short lived because of the amount of pay involved.  At this point in my life having 2 growing children, they did not provide me with the security I wanted in a job."
good,I kinda didn’t like it. I felt like you didn’t really matter what you did. If you wanted floor stock you still had to do register. The customer were great but i didn’t like the people I worked wit. My boss was nasty and didn’t care about how you were treated
good,"The other employees are nice, understanding, and will help you learn. They do keep a happy air around the store but will make sure you are working. It is great."
good,"Setting up cash register for the day, stocking shelves"
good,"The people I worked with were all awesome but the amount of stuff you had to accomplish along with the number of staff and so few hours to complete was stressful. "
good,i haven't learn much from working there. training was not satisfied . i didn't have enough hour to learn anything. i did my best but the job never help.
good,This is a great job to have but don’t expect much in the way of pay. I really enjoyed working there...the managers were nice but unfortunately because of the low pay I had to find work elsewhere.
good,Enjoyed working with the people did a lot of merchandising handled reports opened and closed stores handled freight checked in vendors cleaned up stores helped with inventory reports and pre counting
good,"Not always the best place to work but the right crew can make all the difference when things are starting to get rough a the end of the day. "
good,During my time at DG there were many ups and downs. The work was rough and I don't feel like I was properly compensated until I was moved up to a management position. The only part I enjoyed was the people I worked with. My store manager was the greatest boss I could ever find.
good,It was a good experience.i learned what it takes to be an assistant.i had some long an stressful days but overall it was ok.i jus moved on to go an get my cna liscense
good,Good Job if you love Helping People Hours are decent but Pay is just not very Good I worked full time and didn't event make $10 an hour. good job for someone going through school
good,It was a good work experience overall. I learned how to stock and deposit money. I learned where almost everything was in the store. I learned the times where the store got busy and what should and shouldn’t go into the bags.
good,"Greet and interact with the customers"
good,The company itself was a blast to work for. Had a lot of hard days but that's to be expected of the type of work. The feeling of accomplishment was rewarding.
good,It’s a good job just Employes should get paid more and get noticed and appreciated for their hard work good think you get paid every week I steal of every other
good,"Upper management could care less about what happens to the people who actually keep the store running. They pile work onto us and expect us to keep the store looking like new with a quarter of the time we need. Not only that, but upper management likes to try and bully us into submission."
good,overall not a bad place for your first job. The hours where not to bad only when having to close they do not close until 12am. more hours would have been nice only got about 20-25 a week
good,Great place to work at most DG. But there are some that could use their managers more at their store.  The only draw back is they dont pay enough to live off of especially at 30 hrs and less.
good,working for this company was an great experience. i would open and close the company as needed. When the trucks came i would help with the stocking. Typical everything want as scheduled.
good,Stressful underpaid job all managers were miserable to hard to find a store manager that really did there job not treated fairly better companies to work for out there
good,A typical day was busy in the store I worked. My co-workers were easy to work with. I got good hours being a college student. I learned good management skills.
good,It's not worth minimum wage they work you to the max and your always short staffed because it takes the whole week to restock the store after you unloaded the truck by yourself and in between cusomers checking out. When it was time for a raise i kept getting put off because the district manager had to come fill in due to the store manager quitting. He was not a people person.
good,"The only thing I enjoyed about my job at Dollar General was the people, those I worked with and the customers. Would I ever consider working for Dollar General again? No"
good,The company gave me a chance to prove my work ethic.  And the work was good. The store is located in a residential neighborhood. There were a lot of repeat customers so it was easy to learn their names. It had a neighborhood feel.
good,"I started working in the non con department, I bid out to an easier job and they would always send me back to the hard job to help. That is why I quit."
good,It was a easy job with some obstacles but nothing challenging co workers were great and helpful. Pay was fair for what the job was and was well operated by the store manager
good,They give you good hours when your first start but then cut them when you’re a couple weeks in. I started off with 30 hours and the next 3 months I had maybe 12
good,"This was a good job for some one who loves to be on there feet a lot and loves a challenge. Seemed like there was a lot of theft and some times the customers were very hard to deal with, I even had to phone the police a few times. Between the assigned work and the scary customers I would never take a job with Dollar General again not for love or money."
good,Being a store manager was a great challenge at this company. They don't give you enough hours to run a store effectively and it was struggle to find good help at minimum wage.
good,None I don't have really much of a review to give you this job is not really working out from my personal case but however it may be very good for someone else that's all I can tell you most of the time it is a very pleasant working environment it's just not a good fit for myself personally
good,Don’t miss working here unfortunately. My coworkers were very nice but management was not the best the store has real potential tho. And they have great coupon deals
good,"I've worked for DG for almost a year. I keep getting skipped over when it comes to promotion's. I've watched 3 people jump in front of me when it comes to promotion's. I'm the hardest worker at this store by far, other higher than me does nothing and gets more money an hour than me."
good,Main manager was nice. The assistant manager always made you feel stupid and worthless. Would not recommend working here unless you have no where else to go
good,They are awesome and they train you for whatever position you apply for! They are patient and help you with anything and everything and they always answer questions or concerns. Scheduling is weird well at the store I worked at. Pay is good they started me out at $8.50 as a cashier/sales associate and after a year you get a raise. They offer health and car insurance as well as 401k.
good,"My position was a team leader and my tasks were being organized, good people's skills and cashier. The management was kind of not organized by managers that were lacked of being organized. So team leaders had to step up and make sure the store was ok. I am very good at customer service"
good,"When I would work, I would help the customers if they couldn't found something they were looking for. Also I would check them out when they are done found everything they needed."
good,"As a store manager, you had to be there monday thru Sunday, sometimes open to close, from 6am to 10pm at night, open eveeyday of the year, but not Christmas, got rob at gun point, thats the reason i left"
good,Stayed busy all the time. You will never be bored. You will go back and forth between running registers and stocking shelves. If you aren’t stocking or waiting on customers you will clean. Little to no down time.
good,Dollar General is a fun place to work when it comes to helping the customers.  The management team need help with talking to the employees in a good manner.
good,The manager i had was amazing but your overworked for little money even she is and it's sad because she is a outstanding worker. I would go back to help her if she needs me but other than that I'll pass.
good,"High turnover for management, higher ups don't seem to care about store upkeep, just lacking the attention the company needs. Most stores need a major overhaul and a MASSIVE clean up job, management can be somewhat stretched to do way too much in one day with the given amount of staff on hand. Generally just an odd company to work for."
good,worst place I have ever worked for understaffed low wages poor management underqualified managers have no idea what they are doing no benefits except for management and ft which is not even avaiable
good,A typical day consist of opening the store and confirming paperwork/deposit from the day before.  Stocking and providing excellent customer service.  Daily phone calls with District manager.  Diverse culture. The job is very demanding and the most difficult part was not having enough hour to support demand. I could never comprehend their scale.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,I  help my customer  make should. They  are. Happy.   I learn everything about  jobs.   The  manager  it not to good to work for.    I make  should  my job  is done before I leave everyday.   Customers come first  to. All way.
good,I did enjoy working at Dollar General for a while. I advanced to store manager on duty after only a couple days working due to pass experience. My manager at the time was very flexible and understanding. The manager that took over her job was not flexible at all and didnt care about anyone but himself. Even the customers did not care for him. Unfortunately that was the reason I left to find another job. The pay was just minimum wage and the hours were not all that great either. It was alot of work on truck days having only 2 people in store working. When I got hurt on the job it took almost a year to get my workmen compensation. Very upset by that.
good,Making sure ready for any promotion great benefits they also support wounded warriors projects continue to make sure schedule flexible great management
good,"Assistant Manager I enjoyed working with the employees and assisting customers."
good,"Nice employees work well with others"
good,"I came in early around 5 in the morning and i would be unloading trucks, helping put product out on to the shelfs, and cutting up boxes.  The job was a nice job to have for it to be my first time actually working and I appreciate the experience."
good,"I loved working for Dollar General, my co workers were all very nice and helpful, and management was always there when i needed assistance of any kind."
good,"I learn a lot of people skills in my year there. The scheduling was good always worked around my school and such, and the people were awesome. I had a great time working there."
good,"A typical day at work would include welcoming people into the store, stocking while not working register. When working register having, I believe what is a 5 second scanning time for each item."
good,You only have 2 employees working a shift. This is not enough to maintain store and help customers so can be stressful. At times there is only one employee on duty when the other is on break.
good,I don’t know. I didn’t work there long. But for the amount of time I was there I got to learn the how the register worked how it really was dealing with everyday customers and why it was such a big deal to make sure your customers left happy and wanted to return.
good,"A lot at register when line is packed also when new stock comes in it is very heavy and can be dangerous "
good,It was a productive and fast paced environment but the hours varied way to drastically and if you had to come in on a weekend they wouldn't work with you if you already had prior engagements.
good,"Great place to work at if you enjoy autonomy. You have to balance so many tasks on a typical two-man shift. Typically a sales associate would stock shelves, be a cashier, and recover."
good,"While most of the people were fantastic to work with, the pay was minimal and there was a relatively large turnover rate between people not wanting to show up for work and finding a better job. There were some weeks when they would cut hours and leave the managers with hardly any help to function. We were a large store and the largest grocery store in the town but they tried to make it run like one of the small Dollar General stores."
good,Job was stressful store never cleaned and manager rude. They talked to us employees crazy and didn’t care about how we feel. Also didn’t manage the store right
good,Wasn't all that fun because the boss was really hateful.  Got accused of a lot. It had some good times but most were really stressful a lot of stuff kept breaking and it was a brand new building.
good,"Truly a difficult store to manage given payroll and budgeting constraints. They did not adjust hours based upon sales increases nor shifting trends in business. Excellent business model from a corporate stand point, not so much from the front lines."
good,Working at dollar general has its pros and cons. The best part of working their to me was that it wasn’t as busy as other stores I worked in so I could take more time on some of my projects
good,"Just know that when some thing happens in your personal life, You can not miss work or ask for time off without the another employee taking your shift."
good,"nice and smooth "
good,I only worked at Dollar General for a few months while I attended school. The time that I was there I enjoyed working there because of the supervisor that I had. She was honest and fair and made work enjoyable. The ladies that I worked with worked as a team so it made the time run easier and faster.
good,Working at Dollar General has taught me a lot about why customer service is so important. I enjoyed working with an amazing group of people and enjoyed all the laughter and lesson that was brought to me. Making me become a better human and to never give up.
good,Due to personal reasons I am looking for another place of employment but the company itself is a decent place to work. There is always someone who answers the phone to help out a fellow manager when they are in need.
good,Overall decent job. Very nice place to work. Friendly employees and co workers. A few customers were making the job a little easier and staying busy helped time go by quicker.
good,Work there kinda makes you humble and also helps u get to know people and thing help techies you how to coop with others  I regularl day here is kinda fast nice passé halo u get more done
good,dollar General is a good place to work... they pay well and the growth is outstanding... 900 stores a year. However the workload is high and the company has tons of turnover within the company
good,"I was used.. I was always working nights, and weekends..  The manager was really unfair when it came to someone else closing.. It was always me.. Almost always worked nor then 9 hours a day always short staffed"
good,At the time I came became a employee I was on my own the next day I wasn’t fully trained to the best of my knowledge which yes I always had to call the manager up to the front but overall it was a great experience with the customers everyday
good,I would work anywhere from 10 to 15 hours a week. I would work varying shifts from mornings one day to nights and sometimes night shift then a morning shift back to back.
good,"I did my best to show up at time expected. I really enjoyed working with my manager and co workers.  I Tried to handle situations to the best of my ability I. Helped customers to locate a certain product and helped them concerning price differences. I would refer kindly to customers to speak to the manager or assistant manager on duty regarding returns, problems, defective items, or help retrieving items unreachable. Truly enjoyable experience. Lots of work, but we'll worth it."
good,Its a good starter job for kids right out of high school to help them get on their feet. You would be working at the front desk and the cash registers.
good,It paid the bills The management at first was great to work for but they all left. when the new management came in it was a difficult company to work for.
good,I was promised a position and never got it because I got pregnant shortly after starting. I worked hard everyday. Very stressful environment. Great customers.
good,"	Supervise entry-level employees, assist in the hiring process, and overseeing retail operations."
good,I started as a key holder and worked my way up the ranks. I learned about retail in many ways. It was definitely a different challenge everyday. Daily duties would be different.
good,"In-store experiences at Dollar General are typically pleasant. The district managers that I encountered were at best ""somewhat nice"". Most seem upset with their position and take it out on the store employees."
good,"This company is not a bad company to work for but also not the best. The store managers are overworked and unpaid, and so are their employees. The hourly salary does not match the tasks and stress the employees must deal with."
good,You're constantly talking with customers and staff throughout the shift. I didn't like how there were only two people working at a time at the location  I was at.
good,Very basic customer service job. My manager only talked to me to tell me what I didnt get done in the 4 hour shift I got scheduled to work. Knowing I got done what I possibly could in a 4 hour shift. They wouldn't give me anymore hours because every other employee worked full-time and.needed their hours apparently.
good,"Can get very busy on some days and there may be only one person at the cash register. Always on your feet and being productive, for example stocking shelves when necessary."
good,Would be a great place to work if the company was more organized and competitive. Also if they treated their long term employees better. I also think the incentives could be better as well as pay
good,I liked working here but I felt like the manager didn't do enough on her part. The employees were hard workers and did everything the manager asked and then some. I feel like she should have done more as her job title instead of putting it on everyone else.
good,Good place to work.loved working with public and employees. But there were no benefits.1/2 hour lunch. Family friendly.hours varied didn't get enough.
good,The customers were very nice. The management was inconsistent on some things. There was a very high turnover rate and it was in a very small town so the customers always knew when someone was new. I think there needs to be a look at the management and how they treat employees.
good,I enjoyed working for dollar general. Great pay for assistant managers. Benefits as son as you’re hired. Great hours and work with your availability flexible hours
good,"The job was good, my problem was with the management. I was told to find another job after working there for a few months because I was not full time."
good,"Typical day of work was steady."
good,"While working for DG, I've learned how to properly multitask. Being a shift manager, I have to run register and complete my assigned tasks everyday. I had to learn how to open and close the store, count down all money, and take on the position of store manager when needed."
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work, Enjoyed working with the public and meeting new people. The hours were manageable and the travel time was close to my residence."
good,there okay not the best they do need some work but other than that its a good company to get your foot in the door for retail business. its pretty easy to catch on how to do things.
good,I worked at the one in Iuka and there is alot of drama there. I would not recommed anyone to work there. Loved the customers. They only had me scheduled for 1 day a week
good,Security has improved with this job. A typical day at work consisted of early mornings because you had to stock but other then that it was a great environment to work in.
good,face paced plenty of room for advancement but needs better upper management. and better pay for starting level pay . very stressful on managers which makes it stressful on the rest
good,It was long hours and very hard work but very good pay. I like the money i was being paid there and the people that i worked with.  It was an overall good experience
good,The management here was horrible. If things didn't go her way she would get mad and take you off the schedule. Other employees were fine and very helpful and everyone got along and that is what the manager didn't like. I learned that you can not let people run you off because of their ways and actions. It takes a bigger person to stand up to a boss who's acting very childish.
good,"never paid me on time worked there for 3 months and didn't get paid til i left."
good,"typical day at work would be ringing out guest taking payments via cash checks debit/credit . Stocking and loading an unloading the truck. monitoring the front end,"
good,Is was a nice place just unorganized people quit every day they can’t keep anyone there because the job is so stressful because people don’t want to work and then it makes you work even harder because now you have to do 2 or 3 trucks at one time and that is very stressful on people
good,I wasn't really a fan of this place. Management judged you as soon as you come in for an interview and based their opinions of you off of past workers.
good,"it’s an okay job, nice customers and staff. Although it’s not somewhere I wanna see myself continuing to work. I get about 25 hours a week if that. I would like my career to take off soon."
good,poor management and it was contagious with the employees. good relax environment  good pt time job but wouldn't recommend it for full time work place and advancement
good,very fast past it hurts your back and you work had. the time goes by fast everybody takes breaks together and its hard to find a seat sometime not a lot
good,There is a lot of heavy lifting in a very fast paced work environment. Must be able to be on your feet for hours on end and have a positive attitude. Be a great team member
good,"while employed at dollar general warehouse i was trained and certified operating the single and double pallet jack stow, sit down and stand up forklifts, clamp lift and the slip machine"
good,"I don’t really have to much to say it was cool working there even though I had to deal with stuck up customers , lazy employees , & a boss that acts like she doesn’t care for real it’s been a breeze"
good,"It was fast paced, hard work to maintain a continuous stock flow in a building that never grew with the size of the stock growth. Managing time to handle stock with customer needs was challenging."
good,"I did not mind any part of what the job entailed.  I had no problem completing customer transactions, stocking the shelves, or cleaning the stores.  The problem I had with this job was the manager of the store.  The manager would consistently give me the weekend stocking shift that he was supposed to work without asking me first.  These quickly became pretty much the only hours I would be give each week.  The manager would also criticize the work I did even if I did it correctly.  This among other things is what convinced me that I could not work at this location any longer."
good,"putting up products and waiting on customers, work fast and produtive and setting up new displays,make sure work was done works with everyone, open, lifting heavy items, holidays"
good,Dollar general was very close to my home and the people in that area weren't always friendly. I called it a bad drug area there were people shoplifting all the time I even had to threaten to call the police a few times.
good,"When I worked at Dollar General the management was horrible! The store was normally busy with only one cashier working, and sometimes when you called for help nobody came to help."
good,customer service is a big deal at dollar general if you cant deal with all backgrounds of people its not for you there will be conflict when something doesn't ring up right and you have to deal with it properly to insure that you don't lose business
good,Truck day is the hardest part.  Someone calling out is stressful.  I have learned togive great customer care which is the enjoyable part. Management does not care about your life period. Work culture is diverse.
good,Great place if you are a kid with no real bills. Everyone is friendly and the job is easy. The truck is the easiest part and the customers are the best
good,"I would greet customer, solve queries and concern, clean my work space. I learned how to did with rude customers. Management needs improvement. The hardest part of the job was knowing how to calm a upset customer down. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to brighter a customer day sometime with a warm greet."
good,i enjoyed working for dollar general everyone got along most days and if any issues came up they were solved in a timely manner they were pretty good at giving you days off when needed
good,"Worked there while I put myself through college, a simple symbiotic relationship was established and it worked out pretty great for me. Still friendly with my former manager when I stop in to shop as a customer now."
good,Like most retail jobs its a good start to get used to being in the work force and if you have to it could end up being a career. For me it was a stepping stone the hours are flexible at time but depending on the month and the availability of others it can become inconsistent.
good,"Hours can be late at night"
good,My team was ok but Corp was a pain to deal with they would work us like dogs and not allow enough people to be hired on. They only keep a skeleton crew
good,It was over all ok.. I mean it was a job so it got the bills paid.. I am more passionate about funeral homes and embalming work it is a dream job for me honestly and I am working so hard towards it
good,"The employees were pretty nice, but the customers were extremely unpleasant. At least at the few stores I worked at, the customer base was rude, to say the least. They had a tendency to make a pretty easy job difficult."
good,At first all good liked the people i worked with and then new managers came in and wasnt doing there job i was doing what they were supposed to be doing at the end of the shift
good,Wasn't a bad place to work I just didn't like how they run they shipping department we use to have to load the 18 wheelers by hand and the line never shop running so it's easy to hey behind
good,"While working at dollar general, I really did not do much. It was very slow and nobody really came in. It also was very slow at night. All I did was check people out at the register and stock items."
good,I was a Sale person. I work the floor and clean and restock the shalves. Its an okay steady work area with meeting new people on a daily and getting to know the regulars on daily.
good,Trueful it felt a unsafe place to work. They kinda give u little training and just throw to the sharks. Everyone was always talking and was treated like a idiot for needing help.
good,Dollar General was a great place to work and help people when they needed it. I enjoyed meeting new people and talking to customers on a daily basis. I enjoyed seeing new products for sale and explaining to customers how the products would benefit them in there everyday life.
good,"Typical day at work would be changing and hanging price tags, unloading the truck, stocking the shelves and ringing out customers. Helping guest located items within the store"
good,The job itself isn't bad but the policies in place that limit the hours a manager can staff the store. This and the fact most stores only have two employees on shift make it difficult to perform all job task
good,"it is a ok company to work for they do not pay that much and it takes forever to get a pay raise the company trys to take care of it customers but not it""s employees"
good,my typical day consisted of working the cash register and keeping products stocked. Management was very good and helping me understand how to do my job. My coworkers were also very friendly and helpful.
good,The job itself was decent.  The manager was not very good however.  Many customers were very regular and knew most of us by name and normal shift.  I recommend the company but not the specific location
good,I recommend dollar general to anyone who is looking for extra money and in need of a job to gain expierience in the work force. The work is simple and the environment is good.
good,it was Ok but they had a problem with work scheduling or i would still be working there. really enjoyed working with co works and customers. Was really nice it was close to my home.
good,Dollar General helps you learn the register and improve your cashier qualifications. Certain locations are team oriented to get the job done. Management always needs improvment. Thers always a task to be done so you will never be bored.
good,If you’re looking for something where you’re moving all the time in this fast-paced job for you as far as upward mobility I’m not really sure I haven’t been there long enough to know.
good,"My typical work days are about 16hrs if you are short staffed"
good,"Poor Management "
good,If you wanna work your life away this job is for you. Store managers are required to work minimum 50 hours a week. Work hours alone. Poor higher up management.
good,I have learned a lot that you have to have patience and you have to be fast and listen very well   The hottest part of the job was having to deal with negative customers but it was a kid it every day mainly but the management was good they help me through a lot and didn’t give up on me
good,"extremely unorganized. very few people actually work. the managers and assistants do nothing but blame people. stores always a mess, way too much drama in the workplace"
good,I enjoy working at dollar general 75% of the time. My coworkers are amazing and its like we are one big family. There have been many opportunities for me to promote to a higher position. And they are flexible with hours when it comes to going to school.
good,Not a bad place to work. Needed more hours to live on. Over all if you are looking for low hours and something to keep you from being bored work here.
good,Each morning you would either be unloading stock from trucks or putting stock away in between assisting customers with question or cashing them out at the register.
good,"only a part-time job to supplement my full-time  job. "
good,"Worked here for 3 months and it wasn't bad but the pay was. Minimum wage just isn't enough for anything at all besides a kid in high school. If you want an indoor job and like working in customer service/retail, this is a great place to be."
good,"Lots of hours, in your interview  you’re told you’re going to work a 8 hours a day for 4 days a week. When you actually start working you find out it’s 12 hr shifts for 5-6 days a week. No telling when the schedule may change it’s a day to day thing. All the managers seem to care about is how many cases are pulled, you have to hit 100 percent all shift literally. 30 min lunch, two 10 min breaks. Outside of the pay it’s hard to find motivation for that kind of schedule, work/life balance doesn’t seem to exist there."
good,The job was very stressful and demanding.  Associates had to work at least 4-6 hours in store by themselves.  There were no bonuses given to anyone other than the manager.
good,"dollar general was my first job at first is was nerve wrecking, but as I progressed through my time working i was helped a lot with learning how to my job. i was pretty laid back sometimes drama but other that pretty good."
good,If you worked full-time at dollar general that may be beneficial but working part-time was not the best. I would receive 4-16 hours a week and it was a very slow job that did not pay much.
good,"I loved working there, it was a fun atmosphere . My co-workers loved me and the fact that I cleaned all the time. I did not take breaks all the time either.I cleaned out the milk case."
good,"I've learned to always be patient and calm, we've also been threw 2 managers and 2 DM'S , they were about to make me a key holder but I found a better job with a better opportunity"
good,The job of being a Lead Sales Associate was appealing to me but the lack of employees every shift as well as the inconsistent hours made the job a lot less enjoyable
good,"Needs to work more hours customers are nice.Pay could be better,keeping store clean,putting item's back in stocking,keep parking lot clean helping customers"
good,"I had fun while working there, but I knew it wouldn't last long because it was just a temporary job for me.  Hours were flexible and I enjoyed helping customer within the community."
good,i loved my job its just the constant thieving by the customers all the time the company should have better security or hired security for this purpose
good,I really enjoyed assisting the Customers to find the products thats they needed. I did have the oppurnity to make some friends working at this location.
good,Was next in line for promotion but they hired someone rude  to the customers and never worked in customer service if not for that I would of stayed. Hours weren’t bad picked up a lot of shifts and was trained to be a manager. Felt under appreciated and wasn’t even offered a raise.
good,Management was poor . Imperfessional no communication when it came to the schedule. No communication on any issues or write up I’ve gotten . Would use other employees to pass Messages to me .
good,The job is ok for what it is. It wasnt my best job but I'm thankful I was able to work it. I was giving an opportunity to do the job to the best of my ability.
good,Dollar General offers great benefits.  There is opportunity for advancement in the company.  I was able to learn great customer service skills. Great customers.
good,Dollar General doesn't pay more than minimum wage for those just starting in customer service. For those who do not move up past cashier their pay over 7 years is only $2 more than minimum wage.
good,The store had a new manager when I was there and the store was messy and cludder we were always short handed with employee's some of them quit so I left for Bette work.
good,Company has transition loss prevention personnel to operator personnel. Want to use DM/RD to bring a different loss prevention team of thinker when it comes to shrink.
good,"Just a normal cashier job, on a typical day customers are steady, the hardest part of the job is when the new stock comes in and having to juggle the cash register and stock items"
good,It was an alright job. I love greeting the coustmers as they walked in. I loved hearing some of them all about there day. I really enjoyed getting to know some of my neighbors
good,"I liked working at dollar general,  its just there are lot and lots of shop lifters a d they expect you to go after them , but they wouldn't do it there self ."
good,store is always cluttered. no matter how much u clean the store is always messy.build a healthy relationship with your co workers because at night u are alone.
good,working for this company and just out of high school it was ok it was a starter job and it paid enough then when i worked there. But i dont really remember the mangers.
good,Ok this position was cool management wasn't the best I would love to see more diversity however there are some good things like location is a decent spot
good,"Small teams, if your lucky you will have 3 team members in the store at one time. Turnover rate is very high. I seen numerous Employees Quit or Walk off."
good,"I started working for DG to pay extra bill that had come up with me going to college. It was great, until I transferred and started working for someone else. I was constantly judged for what I did and how i did it. I was never informed enough for the day and I always was in trouble for it. IF you work at DG find a fair manager."
good,"A typical work day always consisted of checking out customers and stocking the shelves in between customers. Management however, was not very good. It wasn't always a very organized place to work."
good,Okay place to work but some customers are not the best. Store Manager was great but pay sucks. Managers only make $9/hr and there’s only a $0.25 raise every year.
good,pretty good place to work pay wasnt enough for the work you were expected to do. great people there. didnt like being sent to other stores to work. not enough hours for each employee loved the customers in that area+
good,There was no playing games or goofing off due to constantly having tasks to complete. You have to complete these tasks in order to leave when scheduled to get off. It was a serious work place with a strict instructions to make sure everything flowed as smoothly as possible.
good,"They don't offer many hours to their employees, the pay is ok but not great. If you are looking for something part-time this might be for you but usually won't get more than 30 hours a week"
good,I work there when I was in high school and college play wasn't that great but the hours are flexible my boss was fabulous became 3rd key after 2 years.
good,"Working at dollar general has its pros and cons , depending on the area workloads can be bigger as opposed to some weeks where there is barely any work just making sure customer is satisfied"
good,"I had a good time working , not enough staff on a shift ever. also they put so much freight into the back it was hazardous and over stacked. my manager was great."
good,to be honest the dollar general I worked at was a mess. stock was never rotated and cleaning almost never done. organizational skills were mediocre at best.
good,didnt really work there long enough to get a good feel of the company.  do know sometimes there really wasnt enough man hours to get things zoned.. or plan o grams to be efficiate
good,"It was a okay job, the pay wasn't worth all the responsibilities for the job title, and the management wasn't all that qualified for their positions and it showed in the store."
good,"I am a stocker by preference and experience. Was hired as an ASM to concentrate on making sure weekly trucks get stocked on floor. As a key holder, I can't seem to get anything stocked due to cashier mistakes, long lines, or any other thing imaginable that the front needs help with. An ASM is expected to stock (empty) 6 totes in an hour, while a cashier is given an hour to do one. An ASM is expected to empty one roll-tainer of stock in an hour in addition to fill-in cashier when lines get backed up, keying in to register to correct cashier mistakes, voiding products customers decide they do not want, cashier lunch or bathroom breaks or having to fill in due to cashiers calling off at the last minute. I genuinely hate this job. I was told at hire that I would not spend much (very limited) time on the register, that my primary responsibility is to ""push the truck"" (stock the freight as quickly as possible). I am tired of being reprimanded for not being able to push stock, when I am constantly being called up front. I just want to be left alone to stock the merchandise and keep the floor clean for our customers. I am actively looking for a new job. Hopefully in merchandising where all you do is stock, mostly. BUT NO CASHIERING, WHICH I DESPISE!!!!"
good,The hrs are bad the pay is bad.  They lie to you It's a good location i like the work but not the hrs and the pay is lousy they say they have your back and they don't help you when you need the day off you loose a day
good,A typical day at there was coming in g early morning to stock for a few hours and then I'd switch to cashier. I'd work 4-8 hours a day and it was good until they cut hours.
good,"It wasn't a very good job, the hours were never the same the people and managers were rude, the pay wasn't good, the manager were not ready to do their jobs"
good,You have to be welling to work and do your job because it one thing goes wrong it get tough and customers get angry. But overall it was a good place to work at
good,"A typical day at Dollar General usually goes very quickly for me any way. It is always busy. Work rigister, help customers. stock shelves set plannograms etc. I am one that likes to keep busy. Just need full time hours. Most enjoyable part of the job to me is the customers.Workplace is decent. Always learning something new for myself each week like some things I'm not used to, that they do differently from when I was a previous key holder.Hardest part of the job to me is running to get someone and having to leave register with customers waiting. I personally do not like to do this."
good,It's a good company that pays decent and is easy to do if you need something right away. They are quick in the application process. Once you learn your job it's all easy pay.
good,Love going to work and helping customers. Work at times are fun. Work place friendly. Get along with management. Coworkers are great. Overall love working at dollar general and helping customers.
good,"My Dollar General manager was very willing to teach me anything and everything that I had questions about; this was my first retail job, and this is where I learned to use a register. My coworkers were very patient with me, and were always helpful. This job taught me to come out of my shell and how to converse with the public. Also, there was always something that needed to be done, which gave me plenty more to learn."
good,The job was easy the only things I would encounter with was theft of customers and unequal. When I started I was told that everyone had to clean before their shift ended and that would never happen and because I always closed I’d get stuck mopping and sweeping the store alone.
good,had poor management never liked you to take a day off always rude to employees the job was stressfull and aggravating and I learned some but very little had to basically learn every thing on my own
good,It was a nice job. The work was easy and the customers were great. The only downside was coupons. Coupons could make or break a mood on the work floor.
good,"It is a good job. Just something to get some work experience. They don't give you much training so you learn as you go. "
good,"Dollar general is a fun active friendly environment. You're able to stock, and check people out. Giving the employees a chance to move around without standing in one place for long periods of time. I enjoyed every day of work."
good,Very stressful environment and lack of communication. The Pay for being a cashier is extremely low for the work you do. Most enjoyable part was my coworkers. The hardest part was having having a boss who did not communicate with you.
good,"The hours and pay are very poor for our area.  I only worked like 12 hours a week for $7.75 an hour.  "
good,"as keyholder I would open store, take care of deposits and open registers. I would help with inventory, stocking shelves and cleaning of store. At night I would close out registers do paperwork and lock up. At times I would work alone in store taking care of customers."
good,"A typical day at DG can just be stocking shelves to running a register to both. Advancement seems slim even after being promised it multiple times, hours are inconsistent and too few. Pay is lowest it can be with no ways to gain raises or incentives without advancement into the company."
good,"There is almost always only two people working, one cashier and one manager, and they’ve got to accomplish sometimes a lot of tasks while tending to the register and dealing with angry customers. Luckily, my manager is rather laid back and understands when things don’t get completely done but I know other managers at DG aren’t as nice when it comes to those things. There is very little stress when it comes to making mistakes, so it’s relaxed in that way, but sometimes when you’re the only cashier and the line gets backed up with 7 or 8 people in it things get really stressful, especially when you’ve got multiple other tasks to complete. The computers and registers also mess up very frequently and sometimes the card machine will stop working completely during a lunch rush which is another frustrating thing about the job. Overall, the job is really nice for someone who can handle a little stress sometimes and is maybe trying to finish school or something and just needs extra cash. Not great for someone trying to support a family."
good,It was a fun place to work. I met new friends and the manager was able to work around my full time job. Hours very flexible. Easy place to work and still make decent money.
good,"At typical work day would consist of stocking shelves, checking out customers and being a help anyway I could. From this job I learned that you have to have patience."
good,"I enjoyed working at dollar General, I loved my customers. And the seemed to really love me. It was Very busy but that's what makes the job exciting and fun."
good,"A typical day at work is alot of assignments, as i had to cash out customers and at the same time do returns, keep my 300 feet nice and neat and also at the end of the night sweep the entire store and mop the entire store as well as throw out the trash."
good,I wanted to become a store manager and within 3 months I made my goal. It is a daily challenge to keep the store 100% customer at all times. Difficult to do without the proper team and lack of help from upper management.
good,"the job at dollar general is good. Work was ok. management"
good,It was a good company to work for I was there for 1yr I was a shift manager my time there I went thru 5 different managers but other then that is was a nice company to work for.
good,I only got the job because they were looking for seasonal help. I ended up working more as full time after the holidays. I got along great with the manager but not with some of the co-workers as some were too stuck on themselves and did not want to work and do their job.
good,"Not a bad company to work for. If you find the right store and management team, it's a fun job. Recommend for someone who is just beginning to work or wanting a career in the retail industry."
good,"I loved the job itself, however, upper management was never satisfied with the work. they had unrealistic epectations. I was an assistant manager and I never received proper training to do what I was asked to do."
good,Keep a record of anything you do.  Including all phone calls.  Tjere is alot of denial in the upper mgmt of things thatvyou are directed to do and for some reason the upper mgmt seems to have no recolection.
good,I enjoyed travelling to help out he other stores very much. It was very full-filling being able to help the people and the stores get prepared for success.
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General.  The management was kind and professional. The hours were consistent and flexible. But I will say it seemed like I didn't have enough free time from work. I also never advanced in position or salary raises/bonuses.
good,I got really bad anxiety and stress working for Dollar General.  They do not pay enough for the work they expect you to achieve. I would not recommend anybody.
good,"This job is really good, I had good hours, decent pay, nice people, and advancement opportunities, had I not had to relocate i would have been made key holder in just 3 short months of working there!!"
good,the rude customers. The people that could not find there items that they were looking for. the one trying to get a discount one something that not on sale and yelling at us saying it is our fault.
good,"Too much work "
good,This is a great entry level position that is geared to give individuals an introduction to the field of customer service. Flexible hours and opportunities for advancement are a plus.
good,Great Place To Work At A Few Days / Nights A Week And You Get Paid Weekly On Fridays . Get To Communicate With Others And Their personalities and a insight on retail .
good,I felt unsafe and the hours were unsteady. I loved my coworkers and most of my customers but the responsibility that was put on me as a key holder was too much for my mental health to handle.
good,dollar general was a good job but it wasn't the right one for me I put in so much to deal with the job and it wasn't paying that much . that kind job was for just for school
good,"Comfortable company to work for. The manger was will to teach how to do the planogram work the hand handheld machine on how to order, to do return pack away."
good,"New Manager really lacking skills with people and management"
good,We haz yo always stay busy stalking or with customer.  Personally I needed more hours and they could not prove them.  It was a small store in a small town and could not justify  giving more hours.
good,A typical work day can be very early or very late.  The company rotated me to several stores across the city for almost a year before I was assigned a permanent store.  While I was paid mileage for these travels it was stressful going from one end of the city to the next on any given day.
good,a typical day of work was productive. we always joined together and stocked our assigned areas. we helped one another when possible. Helped customers as often as possible and tried helping sell certain items when necessary. we did our best to follow orders for the day but busy days made it sometimes hard to do.
good,To much favoritism going on and they expect way to much on a work day not everything can get done in one day they expect u to recover the whole store and still get out on time
good,"Had to work full time hours with part time pay. Didn't give me much time to study for college. The work was easy, but overworked and underpaid. Decent starting job for anyone willing to work."
good,Management at Dollar General has no life work balance. It requires a 6 day work week. The company works on a small crew per store and turnover is large due to not being able to give employees enough hours to live on.
good,the district manager at the time was a butt she always tried to get someone fired there aren't any breaks you have to eat while you work the loss prevention guy was a butt to
good,"dollar general helped me by working around my schedule.. the hardest part of the job was multi tasking between the register, the freight, and the customers."
good,It is a great beginners job a teaches you time management and how to multi task.  The base pay is minimum wage so it does not cover cost of living. Friendly environment
good,"My work day changed from day to day depending on business needs. A typical day could consist of stocking, supervising employees, preparing bank deposits and change orders, and checking in vendors. Planograms and display work were also a vital part of my job, as well as doing inventory counts of out of stocks and overstock. I enjoyed interaction with customers and employees. The most difficult part of the job was maintaining proper staffing levels. Dollar General starts most employees at minimum wage, with keyholders being paid slightly more. Most competing employees in the area offer eight dollars or more per hour."
good,Very good place to work .I enjoy the time I spend at work. The hardest part of the job is work/life balance and the distance I travel to work every day.
good,I enjoyed working at dg for the most part. They do treat the management pretty bad and do not like giving people the hours they need so they will not be hired in full time benefits
good,"Very Fast Paced Environment"
good,Over all the employees were welcoming and easy going. The hours were flexible and overtime was offered.  The customers were respectful and really involved in donating to local charities.
good,I didn't like working there. The box were so heavy that it hurt my back and I had a hard time finding the product where it was supposed to go on the shelf.  The people were hard to work with too.
good,Its good place to work if your in high school. You cant manage a home with that pay salary especially for what you have to do and deal with in that line of work.
good,"This company I feel is okay for short term work opportunities, the company cares more about the company and not too much about the employee, but what the company must realize is that the store cannot thrive without its employees."
good,it was great place to work.I just want to advance in timely manner. i have been district manager in training for over 3 years and the people above me keep relocating or getting fired.
good,"Dollar General was my first job ever and I started as a Key-Holder which was like a manager on duty. I was still in high school so I was supposed to work part-time but that wasn't always the case especially since once school ended and it was the summer I was still ""part-time"" but I was working full-time hours regularly. I was asked to work at my ""home"" store and then also work at a store 30 minutes away while they were trying to get more help over there. You sometimes work with people who are something else and you can work in some shady areas but overall it was a good job for me at the time. I was making money and I work a lot of overtime so I got paid more each paycheck, I didn't really get a great last summer before starting college because of how much I worked but I was able to pay for most of the stuff that would go into my dorm without any help."
good,I loved my job but the peoples  it was a great company to work with and for.i would tell anybody that this job is meant for you and you will love the job
good,Working with this company was an amazing opportunity for my first Job. Dollar General has an amazing environment to work in and amazing co-workers. Also was able to meet amazing life changing people
good,Job being threatened on a consistent basis. No help from higher management. I ran a store only one on payroll for 2 weeks by myself open to close. There is no work/life balance.
good,"Some of the things that I learn working there is that you have to make sure, the merchandise has to be all the way to the front of the shelf, and that you have to mop every night."
good,"This is a nice place to work if its your first job, its a family type of company and you get to know the people that you work with. So thats what its like to work for them."
good,"Dollar General in Knightdale, NC is an alright place to work, but the manager kept hiring people we did not need. Hours were stretched so thin I only worked 2 days a week for only 3 hours. While working there the manager was unreliable and in the long run I was wasting too much gas, for that few of hours."
good,Pretty relaxed job for the most part. Fast paced and consistent overall nit a bad experience just wish the pay was better for the type of work. Few days off not manny
good,Overall was good place to work. Once you work in one warehouse your have worked in them all. They try and compete with the other warehouses and is worth trying if your willing to work.
good,Dollar General is alright but don’t expect anything fancy from them I didn’t get paid enough to support myself and hours were always being cut........
good,"I did enjoy the customers, work, and environment. Although more often than not it was extremely stressful, due to an unorganized management. In my year and a half there I truly did enjoy getting to know the “regulars”."
good,There is an older lady that works at my old store she’s been there for 10 years and thinks she owns the place. The work was decent I moved up relatively quickly but when I had a family emergency my boss was rude and not understanding
good,"Was just a normal start up job, not much to say, got enough breaks, close to home, got a discount when items were gonna be discontinued. Very slowpaced and able to be worked by just about anybody."
good,"The work was hard, but very rewarding.  I had great superiors that worked in store.  However I tried to advance many times, and was told I was not ready.  They then hired a new employee off the street to do the job I had been doing for 6 months.  I felt I wasn't valued or respected as an employee so I quit."
good,Was not fond of district manager but lovd my job and was good at it the people work hard and district did not respect them this was my district not any other
good,"Overall, Dollar General was a very laid back job. It was fast paced and i really enjoyed the time i worked there. The customers were very nice and I always made sure the customers found what they needed and made thier trip to the store less stressful."
good,"This job only offers 20 hours or less a week and no overtime. Friendly environment, I like working with the people there, but i just wish they would offer more hours to employees."
good,"As a manager you have almost no home life. Can be very stressful if the wrong dm is in place. Can be a great place to work. Previous locations in mi and sd were great. Mishawaka was horrible, 5 manager woot in one week."
good,The G.M was easy to work for and made my job less stressful. The store Employees did great team work and we got recognized for our hard work.The G.M from Salesvile was a great guy.
good,it was an ok kind of job but after a while you rerally start to get tired of it it reall starts whearing you down i would suggest that you find something that you enjoy doing
good,"i love my staff. they are my bestfreinds they are exceptional. shopplifter come very very often multiple times a day, we have to catch them and put our lives in danger."
good,"stocked shelf's and cleaned store, along with running the cash register. "
good,It’s a ok job depending on what you get shipping is pretty hard and fast paced especially if you don’t have a partner. Non-con is pretty cool but it’s fast paced as well but your goin at your own pace if that makes sense.
good,I didn't like working at dollar general do to several issues that come with the job. to many to say on this page.  things would be better if it was run better as a hold.
good,"Working at Dollar General is okay with the work environment. Busy and smiling customers always stepping through the door. Easy to learn, long hours. Comfortable environment."
good,I learned how to move to the direct need of the workplace environment. I also learned the importance of having all hands on deck when it comes to retail.
good,If you like to work hard and enjoy working your butt off well work at the disturbution center have fun make sure you stretch and frink alot of milk youll need
good,I liked working there for the most part. It was a good environment and the people I worked with we're fantastic. I really would work there again if given the opportunity.
good,"Time off is 9 out of ten approved, unless it's the busy time of year. Hours are some what flexiable, as they are dictated by the means of the buisness."
good,You will never succeed in dollar general unless you hire the right people with all your daily task that has to be done each day. Its hard to keep good  Employees because dollar general dosent offer enough starting pay as an associate.
good,Company has great values and goals for their desired customer experience. Unfortunately the inconsistency between stores makes work for the company difficult. Two stores only blocks from each other will have vastly opposite rules set by local store manager and ignorant of DGSOP. District and regional management needs to better enforce standards and unity.
good,"Being in two places at once is impossible yet required if you work here. Friendly management and good intentions. Flexible schedule, but the work doesn't match the pay."
good,Dollar General can be a great place to work. It also is very easy to understand the daily process of work duties. I highly recommend this job for someone that is looking for part time.
good,"I'm not sure if it was just our store, or the entire chain, but we weren't funded enough to have enough employees, and our store was consistently covered in stock that no one had time to put away. The managers would have to work almost twice the average work day as a standard employee, and this caused them much stress."
good,I did the nightly paper work.Made bank deposits.The most enjoyable part of working there was giving great customer service.I liked the management team and was sorry that i had to leave because of lack of hours.
good,"A very good place to work for one's first job but there is little movement. If you want a raise you have to look for one outside of the store by finding a new job. Also normal cashiers have very little power. Outside of ringing up the customer, I had to call over the manager for returns, refunds, transaction voids, item voids, etc."
good,It was a decent starting job. You had to run the cash register and talk to customers. Help the customers in finding something they needed. Stock and put away supplies.
good,It was an old modeled store so everything wasn't in the best place. Always staffed so i never worried about people calling off and having to work alone.
good,"Overall fairly positive but a lot depends on who you work for. The company has a lot of good programs for learning skills. Projected culture and compassion doesn't always match reality. The company morphed into a ""burn and churn"" atmosphere at all levels after widespread changes at senior level positions."
good,"working at dollar general was an experience.  If you work 7 days aweek and give your all, the company does not care about you and your needs.  you are just a number that can potentially be replaced ."
good,"it was not what i wanted. wanted to get out of retail. the hours were insane if people didnt show up. "
good,"Dollar General is essentially the poor man's Walmart. You come here for cheap drinks, snacks, and toys. The job is menial and repetitive. Scan this, scan that, collect money, next."
good,"Great job, needed better management. Needed more employees. I worked almost every day due to lack of employment. Work time was very flexible, never really had trouble."
good,Everyday was usually easy and relaxed.I learned how to work in retail.The management there was wonderful. The workplace was easy pace. The hardest part was stocking the floor on a busy day. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with and meeting new people.
good,This job was a great starter job. I learned how to use a register and learned how to deal with general customers. The hardest part of the job were the slow days when there wasn't much to do.
good,Worked for them for years some go by the book some don't...manager was a great person to work for...company doesn't like to offer a lot of be wfits anymore...
good,i loved working with the public and resettling the store for the different holidays but sometimes the crowds get nasty when store full and only one cashier but but lucky I have patience and the smile for such events.
good,Good place to work gets challenging sometimes but what job doesn’t management can step up there game a little but other then that a good place to start a career.
good,I didnt care much for Dollar General The MAnager Always had a nasty attitude and never really cared about any of her employees. i dont really dont have any positive to say besides the employees worked hard
good,It was a fun chill place to work it never was a dull moment. And when u know everyone in town it makes it even better to be there. I would recommend this place to work.
good,"Hardest part at that time (14 years ago) was constant travel.  In addition, at that time there was no coverage for vacations, so you still had constant communications to deal with on a daily basis."
good,Dollar General has a very laid back atmosphere. All the employees are very friendly and the management is extremely helpful. I would recommend this company to anyone who is wanting to start an entry level position and move up in a company very quickly.
good,Dollar General is not for everyone.  They care more about opening more stores and cutting payroll than they do paying employees a little more to make it worth while to stay there for any length of time.  I've only stayed for convenience reasons for where I live.
good,When I hired in inventory was ridiculously behind. Way to much product that didn't get put on the floor. Not enough hours for the work that needed done. Very high expectations but not enough slotted hours or employees to get it done.
good,"No matter your position, a typical day at work will always include manning a register. One cannot stand still in any other circumstance."
good,A typical day included taking care of customers and making sure all stock was neat and in order. I learned about organization and time management. great experience
good,Good place to gain experience and get familiar with how the register works and learn how to stock. Not as fast-paced as other retail stores which is great to slowly learn and build up from it.
good,"Overall, Dollar General is a bad company to work for. I do appreciate those who can stick with it. I was not given enough hours each week to make the drive. I was written up more often than not over not selling enough, which is stupid."
good,"Like any customer service job, it was difficult to deal with at times. But overall the company was great and very flexible for those looking to fill the hours of the day."
good,working for dollar general was a relaxed environment to work at with surges of costumers like  any other business. it was a great opportunity but not for a carreer
good,i think the reason i liked my job so much was because of my 2 awesome bosses they were the best around. even when i got another job i stayed there as long as my boss was there the day she left and went to another store out of my drive time i left as well
good,Good management great people fun place to work always on your feet always doing restock never a boring moment lots of Hands-On Manish it was good and fair to its employees
good,"I feel that the employees are over worked, and they require so much of there employees. There is never security at night, and it's very dangerous. They expect the employees to stop customers from stealing, but there's no way to do that, if you are under staffed."
good,I liked helping others. the associates were all nice. i would work there again. i enjoyed the interaction with the customers on a daily basis. I liked the merchandise as well.
good,A typical work day was slow except for truck and stocking days of course. Holidays were always busy so they days usually went by very quickly. The work environment was stressful most days though.
good,"don't get paid much or not very many hours, its ok if you are in school to work but not if you need a lot of hours. I needed more hours to live. I liked the customers"
good,"It's an ok place to work, but they have high expectations and you don't really get the acknowledgement you may or may not deserve. Customers are definitely a challenge. You must always work FAST and multitask even faster."
good,It's a fast paced job but it's also chilled. The boss would never check on you. My co-workers were fun nice and cool to hangout with. Seasons are very busy.
good,"It was a interesting segment dealing with well off individuals with a elite mindset, but I loved taking care of customers. and we worked as a team and cared."
good,"a lot of theft through out the day"
good,"I wish I had better managers, the job its self was not bad, but my managers didnt pay me enough to do all of the stuff I was doing. I was training and helping new people & not getting paid for it."
good,"Before the current manager came, the manager I was previously hired by was very understanding and willing to help so after she left seemed like things went wrong. A typical day at work was always challenging but worth it.  The customers loved me and I loved them."
good,"This company is easy to work for and it is alot of work, there is always something to do. The turnover rate is really high, they should pay a little more, maybe they will be able to keep their employees."
good,"I enjoyed the stocking and the maintenance aspect of it. The management has fluctuated, but for the most part they've all been mostly reasonable. All in all, your basic retail experience."
good,"I've only been there for two months, and I was promoted to Lead Sales Associate/Keyholder. My hourly wage went from $7.25 and hour to $7.75. I don't think it was worth it, especially since a key holder is more less a manager without the title of manager. I know I can find something that pays more."
good,"loved working with the public"
good,It has plenty of opportunities to advance and even grow as an individual. It's fast pace but if you catch on quickly its worth trying. Customers are the top priority.
good,"Depending on location and manager it can be fun.  Helpful area supervisor.  Fast paced, u don't have to unload the truck, but do pu t stuff on shelfs.  U get to interact with the public."
good,"This warehouse was a fun and productive workplace .As an order selector i really got a chance to touch basics with the entire warehouse ,from shipping to recieving.to inventory and loading and unloading trucks"
good,"This was a very demanding job but if you knew what you were doing it wasn't that hard. Needs teamwork training as no one wanted to work together and wanted to take credit for other people's work instead of doing work themselves. Manager was very friendly but did not discipline employees when needed. As stated in the title, I felt very overworked and very underpaid."
good,Working for Dollar General was not a good experience. I didn't get any hours.I did enjoy my co workers. I enjoy working with the public. I didn't get the benefits working at Dollar General.
good,"Very nice coworkers, my shift would go by fast. We all helped each other at the job. Hardest part was remembering to drop money in the drop box when busy"
good,"I enjoyed working here. The people were friendly and helpful to work with. I learned teamwork, organization skills, proper lifting techniques and retail skills."
good,Working with dollar general i did learn a lot of the retail management. I over saw a big staff with stocking and overall cleanliness. i also dealt with a few troubled staff and customers.
good,"Poor place to work do to the bad pay and lack of advancement. No one cared about the low end employee, and in my oppenion we were the ones the customer had direct contact with so we should have been more important then just someone they can get rid of."
good,"I was lucky enough to be on a good team, but that couldn't make up for the lack of hours that corporate allocated to the store I worked at.  The only way to get more hours was to travel to different stores and once you did that you were constantly expected to travel to different locations. The customer base was good as was the work."
good,They expected a lot and the store had to always be clean and items stocked. the staff I had was very fun to work with and we all grew as a very good team.
good,The company as a whole is alright. There pay could be better to keep employees working there and the security is a must that really needs to be taken in consideration for the safety of they're employees and customers.
good,This was a great place to work to work because they will give a step up quit.You can become management at this job fast if you just show your talent and come to work.
good,The job was a standard part time job.I worked part time hrs and got minimal pay.The manager was nice and the employees were ok.Didnt pay holiday pay for Christmas.
good,Work place was in a area where it would be easy for customers to take from and do whatever they wanted with manager not even really caring ..i liked it at first because it was flexible hours but after awhile working there things got tough with me moving and people just running the store more then employees or manager .
good,"I would run the register, stock shelves and clean the bathrooms and set up any displays that needed to be done. Would pull racks outside for sidewalk sale then pull them back in at night."
good,I would not work for Dollar General again. The pay was low and not enough hours. The manager tried but it was not managed well. It was also a high crime area.
good,Why do I have to write a complete couple of senteces for this. I really don't want to fill this out. There isn't anything fancy about a minimum wage job that expect more out of you than is paid to you.
good,"No pay for overtime when you are the store manager, so the weeks that you end up working 80-100 hours you are expected to be there no matter what if someone else can be if you're the salaried store manager which means they do not care at all about your life outside of that place"
good,"I enjoyed working there, but the manager was not trustworthy and was not honest within the establishing of work hours and I did not agree with a lot of the decisions he was making as they were not to company guidelines."
good,"At dollar general, you work hard and you do not get paid much at all. Expectations are unrealistic, but if you find a good team to work with then it is tolerable."
good,"some good days some rough days, not bad place to work but dont pay well.  alot of how the day goes depends on who comes in, got to deal with the public"
good,I open the store made deposits and put displays outside. I learned that working wit a small team is good. Nothing really hard about this job. I loved the people I worked with.
good,Things were okay at first until new management came in and messed up the culture of the company. Many people quit and the turnover rate was unbearable
good,not a good place to work. all employees and overworked and underpaid. district managers could care less about the employees or customers only the money
good,"Really didn't enjoy my time working here, wasn't treated well, had my hours cut and changed at random no matter what the manager and I had agreed upon"
good,Depending on positioning the job isn't all that bad..
good,"Management was pretty good . Even though some things were different then I had figured . They could be hard on you with certain things , but over all they were really good ."
good,At Dollar General you know exactly what you have to do. I worked with good people. It was fast-paced and a strong work environment. The only flaw was that the company had unrealistic expectations. The pay was low and they expected people to work like they are receiving a high hourly. The Regional managers also didn't adjust properly to how busy each store was. The location i worked at was very busy and was not provided enough hours to spread to employees throughout the week.
good,"A great place to build a career. The jobs are not always easy, but the company does a great job developing its employees to the next phase of their careers."
good,"Coworkers are ok, not a stressful place to work.  One manager is rude and was a real jerk however I do not think he is there anymore.  One coworker was always in the back office playing games on his phone."
good,My title I did just about every thing in the store filled in and helped the manager out the best I could..getting alone with your co-workers is the main thing in a job like this.
good,"Very fast growing company that is going to provide a lot of jobs, The company likes to hire from outside for upper management positions and struggles with turnover in that area."
good,Patience love to work hard for little money I to love your job and what you do to work here must have real customers services the hardest part of this job is when they get a truck filled to the top with merchandise
good,"* working there is okay"
good,"I really think they need to look at higher levels with dollar general. not saying all districts are bad it just they have poor choice in hiring district managers, job not hard it would be a fun place to work if they only hirer loyal people."
good,"I like working there as a whole. The work is hard and the expectations are unrealistic. Because they are a low cost operator it is hard to find good help that wants to stay. The manager is left to pick up the pieces always, with not much support."
good,Its was unorganized and cluttered in the back rooms. It was stressful trying to organize and find what we had and what we did not have at the store. The store has several containers sitting up for months in the backroom
good,"I enjoyed my work there doing plano grams and helping customers, I worked there over a year and quit because I moved away. I did not transfer because ."
good,"I worked for a summer at Dollar General as a Sales Associate. I was hired quickly and trained within the first few days of employment. I was mostly able to work when I wanted, but I did not receive holidays off and neither did other employees. Due to the in-store managment not being in charge of supply and stock, there were often overstock or shortages which lead to customer dissatisfaction and employee stress."
good,"I learn how to have better customer service once I became a key holder. It was never a hard job, it was more relaxing and more for a person that has patience."
good,Dollar general is a good place to work. It has a lot of flaws but almost every place has flaws. I wish that we could keep people with the company and not lose so many people. Something needs to change!
good,"The manager was ok. She could have been a little more lenient for the mistake I made if she would have asked me about the situation at hand. Otherwise, this job is incredibly easy."
good,"A day at Dollar General is being a cashier, stocking and cleaning. What have I learned is to work together. Management when I left was horrible when I left but was good when I started. Hardest part is stocking and being the cashier at the same time. The people you meet."
good,It was a good place to work once you find a good manager like I had for awhile. if you get a bad manager your life will be miserable on the good side most of them don't last long.
good,"Everyday would be the same assignments. which were clean floors, stock shelves,and run the cash register. The management was not all that good but was descent."
good,Working at Dollar General is a job where you have to learn multitasking. I really enjoyed working helping costumers meet their needs and wants.  Some employees really dislike unloading and stocking shelves but I actually enjoyed it. The workplace was very clean and friendly environment to work in.
good,team never worked together to accomplish what had to be done. i was earning min.wage. management was very poor no communication hardest part was trying to pick up the slack of others.
good,Dollar General is a good place to help people to do things that needed to be done I go to Dollar General and time and it's nice to see people in the neighborhood that I know and I didn't know and get to meet and talk to them while they shop or whatever the case may be
good,I enjoyed being a cashier and having really nice custumers i loved my job just didnt like being part-time i would rather be full-time at any job i love working
good,its a ok place to work to much personal things that go in the store. Some employees are just there for a check and dont care about anything or how it looks.
good,Just all fun and relaxed more of a people person to help around the store or even be in the warehouse stocking it all was fun there it helped you learn.
good,Was there only for the weekly pay didnt get paid much plus i had 20 taken out each week for allowance. Other than that everybody usually do their own thing there.
good,Some people are ok but some members of management need more training so they can do their job better some of them lacked time management skills others were amazing
good,"Sufficient supplementary income, nothing particularly difficult. Very simple job. "
good,"Pay is lower than most places. Work a lot of nights and weekends. You never get a break at work. There is a lot of stocking required. This could be a good job if you are working with the right team. If not, the position is not desirablle"
good,Everyone knew their job and finished it in record time each day. Good people to work with. On the job training was completed quickly and by excellent trainers.
good,I did not feel that the type of co workers were the best fit for me. I enjoyed working with the public very much and really enjoyed putting a smile on my customers faces.
good,"Dollar General definitely helps you gain experience in dealing with people, both good situations and bad, and dealing with the stress of deadlines and high expectations. However, they need to offer more programs and incentives for their employees to want to bring their best performance to work. More programs may have been available, but were not made known to the employees of this particular store, communication seemed to be a little bit of a problem here."
good,The customers were great.  Management was not around enough to answer customers questions.  I worked by myself for a lot of the time that I was working there.
good,"I would work there again if I could. I loved my job, but had different outlooks on time off when it came to family death. She thought I didn't need it"
good,"Dollar general is really a place where you can really get your learning experiencae off the ground. you can learn great customer service, multitasking and so much more."
good,"you will enjoy working short hours, set up the display for holidays, enjoy putting out stock, cleaning the front area, greeting customers, the first to know about discounts"
good,its a job its what you make of it. managements sucks in some departments.some areas you do not get your hours.the only thing i like are my benifits and the fact that we get paid weekly
good,It's wasn't bad but not the best. Great customers and staff as well as the store being clean. Job is an okay job just needs more benefits and pay better
good,"Working at Dollar general was very productive, it was my first job as a key holder I absoultly loved working there but as is with any job when it's time to move on it time to move on."
good,Worked to many hours 50+ a week. Then treated like I was nothing when new people were hired. Also didn't even know that I was going to be manager. Just got the keys handed to me and had to figure it out.
good,Pay wasn't GREAT but it was a great job with lots of rum for growth. You can surly work your way from cashier to ASM to store manager then DM . It's all about the work you put in and actually wanting it.
good,it a okay workplace you just need to know you will be getting payed less and they dont offer you the best pay and you have to sweep and mop the floor and tuck in and the dress code sucks
good,"Typical Day-Stocking and customer service"
good,I started working there in order to make more money along with my other job. but they were only working me one day a week for only 4 hrs. or less so it was kind of a waste of time and gas.
good,"Dollar General is a good entry level job.  "
good,it was ok not the best because its hard to keep organize in the store . It was great working with other associates that would actually work. Hard to get full time and not enough hours given. store is not organized.
good,The people are great but the upper management and hours are not.  They are not very family friendly and you are expected to work 6 out of 7 days a week
good,the pay is really low and the work loud is heavy. over all was good to work with as start up job but soon you can't deal with the low pay rate they got
good,not much room for growth but overall the company is ok. typical retail environment. not much to get excited about. benefits were so so and the management team can be a little touch and go but thats with any job really
good,"Slower paced retail establishment, not so good on giving breaks, management could work harder, health care and benefits sorely lacking, could pay more but it's retail."
good,Dollar general had weekly pay which I liked but they did not give out many hours. You would pretty much have to be in management to make decent money.
good,It was a good beginning jobs and gave me a great experience. the people at the job were very friendly and created a good work environment and i am very thankful for that.
good,I had two different managers and they both worked around my full time job. I was thankful for them and all their help. It was fun when  I worked with certain people.
good,"Cleaning and stocking talking to customers "
good,"It was a great place to work, but I was getting too many hours from what I originally requested while doubling on my school classes. The training was good, but needed more time for the computer simulated training on policies than the time-frame that was given."
good,A typical day working at Dollar General Market was a nice company to work for but they lack organization. They work their employers so much that it had gotten to the point that they could not get anyone to come in. The aisles were a complete mess that the CEO had to get someone to come in and  clean up the entire store.
good,"Dollar General was a very good place to work. I learned a lot during my time there. I learned how to manage a team properly and work with other employees. I learned how to open and close the store and handle all the money. Overall, it was a great experience."
good,"My first day was fast paced, but I enjoy working with all my co- workers. Love seeing all the customers happy. Also like seeing the frequent customers come back and have a conversation."
good,Great place to learn different source of things. You get a opportunity to learn how different departments operate. Working with a group of individuals that could boost teamwork ability up.
good,"It is a great company to work for, I didn't have the best experience there because we were always short staffed and continued to change General Managers."
good,no scheduled breaks no relialble breaks. I get yelled at for not being fast enough to do things off the register but I am responsible for taking care of all customers
good,"Better be ready to swim if you are hired in as a Store Manager, Better know how to deal with people and have quick strong judgment of your staff. Personal life ends."
good,"Open or close the store, cover shifts, bank deposits, inventory control. Inventory counting, unloading trucks, store transfers,. Going to other stores to help with inventory"
good,I enjoyed working for this company and I wish I was able to transfer at the time instead of leaving to relocate. I don’t have any regrets for my move was for the best for my family
good,A typical work day was productive as long as you had enough coverage. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers. I worked for Dollar General for almost 9 years would probably still be there if it wasn't for the transfer
good,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing the facility, as well as overseeing a staff of seven individuals. Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,"It was just a job. I stocked things, ran the cash register, cleaned the bathrooms, and created end cap displays using a pre-determined corporate plan. Nothing special or unique about it really."
good,"It is somewhat of a great place to work, the people (co-workers) you come across are great. But the company itself could use some work on the inside the main office."
good,"Its a decent place to work. I've learned quite a bit, but it is a bit over stressful at times. Its fast paced, which makes the time go by faster and keeps you from being bored. I wish the pay was better. $7.75 is not much money for a keyholder (LSA), especially when the cost of living is so high."
good,"Hours are limited, there's not enough money to be made. Would be a great job if I mad at least a dollar of 2 more per hour. However I just feel like my talent and hard work is being wasted."
good,"I like everything but the management"
good,"After working there for 6 months now, my manager still doesn't know my name. And why should he? Hours suck. I'm not there enough for him to learn my name. No one can work here and provide for their families. 10-15 hours as a week sales associate. I honestly don't know how they expect anybody to live off that. Also, why learn anyone's name? Once anyone figure this out, it will be on to the next. I've been made aware that this not the managements decision, but that of the company as a whole. More money is banked on their part for more people employed, but under a certain time scale. At least someone's making money, just not the little people."
good,"it was okay, they hardly work with the hours i needed at the time. manger sucked. the store was a mess due to customers throwing things around. not enough workers on the floor"
good,Its a good job if your in high school but as a grown up not so much pay is low and less than 20 hours a week is what drove me to start looking for other jobs
good,"Not a great place to work. Depends on your area, management and needs.  If you  don't need a large income  and have a lot of spare time  than this is not a bad job."
good,"Dollar General: for a smaller company, they have stores all over the place, and it seems they'll hire just about anybody who meets the bare minimum requirements for the work. "
good,"I've worked for them for 5 years, Now they are saying they can't afford to pay me. So I have to take a voluntary demotion from a full time asst. manager to a part time key. With a 50 cent pay decrease. I loose all 2 weeks of vacation time I've earned, because part time people don't get Vacation time. I won't even make enough a month to pay my bills. This is what you get for being a loyal employee."
good,It was a good place to work. The manager was the problem. But over all it is not to bad of a place to work. They could pay more and be more understanding when things happen
good,Part time /summer work. I learned time management skills by completing store stocking within a specified time and customer service skills through cashiering and interacting with the customers.
good,"I enjoyed what I did and the people I worked with. The corporate team did not come to our store but never had anything nice to say about our store nor gave any helpful advise to better our store and by the time I got hired, we just lost one of our managers."
good,I would not work there again because of all the work that is expected out of the manger and there never ebough payroll to get the stock out do new plannograms and resets so its pretty much all on the manger to get it all done which means pulling a whole lot of extra hrs .
good,Dollar general has some great mangers that work hard and are willing to teach the underlings what they know in hopes they can become mangers. The store didn't have enough people working (2 per shift most of the time) and completing tasks that were demanded by us was challenging.
good,If you are looking for a job to get out of the house a few times a week then this job for you. However if looking for a full time job this job is not for you!
good,i didn't like that i didn't get much hours. i didn't make enough to support me and my kids. it wasn't to bad if people actually did their jobs and didn't play favortizume i was offered a manager spot but i was not able to take it. i had to move due to living arrangments and they would not transfer me to a different store so i lost my job.
good,Good job to work but I had to travel over an hour to and from work. Management does a good job running the place and alot of workers take advantage of it.
good,"cleaning the store "
good,I enjoyed this job but the people aren't always the best to work with.  Management is sometimes lacking as well.  Customer service is a requirement for this job.
good,"Nothing much to say, customer service and taking care of the customers is the best thing anyone could do. for that they are always in need of assistance, help with problems or returns of an item and making sure they are well taken care of."
good,I liked working here because it was a fast-paced environment you got to work with your community see bunch of smiling faces and help out people.  Very friendly coworkers
good,I liked working with the people that worked there but over all the money was not good enough for me and my financial situation. I always worked and never had a day off.
good,"I learned almost all of the skills I needed on-site, such as how to find the location of a product in the store, how the shelves are to be stocked, and how to collapse the shipping carts. The schedules are determined week-by-week, which may be frustrating for some. A week of my time was spent preparing a new store location for opening day. I unfortunately did not get to learn how the cash register operated (stupid as it sounds, but in the operant location we were constantly busy, and in the one that was yet to open, the cash registers hadn't been hooked up yet), but everything else I could do with ease. The manager and employees were rather friendly and willing to help me out when I needed it. The main issue with learning on the job was that sometimes I did not have the exact answers a customer was looking for or hadn't yet learned a certain skill required to help them...and some customers are less patient than others."
good,"Very stressful, heavy lifting, not great pay. I love the customers and knowing what they want when they walk in the door, but the management is unbelievable. I would not do it again unless I had to."
good,When I was first hired the manager knew and understood my schedule availability. After 3 years and new management it is not acceptable to have limited availability. (I insist on taking my son to and from school every day during school year.)
good,The store needs to make greater consideration for it's workers. The place is highly stressful. The store needs to develop a greater team environment instead of just a collection of individual workers.
good,"Overall the district manager did not set realistic goals, and employee retention was minimal.  There was constant issues with plumbing and work orders were slow to resolve."
good,"I only worked there long enough to load, drive and unload the store contents to a new location. I was unemployed at the time, and the manager, Brandy, hired me on to assist."
good,"Dollar General is an over all pleasant place to work with reasonable flexibility, friendly coworkers and competent upper management. I have enjoyed my time working with the company."
good,Working a dollar general was ok. It was slow paced but not too slow pace as to get bored. The people i worked with were friendly. Managers were kind and competent.
good,"A typical work day at Dollar General includes running the cash register, completing the work list and stocking shelves. Truck days are sometimes very busy as well as holidays."
good,"A typical day was busy which was good and i learned how to void and return an item, the store was great a first but then when i missed work he acted like a not a nice person but i understand his postion but i couldn't help was going with me medical and it seemed that he was not that understanding .  The work place was fine and there was no really hard work on the job and the enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,The job itself wasn't bad at all. The managers were the problem. They didn't get along. I was always sent to other stores I didn't want to work at. My coworkers were pretty cool to work with though. The hardest part was having to stock shelves and run the cash wrap because I would have difficulty seeing the customers standing and waiting for me
good,"The store was understaffed, and dirty. The management was poor. The turnover rate was very high. The Dollar General down the street a few miles was much nicer."
good,I liked the work and the job but I had trouble with payroll and not enough hours.       I learned stock and had to operate cash register Also learned work ethic
good,I liked working there but not wearing black all the time.The people were good to work with. I was usually there on the weekends so it was a fast paced job
good,Dollar general was my first job ever so as a teenager it was good for that point in my life. Not much different than any other retail position I have had in the future.
good,Average work place where you are close with customers and feel like your part of the community. Fast work pace is needed and management is a hit or miss
good,I liked it an enjoyed working there for a first job an they will help you every step of the way there a great team an it was great to have the experience to work with them
good,It’s an okay place to work differently not a permanent place because of the pay. I work with fun people which makes it fun but over all depends who you are as a person if you’ll like it or not
good,I loved my job. It was stressfully at times & they never give you enough hours to get everything done that they want done. I left to follow my manager to another company with better pay & benifits along with a great DM.
good,"The interaction with the community is the most enjoyable about the job.  You stay busy, so your day goes by fast. The worse thing to me was the work schedule."
good,Working for Dollar General isn't really my thing. The managers there will leave you by yourself while on lunch and there is always suppose to be a manager there at all times with an associate.
good,"Cashier and asst.manager, Hard work with unloading trucks and stocking products. Helped needed more often. Good with working hours always needed to have help"
good,I would manage the cash register and stock shelves when I was not busy at the cash register. I learned how to multi task and manage my time with being at the register and stocking shelves.
good,"i learn management skills and better stocking skills ,also i learn how to set prices one the items  that where on sell for the week and learn  how to do planograms"
good,They have some very unreasonable expectations. It is a great position for Manager to earn their wings. It is like condensed version of business. Too much turnover
good,It was great I'm a people person so I loved it. No team work at all.  It always was alot on one person cause some people just didn't do anything or just no help people called out or came when the wanted too.
good,work environment is terrrible they cut your hours and it is very slow work. Whiel workng here i went through  alot of struggle to get to the top because they people i worked with were all related.
good,bad thing is no work time no hours great enviroment store is old and dirty need alot of work no one is willing to keep it in update status or help imporve what is there
good,I opened 7 days a week and closed 4 nights a week. Almost too many assigned projects to complete and still maintain positive customer service. Learned a lot but sacrificed home time. Company moves managers and district mangers around a lot.
good,Dollar General is a very fast paced environment. There is always stocking of product to do. Customer service is always number one. Need to be energetic and friendly to work here.
good,It was not a bad Job. The store manager was willing to work with me around my college schedule. Being the only store around made it a fast paced store.
good,A typical work day at Dollar General five to six hours a day. Thirty minute lunch or 15 minute break two other co workers. I learned how to read plannograms and help others for the most part.
good,"really liked working here, but it is alot of hard work for the pay. Can get very busy at the same time that employees need to unload a truck and start stocking new items"
good,I've learned customer service here. The hardest part was the customer service because of the rude customers. I stocked and worked the register at the same time.
good,There isnt enough time in a day to do all that is required for a key holder to do. From cleaning the store and assisting customers and cashiers to get their breaks.
good,"The location I worked at was always busy. Had 30 min lunch hardly anytime for breaks, Manager was great but, they put a lot of stress on  one person. Quite a few times I worked alone with the manager but, it was too busy for just 2 people."
good,"Employment at the Dollar General is moderately fair. You work with some interesting people, and interact with some lovely customers. On the other hand customers can also be absolutely rude. You are not really aloud to do much on theft, or when people harass you."
good,"they work you very hard, very fast and hard to actually take a break. if you did, you were so far behind and they don't pay enough for the hard physical work it takes to do truck"
good,"It was fine. Had a decent boss and decent coworkers. A typical day was talking with customers, stocking, keeping the area around the cash register clean. The job itself isn't hard but you only get paid minimum wage."
good,They are under new management now. I know when I worked there I was 19 and a 3rd key manager and we had no Store manager for a while so we got a lot of overtime and it was fast because we have schools all around. I just really didn't like the store manager that was there and her attitude.
good,Working At dollar general was a challenge for me due to the fact that i decided to accept a position in Arvin and i lived and live in Bakersfield. I Learned so much while managing
good,There is constantly people coming in dollargeneral every day stealing..and the employees is not able to stop it also they is costumers costly running with food in there hands.
good,"If you like to work hard for little pay, this would be the job for you. Corporate doesn't understand what the store employees face, and put too high expectations on what should be able to be accomplished."
good,"For me, I would like more advancement opportunities then I've been given. For the last couple of years I've been promised to be a training DM and it seems to continuously skip over me. Feels like there's a lot of hush-hush going on. Or more less I've been strung along."
good,I stocked shelves and was a cashier.  I helped customers whenever I was available to do so.  The store was usually pretty busy and we were busy most of the time.
good,Not a bad place to work. You work hard -be a team player. Be friendly and do your best to work well with your co- workers. Treat your customers with respect also with a great personality and a helpful attitude.
good,"its a pretty laid back place to work, many friendly faces, management, are super friendly and always help the best they can, the most enjoyable part of working there, was it isn't as fast pace as some jobs."
good,"Easy beginner job, fast paced around the time school starts nd holidays. Worked good hours had lots of time off due to being a part-time worker. Great people"
good,it was an okay job beside kept changing managers and store never kept clean and made like one person had to do all the work and nobody else and people stealing in the store all the time
good,They are a fine company to work for. Can be a little stressful at times but for the most part they aren't to bad. If you want to work in retail I recommend choosing them.
good,"Good company. Management is below average. Pay is not enough for daily living. Fast paced, friendly, could be a potentially better store with adequate training and friendlier staff."
good,It is a easy environment to adapt to. And they will work around any situation as for the schedule for they week. If you communicate that to management. Its not a stressful environment to work in.
good,"If you can FASTLY adapt to fast pace, stressful, demanding work than its a good fit. I personally couldn't adapt as fast as I felt I was being presured to be. Although they did see I could work the cash register good so I was mainly stuck at that position. Co workers are nice but little on socializing with each other."
good,"Worked at Dollar General for a short period of time to get more money to be able to move to a bigger city for college. The job itself was easy, and fairly challenging with the fast pace but my manager made it very difficult to even withstand a full shift."
good,"While Dollar General is a growing small box store, they do not provide the competitive wages and budget to support internally. Managers are paid well and need the support to achieve excellence for corporate, employees, and customers."
good,Working for dollar general can sometimes be stressful. Lots of stocking and floor recovery! The pay is very low! I believe this job is more for kids just out of high school! Certainly not a permanent job!
good,"Productive and a Learning Experience. I only had one typical day of work when I wasn't feeling to good. There wasn't no hard time if my work. the most enjoyable part of my job was working with my   employees, My favorite is probably the flexibility I have with my hours. I also love the company culture and enjoy working with everyone"
good,"I worked here part time while in high school, they were flexible with my schedule. I worked as a cashier, customer service, stocked the shelves and unloaded trucks occasionally."
good,if your just starting out in work force this is perfect job. but if your looking to get a lot of hours and higher pay then this is not a good primary job. if you want a lot of hours and higher pay then you will need a secondary job
good,My coworkers are amazing and the job is okay...the only complaint I have is that I don't believe we get paid enough for the amount of work we are required to do..and I'm not the only one who thinks this.
good,"A steady job but somewhat demanding. Not for those who can't stand long hours. Most of a work day is spent on the sales floor, stocking or facing products. Managment is usually good and willing to work with you from my experience."
good,"This company has a lot of turn over, never enough employees. The cleanliness of the store is always a issue, no disinfectant used to clean public bathroom. Very stressful job, poor working environment."
good,"It is a lot of hard work, which makes it stressful, but it can be fun when you get to see your regular customers. It is also stressful when you are not given enough hours to get everything done that is needed in the store."
good,"I liked my job but the manager never was there. Things backed up almost to the point of no return. O worked very hard, never missed a day. I would work for them again with the right management in play."
good,"Good Advancement Opportunities within the Fast Paced environment for those that can handle the workload responsibilities and help foster an overall good, productive work environment within your department and the overall facility."
good,count money in the safe and the registers to make sure they are correct. Stock merchandise in the store and check in the vendors. Make sure store is clean before we leave at night and lock up the store.
good,It was a nice fill in job with the standard customer service cashier responsibilities relaxed encironment but got busy at times which can be stressful
good,Company is great to work for but they are not to happy to give people hours. When I left d wasn't get but 25 hours a week barely enough to pay my insurance. Love working with my manager and co Workers not their fault that we couldn't get the hours.
good,the store is ok to work for if you have no children and real bills. no full time unless you are management  or a key holder................................
good,"A lot of people tend to quit, many do not know how to do things. However the store runs decent if there is good managment. The higher ups have no idea whats going on and that it makes very frustrating when your at the bottom."
good,the work environment was horrible. It didn't matter how much you cleaned it still felt and looked dirty. The Store manager at the time was lazy. She played favorites with her employees and based their work hours by who she liked better. She spent most the time in her office eating and visiting. And she was always on her cell phone but wrote employees up for doing it.
good,Restock shelf only works correctly if you do it everyday. Store never had enough product on the shelf who did the ordering? The store never had enough employees high turn over rate.
good,It was a good job for high school kids. The manager was really understanding when it came to family matters coming up.  The work was hard to do at all.
good,Other then that it is a really good company. Just needs more people in management that cares for their employees. Better customer service would be nice from some of the locations.
good,When i worked here they pay was poor and you never knew what your hours were. I heard they started to pay the employees a more competitive wage since I left.
good,It’s a pretty decent job nice pay every week I would encourage people to work here opportunities for advancement raises they give them to you as often as they see you deserve them.
good,"I left to pursue my career as a vet tech. "
good,"I did not work at Dollar General for a long time but I did enjoy the time I was there. I worked part time, and they didn't give me many hours which was not the best because I didn't make as much money."
good,Looking for a new job  that I don't have to work 65 to 70 hours a week .I love working with people training and coaching them. Also meeting new  customers.
good,Dollar General is a very nice place to work for you will have to be energetic willing to work and very motivated to work there to keep up with the production you have.
good,I would go back to dollar general in a heartbeat if the pay were decent and the manager was a decent person. I left the company on good terms but left only because of the manager I had.
good,"The DG is a place to work if your a single person or a person with no kids...Typical day was fast and busy. Down time was not a option, breaks mandatory. Management is horrible."
good,"Learn quick that fast paced and lots of responsibility. minimum hours of work is 55 to 60 hours per week. payroll, hiring and interviewing process, all vendor relations and long hours."
good,"It has been 18 years since I worked at Dollar General.  18 years ago it was a wonderful, very family oriented company.  Since that time it has been sold and I know nothing about the new owner.  You would need to ask someone who works there now."
good,changed assistant managers frequently. learnt customer service and how to deal with customers and cash handling. enjoyed the interaction with customers.
good,"A typical work day at Dollar General Warehouse was finding out what was expected of you for each batch that day.  Managers would come by all shift long making sure you're working and doing what you're supposed to.  But for the 10 to 12 hours a day, the fast-paced, competitive work was very labor-intensive."
good,"for any out of high school student or high school student, i recommend. It's very flexible and management from personal experience has been great.               ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````"
good,While I love the company working for them is very hard. They are not interested in training and development and expect new employees to hit the ground running.
good,I learned how to stock things and answer customers questions. I also learned how to lock up. Meeting people and finding different ways to put things away was interesting.
good,"hardest part was trying to run store on fixed hours from corporate."
good,"NEEDS WORK"
good,The boss was an a**hole and very rude I was injured and the day after I told him I was injured he expected me to do something I coukld not do to my injury
good,Didn't like it at first but you grow attached to different customers and enjoy the working environment. Use to hate closing but overall it wasn't that bad.
good,"The management was very rude and made up rules as they went, i was fired for a made up rule and when i tried to talk to someone about it they didn't give me the time of day."
good,I had to learn fast in this fast paced environment I was thrown into the job and worked long hours to ensure customer satisfaction as well as quality throughout the store.
good,"Dollar general was an awesome place to work, I would definitely work there again, it so easy to me, very fun and competitive, we use to bet on who can finish 3 rolltainers in 3 hours the fastest, and the customers was awesome, we was all a family in there. It had its ups and down but generally a good place of work."
good,"I was paid to work 40 hours with a mandatory 45 to 50 hour work week. While I was compensated well and my performance reviews were stellar,  I was put through the wringer by my superiors. Being told a member of my team was being moved and promoted on 5 days notice and told it did not matter if my store was negatively impacted. Calls, texts and emails to DM were often ignored or unanswered. I ran my store as expected with great results. I was never understaffed,  my stock was ran and weekly projects complete on time. I helped other stores by sending employees to cover shifts and often going to do that stores myself to help them get caught up. At the end, I was thrown under the bus for something inane."
good,"I could not continue to work for the Store Manager who liked to call almost every morning around 5:30 to complain about things before looking or finding the solution. Her tone on the phone was rude, condescending, and accusational. I am not sure I enjoyed working for them or desire their idea of a cashier also being the stocker."
good,"Great place to work. Lots of promotional avaiabilities for those that wanted it.Moved up to a lead position in less that a year.Met some really great people whom I am still in contact with today. Trying to get into their new facility in GA"
good,"Good place to work in for high school student, not for career.  Shifts are long, but the atmosphere for working is good.  Recommend it for students going to college for a part time job."
good,"A typical work day at dollar general was very hectic sometimes. Although it was hectic I learned a lot from there. I learned how the general public is, how they react when certain things happen."
good,Come into the store some days it recover some days not . Then the store is hot like no cool air what so ever. And some of the product in not in the right place and a customer pick it up  and you have to price match the amount so the customer can be happy. Some of the product is in the right place the pricing is wrong .
good,"I love the people I work with. But the pay is horrible for what is expected of you. It is no wonder they can't get or keep good help for very long. They should recognize the good, hardworking employees and compensate them for what they are worth."
good,It was a great learning experience for myself. I worked with a great team of co workers that taught me a lot. The people I provided customer service brought me a great pleasure.
good,At DG as a picker in the warehouse it is long hours and high labor. It was not horrible as it could've been better like anywhere else. Supervisors are understanding when something comes up at home and can work with you on time off. Best part of DG is the people you meet and work with who make you feel like family.
good,9 to 5 job you will be trained. work side by side with the manager and it is a fast pace job the hardest part is the customers serve them first. and love what you do.
good,Working here at dollar General distribution center has taught me to always stay on my toes. There is always work to do in this fast paced work environment.
good,"You can't actually support yourself or a family on the pay. The managers are not typically great at managing. you're going to get exposed to a lot of bad people, both customers and employees.the hours can be really bad, even when you've gained seniority"
good,Working here is a struggle. You can work usually as much as your manager will let you but there is no A/C or heat so you have to suffer the weather inside as well as outside.
good,i was responsible for unloading trucks and stocking merchandise to the sale floor.  assisting customers and accurately handling numerous cash transactions.
good,"i enjoyed working at dollar general. i really enjoyed setting new shelving units. i learned a lot with working in a customer environment. They ended up getting new management with about six months of working there, and after they got new management the place went down hill. Being into management you need to set examples of what your employees need to do, they did not."
good,i ran cash register all day when a customer need help i provide assistance and i stocked and cleaned store. I enjoyed the conversation between me and my customers and loved when i had regulars
good,Working Dollar General was a learning experience as far as dealing with people. I quickly learned the law Customers Always Right! Learned that I had an creative side and exposed my ability to build and think outside the box. Quickly excelled  went from cashier to third-key in less than three months.
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace of this company,and the fact that I had many resposibilities. I would open/close the store,which included doing deposits or setting the cash registers. Stocking continuously,along with cleaning,delegating duties and customer service."
good,Manager is okay but needs to be a better manager. Not enough hours and the pay is not that great but besides that the customers are nice and friendly.
good,"After the temporary position at Us Steel I have been looking for employment. Dollar General was right up the street so I went an applied so I wouldn't be without a job. It is a good job , but im looking for full time and a position that offers benefits."
good,"Undercover Boss should come here, there are alot of issues that could be brought to light at the company. Employees work very hard, and are not compensated fairly. But the customers and people who work there make the job an enjoyable place to be."
good,working at Dollar General was okay I did my job my scheduling was poor management was poor   I was not given a balance of days and nights  The manager was not good poor manager skills  This person should have been replaced he was not so to save his own skin he threw me under the bus  so I choose to leave
good,"A typical day would be running register and stocking, which is not very hard, unless you get busy and the manager still expects you to stock multiple isles. This job helped me get out of my comfort zone and allowed me to make better social skills. The managers I had were honestly the best, they weren't lazy and very sweet when it came to teaching me what and how to do things. The hardest part of the job was not stocking or register, but the people you deal with, they are either very rude and made sure you felt badly before they left or middle aged men making odd comments. But I also loved meeting my co workers and meeting the nice costumers that would remember my name and tell me to keep up the good work. Overall no job is perfect, but this job was still a great experience and I wouldn't mind working for Dollar General again."
good,"it was a easy job, it was a temporary so i only worked part-time, but it was a laidback and pretty slow pace job of i should say so myself, wouldn’t work there again because of the low pay."
good,"Wasn't bad working here, just got annoyed with customers. I wish the pay was better and they would open more registers. There were times where the registers wouldn't work and the customers would complain and get upset. The registers were very old."
good,Working there helped me understand the importance of being on time.This was my first job and I enjoyed stocking shelves.Meeting the new customers was nice.
good,The working environment was good. When I need a day off my boss tried to get me off. My co-workers were very helpful and understanding. When I was still learning things they would help me out instead of getting frustrated with me.
good,"Good for a first job. Great for a first start to learn about customer service, phone etiquette l, management, organization  and money handling. Fun place to get to know people."
good,I needed a job. And was lucky enough to have one. Atmosphere was good. Friendly coworkers it was hard to juggle work and him life. That's why the job didn't last long. Because family came first and I always try to give 100%.
good,"I loved my job, but let the area that I moved to get to me.  Must willing to work variety of hours days, night's and weekends a must.  Open all holidays except Christmas."
good,"Great company however the leadership was the worst the store managers did not have experience and were ghetto and very unprofessional. "
good,"The job is hard work, and moderate pay. The benefits are good and decently priced. But, the employee turnover is frustrating and time consuming, always having to train new people."
good,Cashiering is a piece of cake.  Communicating with customers and providing excellent service.  Very low pay for the amount of stress you are putting on your body to stock.
good,Lake of support from the mangers. They get mad when u call in cause your kid is sick even if you have a note... They dont fully show you how to do things right.
good,"My educational background in customer service and cash handling, along with my professional and educational experience, makes me an excellent candidate for this position."
good,"Working there was a fun time. The guest were familial-like. The work was simple yet it required patience, and accurate speed to accommodate guest, and store quality."
good,"I would recommend Dollar general for a decent place to work, but every store isn't the same. It was just the establishment I worked at was out of order and very unprofessional."
good,It was a stressful job. Not many co workers did their job so there was a lot of work that fell back on the others who did their job. Management wasn't the best.
good,"very fast paced and can be physically demanding. "
good,The place is great depending on the location of which store you are working at. Also depending on the location will determine the every day crowed. Normally 2 people per shift with lots of cleaning and stocking to do. Too much for just 2 people while maintaining the front registers.
good,Learning experience was great. Excelling in retail business was educational. Administrating mangement responsibility was challenging. Enjoyed the operations of the business.
good,"rush hour was busy after school let out or holidays."
good,I will arrive to the store 30-45 minutes before store open. Prepare myself for the truck to arrive which will be 800-1600 pieces weekly. Once truck was unload Ill begin to stock by departments. Ill will assign other employees to complete the truck. I will begin setting planograms for the weekly and monthly ads.
good,a typical day of work was very productive.learned to be quick passed with routine duties.management was on top of everything.workplace culture was productive got duties done on time.
good,Overall this was a great company to work for before.. but as always thing changes as cost cutting begins once results come on for the investors... Good pay some good management left
good,good workplace manager was nice coworkers were nice. you had to stock and work register at the same time and on busier days that was very hard sometimes. but the work was still pretty easy
good,"This is an ok place if you just need a simple part time job but I wouldn't recommend working here for the long term.  Manager roles are the only roles that make decent money.  I started out part time and got promoted within a month to full time key holder and then promoted again to assistant manager soon after.  I watched a lot of backstabbing high school drama unfold which is to be expected at a place where people dont feel valued.  District manager was ok but attempted to pit people against each other at times, just know if they are being friendly then they are up to something they want info or something from you it isn't genuine.  They way they schedule will have you burnt out because its very up and down there is no consistency.  I left for a job with more money and less stress I got along with people there but it was a joke at the same time."
good,It really easy and a good job but hours are not good feel this is more type job for a teen in high school who may be satisfied with 15-30 hours not 40
good,I was part time so work was o.k.. worked my full time job before going to work there so it was pretty long. Learned a lot. The hardest part of the job was dealing with v=some very rude customers.
good,The job is not so bad as long as other employees are doing their job as well. Corporate is always cutting the budget so employees are always being cut with hours
good,I was not satisifedwith management when I left I was going threw some person things involving my child a case of abuse and the manager terminated me and listed me as a no rehire for the company.
good,it was an okay job to have there was some drama so it was hard to have a good work environment in the future if i want to work their again hopefully it will have a better management
good,"This was my first job at the age of 18. It was a good place to work and taught me many good skills for future jobs, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good place to start!"
good,Basically had to restock shelf’s run go ring up customers go back and stock then go sweep the floors and prepare to mop. After that go help customers when needed
good,Dollar general don't do anything for their employees.  Underpaid.  Hardest part was lifting very heavy boxes to stock shelves.  The most enjoyable part is the customers.
good,"stocking shelves, running register, dealing with money and customers. learned a lot it was my first job. management was ok at best. hardest part for me was trying to be a morning person."
good,it was stressful i had to work long days and long hours. i spent all my time at dollar general. that s all i seen every day. You are the worker and the cashier because i might just be you the only one working
good,"Personally, my experience at Dollar General has back way below par. I would not recommend this job to anyone who is looking for a career at one of these store, but as a first job or just for the experience, then its perfect."
good,High volume fast paced environment. Pay is decent sometimes you work 50 to 60 hours per week. Everyone is friendly and easy to get along with overall a good place to work.
good,Maintaining composure while dealing with irate customers is the hardest part about this job.  The most rewarding are the regular customers who greet you with a warm smile and kind words to help get you through the day.
good,The only thing I did not like was that I was promised more day shift hours and consistently worked evenings and closed the store.  No one else wanted to.  This schedule effected my life at home.
good,"For the most part, the Dollar General is a nice and easy place to live. The people are really nice and are willing to help as long as you ask for it. The experience really depends on the people you work with."
good,Working at Dollar General was a good place to start out. Mornings would typically be used to work on new truck and taking care of vendors while nights were mainly used to clean and organize what had been messed up throughout the day. 9/10 you would have a good time working and easily get the days list of things to do done but could be stressful if other workers did not take the job seriously. In general its a lot more stressful when there are not as many workers than what we would need.
good,I didn't enjoy working there.  The manager was a  to fave person only looking out for himself.  I heard he lost his job a little later. I just don't know why people are that way
good,It was okay . I didn't have many hours there wasn't really given an opportunity. In was part time and was given the least amount of days possible. I don't have much to say.
good,"A day at dollar general was all about going to work and meeting new customers everyday or every other day. i learned that no matter how right YOU are, the customer is always right in any situation. Management was great at the time, no problems at all.The culture of the store spoke for itself. Great clean environment. The hardest part of this job was to sometimes communicate with the customers. the most enjoyable was to smile and greet the ones i did know and help them throughout the days of shopping there."
good,I generously give dollar general a 3 this company underpays employees. employees are expected to do to much for the amount of pay. they do not treat employees fair. this is just my experience. unless you have a good team willing to pull a lot of weight you will enjoy the job some what. otherwise you will work your tail off for peanuts. it a good starter job though if your willing to put in the time. this is just my opinion. you have to try it for yourself to see if you like it.
good,"I loved my job there, the only reason i left was due to getting certified as CNA. My hours were flexiable from 7:45am until 10:30 pm. Whenever I was needed i went in, on my days off if she was short I went in. The store is wonderful, my manager worked with us to make sure the store ran smoothly."
good,"Management is decent, hours are flexible. Easy to stay busy and productive. Customer service can be both fulfilling and rewarding. Limited advancement opportunities."
good,"I did not enjoy working at Dollar General at all. The management was very unsatisfactory in my opinion. I was told to perform a task, but not shown how. Later received complaints that the task I performed was not done properly."
good,Fun place to work and meet new great people.I think that management should be of people a age or 30 yrs or older. High School graduates are not people skilled enough or have enough experience to be in that type of job position.
good,"I feel that employees are underpaid, especially in key lead and manager positions. The job can be very stressful, but it stays busy and the day goes by fast."
good,"Good job if you don't mind dealing with general public"
good,"store was not staff good, price for merchandise was great, no team building, no compensation for mileage or gas for managers, management is underpaid no help from upper management with staffing"
good,"The job overall was not bad for a teenage job.  Although for the responsibilities cashiers had, it was not worth the hours required only making minimum wage."
good,Dollar General is a good place to start off learning the retail training. It is a fast pace. If you have the right manager and staff the work place will go great. This can be a stressful work place if have to pick up slack. So always have
good,"Most days were pretty smooth until inventory came in. I probably taught just as much as I learned. The culture was very diverse and the hardest part of the job was hiring serious and dedicated people. When everyone showed up for work and on-time the day would go by smooth and I was able to get things done, such as stocking and organizing the store."
good,I loved my job there I was there for four years the hardest part of the job was having a bad manager but other than that I loved it. I learned that you can achive anything if you set your mined to it
good,"Building security after hours needs improvement to keep employees safe.  "
good,some days were easy and some days were stressful.we could have a day of nice customers and some days we could have allful people to come in.i did make a lot of new friends while I wasemployed there
good,"fun place to work, always learning something new."
good,It was a hard job loaded trucks all-day I also run the dock the hardest part of the job was getting a big lane with no help but it's a good place to work
good,Great experience .alot of room for opportunity. I started out as a cashier i worked my way up to store manager .mandatory overtime .would have to work doubles if someome calles off
good,"For my position, you can go hours just working by yourself with no help. The amount that you are expected to do is not really reflected that well in pay. There is a super high turnover rate. I've been there for 3 years and have had 3 different managers and 4 different district managers."
good,This is a basic starting job for anyone straight out of high school. Easy tasks and basic retail hours. Pay is not to good but if you work at a dollar store you can’t expect it to be better than minimum wage.
good,"I was ""assistant store manager"" for almost 2yrs. In reality I was opening and closing the store, managing all the money, inventory/stock, vendors, employees schedules, and payroll. I did all of this with no benefits, a quarter raise, and no appreciation."
good,Dollar General is a bare minimum paying job. You end up working more hours than expected and are called in at a moments notice. The employee discounts do not provide enough incentive to work here
good,"I enjoyed my time there.  Success mostly depends on hiring the right team, which can be difficult.  I had days I loved it Days I hated it.  Looking back it was the people I had to work with that I disliked the most."
good,needs to work as a team and not against others. I had a lot of concerns with safety throughout the store. the team wasn't on the same page at all time and that made it even more unsafe.
good,"All in all its a good company to work for, good moral, start pay is also good but manager and associate's lack communication a lot of room for advancement"
good,"When I was being trained for my position as a sales associate, the person who trained me taught me almost everything I needed to know. The manager that hired me was fast paced and the other employees were fair at doing their part."
good,"Hours never very consistent, one work week may be 30 hours and the next week you might have 20. Fun environment to work in, although it isn't very structured."
good,"Several weeks on end as a salaried employee worked no less than 70 hours, some weeks as many as 104 hours, with the District Managers knowledge.   Left the company after 7 years, forfeiting 64 hours vacation.   I repeatedly requested assistance I received minimal short term ( 2 days) help from another store, then both of those assistants called off, with no key available.   This was the forth district that I worked for with the company and an embarrassing one"
good,"The Dollar General in Tipton, IN is a very boring job. There are only ever 2-3 people on staff at a time. No one is ever able to talk to each other because we are all doing seperate things. The only time you can talk to people is when checking out items for Customers. There is ever only one person to be on Cash Register, but he/she will always be stocking if there are no customers to ring up. So they will always have to be running back and forth. The Management is pretty poor. The store is always cluttered, with one center isle basically inaccessible at all times. There are a ton of overstock on top of the shelves. There are a ton of carts with product to be stocked sitting every where. All in all, I would consider this job as a temporary until a better paying job appears your way."
good,Good company to work for if you are single to much stress on managers . You work hard for you money ....................................................
good,"management is very good and the crew members are very helpful to the customers.  store was clean and organized, employees were respectful and well groomed."
good,clock in get your till and then just sit there for must of the time unless they have you stock shelves while working the register which didn't make sense cause you would be stocking shelves in one of the far isles and then a customer would show so you would have run back the register.
good,I worked in the market . The store has had 3 managers in the time that i have been here. It is very busy. I enjoy my job i have learned a great deal of things about produce. The part part is being away from family so much.
good,"This was a very fun place to work. There was always something to keep you busy. Always meeting new people. New products always arriving. Fun, fun, fun"
good,Not much happens slow store to work at little work done during the days weeksends are even slower. most the work is keeping it clean and it doesnt take but a few hours a day.
good,Pricing was great. Coupons a good deal. I was a cashier. I worked . I learned to work hard and fast. The manangement changed alot. I would recommend working at Dollar General. The hardest part was the standing.
good,"there was nothing short of something to do, stock, or the handling of customers, the store I am located in you always needed to be vigilante... take that as you will"
good,"Once I clock in, I usually run the register until my other cashier is scheduled to work. I then will stock, do recovery of the store, set endcaps, set shelves for new products. Visit with the customers. Close the store, count down all drawers, get deposit ready for the bank."
good,"very flexible schedule, fun work environment, good management, required lots of lifting, very bust day but it went by fast cause of the workers and their attitudes"
good,"I would probably would have still be working there if I had more hours to work. When I left I was only working five hours a week."
good,Typical day at dollar general is usually rude customers and nice customers its all how you take it. If you dont have a positive attitude you wont have a positive day.
good,If you work for Dollar General you better be prepared to live at your store and work 6 days a week or more. There is no time for your personal family and
good,"I like working at place where everyone was very nice and helpful, where i got to learn new skills i can take to any other job.I would like to return to this job."
good,i worked a 60 hour work week. There was min. hours for associate just assistant manager received 35 plus hours. Work life balance is not as good as other companies but you can pay your bills.
good,Loved the job it self but I worked here a few yrs ago and the new management was unbearable to work for/with..  I was pretty much forced out because of this
good,Hard work. Pay not commiserate with work load. Hard to get time off when in management. Good job security. Very fast paced. Some chance of advancement.
good,"Great job for a started job, or a part time job. I don't do well with my schedule changing over and again by working early one day to working late the next day. I just needed something more structured and stable."
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General, the pay wasn't great but I was loyal and learned a lot.  My manager was great and she taught me how to run a store successfully.  I left the position to move to Arizona for a family issue."
good,Loved working here you learn a lot. I learned a lot of my skills working here. Would go back to working here if it wasnt so many hours. Faced place work
good,"Typical day would involve making sure customers were happy with their visit, stocking shelves, cleaning, and organization. Was always great assisting new customers as well as regular customers."
good,"Very fast paced, have to multi task. Not a good balance for a someone with young kids. You have to work a 5 1/2 day work week. That half day usually turns into 6. It may be a good fit for someone with older kids , but I wouldn't suggest for someone with young kids, not a store manager."
good,great starter job for anyone fresh out of school looking to learn the ropes of working for the first time.  there is a very high turn over rate and the work environment is not the best
good,"the manager couldn't schedule right, also took all the hours away from everyone when she was hired. Customers were very rude and did not interact with me well."
good,"This job was okay. The other managers could have been easier to work with, but I dealt with it. The scheduling changed a lot but it wasn't unmanagable."
good,Managers and staff were friendly. The manager was willing to work around me being a single mom of two.It was fast paced. The store was very well organized.
good,"This company is better suited for someone whom needs part time work,  as someone whom is in high school or college.  No real advancement is offered within this particular company."
good,Great place sometimes very stressful  but overall great company some store are very clean and have nice employees very good work envierment loved working here
good,"nice customers, no complaints, helped everyone, not enough hours, hardest part was $$400 worth of coupons, workplace is laid back, employees are nice."
good,i love the cashier experience but i didn't have a good store manager  it was unfair and he didn't care about his work environment.i love being a cashier i have good customer skills and overall it was a great learning experience for me
good,Not a bad place to work for an extra income. The hours aren't bad. And the pay is decent for a part-time job. The environment is laid back and the people are fun to work with.
good,There are decent overall benefits for this area.  However the hours are always shifting and the potential for advancement is very limited.  The management for the maintenance department is good.  The company has a lot of potential but needs more consistency in their daily schedule and discipline.
good,"A typical day at work is always busy. We have to work the register, stock the shelves or any other places in the store, clean the store to perfection and most importantly we have to make sure the customers were happy when they leave. The management changed once while I was there. My first manager was nice in her own way but was never happy with what we did; however when she left and they brought in a new one she was recently made a store manager and had to be trained she was always trying to do things to fast but was always fair and considerate of others. The hardest part about the job was night shift and weekends, it was always pact and it made stocking and cleaning hard for everyone. The most enjoyable was mornings that is when we can stock in peace and we always had enjoyable customers then."
good,Dollar general is hard to keep happy unless you are a clean freak and can keep it 100 percent clean.They wrote me up every time i turned around for missing one aisle or the smallest of things.
good,Hard on body.  Lot of heavy lifting.  Customers are friendly.  Hours vary from day to day.  May work days one day and then nights the next.  Not enough help and management work alone in stores for periods of time during the day (not nights) because they don't allow enough hours for the stores.
good,"I worked as a cashier.  I helped customers with questions and finding things they were looking for, getting their groceries checked out quickly, and some light cleaning."
good,"This job was amazing. It ha it's flaws but the coworkers were amazing and funny. They helped out a lot and the job just was pretty easy. It became easy stressful because the customers and all, but other than that it was a good job."
good,This is not a life long job or career in my opinion.  Minimum wage job and not all that great of benefits.  The store I worked at was good and I liked my coworkers and management.
good,The hardest part of the job is never knowing how many hours you will get from week to week. It all depends on the budget the manager is given and it always varies.
good,"*Balance work environment when tasks are split between associate's"
good,"I loved the environment while working for Dollar General. I did not like how upper management treated their employees. They had no consideration for employees personal lives. However, I learned how to manage a crew on mine own and how to be stern and consistant when it came to company procedures."
good,"You interact on a daily basis with customers, you stock, clean, and handle cash transactions. The only thing that I didn't like about the position was that if a customer comes in a bad mood, yelling and cussing you, you have to take it on the chin."
good,This is a high demanding job very stressful if you can handel stess then this is the job for you however not a family orentaied bussiness for employees
good,Dollar General is a fast paced environment but need a strong mind to work there. customers are who  you strive to please but they arent always right. The hrs you get suck and the pay really sucks.
good,Opening and closing the store . Checking in all vendors . Making bank deposits. Also checking in store truck weekly. The hardest part of the job is closing the entire store by yourself.
good,"Good work, liked working with the people and helping them. I learned cashier skills and counting. Management was ok. Hardest part was getting good hrs and getting sick day."
good,It is not an easy job. it is very stressful job and will leave you not wanting to work there anymore.. I worked at two different ones and neither iof them were thw same
good,"One thing I didn't like about DG is that they say customers come first, but they had you doing a billion things and only one cashier working up front there is no way you could give 100% great customer service."
good,Dollar General is a good starting job for students or for those that wants to seek experience in the retail/ customer services area. You can learn skills.
good,"Saw a lot of changes in my years of service, during my tenure their were 4 different CEO's. The demands of labor and workload didn't always match.  Company has good upside and will continue to be successful."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. I like that there is always something going on. Either stocking, doing new layouts or just helping the consumer it made time there fun."
good,"The job was easy and the work environment was really fun. The management at the time was pretty terrible but since the change in management, it's definitely a great place to have worked."
good,"Great job if you are a people person, some days are busy. some days you have to multi task. great WORK environment. on truck days you will be pretty busy"
good,manager was a laughing stock. did not have schedules ready and would want you to call her the night before you were to work and find out it you had to open the next morning.  played favorites
good,"For the hours and for what you have to do is not worth the pay they give you.  You would have to work by yourself for at least 3 to 4 hours and in that time you have to stock, cashier and make sure everything is in order in the store, one person can't do that and keep customers happy."
good,If you like to stay busy and work hard with little pay I would recommend this place. They are always under staffed and under paid. This is ideal for someone who needs part time work/
good,enjoy helping customers save money and find affordable solutions for their  budgets.  Love helping the elderly especially.  They are so appreciative of the simple things.
good,on a typical day at dollar general I put up stock greet customers. I enjoy what I do because I enjoy working with the public. I enjoy working for dollar general.
good,very fast paced with only two employees working when there should be more at peak times. was robbed at gunpoint and store was lacking in security measures
good,Its a job... It gives you a pay check. Its what you pit into it. If you want it to work tha. It will work. Not the worse job i have had but not the best.
good,"This job was very stressful and was not a good work environment for me.  For someone looking for a first job it would be a good start, just not something to be at forever."
good,"run registers, put away freight , reset shelves for new products and reset endcaps all the time.     Hardest part of job is unloading freight when working around customers to not get in their way.      Most enjoyable part interacting with the customers and helping to find what they are looking for and to see them smile."
good,"Slow pace and incredibly easy job. The schedule is ridiculous, i was hired for day shift but from day one worked nothing but nights. Stocking and loading was easy even with a constant stream of customers. Other employees were less than satisfying to work with. Only managers got breaks."
good,"Working for Dollar General was a eye opening experience.  I learned a lot about people and the lack of pride in workmanship. Also, the part of town we were in was less than desirable."
good,Great people at all levels of the company - joining makepositive is like joining a family and everyone is supportive of each other and has a great time together.
good,"The money is the only good thing about the company, at least if you in management. There is always room to grow with them if you can handle the immaturity of the company itself."
good,"Dollar General was a decent place to work it had its ups and downs but over all it was not a bad job, there was just no career in it for me. unless you are in the management area of Dollar General there is no future i just wanted more of a career then that."
good,My last job i was working for aerotek and they sent me to hyundai and everday i woke up a couple hours early so i can make it work on time then i would  step on the line to do work.
good,Its very simple to work your way up but hard to get into a full time position. Part time didn't really get any benefits which is not too uncommon I suppose. Wish my area had better management.
good,"Satisfying until something else better becomes available to me. My typical day included working as a lead associate, cashier and unloading trucks. I enjoyed working for Family Dollar."
good,If you like stocking and interacting with customers this is the job for you. At times you would have to come in early and help unload the truck and put up products.
good,I enjoyed working there. It was just hard to put up stock and also checkout customers when very busy. Liked all my co workers. Had great team work. Enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"I ran a cash register, stocked shelves, assisted customers find items that they were looking for,some paperwork such as deposits and balancing the drawers at the end of the shift for each cashier on duty."
good,Loved working there the manager was nice n understanding. I loved being there for people and helping people. It put a smile on my face to help people. The hours just wasn't there
good,Some days was very long and if some one calls out you would have to stay. Be xtra careful with your till cause you responsible for it. And you must be prompt
good,Working here allows me to work at my own pace with reasonable time frames to get things done. The hardest part of the job is keeping your mind focused on one task for long periods of time.
good,"I have been with the company 4 1/2 years.  Corporate doesn't care about their workers, just how much $$ your store brings them.  There are no benefits (besides vacation for full-timers). "
good,"Typical day is busy, backing up register well stocking and other daily tasks. Enjoyed serving the community."
good,"I enjoyed my work, but I left because I had a baby. Dollar General was a nice family oriented company where you could work in the neighborhood in which you lived."
good,Dollar general had me stock boxes on the top of  shelves when I was pregnant and the managers did not care they just wanted the stuff done but other than that there okay pay is just to low to live on
good,"If you have the right manager things can go right, but most of the time they don't. Getting days off is hard. Getting hours is hard. There are never enough. The theft in the stores is more stressful than it needs to be. DG doesn't do enough to stop it, however they will prosecute employees who steal and even employees who don't steal. It is very sad."
good,My first job arriving in Georgia. It was a good experience but not very safe. Store frequently would get robbed and was not worth me staying there. No security
good,Open store. Greet customers.Perform normal retail tasks.Unlad truck.Stock shelves.Customer service.Swept and mopped floor every night.Took bank deposit to bank.
good,"I would work back there if I could, I had lots of fun working there, the customers are very polite and its a laid back place and relaxing place to be."
good,"i have fun working at dollar general, customers are nice and easy going as well as the people i work with. Its fast pased your aways on the move, its never dull in the dollar general"
good,High stress fast paced not enough associates not enough hours part timers get more hours than managers high theft stores rude customers all about sales
good,"Fast paced, constant changing, and some stress. Managers need more payroll hours to get all areas to make sure every tasks gets completed. Also they need to pay more to the hourly employees"
good,the manager's job is verystressful and Cutthroat you have to meet certainvgoals of sales some district managers are very nice them are very cut-throat mean managers are salary and expected to work 48 hours plus every week
good,"Weekly pay"
good,"customer service, cashier, stock, truck, opening and closing the store, counting down drawers and bank drop. The hardest part of the day was truck and the most part of the day was communicating with the customers."
good,Work hard and opportunities are there. Morning shift was stocking and evening was cleaning store. Management was short handed. And customers loved me because of my dedication I have toward them on helping them while they shopped.
good,If given the opportunity to work for this company again..I would take the job because it would actuallybecome a career.I would like to be given another chance
good,I was there over a year and was never given the appropriate hours  id asked. I worked my tail off for no appreciation. its a great store and wonderful merchandise but staffing was always a problem. always turn overs there.
good,managment needs more work and needs someone who know how to run the business i dont have anything to else to say about the company other than that the company is a good place to work
good,"Opening the store for the day, getting registers ready for the day, quick mop of the store. "
good,It was a slow work environment. It didn't involve a lot of customers. The work was easy to do so it was boring really fast. Poor management. It was a lot of gossiping and wondering whether your paycheck was going to get stubbed or not.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Dollar General, but even up to the level of the store manager, you do way more work and go through way more hair pulling than what you're paid for, and the only raise you get is your annual one. I was even told by my stores assistant manager that if you get a pay raise via promotion then you won't get your annual raise. It's a great place to work, and lot's of fun. Just stressful and not a lot of opportunity for advancement or raises."
good,This company was very difficult to work for.  Dollar General could never keep employees and they would not pay accordingly to the job that the employees were doing.
good,Dollar General was a very simple job but it was also set at a pace. You have certain things to get done in order to get things rolling. Meeting new people was always great.
good,"I enjoyed the team share that was given,i had to open boxes stock selves,the hardest part of the job was having to lift up boxes.There were times where we had fun days,like picnics for the family."
good,"I enjoyed my job here for the short time it lasted, I needed something to pay my bills more as I was about to be a father and needed more of a consistent job."
good,On Friday and Saturday mornings it was very fast paced because that was when we stocked the shelves with all of the new items. During the evening it was more laid back.
good,it was a ok job. i became a key holder within months of me starting. good fun job place. fast palce at times but overall very easy. it really loved working here
good,"it was an okay experience, the manager was okay the job was fairly easy to do. the customers were awesome, and the coworkers were very friendly........"
good,"I enjoyed meeting new customers and seeing daily customers. They were very nice to me. My co workers were helpful, but the turnover is very bad. We always hired new employees. My supervisor was very understanding and helpful. It was face paced for the most part, but very slow on certain days."
good,dollar general is an ok place to work and it teaches you a lot about the ground work of retail. the environment was kind of fun depending  on the location
good,"Dollar General's sales associate position is a good first job for a high school teen, or a twenty-something year old college student, whether as a summer job, or weekly part time income. The review summary title says all."
good,"worked 50 plus hours a week, was hard to please my DM.  Did not want to go another 10 years in a job that was not as fulfilling as i wanted. i want to retire with the next company."
good,"Dollar general is a great company to work for. A normal day an assistant manager is helping customer, stocking shelves, and run the register. Dollar General managers and assist managers shouldn't have young children."
good,"Pretty good company, manager at the time was not the greatest, didn't properly train employees, or explain policies. Was left to learn my job as I went. Manager did not show up on my first Saturday shift to show me how to check-in the truck."
good,it was a slow paced job. I was a keyholder so i learned managment skills. i enjoyed meeting different people everyday.  It wasnt a boring job. It was a clean environment. I would recommend it to friends who enjoy sales
good,Love the people here it is really close to my house management is ok some drama not more than anywhere else just have to watch who you tell what to some like to talk about others
good,"liked working there, didn't love it as a career, but it was nice . management was cool. always room to move up in that company. friendly environment, good money, good hours"
good,"This job was great. I left to join the military but I would definitely go back. Great staff, they made sure I was properly trained. Very calm environment, great place to work."
good,"This location was a little stressful due to customers with attitudes and the countless shoplifters, the manager at the time believed it was our responsibility to stop them however with inadequate surveillance equipment that was hard to do."
good,"As Asst Manager I didn't see where as the Asst go through a on the job training seminar and training updates, it seems it is for managers only and this can teach newcomers coming on as asst. managers."
good,This job was temporary due to the fact that I was offered a higher paying salary at another company in Florida just after graduating from Ultimate Medical Academy.
good,"Fast paced, high stress job with no benefits. Not a great first job. Great if you like face to face interaction with the public, but is not a job for someone with social anxieties."
good,A continuous schedule samething every week. Follow the 7 day workflow. Clean up after yourself and take care the customer. The customer is always first! Definitely have to follow the instructions of the manager and the dm. Do what is asked of you.
good,Its slow but can be fasted and assistant manager doesn't always out in the work her should and expects the one employee to do it all. so its a frustrating day.
good,They expect way too much to be done for one person. They need more then two people up their at all times. Not just one person .need to work as a team.
good,"cashier, stocking and store straightening and cleaning. need to make sure your money drawer is counted right at the start of your shift and the end of your shift"
good,"I was basically put at a cash register and told to call if I needed help. I wasn't  told if I was doing things correctly. The assistant manager was often outside on a ""smoke break"". Often didn't  know what the work schedule would be. Thee hardest part was not knowing what I was suppose to be doing. The best part was the customers."
good,"Dollar General is not for the faint of heart.  Expect to work, and to work a lot.  As a Store Manager, you worked 6 to 7 days a week due to lack of staff and projects to do."
good,"I loved working as an assistant manager, I loved dealing with customers and being a cashier.  I loved helping organize the store and keeping it a pleasant store for employees and customers."
good,Usually Dollar General store is on a hide place were public is not comon and this makes this store not safe. People can esily do things that are not right.
good,good job friendly environment you can ask your supervisor anything and they always have answer and if they dont they referred you to the correct person who would know
good,You stock you clean you wait on customers overall it's a good starting place. I would definitely recommend people to come and work here or even just to stock
good,"I love customer service, helping and serving others bring me great joy. retail has a extremely large turn over and doesn't allow much time for management to have a personal life,"
good,"Its not to bad as a job you just need to be a people's person."
good,I didn't work for dollar General for that long. Was there for 5 months.they were ok to work for wasn't the best. Short handed too a lot of people were walking out.
good,Here your fellow co-workers will show you everything you need to know  how about retail and also point you in the right direction to become a very successful cashier
good,not enough hours are provided to adequetly operate the store.. inventory management is for the most part out of your control. you are sent merchandise that you have to find a place for causing blockage in aisles.
good,I came into the company as a cashier but left as an assistant manager. Team work was never a problem. The hardest part of the job was disrespectful people. The most enjoyable part of the job was the positive work environment set by the employees.
good,my opinion on dollar general is they are a good work place if you want to make a little money when you are in the high school other than that i wouldn't recommend dollar general because you don't get paid enough and you don't get enough hours
good,"This company was good to work for. Great hours, good scheduling. I liked working with and helping the customers. The pay was OK, good benefits. I just didn't get along with the manager."
good,"I was employed at this business for a little over a year, was relocated to local stores 3 times and never once received a pay raise. The management and environment is great, the company would fit someone thats only looking for part time work and a little extra money."
good,It can be fast paced some days and a slower on others. Friendly staff and flexible hours. The hardest part of the job is the lack of pay and lackluster health benefits.
good,If you are a Sales Associate you cannot get more than 30 hours a week to work. It is definitely not a job to pay the bills. Management is terrible. It is semi-easy to move up the ladder but thats also just more responsibilities that fall back on you.
good,Depending on the store and manager could be a great place to work. Most customers are good and appreciate what you do for them. Putting up the freight could be stressful. With the right team you can get the job done.
good,"When you have a good manager, working with the public is not nearly as bad. However, the public are still awful. If you are going to work with this company make sure you get a good manager."
good,"It was one of the hardest jobs I have had, never knew from one day to the next what time I was going home. the lines of communication were awful. Not a team oriented company."
good,"I love to meet people.  It's a great job if you are a student in the process of trying to get your education.  I stock the store with incoming merchandise.  I mop the floor, and I also monitor the store on a daily basis for spills or hazards for safety issues.  I check customers for merchandise being purchased.  I greet customers, and I thank customers upon leaving."
good,"A typical day at work was standing at the register checking customers out, or assisting customers to find an item. When the truck came in you would stock the item throughout the store and make sure that everything is in order from oldest to newest. That was the hardest part of the job because it was  a lot of lifting the can hurt your back. My coworkers is who i enjoyed the most because the was like family and made sure everything was completed as a team so that the job could get done."
good,you can easily get overwhelmed in that environment. no one is ever held responsible for their actions and no actions get taken on those who are severly taking advantage of the place
good,"I liked being a cashier, it gave me a chance to interact with new people. Dollar General is a good place to work for someone just starting out. It has benefits and is growing every year."
good,"I have worked for this company for a little over two years now, and have learned a great deal in retail. Personally, I think that Dollar General's training program leaves a lot to be desired. Depending on who you work with, it can be an enjoyable job."
good,"standing on feet for eight to ten hours"
good,I cashed people out and help stock the product that came on the truck. When they built the store I worked at I helped set it up and get it ready. I also cleaned the bathrooms
good,This place was hectic to work the management was not fair at all.  It would operate a lot better with proper management in place. The job itself was not hard at all.
good,"i had wonderful manager that was very easy going but hours to work would change at last minute.  With it being night shift and having to be home to pick up my child by a certain time, I couldn't always work the hours needed at last minute."
good,"It was hard being a key holder work with mangers they don't want to do they job put alot of work on me and they didn't pay me or want to give me a raise and I work as a cashier, I stock, clean, I counted deposit's, I ran the shift at night was very scared people steal alot no security"
good,This place is very fast paced and very stressing. But it is a good place to build your customer service skills and to make a paycheck. This is for someone who needs a flexible schedule.
good,It was fun a lot of the time.  The company expected to much to get accomplished in a day I think.  My co-workers were the best part of the job.  People often see retail jobs as not being very difficult but they are really no joke.  I ultimately left the position because I was just so exhausted all the time.
good,"Busy job with not enough pay nor benefits. Company doesnt work with your schedule nor will help you with really growing with them, its always busy and not enough employees"
good,"Liked the job the co-workers made it fun, had to have just a little fun at work. The customers mostly were very friendly and management worked with the employees. The only hard part id say would be when the other employees didn't show up for their shift then things had to be readjusted but over all I enjoyed the work it was a new experience."
good,I enjoyed working at dollar general but at times I felt even though it was part time there could have been better pay as well as hours available. The management team was great.
good,I just had a poor manager who didn't know anything about retail and would change peoples schedules without notification and was very rude.  The workload is high but with the right team it is attainable.
good,"the only thing is, If you put a store in a urban neighborhood expect a lot of theft. It was a lot of the neighborhood customer stealing and I think the store should Have came to that district with a better plan of action for that."
good,"Filling shelfs  of new products, putting up new price tags, following new plamograms for the new resetts, cleaning of the store.  After the remodling I was given an Assist. Manager postion.  Received all vendors in, put way all warehouse shipment away, all banking deposites done, all daily and weekly paperwork done,traing of new crew members."
good,The management was good however the hours you will work are under exaggerated. Job is fast paced and difficult to keep up with but great for those looking to maintain or increase fitness.
good,its a good job the manager is ok she's not the best but she ok and the customers are friendly sometimes but the work is not hard at all but the store is just dirty
good,Nothing to add. Temporary job for extra money. I enjoyed working there. it was a very hard time to make the store in tip top shape after the remodel...
good,"It is a very stressful work environment. If you are good at your job, be prepared to do somebody else's on top of doing yours. Management is clueless."
good,it was a great job overall but the crime rate was crazy a lot of people stole out of the stores you cant watch every customers that comes in there and it was very open cash register right at the door.
good,"management"
good,"I was able to enjoy my job, create a harmonious environment, due to escellent management. I had many repeat customers. We all worked as a team."
good,"It can be a good place and provide for a need in your life for a time, but be prepared to work very hard. customers are good. retail is retail, but no"
good,"A typical work day would always include unloading freight and stocking shelves. Working on plan o grams, resetting required end caps, and clip strips."
good,I enjoy working with public.received lots of experience in retail business.learned about ordering merchandise for company.all aspects of retail.also learned about hours company gives t o make scheduling for week or bi weekly.
good,"working at dollar general is easy going until we have our rushes. i learned a lot about our work, and other employees work. management is good. the hardest part of the job is being able to help make the customers happy. the most enjoyable part is knowing that the customer left the store happy."
good,Doing the things the store manager needed done. Cleaning open and closing the store unloading truck and stocking it. Tending to customers and helping them.
good,A typical day at work is getting myself organized for my shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday and giving 100% customer service to each and every customer.
good,"You run open and or close the store, run the register, clean the floors and bathroom,  stock the shelves, zone or recover the products, unload trucks, a little of everything for minimum wage and only a few hours of work a day."
good,Flexible scheduling but unclear of the dress code. They are not very clear with expectations and not very understanding with emergencies but overall easy place to work.
good,"Checking in  merchandise vendors, delivery trucks, overlook cashier operations, make bank deposits, scheduling , payroll.  The hardest part of job is being accurately trained before being left to run store smoothly and proficiently, by Dollar General rules and correct protocol."
good,"I personally liked the company, but the location the store was in was not very pleasant. It was actually a high volume store for crimes to happen. Had I known that going into it, I would have went with a different job opportunity."
good,A great day at work for most days. I absolutely loved my customers.. There were times that I had to be acting manager because the manager wouldn't show up
good,The manager does not care about the customers same with a lot of the other sales associates. Myself and the assistant manager were the only ones who were kind and cared about the customers.
good,Like getting up at 5 in the morning to do my morning stock then by 8  in the store love the people very friendly by 12 or 1 my day was over so I had a lot of free time
good,a typical day at work was very laid back and enjoyable with the smell of brisket and chicken in the air. it was a small workplace with only 2-3 people working a day.
good,The worst part of the entire job is the rude people that you have to deal with every day! Other than that the managers are super friendly and also the corporate managers are not as bossy as it would seem.
good,"I've always enjoyed working as a cashier and stocker helping others."
good,On a typical day mostly stock  items or cashier. A work day was usually a 7 hour shift. Sometimes longer. I didnt agree with the pay unless you was a key holder your pay was a little better
good,Overall Dollar General is a great place to start at if other companies are not wanting to hire you because of no work experience. You'll adapt skills for the long run.
good,okay. was a nice place work at the time. to each its own everybody  have different ways of working so if you can get along with your workers and managers all as well.
good,Disregard for employees rhat work their buttstock off to only worry about that bottom line. Expect way to much work for the pay given. No positive reinforcment
good,"all ways busy"
good,Extensive customer interaction required. Job requires a lot of time and energy. When the store is staffed with the right people daily workflow is fairly smooth and productive.
good,I enjoyed the interaction with new people but the job asked for way more than u were paid for. They start you out at 7.25 an hr and dont give and incentives for at least a year
good,It was a experience i will never forget that's for sure. Good people and great place to work with. I learned alot and will carry that with me through out teaching others as well.
good,"You always have something to do and there is not a dull moment."
good,"I like working here , it's much easier than I thought and we as a team manage to get work completed. We recently won #1 customer service award in our district. Overall I like it"
good,"Typically 9-10 hour day. Hiring, training and developing employees. High volume of customers on a daily basis. Maintaining daily store cleanliness. Handling cash and deposits daily."
good,Although my stint with the company wasn't long at all; I still enjoyed every minute I had with the company. The work environment was nice mainly because of the customers.
good,"Dollar General is ok to work for.  Your co-workers are pretty awesome, but corporate like to cheat managers. If Dollar General could get away with it they would not pay their employees."
good,stocking of shelves and displays. having to work well with other staff and management. taking the lead in problem solving. assisting customers with concerns and purchases
good,This was a decent work experience. Some very rude customers but the staff were fun. I would usually have to run the register while managing to restock the store.
good,This job required a lot of on the feet work. You had to keep yourself busy even if there were no customers. When there is a lot of customers it helped pick up the pace.
good,At the time I was young single mother and this was a tuff job. Lots of hours away from my kids. But the pay was fair and the supervisor was a good lady.
good,the company was great the upper management DM's and the worst. our store was robbed at gun point and no one called or showed up all they said on the phone was I'm glad they didn't kill you
good,"Didn't get enough hours ..didn't have help to assist heavy lines employees talk about manager argued with them"
good,watch yourself and always have your own back make sur ethey fully train you but if you are self driven and fast pace than youll be perfect and remeber to breathe
good,"I don't know about other Dollar General locations, but the location that I worked was very tiresome. It was always busy, short on staff, angry customers, and management (the company in general) don't understand at all how the store should be ran. Never listens to hard working workers. That's why the good workers always leave."
good,Very fast pace job. You are expected to wait on the customers as well as help work freight. There are usually only two people working the store at a time so it can get a little overwhelming.
good,Normal retail job. Assisted customers at checkouts and out on the floor. Put stock away and faced the shelves. Made sure store was clean for customer safety.
good,This is a the most stressful job I have had. Store manager don't do her paperwork if she has ran a register. She don't count safe when she opens in the morning. One of the key holders is very rude. He does what he wants ans nobody says a word to him.
good,I was very busy with school and my first child when I worked for the dollar General  and it was so easy to work around my busy schedule. I'm very grateful for the way we all treated each other with respect.
good,I  greet the customers as they walk in the door with a smile on my face. And I also ask the customers if they find everything okay In which   if they need help I will assist them
good,My experience here was ok. Didn't really have a problem with coworkers or customers. They seemed decently managed at the time. They seem to be doing better since they fire my manager.
good,Dollar general was awesome. You did more than just serve people you actual got to the store and the people are so nice. But employees come and go a lot.
good,A good place for someone to get their first job. I wouldn't recommend being an manager. Theres just to many communication errors. The job is not worth the stess
good,Fun and enjoyable place to work!  I worked as a cashier and learned how to run a cash register.I would say  Management was the hardest part of my job.
good,I liked working there because I was able to meet a lot of new people. The job itself was very unorganized. The management was horrible. Each employee was considered anther body in the door
good,It was fast paced and a little stressful the pay could be better with all they want you to do on a daily bases. I honestly would not recommend this job to a friend.
good,"its a great company to work for the store manager was great to work with. i was one of his best work i was a cashier coming in the door. then i became and key holder, over the night shift cashier do the nightly deposits work stock if we short of help."
good,I loved working with my coworkers at dollar general. i hated working the truck.I didnt mind the hours other then truck days. I was treated as family by all.
good,Not a bad place. Wasn't there long enough to really get a feel for it. Boss was nice. Hours were ok. Never met any of the higher ups. But all in all not a bad place to work for.
good,I enjoy working with the public on a daily basis and also working with the vendors and my co workers. The atmosphere is ok along with everything else.
good,Management wasn't as good as expected...ii made enough but my hours got cut alot...i had to find a second job just to make enough money for college...
good,It's ok yes it is a job but the organization is kinda sloppy and could be better run. I have worked for the company about 4 years and have enjoyed the customers I have met during my time.
good,I worked for the company for 5 years. In the five years I advanced to assistant manager. I loved interacting with customers. I enjoyed learning about the products as well.
good,it was ok job family oriented job just HR didnt care about well being of the employees great company benefits you get nice percentage paid if meet production on week to week bases
good,Working part time your lucky if you get 4 hours a week to work and when they do put you on the schedule they work you very hard. While everyone else is doing less or nothing.
good,"dollar general employees were very helpful and attentive to the procedures of the remodels, The office personnel was very active in the learning of new procedures and the concern of our well-being during workdays"
good,I worked the register as well as working the floor. I would stalk and help costumers find what they needed or checked them out. I would clean the store after closing.
good,"Overworked, but have room for advancement. The job can be easy if have the correct team working for you, otherwise it will be a complete headache and very stressful for the pay."
good,My position was a key holder. Which put me below assistant manager but above cashier's. Not worth the extra 50 cents an hour for the added things we did. Too much turn over of employees in store.
good,I liked it a lot at first. I enjoyed the people. Learning how to use this type of register was informative and fun. It allowed me to gain retail experience.
good,You can work there if you actually can keep up.  Your are required to meet production each day you come to work.  There are a lot of people who work there who actually love it
good,"My direct manager was great.  The work was hard but fun.  "
good,i liked working at dollar general. the coworkers were easy to get along with and management was great. The hardest part about being there was always being so short staffed but we made it work.
good,DG is not a bad company to work for. they have a lot of potential buttttt they are heading down the bad management road and that mean the end will be close lol.
good,You definitely have to work hard at dollar general cashiers and key holders always have to stay busy and do stuff which can cause us not to. E at the registers which can cause customers to be very upset also there is only two people o shift one cashier one manager you never get a break with out being called to do something so that whole thing about legally having a break without being bothered doesn't exists. And the pay is very minimal for what we do especially key holders
good,The one I worked for was like a mini Wall Mart. The cash register never worked properly and we were always having to reboot them. But I have to say that's where I got my first retail experience and management experience.
good,"It was fun, but due to medical reasons, i wasn't able to work there very long. Management was great and very instructive. I had no problems with management or how we worked."
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General. I thought by getting another job with higher pay would benefit me and it didn't. I still would love to work at dollar general.
good,Working as a cashier can be quite difficult when you are trying to complete you daily task and also trying to assist customers at the same time . And it's not always guaranteed to have 30 or more hours a week.
good,Working as a cashier can be quite a difficult job if you aren't a good hands on person. The hardest part of the job would be getting your tasks done in time while assisting customers at the register.
good,"Dollar General was a good place to work, and I loved working there. The only problem I had was balancing work and school, and having my voice heard by management. If I could balance out being a full time college student and working 35 hours a week at the same time then I would still be working for the company, but during midterms and finals working that much was impossible for me. My future career will always come before a part time job."
good,i didnt like working here... it wasnt my cup of tea.... dont get me wrong i love my coworkers but not enough hours i only pay 50 dollars on a good week
good,Pretty laid back. Coworkers were helpful whenever a conflict arose. Learned how to deal with customer disputes and point them in the best direction...
good,"This job wasn't too bad at all. The days are kind of long sometimes, but the work isn't hard. If you can stand for hours straight, this job won't take too much out of you."
good,"Love the store I work in. The manager is great, but the company has some unrealistic expectations.  We have the largest store in the area and they do not allow enough hours for this store to achieve their goals."
good,A very good company to work for in terms of opportunities to advance from within.  A good system in place that leads to success when all procedures are followed.
good,"It wasn't very hard work, check customers out, stock shelves, move and fix things that are out of place. I enjoyed the people that I worked with, they were all very nice and helpful from the time I started to the time I finished working there. The only problem was when they were giving us a new manager, my scheduling just did not work out anymore. It was like the new manager couldn't figure out how to work around my school schedule, and I'm in college so that's something that comes first overall. But, for the most part it was a good work environment."
good,A typical day at work consisted of stocking and ringing up customers. Making sure all our merchandise is pulled forward with label facing. Check dates to make sure none of the products have expired.
good,Customer service was the main part of the job greet and thank them and advise them to come back. Didn't learn anything that I didn't already know . Management was good and for the most part professional at all times. The work place was well maintained at all times. There was nothing hard about this job that I can recall. I enjoyed meeting new people and the customers were pretty friendly as well.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar General over the past summer (2016). The co-workers were friendly and welcomed me with open arms.  After receiving the proper training necessary, I felt at home and part of the team.  Working closing hours most nights, I felt I did my job adequately and with very little trouble.  Overall I enjoyed working there and the only issue I had was the pay not being worth the amount of hours I worked each week."
good,Haven't worked for this company in years but they seem to be staying on top of the logistics world. It was a good place to work and still seem to be going strong in the Oklahoma community around here.
good,A typical day at work varies as some days are harder than others. The company expects a lot and sometimes has impossible tasks. It all depends on your manager and your DM.
good,"I usually worked from 2-10 as a key holder stocking the shelves, helping cashier when needed. Counting money and doing a deposit after we closed making sure the customers are happy with the service."
good,My store is one of the best places to work.the people are great to work with and the ones that come in are greaat people to know. Manger will work with you as long as it benefits them.
good,"just another basic retail job. it all depends on management on wither or not it will be a good job. the first store i worked at had an amazing manager that i would do anything for but when i moved the new manager i worked for was lazy and was hardly ever at the store. she is why i quit, no respect for lazy."
good,I really didn't like the work place environment everyone wanted to be the boss. there was no structure I wouldn't recommend them to anyone especially if they have the same management.
good,Fun work environment people friendly  store  great consumers services only thing I don't like is no benefits slow work days and the one I was at had the minimum pay rate for my position if u want a quick short term gig it's the best place
good,"Management was great, to much was expected to be done, never able to make plans at times someone would be calling off or coming in late and had to stay later then you wanted to."
good,Its a good job to have when you have no job but as making it a life career lots of room to advance but you may have to move for the advancement. Only assistance managers and managers are offered benefits.
good,Good job. Nice people. Could pay better. I enjoy the people I work with . Not enough hours . The pay could be better. They are very flexible when it comes to family and needing time off
good,Management was very lacking. New hires only lasted for a week at a time. Schedules changed without notifications to the employees...just bad management.
good,This good opportunity to work your way up with a company that is growing fastly. Many advancements and opportunity. And will educate you for future plans.
good,I loved that I stayed super busy. The people were nice. On typically fday I worked evneings. When we went busy at the regesters we were busy restocking shelves. I loved my experience with dollar general.
good,"they have a horrible pay rate with minimal chances for a raise, and when you do get a raise its also very minimal. they expect one person to be able to do the work of three people and are very backwards about certain things. also a lot of favoritism and inappropriatenesns throughout the entire company."
good,i loved that i moved positions very quickly. basically started as a night manger the work was light besides freight which you had to unload all weekend long.
good,"cashier, you have to maintain the front desk.  keep aisles clean and answer phones and check customers out. and when there are sales on things you have to put the tags out."
good,It was okay. a typical day was fine. Didn't learn a lot. management was fine but lackluster. The culture was mostly non existent. hardest part of the job was dealing with faulty equipment.
good,"the company was great for me to start over and make a fresh start for me."
good,"at the time working here was just a place to come to work and if you made friends on the way great, not everybody showed up so that meant you had to do extra and did not feel appreciated for the work you did."
good,I liked working here because i got to do what I love to do work with customer and stock. learned about bar codes. Very nice environment to work in. My team there was GREAT!
good,i was working on getting the new store together  building shelves stocking items pricing items unloading the truck wiping down the shelves cleaning the old store out
good,"I had a good time working at this particular Dollar General. It is situated in the proximity of everything. the crew were nice, and overall liked working there."
good,I have work for three different stores and for the most part was a fun place. Lack of staffing can be an issue and dose cause customer to become upset. Overall a good place to work.
good,"Usually very organized, with clear rules and expectations. Expect to go above and beyond, and to be paid close to minimum wage. There are always things to do therefore the day goes by very fast."
good,People were nice good place to work.  Went in to work stock shelves checked customers out and unloaded trucks.  The pay was low but that was understandable.
good,When in first starterd it was great. Even though it was a steady job I still enjoyed getting to see new faces an make friends with the customers. Yet the pay could of been a lot better with all the work you have to do.
good,"The hardest part of the job was, unloading the truck. The customers was most enjoyable. The out of state dollar general I previous worked at was filthy."
good,"I worked as a cashier at Dollar General and at first, my coworkers were definitely easy to work and very fun to work with but things start to change after awhile. A typical day working here consists of cash handling, providing customer service, stocking, recovering and sometimes doing inventory for the store. The hardest part about the job is doing inventory because you have to learn how to read the labels in order to find the items, especially for the new stores."
good,open store to public. great manament service  make my cashier feel good about ther jobs.very laid back great workers stocking and ringing up coustomers . the hardest part  was unloading the trucks  this job because everyone worked as a team. having ppl who u could depend on to come to work.
good,working at dollar general you would have to be able to help put the truck out and run the register at the same time you would also have to do a full recovery on the store sweep and mop every night and make sure the store looks nice for the next shift but overall it's a great job
good,Made sure shelves were neatly stocked with labels facing outward for easier browsing. Operated cash register while greeting customers entering the store and helped them locate the items they needed.
good,"On a typical day, I stocked shelves in between checking out customers. It was frustrating at times trying to get all your stock away when it was a busy day."
good,I love my customers. It was a really great place to work for. The management was great to work with very out going. There wasn't a hard part about working there.
good,i was on a smart team where i did resets on stores. i even got to put together a store. i got to learnthings most employees didnt get to. i would recommend.
good,"The atmosphere was really laid back. I didn't feel so pressured, which helped with my anxiety. I adored my co-workers, very easy to get along with as well."
good,Very fun and friI endly people that I worked with at Dollar general. Was very flexible at working diffrent things while I was there between cashier work and stocking.
good,"Long hours with no life and work balance. Great place to work for, but no opportunities for advancement. Overstocking of stores. To much merchandise and no where to stock and make the store look good by planagrams."
good,"Typical day at DG is like the energizer bunny, you go go go until the time you leave. It is a great job if you can keep up with all the responsibilities and tasks. Depending on what kind of manager you have is how u will enjoy your job. Overall if u can handle fast paced and constantly being busy then u will love your job."
good,"It's a nice part time job, my manager works with my schedule really well. We are short staffed at the moment so having a doctor's note is a must for missing a day. They still get fussy about it but they can't fire you. I've been with them for 7 months and have had no raise or advancement. Looking for better pay."
good,I had to run cashier and unload a truck by myself. They don't give uou very many hours but want a lot of stuff done. Also the pay is not worth working there
good,a typical day depending on the shift I'm working that day including on preparing the drawer and getting the deposit ready for the bank. After that depending on the staff will determine if i will be running a register. At the end of each cashiers shift I am responsible for counting their drawer down and handling the money. The job for the most part was very enjoyable.
good,Your coworkers are great depending on who they are. I would say there is a high turnover rate at certain stores. LOTS of walking and climbing ladders. I learned a lot about people and different peoples management skills as a result of circumstances that occurred while I was employed there. I would say the hardest part of working there were certain customers. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers that I still have relationships with.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Dollar General while I was in high school.  The pay was low, but the hours were flexible and allowed me to take other side jobs in the area (a heavily agricultural area) to make extra money.  My manager was outstanding and very charismatic.  There were few opportunities to advance past cashier/clerk, but I also did not seek them out.  I spent most of my shift stocking shelves, facing inventory, and running a cash register and point-of-sale machinery.  I enjoyed the customer interaction most of the time, but Dollar General tends to attract some unruly customers.  "
good,team work is always best when it comes to those at DG. They work together to make sure things are done the way they are supposed to be. The store manager is really awesome!
good,"Enjoyed my experience here, learned so much about commercial property management and management as a whole. Very honored to have this on my resume. Great experience!"
good,I was employed for one week due to a personal family matter I had to relocate back to my home town. While employed i learned proper stock techniques and basic cashier duties.
good,"My experience working at Dollar general was pretty good ! I was already familiar with the stocking so that was cake, also the cashier I had a lil trouble with but that wasn't nothing I couldn't handle. Staff was great, everyone worked, greeted a customer with a smile, very helping & hardworking."
good,its always good when you have steady work and a pay check that is on time. the people are okay. it keeps you busy so the work day goes by quicker. some store managers i worked under were over the top and needed anger management. throwing merchandise at your employees is never okay
good,"A very good customer relation job. This job consisted of running a cash drawer, stocking, cleaning, facing merchandise. Sweeping cleaning the lot. I liked this job because of the customers."
good,you have to lift heavy items but its a good place to work and it pays every week. you will be a part time worker unless you want to be a key holder or manager.
good,it was an alright place to work once you get past management and are able to handle the jobs that they provide you with. You have to be willing to work hard.
good,dollar general is a good place to work...managment is layed back and easy going...you get benfits once you get past probation period... you will learn many new skills and meet new people daily
good,it's okay. Just a job. pay isn't great. it can be really hard to get full time but you can usually get right under 35 if you express that you really need the hours.
good,There is too much to get done and not enough time. They need to hire more employees. The pay isn't near enough. It's stressful trying to do everything at once.
good,"I loved being a part of Dollar General. Very fun environment. Not as big as Walmart, but a lot of learning involved. Started out as a third key manager and ended up as an assistant store manager. I was able to create a fun, yet determined group of associates to get the job done correctly. The only problem with my position was being robbed early in the morning. I was sent to a store in a bad location because the district manager wanted me to work on another store to help get them ready for their inventory. The other store was an absolute mess. Once I began working and almost had the store at perfection I was robbed coming in to open the store. One of the most horrifying days of my life."
good,DollarGeneral was my first job. What I've learned while being their was you have to have great communication skills and know how to multitask also know your math. Dollar general was a great place for me to start I can now say I have lots ofexpierence from there. From Money handling to customer service and management dealing with paperwork and customers was great.
good,Dollar general is a great company. They offer great benefits and 401k. They have a hirefrom within policy which means there is great oppurtunity for advancement.
good,Typical retail job. Nothing good or bad about this place. Great place for a college student or for a part time job for extra money. Always worked with my schedule.
good,I enjoyed working with the regular customers and getting to know the residents. The only thing I didn't like about the store was i was getting paid for 2 jobs. Working cash register and stocking shelves.
good,worked to remodel the store from stock movement to shelving breakdown and replacing with new shelving and restocking all the products once completed.  Good experience.
good,It  was a good environment to work in. Everyone got alone .it was fun but we still got the job done. The most enjoyable part .of the job was meeting all the different people thAt came in the store. There reaping wasn't nothing hard about the job not to me anyway.
good,"Working for Dollar General was a wonderful learning experience. Dealing with the general public is always a challenging, yet rewarding experience. The workplace was just the right size to not be overwhelming to upkeep. Management was always helpful and hands-on with merchandising and assisting customers as needed."
good,"not a fun place to work. no room for advancement"
good,I enjoy my job most of the time. But it can be stressful at times also.There is always so much to do and not enough people to do the work that needs to be done. I enjoy the people I work with.
good,the job itself was good and easy to follow the company worked well with schedules I was able to further advance my knowledge on shelving placements and product placement and able to learn more about retail management
good,"I stocked shelves and ran cash register. sometimes did inventory."
good,"A typical day would consist of running the cash register and then stocking the shelves between customers. Then at night, get ready for closing time. Fun"
good,"always new items and people to deal with, store is small and the employees are not happy most times due to worker shortages."
good,I worked there for 3 years and had several promotion's but management was horrible. They would change the schedule every two days without warning and you had no chance to make plans. They had their favorites who got the better shifts while i worked 10 nights straight almost every week with small children at home.
good,I have worked for the company for 7 years and feel as though I have nothing to show. I have no work life balance with the job that I currently have and feel like it is taking over my life.
good,"I didn't work there for very long, but the short amount  of time I did it was decent.  It wasn't very organized but the customers  made the job worth it."
good,I have learned many things working at Dollar General. I started out as a night time cashier and worked my way up to a Store Manager position. I worked in a high shrink store in the Lansing area. I learned ways of reducing shrink.
good,"I really loved my job until upper management cut payroll budget so much that it was impossible to achieve work load goals. Team work could be accomplished if they would allow employees enough hours to make it worth their time to come to work, and pay above minimum wage"
good,"Maintained knowledge of current menu items, garnishes, ingredients and preparation methods. Appropriately suggested"
good,"Ok place to work. little pay no life . If you enjoy working in the retail,customer service field you will enjoy this part of the job. As a manager you will have a lot on your plate that some time will not be your fault. Ex, shop lifters. If you looking to move up to a district manager with  a better company discount stores are a good training goal."
good,Assisted with customers who look to get items needed for everyday life and also made sure the store was presentable for the supervisors.
good,I enjoyed working there. I worked on an assembly line so it was pretty easy and fast paced. The pay was pretty good also I got paid weekly which was amazing. And they uped their starting pay from the last time I worked there.
good,"Typical day is usually 10 to 12 hours stocking, merchandising, greeting customers, managing daily tasks and staying on budget as all tasks are completed.  Job can be very stressful and require a lot of your time.  Best results are when store is fully staffed with people who are passionate about their position as you are."
good,"typical day, Stocking the shelves, checking out the customers, most times open and closing. I learned there are only a few times you can make a mistake at the cash register. Management was okay some fun others, not so much. there was only two people in the store at a time, diverse when the shifts changed but that's about it. hadrest part about the job, Acting like I really like people, even when their rude. best part, going home and getting the check at the end of the week."
good,I have no comments about this company. I honestly don't have anything to say about this company. I don't have any comments what so ever.
good,Long hours face pace very hot to very cold good employees over worked nice people very good group work few holiday's off high turnover rate
good,"This job will keep you on your toes. None stop working. From stocking to taking care of customers, to cleaning, to everything else. You almost always find what you need given it's convenience."
good,"I learned a lot such as being assistant manager/lead sales associate, running a register and opening and closing store."
good,I don't have anything to say but they need to schedule 2 or more people at all times when opened. I also think they should close @ 8:00 pm not 10:00 pm. @ night time it is so dead. I also think they should give a full time position at least 35 hours a week.
good,"Typical day customer service, ran the register, stock, managed employees. Learned good people skills and skill to help run a more productive job environment"
good,"dollar general overall is a great work environment, the work team is very hands on in helping new employees succeeding there company"
good,"A typical day involved opening or closing, processing freight, doing layouts, ringing and helping customers. In my short time I learned to prioritize many tasks work with management to achieve goals. A good clear training program.The hardest part was closing most of the time and most enjoyable was working with customers and staff."
good,I loved this Job but did not like the Pay Had no Raises and did not get any promotions so it had put a set back Financially other that that I enjoyed being Part of a Team.
good,Working at dollar general I learned good communication skills with customers and how to keep the conversation short and simple. The management was effective and easy going. The hardest part of my job would be the customers at times because of their impatience but with the proper efficiency it would not be a problem. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work together with co-workers in a fast paced environment.
good,"i learned a lot about customer service, with this job you have to deal with a lot of personality's and being able to have patience with customers taught me a lot about how people interact with each other."
good,"Great corporation to work for. A lot of room to advance, not just a job but a career. Enjoyed a regular basis of customers daily. Had great relationships with outside vendors. Way too much to be done in too short of a time frame its expected to be done in with very little allowance of hours for employees to work to get it done. Very poor training, you just get thrown into things without being trained properly."
good,Haven't been with company long enough to form an honest opinion. The wage should be more than $7.75 of starting. This would give individual's the option to stay vice a high turnover rate of staffing
good,"Typically as a key holder you were the store manager, freight worker and cashier.  There were many times when hours were cut because another store in the district used to many hours so you had management trying to get everything done by themselves."
good,It was one of the better jobs I had. Although there's a lot of bending and lifting it has many perks. It didn't offer insurance or benfits but overall it wasn't a bad job just bad management.
good,"Retail in this environment is both fast-paced and highly demanding, with a large volume of customers with each cashier being responsible for nearly $10,000 worth of sales per day with a margin of error for only $2.00. Management can open your register at any time with or without your consent, while all employees, cashiers or otherwise, must use the cash register to clock in or out, giving ample opportunity for counting errors. There is ample room for you to be terminated for a small loss of money that any other company would overlook, with management even admitting that they would not be able to find the reason that said money went missing as there are several reasons it could have happened throughout the day."
good,This job has it's ups and downs. The flexibility of your work schedule varies from week to week. It makes it a little hard to have a work life balance or to plan anything in your personal life.
good,The cashiers had to stock the shelves and help customers at the same time. I wanted a transfer and they would not tell me the truth about whether I got it or not.  It was small and cashiers had a lot of responsibility.
good,"Pay for store manager good, but not great compared to the expected duties and extended hours you have to work to get the jobs done for the week. I liked the job duties because I am not afraid to work. However, I had a skeleton crew, therefore sometimes planograms and such were late. There was absolutely no hours to train new people. Training hours had to be absorbed in the given labor for that week, which was projected at the beginning of the current quarter. In a nut shell, not enough labor to get the job done in a timely manor. I did love giving customer service, solving problems, and mentoring my employees. Those things were rewarding for me."
good,"When I first started, Dollar General was the company I thought I would retire with. It payed fairly well, the advancement opportunities were phenomenal, and management was pretty laid back. Then both my District Manager and Regional Director were replaced. Regional didn't care about anyone and just wants the bonuses. He would get on conference calls telling us that we would lose our jobs if sales didn't increase.He's a young guy that lied on his resume to get the job. My District Manager cared even less then he did. She would fire anyone for any mistake no matter how little. I worked 70+ hours for my manager to treat me like dirt. So glad I left."
good,"I learned office management duties, filing paperwork, counting day deposits and learned multitasking duties when working alone."
good,"*cashiering some days busier then others"
good,A Typical Day At Work Come In Clock In An Get Straight To Work Wither Putting Go Back Back Or Ringing Out A Customer . I Learned That You Have To Have Patience Dealing With Customer Services Different People Attitudes And Personalities The Management Was Poor Because Of The Favoritism That Was Shown.The Hardest Part About The Job Was When The Line Gotten Long An Only You Working But The Most Enjoyable Part Was Learning New Things An Meeting New People.
good,"Fun environment,lovely people,good work place,good pay,customer service,I also like shopping their affordable items,clean environment let of items too choose from"
good,It probably would've been better if it had had a different manager when I was there. All she did was sit around and smoke and didn't do much work. I hear they have a new manager who is much better at her job.
good,"Nice place to work for a part-time job, or for a student.  Enjoy greeting customers, especially the ones that come in on a daily basis.  Friendly and family like environment."
good,It is sometimes hard on these day because there is a lot of stock to put up. Overall you have to make sure there is communication between you and your workers because you need it done right.
good,"Stocking shelves, ringing up customers, general cleaning duties, Just a job to make money, not a good career. Minimal pay, no hours,  bad management.."
good,Dollar General is  good company to work for. Fast paced ever changing always something to be doing. They promote from with in as well as hire outside. Pay and benefits are great once you reach management level.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of working the register, cleaning, stocking and recovery. It was my first job, so I learned a lot about working under someone and taking orders. Management was just as average as the rest of the store. There's really nothing great about management and nothing bad either. I didn't really see the store manager very much but when I did, she would usually give me the orders for the day and then stay in the back doing paper work. The hardest part of the job was being alone for most of the time. I was really new when they just left the store to me the first few times. It wasn't that difficult but there were a few times when I wasn't really trained to accomplish some of the talks I was required to do when the store was left to me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers."
good,"It is an Okay place to work it just wasn't for me. I loved it but they always called me to in to work for people, I pulled double shifts, and came in on the days that I asked off for events."
good,This is a great place to work its very fast paced and exciting at times people are fantastic. I love working truck its really fun.
good,"It all depends on the sales of the store, the more sales the harder and more fast pace of the job."
good,It is a pretty good place to work if you need a job. It isn't very hard to move up if you do what is asked of you and show up when you should be at work.
good,"It was a place where I learned a great deal. I was able to hone my customer service skills, communication skills & management skills. The stability was something that I could not get comfortable with."
good,"Dollar general was a safe work place , overall very friendly people worked there . Had very little to none problems with anybody that came in . I enjoyed my time working there"
good,A good  work place and company  to work for i did lots of stocking cleaning and ran the register  and pick up shifts when someone  called out
good,Great place to work but they don't offer enough hours. 20 hours a week isn't anything for me i spend more time at home and I love to work. But in general this is a great company that has great customer service you really would find a rude employee.
good,"It was a good place to work. I always had something to do. I learned how to count down drawers, and open registers,etc. The most enjoyable part was when I got to be out on the floor getting things done, it made me feel good to be able to day I got a lot done."
good,"I loved working here even tho I thought they could pay more. But it was only part time for me so it was not a big deal. Most people only get 24 hours a week. I was working 16-20. I had weekends off. Easy job once you learn the store. As a cashier you get a chance to meet a lot of people. Some nice, Some are very rude but If you know how to not take people serious you will get a good laugh everyday. I heard of a lot of stores do getting robbed. That was my only issue. If you give then you could be fired or let go but if you do not than you are putting your life at risk"
good,"The hours are long and the work is strenuous, but the starting pay is great for the area.  There's plenty of opportunities for advancement if you put in the time.  The worst part of the job is the lack of communication between supervisors, and that there is no accountability for not doing your job correctly."
good,"a typical day at work would be alright, not to busy not to slow. I learned how to manage money and do credit card transactions. my coworkers were nice."
good,"Dollar General was kind of a strictly ran business. I manned the cash register and had boxes to put away when nobody was at the register, but when the register was too busy for me to put the boxes away, they werent happy with me."
good,"Work is very simple. You either stock items or run the register. However, it can be very unorganized at work and know one knows what t do or handle some situations."
good,"Easy job, but you are overworked and under paid. Sometimes you would be scheduled at all then other times you would be scheduled for a certain amount of hours and then it extremely exceed those originally scheduled hours."
good,"•	Responsible for shipping materials."
good,"I been here for 6 years and overall it's a good job but like any job it has it's ups and downs. I have to stock, run shifts, count money, and make payroll shcdules"
good,Was a nice place to work. Was accused of something that did not happen and let go because of what someone else said. Managers were awesome and were very helpful in any situation
good,"The typical day at work is mainly behind the register. Since the new store opened we have been getting a lot of customers from all around, to include Hallsville, Columbia, Mexico, and Sturgeon. Since we opened the new, bigger store, we need to at least have 3 people on the clock at all times, just to make sure that everyone can get in and out smoothly and not have to wait for a manager from the back to get up front."
good,Not an exciting job but it is very flexible with my schooling. I also like the fact that there is some type of room for advancement. Another plus is the 401k plan that is offered.
good,"This company in general is very strong in the retail market. Great opportunities for advancement, with a large number of very well educated associates."
good,I love to make customers happy I love to help I think my weakest point was having to work the register and the floor at the same time I learned how to damage items which was awesome
good,"Being a people-person really helps with this job; if you aren't, you might struggle with the daily tasks you will need to engage in."
good,"stock shelves, sweep and mop floors, run cash register is a typical work day. didn't have any issues with management or coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening and closing the store, handling operational procedures, assisting cashiers, providing customer service, supervising cleaning staff, setting alarms, and keeping the entry area clean and organized. I enjoyed my job very much because i started out a cashier and was promoted within three months to third key holder. My co-workers were casual and hard workers. The hardest part of the job was assisting the customers with returns, and such because you had different vibes and many different attitudes that walked through the door, and sometimes it was hard to explain procedures and perform them. The most enjoyable part of the job was having to pull names at Christmas and having a Christmas dinner at work."
good,On a daily basis I would either stock the shelves or run the cash register.  I also helped customers find things that they were looking for.  The hardest part of the job was the pressure on my back from all the lifting.  I also did not like that you had to be a friend to the manager to advance at the store.
good,my review overall i enjoy working here.. it has a lot of perks for working here getting hands on hand training with manager opening and closing the store procedure
good,"The job was alright. I enjoyed stocking shelves. I had a good boss and I liked most of my coworkers. I didn't get enough hours though, and I really hated when the trucks came but overall it was a decent job."
good,"This is a really good company to work for. The pay is excellent as well as healthcare benefits. I would love to work for them again at some point. Oh, and the HR staff and management is awesome too."
good,we would put parts on racks and unload racks for the next shipment. we would inspect the parts for any damage with the coating before sending the shipments out
good,"I truly enjoy working with the employees at Dollar General. Everyone is easy to get along with and always has a smile on their face, it's contagious! We have all formed a special relationship among each other and also with our regular customers. Time almost never drags at DG. The managers typically have a specific duty for you to work on while your there, so theres always something to do (no standing around!)."
good,As I was only with Dollar General for a month I did not experience much. I enjoyed the workers I was able to work with which was only one other person. I was the only cashier on the clock besides the key holder and she only ran a register when we got too busy. Calling in due to any reason was near to impossible because the worker is required to call another employee to cover their shift and if they refused than you had no other choice but to come in or be fired.
good,This job has a laid back and easy work environment. The work schedule was flexible and there was little to no stress. The environment was very quiet and enjoyable to some aspects.
good,"A typical day at the dollar general would be greet customers, process transactions, provide customer service, replenish merchandise and keep your work area neat."
good,The environment is very alive and fun to be around but the wage of pay and hours aren't very good. The minimum wage isn't to decent but  was hoping that the hours would replace the pay. On average as a weekly pay period i make roughly 130-140.
good,"I worked for them 2 years as a customer service representative the promoted to 2 key manager.  Open & closed store, paper work, cashier,  sales, stock."
good,"Work hard, team work, long hours. If you work hard and do this job you are there to do you will do, the management team will thank you. You must have good attendance, not be tardy and be a overall good employee."
good,Good work environment but I don't get any hours. The management is not as bad. I get along with the co-workers. I enjoy getting along with customer and helping them out.
good,I liked the job my co-workers were enjoyable to hang around and work with we got our jobs done productively and accordingly. The customers were great.
good,Challenge but fair company. Company growing at a fast pace offering more jobs in the community. Good company when it comes to helping the less fortunate
good,I love my manager they're very close to my house overall I believe that we needed security there because it was such a bad neighborhood
good,"High turnover among employees, low pay, few hours.  The store manager was nice.  The store is not very clean.  The availability of merchandise was good.  The location of the store is in a high crime area.  The employees are this location are very displeased with the lack of hours and low pay.  Most of the customers are very nice and understanding."
good,The people are rude. the boss tries to act like he cases but he really doesn't. I'm not saying all them are the same but my store was horrible. You wouldn't want to work here.
good,"Dollar General was my first cashier experience, where I learned a lot about different currency and how to take payments. It taught me a lot and is a very fun place."
good,I love working with people. It is very easy to stay busy. The company cares about their employees with benefits for full-time positions.. The company is growing so there are jobs available.
good,This job provided steady learning and gave your life fulfillment. I enjoyed meeting new people and helping them reach to better their lives.
good,I worked there for a brief period while attending technical school part time. The management valued me as part of the team and it was a pleasant work environment.
good,"I really liked working there. I learned a good bit there. I did a lot of the same things everyday. I loved running the register, but I hated some of the management."
good,"fast past job, always something to be done, customer service comes first and must be dependable and multitask is required. as management you are required to be able to work open availability"
good,"I enjoyed working here. The supervisor was nice, other employees were too. Consistent, fun work. Had plenty to do. Only problem was some of the customers who came in just wanted to be really rude no matter how nice you were to them. Then other customers were really nice and very respectful. I liked my job here. Only left because the money wasn't worth the far drive when my hours were cut."
good,Dollar General is a Good company that likes to promote from within. I enjoyed my time with the company on both occasions i worked for them. I would still consider employment with them again
good,I made decent money at Dollar General but the store I was sent to was horrible and I did not have corporate support to get it together.
good,Our customers are an extended part of our Dollar General  family. We love our customers almost as much as we do each other. We have formed a wonderful  working relationship in the short time we've been opened.
good,Its a good place to work at as a team I have learned alot of thing there but the hardest part is that when It gets to closing time
good,I learned how to run a register here for the first time & i watched several training videos to help gather an idea of what i would be learning on the job.
good,The DM and RM have no care for the people under them and only care about the numbers on the reports. This leads to very low morale and eventually low productivity because of the lack of appreciation.
good,"This job is a good starter job, but that is about it. You are required to do the following:  Stocking of shelves, which you are timed on how fast you can stock them from your U- cart. You are also required to do recovery at the end of the day. Meaning, you will have to take misplaced items and put them back in the proper place, you will also have to take inventory of any stolen items. You are required to run the cash register, and if you have 3 or more people in line, then you call management up to help you, besides that You are the one that mainly mans the register.  The benefits are not worth much, and unless you are super precise you will not have any advancement within the company."
good,"Productive, fast pace, peaceful working environment. The customers can sometimes be rude. The management is not all that bad but very unorganized. Fellow coworkers were welcoming."
good,As lower level management I have a tendancy to ask for more responsibility to prove my worth. These managers took advantage. Felt like I was put in charge of something and I made a schedule to fallow and no one did it. We all got along but when I had family things it was super hard to request off. I only called in 3 times the year I was there.
good,This job could have been a lot better if they do away with the production system.  It is very repetitive to the point of boredom.  A few of the supervisors are real pains in the neck.
good,it was alright to work for. the boss made me feel stupid if i asked a question. i was only part time. i hardly got hours. not customer friendly employees
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my job until last year there.Mgmt did not know their position therefore had to cover work load and mine.I enjoyed hours and were exceptional otherwise I would not have stayed as long.
good,"Although management tries their best to work with you in order to get your hours, there's just zero room to grow with this company. There are hardly any promotions and with such a low budget there are little to no hours to be worked! Which is ridiculous considering the amount of work expected to be done."
good,"Good place to work. For a part time position it wasn't to bad. Helping customers find what there looking for, threw the knowledge of stocking shelves was great."
good,Enjoyed great employees that worked under me and following through with anything that i asked of them. There really isn't a hard part of my job that i cannot handle anymore after working in this type of retail environment after three going on four years now.
good,"I work in a small town, so I accept that the pay isn't the greatest.  But the last Vice President cut employee hours back so far that the job has increased in stress by 100%.  The turnover rate is very high, and the few people who don't quit are treated like workhorses and called in even on their days off.  I rarely see my kids anymore during the week, and have been left to work more than 16 hour days sometimes, because there are no other people who can come in to work."
good,"Counting money,customer service,stocking,inventory, hardest part of my job is inventory. What enjoy the must working with people."
good,Management wasnt too bad but they couldve been more responsible. I didnt feel like I got paid enough to deal with the customers.
good,The work was easy enough and the work environment was very friendly but the Human Resources Department needs an improvement first a good contact number that they actually will respond to and to get organized.
good,"I'd loved being around my co-workers and managers. The job wasn't hard to me, because I love helping my customers everyday. Just being at Dollar General has taught me so much. I've learned how to deal with customers on a professional relationship. I was trained on how to do refunds, returns, exchanges, and how to apologize to a customer when I made a mistake."
good,"Our equipment, including our shopping carts, was allowed to break down, to the point that customers would point it out. Attempts to notify management were repeatedly rebuffed.   My manager was very rarely present, and was extremely unpleasant without provocation. Several of my coworkers and I were called in on scheduled days off, and I quit after he demanded I come in to work during my niece's funeral."
good,Good company better than family Dollar. Has a since of diraction on which way the company is going. Does not pay the same. But company has plenty of opportunity
good,"It was okay. The shifts were long, customers rude, and the coworkers crazy. But it paid the bills and helped prepare me for my future in ways. I only worked there for two months."
good,They were OK to work for.I do suggest that they do more to make their employees feel that they are apart of the picture there is little room for growth from within
good,"Running a low budget operation is always tough. Its a typical small-box retailer environment where you always have something to do. When someone calls out, unless you can find someone to come in you are stuck working a double shift. They have decent benefits such as the 401k and life insurance policies. Upper level Management is always changing which means each time someone new comes in they like to focus on different types of improvements they want to make. Its a good resume builder and stepping stone until you really find a job you want."
good,"Dollar General is a decent company, however they could take a more active role in their stores to ensure they are being run properly. Also, improvements need to be made in how the store handles trucks and the size of their stock rooms."
good,"the employees I worked with were easy to be around, we were all friends."
good,Nice store to work at. Iv gotten offered plenty of different opportunities to handle different positions & did them very well. I loved to do the invitory trucks.
good,Its a job. Some management dont care about it workers. short hours and over pack store with items to clutter it. they talk about you to other store management.
good,"Overall this is an OK job if your looking to work  a part-time position. The management is not stern, so co-workers are slack. Hardest part of working here was getting jobs done on time."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working here, they pay managers well but you work for that pay, employee retention is hard because the associates basically miss work when they want to."
good,Unloading.trucks.stocking.shelves.helping.manager.set.up.displays.for.different.seasons.helping.customers.locate.differerent.items.on.sale.
good,It was a retail position.  You had to stock the store and make sure that it was clean and neat looking.  You also had to redo the plannograms.  My store manager was great but others are not as good.
good,"Working at Dollar General was an interesting experience, it is not for someone looking to make a lot of money or raise a family, but for someone looking to work a few extra hours part time."
good,"Enjoyed meeting new people, however some of the management in the Uvalda store need to go back to school and find out how to treat your workers.  Terrible, and very much prejudice against white people, sad to say but even the customers noticed it so it wasnt just me or the other white person working there.  Dont expect to get more then 15 hrs either, if you are not a key holder or the store manager you are out of luck on the hours you are just a standby!"
good,This was my first job. Very willing to train. Sometimes a chaotic volume of customers but overall a great place to work. Lots of room to grow and move up in the ranks.
good,"will I come in to work then I clock in for work get my till ready and after I am done put my till way in the register and I talk to store manager or  assistant manager  who every there in morring see task want me to do and get them done or it depends how busy it is there at the store."
good,"Its not a place that I would want to work as a career job. Strickly part time that is all. Co-worker are very nice, and management had no idea what they were doing."
good,"Bad management, and received very little training. Unclear instructions from the manager. Obstructed walk ways upon clocking in that was caused by management."
good,Its a OK job really a second type of job only part time. Starts off at minimum wage. Got to be able to do more then one thing at a time. Must be able to take criticism.
good,"Everyday gets more frustrating, Co workers would not complete their Job and other individuals would have to fix the co workers mess on top of what you are supposed to do."
good,It can be very Slow at times. Very laid back but hard working. All about customer service and keeping store clean and organized.
good,"i would count the cashiers drawers after shift ended and set up the bank deposits for the next day. i only left because of the manager of the place, we had some differences we couldnt fix."
good,"The air condition was always out. This was a problem for everyone but especially people like myself with asthma and nose bleeds in hot weather. the management called me in almost every one of my off days in my short period of working there. There was little consideration for workers personal life, as long as someone jumped to the needs of the store."
good,"Great job for those just beginning in the work force, helps teach structure and work skills."
good,My typical day at work started by me clocking in for my shift. On my job I learned about team work and how to work well wit customer. The management worked well with everyone and I enjoyed my co-worker.
good,"Any local work is great, and the people are exceptional.  My boss is the best boss I have had the pleasure of working for.  Corporate is another story."
good,This was my very first job and I ended up staying there fro almost three years. Management could've been better but overall it was a great started job for a college student.
good,Pretty good company ok pay and good benefits ok people to work with mangment was ok.had to move so that why I no longer work there
good,There were some supervisors who were good to work with. Other supervisors needed to learn social skills and manners. I would work there again as I am sure the bad supervisors have been replaced by decent supervisors by now.
good,"Assist customers, take payments, clean front end, stock and recover. The job wasn't hard at all. I loved working with the customers."
good,"Is a decent starter day to day job, but really lacks what you might be expecting, a lot of non sense truck orders and very unnecessary judgement for what is used and what is town out."
good,"Opening and closing store; preparing deposits, balancing tills, balancing safe, stocking, recovering store, working plan o grams, resetting sections, price changes, displaying prices for sales ad, general cleaning, backup cashier, customer returns, customer service,   The  hardest part of the job was lack of communication between coworkers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking, recovering store and assisting customeers."
good,"a normal day at work would see me restocking and readjusting shelves, pushing carts inside, taking care of customer needs, and working the register."
good,A typical day at Dollar General would be coming in at eight in the morning and counting my drawer before I put it in the register. Once I was in the register I would then proceed to either wait on customers or put up stock while waiting for customers to come up. Then once my shift was over the next employee would come in and start where I left off. Management was not the best because they would just sit in the office and play games on their phones. But my co-workers were amazing and hardworking no matter how bad the managers were. I would say the hardest part of the job was working in such a small store that is was suffocating and dealing with a very rude community. But I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was getting through truck and not feeling like we would never get done until the next truck arrived.
good,"I did recovery, I worked cashier and kept my customers happy and satisfied, while doing that I would have to maintain a steady pace putting up truck so I could get it done by a certain amount of time. I would have to sweep and mop on week days."
good,I liked working for Dollar General it was close to my home. I loved most of the people I worked with. I loved my customers. The job was  mostly simple.
good,I like working there however I was looking for a position that allowed me to have more hours also where I could help people take care of themselves
good,"Greeting customers, helping them find products and promote products as well. scanning what the customer would like to purchase and giving back the right amount of change. Providing great customer service so they not only come back but refer others."
good,Working with the public was the job to do.  Taking the challenge of closing the store was interesting.  Cleaning the store and stocking was always fun cause you get to meet and know the customers.
good,"most days are busy.  learned great customer service.  friendly environment.  truck days were hardest, unloading full trucks and stocking shelves."
good,I would stock shelves while helping customers and ring people out on the register. Threw out the day i tidied up and cleaned the store also.
good,"They expected more of me despite the amount of hours I was working, which was 80+ per week. Great environment but lack of professionalism."
good,"Overworked, underpaid, lied to and promised this and that. Company does not appreciate their employees....no advancement no raises...etc. Lie after lie...sounds good until u see all the things that goes on behind the scene"
good,Ok company to work for same as a lot of other companies long hours shifts.You stock merchandise and you ring out customers.
good,"Count draw, while the manager told you want to do for the evening shift. Start scanning while you either had to stock or pull back stock or recovery the store. The hardest part was the manager didn't like to work with school schedule. The most enjoyable part was regular customers."
good,the work was more physical then anticipated and the pay was okay but felt with all requirements pay should of been more. The people were friendly and management was great. It was just not a job for me.
good,Im am still with the company but only work weekend morning store got robbed and i need to further my growth. What i learned as a cashier is commutating better with people face to face.
good,"I was a key holder. Duties included register, stocking, merchandizing, recovering/facing, and customer service. I also counted the end of the night deposite and closed the store. "
good,Dollar General is a fast growing company and always in need of new employees. New stores are popping up everywhere. Management was very friendly and always willing to work with school schedules.
good,Dollar General is one of the places where if you're trying to make a career in retail sales at a smaller level than say Walmart or Target then it would be right for you.  The hours are usually less than 40 a week starting out but the more valuable you are to the store and the more your name gets around between managers you can quickly fill those extra hours in by working off days at other locations or on special projects in other areas. A typical day at work consisted of pulling merchandise out onto the store floor to be placed on shelves for sale.  After you would complete one pallet of merchandise you would retrieve another and continue until all merchandise that arrived recently is on the floor for sale.  If you are working the cash register on any given day you would have plenty of customers to deal with so being able to communicate effectively is a must.  Overall my managers were pleasant to be around and never made my days harder than they needed to be.  The co-workers were generally the same.  The hardest part of the job was the early hours for me.  I was usually in the store two or three hours before we opened.  So don't look forward to sleeping in any given day as your hours are flexible as well.  The most enjoyable part of the job was all the people I met and got to know.  You'd be surprised what you can learn from someone just by showing them where the orange juice is.
good,"My duties detailed customer service in witch is one of my strong points also completing daily assignments as far as handling cash assignments(deposit slips,change fund,Cash registers)opening duties as well as closing duties"
good,I enjoy my job and wouldn't consider leaving it except for the fact that I need more hours. Our hours have been cut quite a bit and honestly I just need more that what I'm getting and it doesn't appear as if that will change anytime in the near future.
good,"On a typical day at work I would try to go out of my way to assist each customers by making sure if they found what they came for. If not I would go out of my way to see, to locate the item for them. If I'm unable to locate the item due to being out of stock. I would take their contact information or I would share with them what days we get our trucks in to have them call in to make sure we have that item in before making the trip in. What I have learned is that you need be productive when working, and make sure customers that come and go are happy because they are whom you see each day. You want those customers to come back. What I have learned in Management is you have to build a relationship with the employees, so you that you and the employees can work as a team. "
good,"Dollar General is a place for great customer service; the employees are very helpful and stay productive throughout the work day. I did lean more organization skills, and working with people, as well as generating great customer service. There did come hardships with working at Dollar General as a sales associate because multi-tasking with customers as well as shipment of products became tough, but I learned how to manage both equally. I did enjoy conversing with customers and assisting them with product questions."
good,This job would be great job but the management really isnt where it should be. There is to much person and unprofessional mangament tactics being used at this job.
good,"It was a nice place to work but, not a career field for me. Employees were nice along with the manager. I was a typical sales associate and restocked shelves."
good,I resigned from this company because the management and district manager were not honest people and corporate would not listen.  Instead they found ways to fire emploees.
good,"The management was the problem, scheduling was off and they needed more staff. They fired the manager now the store is better."
good,Stocking is easy and fun. You learn quickly where things are and how to read the labels to know where items belong. You get to meet new people and help them find things that they are looking for.
good,It was a good first job to have as a student. I developed excellent skills such as customer service and cash handling. Work days are busy. Co-workers are helpful. Hardest part is handling difficult customers. Most enjoyable part was delivering excellent customer service and keeping the customer happy.
good,"Dollar General is a fun and enjoyable place to work."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General would consist of assisting customers, ordering supplies, replenishing inventory, and managing sales associates. I learned who manage a group, work as a team, and how to be a effective leader. Management was very fair and hard working, they set the tone of the store. Meet some great friends that started off as co-workers. The hardest part of the job was having to always be available. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people daliy."
good,"Okay place to work at if the staff is up to par, you learn a lot the longer you work there. The management is okay, rather work with a team who's older and much more experienced. Hardest part of the job is staying on your feet for long hours throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team who's enthusiastic and fun. Makes the day go by faster."
good,"Set up tills for checkout clerks. Prepare deposit from day before and take to bank. Set up displays according to blueprints , put up new stock, set sale items. Never the same daily thing. Hardest part is when we had to unload trucks, but seeing all new merchandice for the first time was fun."
good,"A typical day was running the cash register, restocking that which was the on duty cashier's responsibility, cleaning and mopping the front area of the store and bathrooms and weekly mopping the whole store. When I first started the management was fine. We had to hire a new manager and the assistant manager was in charge and she was great, real nice and approachable. Then then new manager came and it was a turn around. I did not like her. She came off as my way or the highway and I would prefer to talk to the assistant manager if I needed something because she was more approachable. My co-workers were okay for the most part. There was a couple I didn't care about but they were the super serious and not talkative type while the ones I liked talked and made the work not seem as repetitive because it took your mind off the work just enough so it felt like time went by faster. The hardest part of the job was the nightly cleaning duties especially when we had to mop the entire store and it would sometimes be after 11:00 P.M before I got home. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably my co-workers who would talk. They made it feel like time was just flying by."
good,"Load boxed items on floor , find correct location stock on shelves ,read labels , back up cashier"
good,Managers sucked. They were always short handed. No consideration of employees at all. Not enough hours at that time..And the store was always cluttered.
good,"I was a manager at Dollar General for almost a year and I loved it!!"
good,"Most days were calm and went by quickly, other days there would be some tough customers but we were able to work with them to make there shopping experience more pleasant. the managers where very easy to get along with."
good,"It was a typical day at work. I learned how to quickly unload freight. The management was changing because they did not have a set manager of the store. The hardest part about working there was wanting to go to work everyday. The reason that is, is because most of the employees had a lot of drama. The most enjoyable part about working here was certain people i worked with."
good,"Dollar General was a fast paced retail environment that offered many challenges on a daily basis. Challenges included everything from helping customers, floor set design and driving sales. Overcoming these challenges is what made it all worth while. It taught me about myself and gave me the ability to manage others."
good,"It was pretty hard. had to multi task. Help the customers, do cashier, and stock the shelves. All at the same time. Sometimes before leaving my shift had to make sure the whole cart was emptied before leaving."
good,"I spent a total of five years with Dollar General, Inc. A year and half of which was spent in a management position. Overall, it was a good job. As with any job, my time spent with the company had its ups and downs. However, overall the company provided me with valuable work experience and skills."
good,I loved helping my customers. I didn't like the management staff though. My co workers were amazing. Always working hard but DG wants you to work like a slave for a little bit of money. And they barely want to give you house.
good,"Dollar General is a decent company to work for. I have learned some valuable skills, and made some good friends. I have done so many different types of jobs for Dollar General I do not find any of it difficult anymore I love what I do!!"
good,A day at dollar general was ok as long as you did your job and stayed out of the managers way. The employees were nice to work with.
good,motivated sales associate independent worker with high energy and good communication skills.  Reliable and friendly professional able to work with little oversight and collaborate in team environments
good,"I worked at the register, stocked, and cleaned the store. the hardest part of the job is timing yourself to stock and clean up before the end of the shift"
good,interacting with customers is the best part about this job. Sometimes it can be very busy and fast paced and a lot of the time multi-tasking is required.
good,You cant receive more than 40 hours a week it is against policy. Breaks aren't properly given to managers due to lack of staff. I am alone in the store alone sometimes its a high theft store and ours area Dollar generals are often robbed 3 stores last week were robbed and that week i was left alone 3 different times (which is totally against policy) for hours at a time. I am currently leaving due to my safety being in jeopardy.
good,"The Co-workers are fun and working there gave me experience in dealing with cash register. However, if you are in college, they will not work with your school hours very well."
good,Cleaning up and stocking from the back. unloading the boxes it and straight it out on the shelf. Mopping the floor. Work for part time.
good,Great place to work. Fun and helpful co-workers. Layoffs during the winter months caused issues. Good length lunch breaks. Very good training.
good,"made sure store was opmned on time, made sure all money and employess were accounted for during shifts, stocking and cleanign through out the day"
good,"Dollar General is a very fast paced work environment that can be extremely stressful. It has also taught me a lot and has made a difference in how I view my workplace. Dollar General has given me the opportunity to grow within my career in retail, very quickly. I have learned many things while working with the company, such as: how to handle certain situations, better management skills, and job experience. My co-workers and I work together to make Dollar General a very customer friendly environment. The hardest part of my job with Dollar General is never seeming to have enough time to get things done. Between people calling in, quitting, hiring and training new associates, helping customers, doing resets on core aisles and endcaps, office paperwork, it can be a lot for one person to handle all at one time. The most enjoyable part of my job with Dollar General however, would be that I make an impact each and every shift I work when I walk through the door. Whether it be helping customers, training new associates, or simply achieving an assigned task, I always seem to find myself smiling at the end of the day, knowing I have somehow made a difference, no matter how big or how small."
good,"You will learn a lot by working at DG, but the pay is horrible for the amount of work they require employees to do. Overall, its a great place to gain a lot of retail work experience."
good,Honestly it was a decent job with decent pay but not a job you could make a living off of and afford necessary things along with other expenses. The hours were enough most times and the job can be a bit strenuous but what retail store isn't?
good,"putting stock out,assisting the customer,and ran the cash regisrer. sweeping/moping floor,restrooms. unloding the trucks"
good,We had many changes in  management in the years that I was employed with this company. It seemed as if we were a practice store. I feel that has a lot to do with the decline in the quality of the store's productivity and cleanliness...
good,dollar general is located in a very high theft location. police comes their all the time. short staffed machines is all way broke
good,"This company, or atleast this particular building was awful. They had purchased a new building but then decided not to just because they wanted to save money"
good,It was a nice place to work. Your coworkers tend to be nice and talkative group. They were always willing to work with you. If you need some time off they are more than willing to work with you on the time you need off. They do have benefits. You can learn online what you need to do to work there. You are to stock the shelves and watch the cash register at the same time. If you close you are to sweep and mop the floor. Pull in all the sidewalk sales items that you have to put out in the morning.
good,I learned so much working there how to deal with customers who are happy and not so happy I improved on my typing skills I could multi tasks do several jobs at once I was always there on time
good,"I like the store I work in. Being from the city, I know many of the customers. My co-workers are as different as they are fun and hard working. I open and close the store. Balancing the cashier's drawers and the safe fund, making deposits and doing reports is also a part of my responsibilities. "
good,"A typical day on  the job consists of co-workers working together as a team to get everything done, that needs to be done. Something I have learned from this job is that co-workers can be two-faced and managers do choose favorites, although they're not supposed to. The hardest part of my job is satisfying my manager, my manager is one of those managers that choose favorites and I personally am not   one of those favorites. My manager has cut my hours down to nothing because she doesn't have hours for me, but she will bring in others from other stores in our district. My job is hard to please, although I do the absolute best I can do to overcome my responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers to get freight done when it is supposed to be done, and accomplishing it together."
good,"I loved my job. It was a very stressful job with little pay, but i love all my customers which is why i think i stayed as long as i did."
good,"DG are small stores, with a handle full of employees.  Typical day was stocking, facing, assisting customers, cleaning and merchandising.  I was hard work, but I enjoyed it."
good,the work was very fast paced and fulfilling. i liked all the people that worked on my line and they were very friendly and helpful to me. the management were also very good at what they did
good,"A typical day at work consisted of 1 opening employee followed by 3-4 hours of having no backup to run the register so the shift manager can conduct other business. There were long gaps of time where only 1 person would be in at any given time, which upset customers and really harmed the work flow. The turnover rate was quite high as they primarily hired part timers with low availabilities and expected them to work more hours and they ultimately left or were terminated. The hardest part of the job is getting up to 20 rolltainers (cages of product) on the floor within 2 stocking days(see above about short staffing). The most enjoyable part of the job was to see happy customers leave the store after they purchased their goods."
good,Great Place to work for a starter Job. Customers were phenomenal. Learned a lot of management skills. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with all the work when part of your management team did not partake.
good,"I help the manager with the store, opening and closing, stocking, assist customer with their purchases.  Count cashiers register at end of their shifts,  prepare deposit at the end of the night.  I worked on the cashier register when the cashier need assistants"
good,I like the physical work I get to do at this part time evening job.  It's nice to supplement my income.  They work around the schedule and needs of my primary work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting out from in front of my daily computer work.
good,"Store was not always super clean, the customers weren't always the best, but the team was fun and we got the job done. The job was fairly easy."
good,"dollar general is a sloppy but convenient place to get product and find most of what you need, co workers were fair. Not to bad of a workplace."
good,The management was not good. I worked the cash register. I have learned to seek better jobs with better management. My co workers were pretty cool and had good work ethic.
good,"If you are looking for an opportunity to quickly move into management and don't have a college education, this may be the place for you."
good,"A typical work day included doing checkouts and stocking shelves. I didn't work there long, but I did enjoy having the job. I learned how to operate a cash register and how to stock shelves. My manager was nice and taught me a lot of things. My co-workers were also very nice and helpful to me. The hardest part of the job was dealing with nasty customers and still keeping a smile on. The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking with friendly customers and putting a smile on someones face."
good,I would recommend anyone to try to get a job at Dollar General because it is a good place to work and get to know people that is in your surroundings.
good,"This job provided me with more experience into retail as well as customer service on a daily basis.  Busy, and intresting."
good,Customers were always friendly and seemed to enjoy their experience at the store. Store was always clean and clutter-free which customers enjoyed.
good,Working at Dollar General you learn a lot of new things. The hardest part about working at this place or any place is learn how to get along with any body. The most enjoyable thing about working at Dollar General is that you were inside out of the weather.
good,Dollar General was a good place. i worked there because I just wanted to work somewhere after being unemployed for four years. The job was pretty basic. I performed the same regular operations that any cashier at a retail store would.
good,my typical day included in helping customers get what they were looking for and tending to the store's need's. the management was very well maintained. the hardest part of the job for me at the time was stocking the shelf's and making sure all customers were satisfied
good,great store to work at nice and easy pace meet new faces and learn how to work at retail stores is very important always willing to help new ones and train them
good,making sure store was clean and helping customers.managed a store temporily was not for me.hardest part was unloading truck.Got along well with coworkers
good,"oversaw2-4 employees ,open and closed store assisted cashiers with issues and counted down drawer.Also did set up and display."
good,a typical day was ringing customers up and being a stock person. my co-workers were very friendly and the hardest part of the job was trying to stock the entire store from shipment in just 4 hours
good,"its a minimal effort job for minimum wage. makes sense for high school students just trying to pay for gas, booze, and cigarettes. wasn't hard at all"
good,"Enjoyable fast-paced work environment, great diversity on the job. Great experience with retail work. Good pay, decent benefits, good job advancement."
good,Dollar General Distribution is a very good place to work at. They are very good to the Employess. They do things for the Employess like give them awards for safety.
good,"A typical day at work included stocking, facing, cashiering, relieving employees for their breaks, counting down drawers, opening and closing store, unloading freight from stock room, cleaning, theft prevention. The hardest part of the job was not enough time to get everything completed. Co-workers were fine, some had attitude and laziness."
good,"Waiting on customers, stocking and managing the store."
good,Was a good place to work and was close to where I was living at and I liked working there do to the customers that would come there
good,I really enjoyed working for Dollar General. I had a great Manager and Supervisor. I had fun with all my coworkers. My main interest was giving great customer service.
good,"We pushed toward our daily goals and reassessed regularly to improve on safety, quality, inventory and productivity."
good,"	Assisting Customers"
good,"Honed my skill at providing excellent customer service."
good,I had a good management team which made the job easy. I was only a part-time cashier but you still have a lot of duties when in that position.
good,i did not like the hours or the people that worked there they were not very nice and they did not believe in helping you when there was a lot to do and not enough man power it was a lot of rules and the magers were very rude
good,The over all experience working for this company was a high skill set in order to keep up with the forever improving aspects of the departments and also the informative customers that we assisted inn their purchases. Other responsibilities for this position consisted of inventory and sales.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of ringing up customers, handling cash and credit cards/ debit cards. I learned about people skills."
good,i worked at a extremely fast paced store where we were constantly moving inventory in and out of store. We had alot of different vendors and where i had to check in different products keeping and maintaining records of those deliveries
good,The work was not hard work but the pay was very lacking for a manager or a key holder barely above minimum wage. If your more about the work than the pay good place to be.
good,I would manage and deal with the customers. We had to unload trucks and services others. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. I always manged to handle it very well though.
good,Working at Dollar General is fun and enjoyable. I enjoy interacting with the many different people who come in. My work piers and managers are great to work with.
good,"a typical day was making sure that you had all the stock and working with vendors on a daily."
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, I like it but the management was terrible the hygiene of the store was poor there were no benefits for sales associates the hours weren't all too great I would have been lucky to get 15 hours a week."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed the management and coworkers I interacted with and the customers that came in their on a daily basis. Their willingness to work with an employee was phenomenal.
good,"Normally a slow day unless we had more kids than usual. The only usually only lasted a few hours, but the coworkers were very helpful and friendly."
good,This establishment has its ups and downs. The managers would basically guilt you into taking extra hours when didn't have to.
good,Good place to work part time. It was in a great location for me that is the reason I took the job because it was close to home.
good,I liked working for this employer but I didn't like the management team. The ran the store all the way backwards. They was really unorganized and hardly knew what was going on. If I had another chance to work there i wouldn't but I would loving working for another store with that company just not that store.
good,"They ask way too much out of you, for what they pay at minimum wage. Even after I was promoted to a shift leader, they cut my hours down to 5 hours a week after I had a family member pass away and had to stay out of work for a few days to get that sorted out. I do not recommend working here unless you have strong patience and are willing to let these people walk all over you. Even the customers hated coming into our store, but for lack of better shopping, they had to."
good,Dollar General gave me the experience I needed to get started.  Good overall starter job.  You know when you are working all the time but your job position is whatever is required of you.  Nothing is the same each day.
good,"a nice place to work. Always stayed fairly busy. the costumers were pretty nice. Manangment was great, she showed us she was willing to work harder than us."
good,I worked as a pharmacy technician. I did a lot of data entry. The company is a specialty pharmacy and I like what the company stands for
good,"Ran daily report and put notations in daily report ledger, follow hold time for standards of Dollar General brands. Assist my friendly guest."
good,you deal with people you may not like but the paying job is good. I had an wonderful time working for dollar general. but the managers were very flexiable to ur days and hours
good,what I liked about the job is the environment and the new opportunities. I enjoyed working with customers and meeting new people.
good,"cashier, stocker, great costumers came in, loved my managers,"
good,"Fun environment  helping people find bargains.  If you don't mind working hard, you should try working at Dollar General."
good,its a great place to work. but manager wasnt fair on hours. i learn out of this job was to balance out cash from register and got better customer serivice
good,I enjoyed working for this company.  It was a lot of work but not very hard.  The biggest downfall of this company was having to unload the receiving trucks by hand and not having a better organization of inventory.
good,A typical day involved hard work quickness and patience. I learned how to interact with customers and vendors. My co-workers were very kind people and fun to work with.
good,Responsible for opening and closing of stores. Planogram functionality was a must. All tasks were strictly time-bound. Learned how to navigate store financials with more thoroughness. It was a very direct-tell company with little room for suggestion.
good,I enjoy making customers happy in my everyday work environment. All it takes is a smiling face to make someone's day that much better
good,"I had to clean, organized everything in the store by color, size, brand, help customers. Counted registers, made deposits, voids, counted safe, and change fund."
good,One could never get ahead with this company. Constantly changing ideas week after week.Keep a staff could be very hard unless the Store Manger had a good relationship with his employees.
good,The most enjoyable part of my experience with Dollar General was the inter action with differ staff and customers. Training of managers should be more organized to minimize turn over potential.
good,"Working at Dollar General requires a large set of skills, luckily they're willing to train people with no experience. You can move up fairly quickly there. Unfortunately there's a rather high turnover rate, and if you stick around long enough you'll find that you're working with a whole new set of people than you started with."
good,would recommend to work there had a lot of work to do kept me busy the hours were not what I expected would have like to have more 25 hours a week not enough
good,While working at this company its was very high volume and productive. I enjoyed every moment of the job. People at this company is very helpful and outgoing.
good,friendly environment and somewhat clean and organized. If I had to work there again I would . This place is very employee friendly.
good,"Kept this job through school so I could have extra money."
good,"Had fun working here, started off has a cashier working part time, because going to school full-time, then I started picking up more hours plus going to school. Then started training as a Key Carrier (Asst. Manager), then transferred to a different store, due to dropping out of school to train as an Asst. Manager, then moved to Texas to be an Asst. Manager."
good,A typical day at work is all about hard work and getting the product out to the customers and making sure the customers find the product that they are shopping for. I have to make sure that the cashier that I have on duty knows and understand the task for each day. Our general manager is really good at what he does helps us to get everything we need to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of my job is the job itself. I like to keep active on the job. This job keeps me moving at all times.
good,very shady every one want to get ahead and blame you for there mistakes. bosses are rude and the slack there off so we have no time too do the job you are hired for.
good,Great location to work in and customers are always greeted and helped. Hard-working employees do their best to make sure customers get what they need.
good,"It was a simple job, not something long term.  It was very flexible when it came to scheduling. The people were friendly and the customers really don't give you a hard time."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General would start at six in the morning most days and I would have an evening shift or two.  A typical day would be a bank run, helping customers, and overall just running the business.  I have learned a lot; including leadership skills, balancing life and work, and so much more.  The biggest set of skills that I learned was just overall my own personal growth and skills and what I could accomplish and how far I could push my own limits!  Management... I deal directly with the district manager.  Due to being a manager, I only need to see the district manager once or twice a month, but I report anything I need to, to her, and vise versa.  My co-workers are like family!  They treat me well and I treat them well and return!  My staff is full of caring, loving, and overall hardworking people and I could not ask for a stronger staff!  The hardest part of my job would be balancing life and work. Due to the lack of hours that the company allots me, my typical work week is sixty plus hours to stay around or on budget.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that my staff loves working for me, the customers love visiting the store, and overall it is just a great environment to work in."
good,comfortable job for me. Enjoyed the retail environment. Closed Christmas. Steady work. employees were mostly dependable.
good,Everyday was a busy day. The co-workers were all very nice. The hardest part of the day was when the lines were long and I was the only one working. I enjoyed what I did there
good,"Working for Dollar General was a pleasant experience due to its constant interaction with customers. Unfortunately, I did not find the company's ethical and productivity standards to meet my expectations."
good,This is a good part time job. The work is not hard and you can meet different people. It can be fun at times and gives flexible hours.
good,Dollar General was an amazingly terrible experience for myself but was much needed. This job had very little benefits for its employees and showed lack of care for the store that i was located in. Other than that the personalities of most of the employees and managment were nice.
good,"Overall work experience was good. My only disheartening complaint would be that our store was a target for armed robberies. As a cashier, I enjoyed the customers and learned great patience. I enjoyed stocking and learned the store's products through stocking. My co-workers were friendly and pleasant and the store manager was exceptional and encouraging."
good,"A very hard place to work at,it is a very streeful job.I had a great team.I loved my customers.I loved being able to help so many people."
good,Over all I enjoyed working for dollar general. it was fast passed and I loved working with the public. was fun and exciting at times and boring at times
good,"Dollar General was a fairly decent place to work. I loved being around the customers, especially the regulars. I learned many different skills and how to handle different situations. The only thing that bothered me was the current management and how much drama there was between the manager and some of the sales associates and other managers."
good,"too much drama in the store"
good,"only worked here for a short time due to pregnancy leave overall a good mangement with awesome coworkers as well, very easy pace job"
good,"Starting day off with a smile and positive attitude. Be ready to deal with any type of customer. Always think of your coworkers as a teammate, you're all in it together"
good,"There is not enough help during the evenings, only one cashier and one lead associate and sometime the store is backed up."
good,"The hours were extremely lacking, the environment was filthy, and co-workers were lazy. I found myself constantly trying to clean the place while others would laze about or chat with the customers."
good,I was a ast. Mgr I liked working with the public had good hours. I did ordering cleaning stocking cash handling and management duties. had a great staff.
good,The people that I work with are great. They are friendly and funny. The hardest part about the job is putting out freight because the planagrams in the store change on a daily basis so nothing s ever the same. I would have to say the best thing about the job is the customers meeting new people.
good,Liked working with grea fun people. Liked being really close to home.Helping all the people that come in the store. the hardest part was how busy Thursday was when all the merchandise come in and having it done by Friday
good,"stocking, cashier, learning how the store works. & where different things go in the store. meeting different people. helping people find things in the store."
good,"I felt like i was doing everything there, the other co- workers would just sit in the lunch room talking while i was at the cash register with customers."
good,"A typical day would besee what needed to be stocked, returned or cleaned up, then count your drawer and load it. in between customers clean up the front area of the store. as the day ends, you need to clean the entire store. then you count your drawer and close the store."
good,"Help customers, assign task to Employees, set Displays to Plano-gram Bank Deposits, review security Video."
good,"Assist in setting and maintaining plan-o-grams and programs. Provide exemplary customer service. Perform other duties as necessary to maximize profitability, customer satisfaction, and teamwork, while protecting company assets and reducing losses.  Authorize and sign for refunds and overrides; count register; make bank deposits."
good,The hardest part of the job was leaveing when there is more work to be done..I enjoyed the start of my day going into work to please others day
good,"If you're looking for a job to support a family on, I wouldn't say I recommend it. The hours and pay don't level out for those put under a salaried wage."
good,"Work/Life balance is tough. Advancement opportunities are great however there is alot of turnover which makes you feel like your job is not that safe."
good,It was a friendly place to work.  Plenty of work to keep you busy.  Enjoyed my coworkers.  Couldn't work with me regarding my children.
good,"Constant hustle to get everything done in a day. Daily recovery, stocking, cleaning & customer service. No slacking allowed."
good,"Meeting a lot new people and providing customers with great service and product"
good,"The biggest thing that I have to say about working for Dollar General is it feels like the ones that are the head of the company, do not seem to really show that they appreciate the employees that run the day-to-day operations of the stores."
good,very nice environment to work in although it can be difficult at times. I enjoyed working with new people and getting to know them although it had its moments where I didn't feel comfortable.
good,basic job. minimum wage job with underpaid workers. stressful job with a heavy load on your plate. stores need to be bigger for work space
good,The management was great and I enjoyed the people I met.  The hardest part of the job was the turn over rate.   The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the people I met.
good,A typical day at work includes stocking and customer service. The environment is pretty random due to it being based on customers who show up to shop. I've learned how to manage and look at various aspects of the job in a more business centered state of mind. Management are very knowledgable and are willing to help. Co-workers are not as knowledgable and willing to help. Most Dollar General's are hurting for help and have to hire people who do not take pride in their job but are instead chasing a paycheck. This makes for a crew that lacks in drive and grade-a performance. The hardest part of the job would be the physicality of stocking heavy items and handling conflicts with customers. The easiest would be paperwork and dealing with the regular customers needs.
good,Not enough payroll to keep business running like it should. Needs better communication for the stores. Not enough communication between the district manager and store managers
good,Very fast pace employer with very little help as far as co-workers and crew members everyday. I always had fun while I was on the clock with the manager and the customers. I was able to talk to them and get to know them a little bit more then just a simple hi how are you. The hardest part of the job was working with literally just you and the manager that was it. no one else. I think ever store needs more then two people on the clock at all times. Unless you are just opening.
good,"A typical day includes working the register, customer service, stocking shelves, and custodial work.  The hardest part of the job was mopping the whole store night after night, especially during winter time with snow and mud.  The most enjoyable part of the job was multitasking and keeping busy all throughout the day."
good,On a daily basis i would assist customers with anything they needed and i would stock selves . I learned how to operate a cash register and keep track of inventory.
good,Spent most days handling the truck and the remodel of the store. I learned how to understand a planogram. The hardest part is reorganizing the store when it is not up to date. Most enjoyable is that you stayed busy in your job.
good,The district manager is very rude. The customers are great but no benefits for part-time employees. The job is not security for my family.
good,"I learned a lot while being at Dollar General. I worked in a very diverse setting, which was beneficial for my co-workers and I. I enjoyed being a helping hands to the customers when they needed assistance. The hardest part of the job was dealing with inconsiderate customers. I learned about a lot of seasonal charts, and ways to set up the merchandise based on the monthly planner. I learned how to be a patient and diligent individual despite how others reacted."
good,"Friendly environment, good location, taught me customer satisfaction, co-workers were helpful, hardest part was customers stealing, enjoyable part was the nice customers."
good,Hours change and never sure if you will get 20 hours or 40 that week or what shift you will be working. Management changes a lot so not sure week to week what to expect.
good,"You are the Operations Manager, Merchandising Manager, Head cashier, Warehouse manager, store replenishment lead. Your day starts early with unloading store truck, putting away. Then you have to open store, run store, do payroll. Manage daily inventory as well."
good,"This is the typical starting job, wages were not very high, and the work was physical at times. This is the job a teenager has during the summer. It would be difficult to sustain a complete family on the wages that are paid there. Enjoyable, because of the work with the public, but stressful at times because of the long to do list, yet, i would gladly go back."
good,"I worked scanning customer orders, bagging and handling money, be it cash, check or credit card for sale of merchandise. On down time which was rare, I would front store. After store closing I had to sweep store, empty trash, bring in walk merchandise and make store presentable for next day."
good,I enjoyed being able to move up in the company. being able to assist people that need help. over all the work environment you stayed busy
good,"Too much animosity among coworkers that made for a stressful work environment. I loved the interaction with customers and helping them with whatever they needed. The manager was fun, but oblivious to all the drama from the staff."
good,Days varied depending on what needed to be done and what day it was. You can move up fast in the job as long as you do your job and you do good.
good,"Working for Dollar General was very difficult, management has been very un-organize, but other then management customers were pleasant to work with and a fun work environment"
good,A typical day at Dollar General was very fast paced. My main goal was to please customers. Working almost every weekend wasn't so great.
good,A typical day a work was to keep people happy with there visit. I learned that I am happy helping people. I loved working with the other workers. I didn't fined that this job was very hard. I enjoyed getting to help many people.
good,This particular restraint needs work. the staff there are wonderful. it is mostly he management. there are some things the managers need to work on. such as work presentation and attitudes toward their staff.
good,"I enjoyed working with people, loved managing coworkers, however the way they throw people into a job position with really no training in full I believe is why my employment ended. I really liked the fast paced work, handling the freight everyday, constantly moving the store around ."
good,"Although my first manager here was a great person, some days were better than others. This store was extremely busy and some days I had to deal with a lot of rude customers!! Overall I really enjoyed working with my coworkers, my first manager, and the pleasant customers that I was able to come in contact with!!"
good,The high customer volume and demand made for a fast paced day. The company was especially geared to customer satisfaction.  The hardest part of the day was trying to stock out while the store was open to customers.   The most fulfilling day was to see a smile on a customers face the you assisted.
good,"I'll make this brief, very brief.  The store manager can make or break the work experience.  Since I know this is being shared, I will say no more than that.  As they say, ""discretion is the better part of valor""."
good,"Decent enough customers.  Ok management, even though I worked under 7 different Store Managers in my 4 years with the company.  I did get a better idea about things that I had not previously understood in other retail management position.  I learned more about shrink, plano's, vendors, etc.  At one point, after the initial manager that hired me quit unexpectedly,  I had to step up and ""play"" Store Manager and prepare for my first inventory.  Thankfully, the District Manager was most helpful in guiding me to what was expected by me and my team members.  And my team members were very hard working!  The only downfall with this company is that it does not give it's Store Managers enough payroll for its employees so that EVERYTHING can be done efficiently. As an Assistant Store Manager I was only getting part time hours, which led me to find other employment.  Otherwise, I most likely would have continued working there and continued working towards advancement."
good,"Regular week was 90+ hours...  Extremely minimal payroll left store manager alone in store for hours on end, stuck on the register instead of working freight or operational management.  Trucks once or twice a week brought 100+ cases to unload and stock with usually only one or two helpers, took two days to get through.  Inventory was scanned by hand once a week for stock counts to complete orders for inventory.  "
good,"Must be willing to multi-task, problem solve without store manager available.  Accurately cashier, stock, handle vendors.  Customer service resolution."
good,"Learned about using a scales to count money, how to do discounts, I also learned how to check in vendors when they were bringing in merchandise to stock the shelves with."
good,the day to day activities consist basically for good customer service and maintaining a great store quality. not a bad place to work over all
good,The new manager seems to be setting realistic goals daily for the employees to accomplish.  Manager is team oriented and has a positive attitude for the employees.  In the area of the store there is excessive shop lifting and we are continually having to watch for shop lifting.  Some of the co-workers are great to work with and some are not accomplishing their daily assignments.
good,"The job/life balance is hard to accomplish with the many things happening within the management responsibilities of the day.  The interaction with the customers is awesome especially when the items they are looking for is in the store. The co workers if trained correctly are nice to work with, especially when they come in and go right to what should be done without being told.  There is no typical day at Dollar General because there was always something to do from changing of sale prices to working a planogram...I actually working at Dollar General because of the interaction of the customers with workers and maintaining the different activities of the company."
good,"Some amounts of time can be very busy, and might slow down for a while. Even during slow-pace, there is always something to do. Involves co-workers to work well with each other and communicate well. Excellent customer service is a must, as well as great communication skills. Management is mostly caught up with tasks. Hardest part of the job is getting many tasks done. with short staff. Most enjoyable part is meeting new customers and building positive relationship with them."
good,"They are professional, clean, and productive. They are awesome. I would not mind working for them again. I worked with very energetic, happy, professional people also who were glad to help me do well."
good,"Dollar general is the perfect place for a teen or an adult looking to start fresh and is willing to work hard for their rewards. A typical day at work is coming into work and clocking in and cracking a few jokes with whoever is there, what happened next depends if i stocked or was on register. if i was on registere i had to take a drawer back to the back room and log into my dg account and access the money counter to make sure i start my till off with 100 dollars. if i stock then i have to go to the back room and pull our a rolltainer of product to put out on the shelfs. I loved my co-workers I couldnt ask for better friends at work honestly and when some cool customers come in the store it just makes it all the better. the most enjoyable part of the day is when i make a person smile and laugh and make their day because it just makes my day even better each minute."
good,"Employees are great (kind, team players, patient). "
good,Everyday is different and challenging. Every effort is to make sure that the products are available for the customers. I love providing service to the customers.
good,I love my job mainly my customers they are all fun and easy too talk too on a day to basis .If you don't have a relationship with your customers then you don't have a business or a job. My customers are always first no matter there mood are mine we always make each other smile. My co workers wouldn't change some of them for the world .
good,I liked working at dollar general but the pay was very low and you have no room to grow in the company overall it is not a very satisfying job.
good,mostly part time positions.  Only the mangers work full time.  Able to transfer to different locations.  working hours are decent.
good,"I like the job I am at now. Although, I would love a job that pays more or offers more hours. I think it is a great company for anyone who desires retail experience and wants to move up fast."
good,The work was manageable and varied. Meetings went smoothly. Supervisors and coworkers were helpful and supportive. I learned how to do my job with help from my coworkers.
good,"nice place to work, very clean and safe .can be fast pace. Always something to do. The hardest part of the job is putting the truck away"
good,I would come into work and clock in. I would count down a drawer in the office. I would check START (which was planograms and signs that needed to be hung). I would take the drawer back upfront and put it in the back up register. I would start throwing freight in the back of the store while my cashier throws freight and runs register. Every night we would stock the coolers and lock up. The hardest part of the day would be getting my body use to throwing freight if I had the day off the day before. The most enjoyable part of the day would be seeing the regular customers come in and make your day even better than it is.
good,You are constantly overworked and under payed with little to no appreciation. The co workers are inept and mean. The most enjoyable part of the job was when i got to leave.
good,It was hard work and you had to be willing to push yourself. The manager called you with only a couple hours notice on when you had to work because there was no set schedule.
good,"I like working in the front of a store, being the cashier. i would work at the register helping customers but i would multitask with things that needed inventorying and stocking."
good,"Appears to have a very high turnover rate in DM and SM ranks although to Company is financially sound, and publicly expresses a ""people"" atmosphere in their operation.  "
good,Dollar General is a great place to work. The only problem I have is the neighborhood (for a lot of them) isn't the safest and the pay is minimal for the responsibility and  expectations in that type of environment.
good,"If you like to keep busy and multi task, you will enjoy this retail establishment. Pay structure could be better for part time employees."
good,"honestly i love working for Dollar General but the manager at the salem,sc store is not worth working for, she doesnt know how to run that store, and you dont get enough hours or get paid enough for the things you have to put up with. But other than that i love it!"
good,I checked customers out most of all until at the end of the night when i would front the shelves.
good,"I would arrive an hour and a half early, check the store perimeter, start opening duties after reviewing notes from the night before.  I would count the money, drawers, etc. and make a list of tasks to be completed before the day is over.  I learned to adjust to different personalities and assign duties based on the strengths that I recognized in them and the ones they acknowledged as being the most comfortable with doing.  My coworkers were helpful and respectful.  The hardest part was having to explain to some employees the differences between being an associate and a boss/manager.  The most enjoyable part was being acknowledged for outstanding performance and encouraging my staff."
good,This company requires store managers to work 6 days per week and does not compensate well for the amount of work that is required.
good,my experience with dollar general was very nice. i got to work with other people that i got along with very well and also in a friendly and nice enviroment.
good,they promised me when i was hired I would move up when a position came open and i am still a LSA
good,Typical day was always the same. There was always some type of drama because everybody didn't not like working with someone. so I ended up leaving because of all that drama and gossiping that was going on there. I did like seeing the regular customers who came in at least 3 times a week. they always made my day go pass fast. I got along with all my coworkers.
good,Just like any other min wage job. do what you are told and you will do fine. Overall a very good starting out job that requires no skills.
good,I didn't like working here as much as I thought I would. so that is why im looking for a different job.
good,"only worked 3 days a week "
good,"Better than fast food, I enjoy that I get paid every week but management is messed up at my location and employees are often treated disrespectfully by managers. Also wouldn't be too bad if I got paid more than minimum wage."
good,"Managing customers, team-members, as well as managing time effectively where all team-members' hours of work are fully utilized in order to continue daily success in the operations of the store."
good,"Fun place to work until you have nothing to do. Like any other job, there is only so much cleaning you can do."
good,Fast paced and I enjoyed meeting new people everyday. I sadly had to leave my job because my hours were cut down to 6-10 hours per week.
good,Pretty good job never boring always had a task to get done. Fixing up the self and stocking always entertaining. The work wasn't hard which what I liked the most about the job
good,A typical day at work we restock our shelves and take care of our customers. I learned to watch everyone in the store to make sure no one was stealing from the company. Management ran the facility very well. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was trying to make enough room on the shelves for the products. The most enjoyable part about my job was working with the public.
good,"great place to work if you dont mind long, random hours and enjoy working with the public"
good,A typical day at work would consist of me running the cash register stocking the medicine wall. I've learned that hard working can really pay off and along the way you'll meet some friendly people. The management was very good but sometimes they could be slow at assisting with back up or taking something off the customers transition.
good,"It was always busy working for Dollar General. I've learned no matter if management wasn't the best to me, I made it the best for customers to have the best experience while I was at work. Lastly, the co-workers I worked with were nice while my time lasted."
good,A typical day at work is a day of re stocking and reorganizing the store. I learned how to accomplish goals set out per shift.
good,Working with customers was a great experience! I also worked as a Stocker.

good,"Dollar General is a easy going place to work, the coworker are wonderful people. I also like how the time go by its all ways some to do and its great place to work."
good,Great if your looking for your first job. You can learn a lot about retail. Learned a lot about store presentation and customer service.
good,As a customer you can usually find some amazing deals between sale papers and leftover seasonal merchandise.  In the employment perspective they take advantage of all the store and district managers.  Forcing additional hours with no protection from the state or federal government.
good,Fast paced and always a lot to do. I learned that you have to work as a team there not one person can do it all. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the whole truck done in two days.
good,"A typical day involves dealing with many customers, cleaning up a very busy store, and counting money in drawers and the deposit at the end of the night. Trying to find a balance of completing all the duties I have within the time I have is the hardest part of the job."
good,I loved working there. Meet alot of people that are now my closest friends.
good,"Cleaning, Organizing. But all in all i fun oriented place to work"

good,"it was a job, company is not a company i would work for again, you do everything they ask and its never enough"
good,"You have task to do everyday also interacting with the customer,  stocking shelves and making the store pretty,"
good,Dollar General was a good company to be working for. While i was there I learned and build my customer service. Management team was not always professional. Co-workers was great people to work with and even became friends further than work. The most enjoyable part of working at dollar general was meeting new people and building a relationship with co-workers and customers.
good,I get to work at 5:30 and work 10 to 12 hour days. I look over the store and make a list of what needs to be accomplished for that day. I give the person for morning a list to get done before shift is up for the day. Same with afternoon shift..I have a great management team that helps get projects completed on time.The hardest part of my job is getting huge amounts of freight each week and all the heavy lifting .The customers is what makes my job enjoyable. Being a part of their lives is a joy.
good,I worked in a fast paced environment with strong customer service. I attended several training sessions which I brought back to my store to incorporate to my staff.

good,I count down the drawers and the safe then I get started on whatever the manager tells me to do.  I assist customers and cashiers when needed.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes I don't get to be with my family on the weekends.  I however love my customers and look at them as my second family.
good,I unload trucks that come in. Run a cashier during the busy time of the day. Stock shelves when the day is slow.
good,Don't have enough incentive for employees.Corporate allow money to keep them from having quality employees around. Which is unfortunate because that's going to keep them from taking the game over.
good,"A typical day at my job would include stocking truck and/or the overstock from the truck, as well as checking in vendors, answering calls, assisting customers with their daily shopping and returns, problems, etc., as well as recovering the store, doing paperwork, cash management, and closing the store down. I am the assistant manager, and I have been with the company for one year and five months and am still currently employed here. The experience working here so far has been great; i have learned so much about retail and business management than I knew before. My customer service skills have definitely improved since I started working here, and they still improve daily. The hardest part of my job would be fitting all of my responsibilities into my allotted time, but I always do. And the most enjoyable part of my job would definitely have to be my coworkers; we are a huge family at work and it really makes work more fun."
good,"Responsible for hiring and training all new hires. Also payroll, scheduling, deposits, ordering merchandise, setting weekly ads and plan o grams. Providing a safe and clean store to work and shop."
good,"My typical day at dg, was hard work,but also fun ,because I new my job,i knew what my superviser expected out of me. what I learned,working as a team ,gets a whole lot done, then working by yourself.managemt, I must say I worked with a great group of people. The hardest part of the job I must say is, getting behind, or having big orders"
good,innappropriate conduct from managers/too much horseplay
good,"A typical day of work is just working to register, helping customer check out. On the down time recover the store."
good,This job helped me stay healthy while pregnant with my first child even though the hours where long and sometimes I opened and sometimes I closed and had to multitask quiet a bit but it was a good job.
good,"I really liked being busy. At Dollar General, there was always something to do. Whether it was assisting customers, stocking shelves or cleaning, you were always busy!"
good,"Most days, I run the register and stock medicine when there are no customers waiting to check out."
good,I enjoyed working at this career because there were so many different things to do and so many different people you came into contact with everyday. Never a boring day I learned how to listen to and help solve customers needs and complaints. The best part of job was seeing your accomplishments and watching co-workers grow and succeed. I very much enjoy working with people and in retail.
good,"Lots of tough work, but manageable, by those willing to put in the effort.  Advancement availability also for those willing to put in the time and effort.  You can get out of it, what you put into it."
good,"This was not a bad place to work but, was expected to do too much and lift a lot of heavy objects, I was pregnant with some minor complications at the time."
good,never got the chance to work more hrs. had to travel out of state just to get to the job. Robberies occurred also
good,"There were some really dependable and hard workers. The hardest part of the job was unloading the weekly trucks, not enough room in warehouse. I really enjoyed the people, I am a people person, I never meet a stranger."
good,It doesn't pay much and weekly checks cause for more of a problem when it comes to saving.
good,"Work from 9 - 3 or 3 - 10:30 "
good,When recent management was there it was very unprofessional
good,I like to be busy all the time so this was a good job for me.  I hated to leave.
good,"My experience at Dollar General was sub par, not my best working experience at all. The people I had worked with weren't exactly professional, the customers were absolutely lovely and appreciative. I had the opportunity to start handling money more and make bank runs for the company towards the end of my tenure."
good,"DG was a good job, you got paid every week, work with great people who cares about your improvement."
good,"it was a good job for a first timer, managers are very freindly and understanding"
good,"This company does not offer much in the way of pay or a chance for advancement. Every year you work there you get an extra quarter on the hour, but the kick is once you reach a certain number you cannot make more than that amount an hour."
good,Average Retail Job.  Hours are okay.  Management is okay.  Pay is poor.
good,"Difficult to answer, not the best experience. I had trouble doing the manager position because the wouldn't let me weed out the bad employees."
good,productive and learning environment. not for advancement carreer. easily an employee can loose his position. i was not happy with that company
good,This is a decent place to work as the staff is friendly and will make you feel welcome and the procedures are easy to understand while the registers are not to difficult to master. The only down fall is that it is incredibly difficult to get full time and part time hours are never guaranteed. Some weeks you may have 25-30 hours and then others weeks you may have 5-10 hours. This is not necessarily the fault of management but is rather and order from corporate.
good,Wonderful place to work just needs some new management and positive leaders. Company will not allow you to get hours in order to get benefits and do not like to offer chances to advance in company
good,"A typical day at Dollar General means I'm running the cash register, checking in vendors, and stocking shelves all at the same time. I've learned how to multi task like a pro. I know what needs to get done and the order of importance in which it needs to be."
good,I enjoyed working there just needed to find a job where I got more hours.
good,"I learned how to operate a register, and scanner, also how to count down my till (register)."
good,Loved my job here! Loved everyone i worked with. Very long time ago though.
good,"Every time at work, I stocked items, checked people out at the registers, and cleaned the store. I learned how to use a register and how to prepare for inventory. My co-workers were hard to get along with at times because of drama. The management wasn't all that great. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time and working during the holiday season."
good,a typical day was making sure that I tended to my customers and their needs
good,"Ok place to work not the greatest experience I've, and extremely high turnover rate. Also employees are extremely underpaid."
good,I felt used at the end because they only needed store set up for grand opening
good,"Yes, Dollar General is nationwide, but every store has its own individuality and chemistry. It is truly hard to find two stores exactly the same. In this way, the store becomes like a small family, everyone knows and works with each other, and learns each other's strengths and weaknesses. But by building up the whole team's knowledge and experience, the store can thrive, and that brings a huge boost to confidence. Knowing that I had a direct part in my stores success was truly great."
good,It is very fast-paced. The management is not the best but its improving. The co-workers are easy to get along with. It's a great job overall.
good,Hardest part of the job was not getting your next schedule until the day before.

good,dollar general is a good place to work as well as a great experience.
good,Store was always mess when i came in to work. Asst Managers would always be talking or complaining about store manager. Not a healthy work place.
good,"This Dollar General has been rated number one in the U.S. for it's astounding profits made on a daily basis. Each day is filled with the challange of keeping the store stocked,clean, and orderly while checking out customers. The management team for the store that I work at is friendly and happy to assist new comers. The hardest part of the job is achieving assignments given for the shift while keeping lines down."
good,Assisting Store Manager to perform daily duties throughout the store...
good,"It's a mice place to work, but it could stand some improvement from the higher up on the totem pole"
good,loved my boss and coworkers. upbeat environment and morale.
good,"Customer service comes first, making sure store has products on shelves and ready for customers. Plan o grams need to be set on schedule and set exactly like pictures. Store needs to maintain cleanliness and a friendly atmosphere. Hours managers need to work is long and days off are few. "
good,Well I came in starting off at 8.25 ended up at 15.00 hr......Reason why company had a lot of problem which I had correct I had to fire a whole store and rebuild it...Then I had another store that had a 25% theft rate I changed that to 7% by the time I left it kept me thinking

good,"Liked working there, just didn't like the fact you go in not knowing how many hours you are going to work"
good,"As a Sales Associate at Dollar General it is important to be willing to help customers and to be respectful too. Also, as a Sales Associate you're very productive. Every Friday, our Dollar General received truck. Not just for the Sales Associate, but for all co-workers as well, you work truck until it is finished. If you're not working on truck, you're working on over-stock or recovering the store, as in, cleaning and making the store look presentable for the customers. As the Sales Associate does all of the above, the Sales Associate also watches for customers at the cash register to have them leaving satisfied with their service. You're constantly on the go, go, go and that is for any position that you work. At the Dollar General that I worked for, every co-worker had great teamwork. If teamwork wasn't being done, you wouldn't get through half of the tasks that needed to be done daily. What I enjoyed most about being a Sales Associate for Dollar General is getting to see the customers that came in daily, my ""regulars."""
good,"I had a good time working at dollar general, the people who came in were generally really nice and good people to talk to"

I enjoyed pleasing customers at this job. My co-workers and I had a very positive and friendly environment in our store. Company had a great bonus program. Hardest part of this job was going in at 5am to unload tucks and having too many expectations with limited payroll hours to bring in extra help, lots of heavy lifting, being on my feet up to 13 hours a day."
good,This place had given me a lot of experience with working on the floor and assisting customers.
good,"Clocked in @ 4pm made sure both register drawers were right, Went to the back room & pulled all the stock that could be put away, Recovered all the shelves, Counted down our register drawers at the end of our shift, & made the nightly deposit, set the alarm & locked the door."
good,"Working in Dollar General was always busy, we had a lot of customers. The day at work was very challenging but I enjoyed myself. I learned to deal with all types of people. I met some pretty amazing co-workers they taught me everything I needed to know on the register and on the floor when I had to recover the store. The hardest part of my job there was dealing with returns and when I was the only one on register and had a lot of customers but I always pulled through and accomplished it. The most enjoyable part of my job was the end of the day and I had to recover. I got to learn how to properly organize the store."
good,Typical good workplace. Good manager. Enjoyed working truck

good,"A typical day usually involves greeting and assisting customers, register, mopping sweeping, stocking, etc."
good,"While other management and coworkers have not been bad to work with, I am not fond of this job. I work night shifts and come in for the as early as 1 PM. I feel like I am work more than I am awake enjoying the rest of my life. While I like dealing with the nice customers and putting out the things they need for everyday life, it's the not-so-nice customers and thieves that make me so mad some days."
good,Many opportunities to learn different aspects of the company.
good,Nothing special to say about these companies. Only thing good is that they pay every week.
good,Took incoming phone calls on several accounts from customers placing orders.

good,I have worked there for over nine years.A typical day at work would include either opening the store in the morning or closing at night. I have learned to get along well with people no matter how they treat me. The hardest part of the job is making sure employees show up when their shift starts.  The most enjoyable part is getting to visit with people and getting to know them

good,"This company has a great concept, in what and how they furnish reasonable prices to their customers,  but there was never enough staffing hours to complete the work that needed to be done."
good,"A typical day for me consisted of morning paperwork of the opening of store for the day counting safe and issuing numbers for the night before."
good,"First when I got to the store I would make a run to the bank and get change, then I would get the cashier ready. and start to stock the store with items. Thru out the day I will check in merchandiser like pepsi. Once a week the dollar general truck would show up and I would unload it .What I learned from here is how to help others out and to be patience. I enjoyed working with others and I hope I can find a great place to work at."
good,"Stock shelves, be very nice to customers, make/break change, deal with minimal staff of store, clean as you go. Hardest part of job is stocking while cashiering.  Most enjoyable part of job eating sour patch kids in the break room."
good,I gave the stars I did because I didn't have such a great time there I had and employee that damaged my car and when I showed the store manager the damage he said it was my problem and I had to deal with it so I made a police report had the damage fixed. The same employee damaged my car a second time and this time there was a witness and when I took to witness and the pictures the witness had of the employee doing the damage to my car to the store manager he did nothing to the employee and again told me it was my problem and to deal with it so I wrote the employee up and gave her 3 days off .I got suspended and then I had to leave the company because I didn't want my car to keep getting damaged by this employee since the store manager wouldn't help me by punishing the employee or backing up my punishments
good,some favoritism  to certain employees. the co workers are ok
good,I was  a part time cashier. Enjoyed performing customer service and learning new skills.
good,It was a good way to meet and get to know all kinds of people. My co-workers were very friendly. I learned how to be a leader and became very productive and more outgoing since you have that every day customer interaction. My store manager was lazy and never wanted to work but the District Manager was very friendly. Manager said they would work around my school schedule but kept scheduling me to work during classes so I had to drop out.
good,"Dollar General is a not like any other company that I have worked for before. They have the days planned out weekly on what needs to be done in the store as well as making sure that the employees are focusing on achieving excellent customer service, keeping the store recovered and clean and that the store is fully stocked at all times. Being a manager for this company has been both challenging and knowledgeable and I have learned a great deal when it comes to maintaining a discount grocery retail store."
good,Fast paced but good work. Learned how to stock shelves properly. The best part about the job is helping and meeting new people.
good,"a typical day usually is slow and allows you time to clean and restock at a steady pace. sudden swarms of customers are not uncommon."

good,"A typical day would consist of cleaning, stocking, ringing up merchandise and greeting customers as they entered the environment. I learned great customer service skills. I would have to say the hardest part working there would have to be when we had to remodel the store. The most enjoyable part would have to be making new friends & learning new skills."
good,"Helping people and computer work and paperwork, and cleaning and being as assistance manager"
good,At DG you havet o lean to do it all. cashier stock & unload trucks.
good,I think that pretty much says it right there. Co-Workers were awesome and my customers were awesome the down side of it all is not enough payroll to go around and the pay should be a bit more for the work that you put into it as well as you never have set hours its changes every day and every week so it doesnt give you a chance to plan anything for your days off. The benefits are kind of steep if you wanted to invest in it. I would say if you needed a part time job or needed a little extra cash in your pocket and have a love for people this would be the perfect job for you.
good,A day working would be progressive with many customers coming in and out with several interests and problems often. But with the skills I learned I could then deal with them respectfully and get them what they needed. Most of the time it was just me and a manager on the clock so things were fast paced and sometimes hectic given the amount of customers.
good,"This corporation is based thoroughly upon team work and dedication to not only individuals that are in the franchise but most importantly to the customers and the community in which it is in. Since I've been employed with DG, I have worked under a couple of different store managers and under each one team work drives the success of the store. I enjoy being part of the management staff because it gives me enough authority to make a difference in the store and help to produce better sales. I've learned that listening is essential in retail. The hardest part of being a manager (MOD) is the frustration and pressure that often surfaces. I'm not a fan of either but it comes with the territory and I handle them both with professionalism."
good,would not like to comment on the position. The treatment there is unprofessional
good,"Help customers"
good,"During the most recent times(2) employed w/ Dollar General there were management & district management problems. I suffered an unexpected loss of job due to the unwillingness of management to work the necessary hours required for the salaried position. "
good,very fun place to work at if you enjoy customers satisfaction.
good,"Cashier/stocker"
good,At Dollar General you have to run the cash register. Provide exceptional customer service. Have a knowledge of all the stores products. Front face the store. Keep the store neat and clean.
good,Greeted customers as they came into the store. Stocked shelves. Cleaned store.
good,"I would take daily counts of the day's take when my shift was over, I oversaw the employees at the store and had a productive store under my management. My co-workers could have worked harder and I encouraged them to do so. But if my co-workers did not do as they needed to I disciplined them and I took over and completed their job. The hardest part of the job was store relocation. I adjusted well to the store relocation and meshed well with those store employees, but I do my best work in a stable location. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I advanced in the ranks quickly and meet each new position with success."
good,would stock shelves and ring up customers. co-workers were friendly and enjoyable to be around.
good,There are many customers a day. There are rude customers just as well as really nice customers. Its a very big store.
good,The hardest part of the job was balancing the work that the Health Board was requiring along with managing the day-to-day operations of the store.  The employees were great!  Everyone worked very hard to get the store in shape.  Employees from other stores came to our store on their days off to help.  Being apart of that level of teamwork was the best part of the job.
good,"you try to stock all shift long, but you get interrupted by: customers(non stop), cashiers for voids and returns. venders. I learned everything I know about management there. my manager was great. co-worker (associates) are fun to work with. they know their jobs. dealing with customers all the time, always same people day in and day out. same questions they asked hundred times before. working with my co-workers."
good,"Not willing to work around schedule as needed. Would not consider if I had a babysitter for my child before making schedule, therefore would end up calling into work."
good,"Customer service, Stock and merchandising. The hardest part of the job was meeting the goals without staying over. The most enjoyable was the teaching others to take on more task."
good,"Its a busy place to work. There is always something to do, if it isnt customer service you have freight and if neither need to be taken care of you can face products and clean up."
good,"A typical day at work is busy scanning customers items putting things up on the shelf's and pulling items up to the front of the shelf where customers can get to the items and see them. "
good,typical day at work is be a cashier and put the truck up. Cashier was easy until you had to put the truck up at the same time.
good,"The Job is ok. My main objection is the low pay and the way they treat their workers. On a typical day of work  I would count tills, front the store a manage a few employees."
good,"Providing excellent service to customers. Answering questions to the best of my ability. Coworkers are amazing, easy to get along with. Everyone is welcoming. I honestly don't enjoy my job, there is no way for growth."
good,"Great employees, set up a new store,, enjoyed the job very much, Hardest part of job was being  assistant manager,"

good,Learned how to be patient. Fast paced environment. Co-workers easy to work and get along with.
good,"I worked 12 + hrs per day checking in vendors, cleaning and stocking shelves, cleaning the floors and bathrooms, making bank runs, dealing with shoplifters, etc.  The low wages and part time hrs did not attract employees who were motivated to work. I spent a lot of time picking up everyone's slack."
good,"Cashier, stock, clean."
good,"My advancement came really fast as I work with-in this company I went from a cashier, key holder to Assistant Manager."
good,When i worked at dollar general I was actually helping remodel the inside. It was a lot of fun. That job is how I met some of my friends.
good,"It was a great experience, where I was given the opportunity to learn and expand my skills as a Cashier. The environment is very friendly, customers are great, it's like having a second family."
good,store unorganzined stuff not in the right place and only one register open
good,"A typical day at Dollar General consist of operating cash register, stocking shelves with products, assisting customers with locating items within the store. I learned first hand how to deal with certain types of customers. The management were wonderful, understanding and encouraging.  Some of my co-workers were very helpful and dedicated while others were not. The hardest part of the job would unloading and lifting extremely heavy boxes."
good,"greeting customers was a great thing, the co-workers were ok to work with,the most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,The job is easy and it's a good place to get experince in retail.
good,learning how to order items for the store. opening and closing the store. doing payroll and other things.
good,".cashiering & assisting customers."
good,"Lots of unloading"
good,"Have applied but no call back but nice letter saying no job at this time. But still in the paper"
good,"The day would start with warm-up exercises and then we would work til first break. Then we worked till lunch, then we worked til second/last break.

good,The work day was long and hard but with the right team members we turned the store around and gave great customer service and satisfaction.I sucessfully improved the store Inventory and cleaned up the back room and store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the praise the customers gave us for improving the store conditions.

good,"At the dollare Genral, I was the asstant manager, I was there to teach as well as to learn, It was a fun place to work."
good,"non-stop, fast paced. Huge break room with ping-pong and foose-ball tables."
good,"Great experience, little pay, high turnover, learned a lot, room for advancement"
good,DG is a good company to work for if you're ready to work and can handle the work load.
good,Job offer should be as stated at time of employment. Not what I was offered.
good,"At times it was a fast paced environment, at others it was slow and gave me time to stock shelves and clean up. I enjoyed my co-workers, I did not enjoy my boss, I am certain he was on drugs and he was not willing to work with me when my mother-in-law was injured and I requested time off even after I had worked holidays."
good,"I would not say that Dollar General was the ideal place to work, but it was not the worst place either."
good,A typical day at work would be the moment you walk in you clock in and move carts and other items outside. I learned how to operate a cash register. Management was okay I think it would have been better if my schedule was set every week instead of me having to call in everyday to find out if i was working the next day or not. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job would be going back and fourth between the register and stocking shelves because there is no system to know when someone is at the register but it was manageable. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
good,Good starter job but its low pay for a large amount of work and your left alone most of the time so you have to get it done right the first tiem and fast!
good,"The store was short staffed when I applied so I got the job with no problem. I can say that the work load was not at all the problem, it was my co-workers. My manager was constantly off talking to someone, and called me an idiot to customers behind my back. The sales lead who was in charge of me spent most of the shift talking on the phone; then a week later quit. And my co-workers where constantly talking behind my back. So I quit because due to mental health issues. But on the flip side, I loved working in the back room and helping customers find what they needed."
good,I stocked shelves and checked customers out. I had great co-workers. It was a very steady pace job and I had a good amount of hours.
good,"Set up Registers. Open store. Stock Shelves. Review night befores "
good,I had to make sure my team members was doing their job safe and marking all cleaning supplies accordingly to the MSDS
good,"wonderful benefits, workiong here was pretty good, 12 hour shifts 6 days a week was a lilttle much on never seening my kids or spending time them"
good,management no good stocker cut boxes open to have the pickers pic them
good,"I can say, that this job is a good job for somebody to work part time or some one that is in school.  They do not offer full time positions unless you are a manager."
good,while its easy alot to learn great co workers not hard at all.. worst part is dealing with customers and easy is everything else
good,I performed excellent customer service skills. I applied a lot of the interpersonal skills I learned from my psychology classes that I took in school. I just learned how to perform my job as a cashier more efficiently.
good,"learned a great deal about customer relations, learned about maintaining control in busy high stress situations"
good,It's an alright day to work for. The bad thing is they only give you like 20 to 25 hours a week. I was hoping for 40 hours but you gotta take what they give you. The hardest part of the job is being the cashier because they watch closely if you are over or under. I don't like being cashier. The co-workers are all easy to get along with.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dollar General, The employee's were nice, the manager's were nice and understanding."
good,Never a dull moment. Loved my co-workers and shift. Liked that we came together to meet our quota.
good,nice place and good atmosphere to work business is constantly growing so there is room for advancement just cheap pay
good,"Dollar General was always short on staff. I would be responsible for cleaning, cashiering, stocking, pricing, and customer service all at the same time. I was required to work many extra shifts and doubles because of the low number of employees. There was always projects going on throughout the store and rolltainers placed throughout the store. This made it difficult for associates as well as customers to really get around in the store. The job was very fast moving and I was responsible for many different duties through out my shift."
good,"A typical day busy and fast pace, I learn to help keep customers happy. Management was awesome co-workers love me never had anything hard about this job. The most important part of my job was making CUSTOMERS SMILE."
good,"This is a good place to work but Dollar General will not come to realization. There is too much work, too little pay, and anyone in management can almost have no life outside of Dollar General. I learned that you must delegate in order to get most jobs done. Co-workers don't always have your back like they should. The hardest part about the job was getting strong people behind you to take up the slack when management is absent. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,run cash register an put up stock. help customers find products in the store an feel welcomed an want to come back
good,"Easy job, flex schedule, pay was ok, management worked with well with employees "
good,"Distric Manager very helpful, good hours, love to work there"
good,Enjoyed this place because of its busy & constant work flow.
good,"management listens and tries to work with your schedule "
good,"I arrive around ten or so minutes early, clock in, count my drawer, relieve the cashier on duty at that time. I work the register if I have customers, but if I have no customers, I have to either go around and stock the shelves, if there is stocking to be done, or I will walk around and ""recover"" the entire front of the store. Recovering is basically when I walk around and make sure all items are pulled to the front of their shelves, to the very edge. I sometimes work 9.5 hour shifts, with a one hour lunch break, for which I cannot leave the store, and other times I work shifts as short as four hours, depending on the scheduling of that week. I learned that there are all types of people you come into contact with each day, and each one of them has a story, and most just want someone to listen to them. The management slacks a little, and they sometimes do not follow the rules set forth by the people above them, but can be very understanding at times. The hardest part of the job is finding a long enough break to get away from the register and do my other jobs, such as recovering, while keeping an eye on the register in case someone ventures up to my register. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to chat with customers. I am a people-person, and I love meeting new faces and coming across familiar ones."
good,"the typical day at work was always interesting, i learned that to be more productive you must first be organized, we had halloween decorations still in the back corner in april, nothing ever got done because we were so short handed the hardest part was holding the keys because if your associate needed a void or drop or got busy you had to drop everything and help them so again nothing got done, closing was the most enjoyable part of the day because your associate could get stocking done while i was counting the change fund and the deposit"
good,i worked there and it was nice and layed back and easy work. i enjoyed working there.
good,"Typical work day consisted of stocking shelves, helping out customers, and working the cash register."
good,"The job itself wasn't too bad, but the people who worked there made the job seem harder than it was."
good,management team wasn't very supportive of it's employees.Off going shift leave unfinished tasks that should have been complete
good,Working here was great until i got accused of something. Oh well you keeping going and not let something hold you back.
good,over worked as a store manager earning salary. worked anywhere from 60 - 80 hours a week for very little money. management was poor at the time.
good,Its was okay job to have but it have you do to much stuff it the last minute. 
good,"A typical day working for Dollar General consists of managing deposits, setting planograms, re-merchandising, and making sure all other employees are doing their job in a fast but yet productive manner."

good,"It was a fairly common workplace with a demanding time schedule. The hardest part of the job was keeping customers happy when they wanted to return items without receipts, having to tell them no. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help people save money when we got the chance to."
good,"very good first job, loss prevention, careless workers, a lot of theft going on within the staff and customers, long hours due to the times they are open "
good,"I enjoy working for dollar general, just sometimes they may require much more of you than what they pay you. "
good,"Was ok since I like to interact with a peoople; great place to meet new people."
good,"rang up customers and stocked shelves."
good,"Helped customers- find products and range them up as a cashier. Voided items that were not wanted. "
good,I would load truck with boxes after they came off the conveyer belt. Good part of the job was the pay. The worst part was the hours that I had to work
good,   DG is a fun environment with the right team. I've learned that it is what you make it. Very fast paced and a lot of hours.
good,"Enjoyed having a job.  Meeting people and assisting them."
good,"I rather be working outside then inside, the co-workers were nice, I stocked shelves."
good,"Its a nice place to work, The Co-workers are fun and outgoing and easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers.

good,"Learned about inventory and sales, very fun job working with people."
good,A typical day at Dollar General is interactive. You can learned many different products that's coming out and you get to see new people. The Management was great they looked out on you when it counted the most. My co-workers was unique in their own way. The hardest part was nothing at all. 
good,"Pay is very low!! opening /closing store, deposits, voids, returns, ordering unloading trucks, supervising employees who had bad understanding.  Still enjoyed my job and work with the customers"
good,"I loved my job because I love meeting new people and learning new things. I built a relationship with most of my customers. I love to see people happy. Ive learned that not everyone is going to be fond of you no matter how nice you are to them. Take everything with a grain of salt beacuse things could always be worst. No matter how your boss or your co workers make you feel just continue to keep a positive mindset so you wouldnt be distracted. The hardest part of my job was when my co workers would have a bad day and bring their attitude to work. I would just simply speak and tell them i hope they have a good rest of the day because a compliment can make a persons day! The most enjoyable part of the job was experiencing new ways to increase sales, meeting new faces, and my co workers"
good,"not enjoyable, no room for advancement, nothing else to say "
good,I would count my register and make sure it was right with what need to be in it. I learn alot on how to work with the public and how the store want to look. I like working with my co-workers. We had alot of fun. The hardest thing was to keep up with the different things they wanted done. I enjoy working with the public and learning what I did.
good,"I would work the cash register, talk with customers, and recover and stock the store. i didn't see it more than just a job."
good,• Supervised 30 Employees in the case pack division
good,with the people in our area being on assistance we have alot of scam artist who is also theives and they know what stores to go into when more then one person is in the store to shop lift
good,when i first started their it was nice untill different managers came and they are so disrespectfull
good,My typical day at work is stocking and arrainging items on the sales floor. I enjoy working with my co-workers... the harderst part of the job is not enough hours..The most enjoyable part of the job is that I am working...
good,Did not provide enough payroll to keep employees at store. Lack of communication from district manager made it difficult to perform job as needed.
good,"This job was a learning proccess, It was a job at least, but working with a manager with negative aproches and the company benifits not so grand, was hard to make a living and take care of my children,"
good,loved co-workers; changes in management was a downfall; worked 10-12 hours a day; worked different shifts and hours
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting and ringing up customers, stocking shelves, and cleaning the store."
good,"A typical day at work included: working on the cash register, helping customers when they needed it, and putting up merchendise."
good,take care of customers handle the register stock recover help when need have a friendly work enviroment
good,"At work i enjoy the people, I like to learn and everyday I learn something new or I'm teaching someone something, the hardest pasrt of the job is when u have rude customers, disloyal staff but know matter what I always make the best out of my work place."
good,"Meeting people, working on cashier, and the co-workers were nice"
good,The typical workday at dollar general is always busy and productive.
good,"you had a goal of a basket size, normally it was maybe 9 items. you got written up if your customers did average 9 items... which is hard its a dollar store. Most people come in buy one thing that they need on there way home from work, yet the employee gets punished for what the customer didnt buy..."
good,Follow processes and every week will be the same as the one before
good,this was not my first money handling postion but one of my favorite retail jobs. i learned much on this position such as how to read schematic labling. The item's SKU #. learned about how to secure cash in drop box in case of robbery. Also how to perfectly front and face products so they look more presentable to the customer.
good,Its Good to start out with DG but I would rather work in Retail / clothing sales
good,"Actually liked this place, there was plenty of work to do and everyone got along fine. The last time I worked for this company I was sick, very very sick. One night I worked cash register as usual, and being what I thought was overly tired, I asked the supervisor if I could stock shelves, which meant that she would have had to run register. but that isn't the way this company is set up. Non management runs register and management stocks shelves. As a result my register was short, and I was fired. this is the first time in my life, I would have rather called off work or left early."
good,"The pay wasn't great. They didn't offer any sort of employee discount. But, if you enjoy working in Customer Service than it's really good."
good,Dollar general is a great company to work for i've had some wonderful times there...
good,management on salaried employees are prone to working themselves ragged due to lack of underpaid associates and poor upper management as well as very poor company processes.
good,Friendly in environment
good,did planograms and worked on the register and did returns and banking and stocking
good,it is had to say when you have a district manager that thrives on making everyone fear him...
good,This job was an good job but there was alot of management issues
good,i love to meet new people got to learn new things the manager wrote me up cause of what i wore til they got uniforms
good,Always busy working with comsters and pricing and putting away merchandise
good,"scheduling staff, seting planograms, working freight, training new store managers and providing great customer service"
good,Coming in and serving costumers was the best part of my job. I learned how to manage money and also how to open a store. My co-workers were very close but the hardest part off my job was off-loading a truck it took hours to do. I enjoyed the people that I met they were from all diffrent professions.
good,"I would have preferred to not have a swing shift (ex: 6 am Saturuday, then 12 am Sunday)"
good,"As soon as I would show up in the mornings I would unlock the front door and start my day off with running repots from yesterday's business to verify that the cash balanced. I would then walk the store and verify cleanliness for the customers to have a neat, tidy store to shop in. Once the doors was unlocked, I would then bouce between register, customer service, stocking shelves, hanging new sale signs, and anything else that may need done. At noon I would get my first cashier. Then I was able to go to my office and finish my morning paperwork then run the deposit from last night to the bank. For the rest of the day I would assure that my cashiers for the day had plenty to keep them busy as well as inform my assistant manager of anything that happened throughout the day. I would then leave for the day around four or five pm. Although I have left for the day, however; I am still on call around te clock."
good,"I enjoyed the type of work I was required to do but not the workload. Corporate expectations were too high. Unloading a rolltainer in 30 minutes is unrealistic, especially if it is food. No wonder there are so many expireds, no time to rotate. It's hard to hold your team accountable to standards when you know it's not possible. If even only one of your employees are slack it throws everything behind. I was overwhelmed by the workload and the constant interruptions to the register for returns, voids, change, etc..I enjoyed planograms, stocking, checking in vendors, assisting customers, and office duties. I didn't enjoy having no breaks, interruptions while clocked out for lunch and going to the bank on my car using my gas without compensation."
good,This is a very fast pase and physically demanding job.
good,I like working at dollar general because I love learning new things and meeting new people. I love hard work annd staying busy and focused.
good,"On a typical day at work I stock, helped customer's finding things in the store, check customer's out and gave the correct change back. Also, bagged and put groceries in to the buggy."
good,Hours were long and no set work schedule. Enjoyed the people I worked with and customers.
good,I was a key holder which deals with taking the money to the bank and getting change if needed. opened and closed the store. the management was very nice and easy to get along with.
good,"A typical a work day includes: Stocking shelves, inventory counts, Friendly customer service, cashier services, as well as checking in vendors."
good,nice people
good,"fast paced which is good, but the schedule is never accurate"
good,Just another place where you stock shelves and take care of customers in a professional manner.
good,"There are no typical days at work, each is different. I stay busy and like to stay busy. I have learned many things: how to use the HTT system for checking in vendors. How to merchandise, how to put together displays ad planograms. How to open and close the store. The people I work with are like family. The hardest part of the job is not knowing my schedule until week's end and not being able to make plans. And, not having a steady schedule. it changes from week to week. The most enjoyable part of the job is our customers. i love people, working wth the public and giving great customer service. In fact, i would say, I thrive on it."
good,"it's a challenging environment, meet interesting people, fun"
good,"productive but busy job, i kept the shelves stock and unloaded trucks every week"
good,"the management staff was so unorganized, the job was an overall drag"
good,this was very unorganized company. not very fullfilling at all and no future for me.
good,open the store. prepare cash drawers and take deposit to the bank. Come back and open store for the customers. Merchandise new items. Customer service issues. Receiving merchandise. Setting planagrams.Scheduling employees.
good,Had a very responsible staff. Worked together to stay together.
good,"Count your tiel, check out customers as they were finished shopping. Stock merchandise as needed, load and unload truck. The managment kept changing, so you had to know your work and be on top of your game."
good,"Worked 80 hours a week still never had enough hours for payroll. The DM's are a joke always very very negative, expect to get so much done with very little help and always having conference calls. they always want to blame shrink on employees and not on shoplifters. Every one to them is a thief, that works for them. If you have a spouse or kids or even a family think twice. You will be married to that place and NEVER NEVER get any postive feedback. They expect you to put a truck up in 2 days with no extra payroll"
good,a day at the dollar general is a fast and alway on top company The hardest part of the job is dealing with unsatisfied customers. I do not seeing customers unhappy. A typical day is hard working long hours but that is a good thing. I liked having all the work time as possible
good,A typical day at work was filled with excitement. I learned more patience with unknown people. The hardest part of the job was management.
good,"Some of my co-workers was helpful and friendly. A typical work day would included restocing shelves, recieving, breaking down stock and boxes, customer sevice and protecting the store."
good,Overrall it was a great job and many opportunities to advance and kearn new things.
good,If your the kind of person that like to move around 24/7 to get your day going.....then dollar general is the job for you. Plus you would get paid every week
good,"I enjoy working with people. I had difficulty with the register sometimes due to eye sight (wear glasses). I get along with most everyone. I stayed busy, always something to clean & stock."
good,"Working at Dollar general has been a very rewarding experience. In this experience I have learned how to not only balance work and a social life, but also how to balance college. My manager was a terrific addition to this job also. Whenever I needed to come in at a later time for school or medical reasons, he was very leniant. My co-workers are very amiable, and when the time comes to find my true career job I'm going to be upset to leave, because this job was the very foundation of my income, and real world experience. If I was to honestly pick out my favorite part of this job, I would choose cashiering. This is because I was able to interact with such a variety of ravishing people."
good,I really enjoyed it. The only reason I left because of the money.
good,"i was classified has part time help. A day at work would vary from opening the store or closing the store. I would either stock shelves or be a cashier. During the time I worked there we had either no manger or there was three different ones. I liked all the co-workers and made a few life time friends.The hardest part of the job was working all summer without air and sometimes in the winter not much heat., I enjoyed helping the customers."
good,the workers are all toward each other they have a set group in which they hang around my experience here was not very well at all
good,easy job. typical cashier responsibilities and stocking shelves. the worst thing was the pay...minimum wage.
good,"assisting customers, putting out freight, maing bank runs and the hardest part of any retail job is the day after Thanksgiving(Black Friday) and the day before Christmas."
good,i like the dollar general because i learned how to use a register and i liked the people i worked with
good,"A typical day at work was opening/closing the store with making or taking all cash deposits. My store manager was an outgoing hard worker. My employees were all friendly and had good customer service skills.The hardest part of the job had to be the extreme demand of stocking. There were many loads of heavy product. The most enjoyable part of the job was the cash office along with all of the operational things such as filing, payroll, scheduling, etc."
good,"Depending on your location and your management team, the experience can be enjoyable for the most part. I was blessed to be hired at the location and I'm equally blessed to have the manager that I have been employed with for almost two years. He is a great guy. He took a chance on a single mother and has stuck with me for these almost 2 years, since October."
good,"I loved my custmers. I knew almost everyone by there name. My management team wasnt the best, but we made it work. What I learned from this company was that they took zero tolerance and it was often a win or lose situation."
good,"At Dollar General I worked a cashier and sales associate. I was able to create product displays and assist management with different projects. The management was wonderful and treated their employees with respect. My co-workers were always fun to be around and I looked forward to going to work with them. I do not have any complaints where the work load was concerned, it was very managable. The part of this job that I enjoyed the most was being able to interact with customers. I have never had a problem striking up a conversation with a stranger which I found was very beneficial."
good,"A good job for a first time job. The company is a good company, I just didn.t want to stay there for long term."
good,A typical day consist of long hours and extremely hard work. Its a great enviroment with air control temp at 69 degrees year round. Nice breakroom with 4 plasma tvs alot of microwaves so the wait is not long.
good,"Its a good place to start off at, if you don't know anything about cashiering or retail, or stocking. Its a good place to go and work at. Co-workers can be difficult but thats everywhere, the hardest part about this job was the cleaning i had to mop entire store."
good,I loved meeting new and repeat customers. This is a great company to work for and they have a lot of potential. If the store I worked in was bigger square footage wise it would have most likely doubled in sales. It is the highest volume store in the area while being the smallest store. I loved coming in everyday to hear about my customers and just being able to fulfill my customers needs.
good,I enjoyed working with customers interacting with co workers and managers. The hardest part of a customer service job is when a customer doesn't feel satisfied with product or the service they are recieving.
good,This is a very busy company! there is always something hands on to do with your time. Great people on staff and overall enjoyable!
good,"You go to work, you sometimes get told when you go in that you are working 11 hours instead of the usual 10, which isnt bad unless you have kids. Then you have to make arrangements for them on your breaks. You have to work tons of overtime in the summer and around holidays and its usually mandatory. I liked working in the office, but I only got to stay there until an armed forces member returned to take their job back."
good,"Typical work day for me was assisting customers on the floor as well as with their final purchases. When I was not busy with my customers I was on the sales floor, stocking my sleves, putting away abandons and making sure my store stayed clean."
good,"Working at the location that I worked at, it was complicated, because there were management that didn't want to do the work. There also, were employees that didn't want to do certain tasks. I was out of my element, because I am a person whom follows rules and regulations, along with being a hard working, dependable, and reliable person. As far as advancement is concerned, I was a nominee for the Assistant Manager's position, but because I was in school they ruled me out. The security of this company is poor. I believe they need raise the surveillance and monitor the store a little better."
good,"I enjoyed my entry level job working at the Dollar General. I had a great chance to get experience involving, customer service, cash handeling, and working with fellow employees. I also was involved in sticking merchandise and recovery."
good,"Early to work,I learned to how to stock,management then was ok.My co-worker were good got along with everyone,not really anything hard about it , i was always moving around.Most enjoyable was the people i would see on a daily bases."
good,"My main responsibilities consisted of opeing and closing the store, unloading trucks, stocking merchandise, running register, making a schedule for the following week, doing damages, doing the deposit to take to the bank. All of this is what I did during an entire week, not a day. The thing that I learned during my time working for Dollar General was that Management noticed when you went above and beyond to help them with other stores, or with training. The people that I worked with here were very good at what they did, and understood what it means to be on time and kind to others and customers. The hardest part about the job was having to do the training to become a Store Manager. I was out of my store for two weeks while in training. I couldn't really help them while I was training, so they were all alone. People that you meet while working here was the most enjoyable. No one person is like the other, everyone has their own opinions and views, at working for Dollar General I saw more often then other places i've worked at."
good,Talking and meeting new people everyday. Learn how to open and close a store. How their financial work and how to budget.
good,great place to work
good,"Decent management, acceptable compensation and schedule requirements"
good,"This company left little to no opportunity for advancement, and left the location in disrepair for quite some time."
good,Check out customers at register. Restock/recover the entire store. Sweep and mop floors. Clean bathroom.
good,The company was alright to work for. The hours were not the best.
good,Only worked a few hours a day. I enjoyed the people that I worked with. I loved creating frames for customers. I enjoyed working with people.
good,checked in vendors
good,A typical day of work was cashiering and assisting customers. I enjoyed working as a team with my co workers.
good,"A typical work day would be very busy. Being the only convenient store in the neighborhood meant big customer demand. I was a key holder at this location so I was always busy and on the move. This was my first place of employment, I learned a lot and gained great experience."
good,Maybe if this company valued their employees more it would not have such a high turn over rate.
good,"My details I either open or close I assist my cashier when needed, I set planograms, I help customers look for what they need and at the end of my shift I make out a deposit, run my reports. My most enjoyable time at work are meeting new people and helping where I can"
good,Despite only having two people at the most working a shift; everyone was a hard-worker.
good,"The position at the store was full of numerous challenges, but lacked communication by upper management on how to address the challenges."
good,"Our manager was fired for stealing from the company so it wasnt that great. the employees were great, the best part was to be able to talk to everyone and communicating. the worst part was we never knew when we would work."
good,Typical day at work was easy
good,Great place to work for people starting out in the retail business
good,"The holidays are crazy, such as black Fridays."
good,Dollar General is an nice work environment. If were assigned the correct amount of hours and would have be an very well designed retail store for work for in the corporate world.
good,"Team Player type environment with great management,staff and employees"
good,"Always something different to do, team environment. Health benefits offered to full time employees. Flexible schedules."
good,"As a whole , Dollar General is a very strong company to work for and they are sincere in thier values and beliefs."
good,"The customer service is very good, but the atmosphere is drab and the scheduling conflicted with my classes."
good,I previously worked at Dollar General. I started as a cashier and within 2 months I was advanced to Third Key Holder. They do have a very high turnover rate and I have seen them demote an employee for another employee to come in from another location. In general I think they are a fair company. My circumstances were unusual and the manager i worked under was still getting use to her job.
good,Low pay. Good job overall if you go to a good store with a good team. There is no stock position. You have to learn to multitask to be able to get anything done.
good,"Under new management.When I was working there,I thought I was really looking forward to something different to the atmosphere. It's a different story."
good,I was the assistant manager and only made $10 an hour! Not worth the responsibility for the pay and hard work. Not always enough employees to schedule.
good,The managers can be friendly at times. The pay could use some increasing for the General cashiers. The constant changing of the seasons and product was visually nice to see.
good,Pay is okay but the managers I work with make it unbearable. The main boss is a amazing though. But location matters its the management team that make or break it
good,"It was good. I like the people. It was a good experience for me. Always be helpful to each other. I learn to work quick and managing a rush time. The hardest part was when someone do not come at work, work load increased double."
good,"Good for advancement, good hours, not enough pay. SM lazy, leaves majority of work up to AM. Employees don't have basic home training like cleaning up after themselves. Overall, pretty decent for awhile but will neglect you in the long run. HAVE OTHER PLANS!"
good,"Management is not always available to help you grow and solve problems, often times left up to you. District manager is very hard on management and expects unrealistic expectations, which trickles down to all employees."
good,"Not enough raises. Good for working around time off. Favorite people get all days, more weekends off and very few nights. Company policies make an employee feel untrusted and make no sense. Like handling money yet my co workers have to look through my bag. Having a key to front door but not allowing to have a key to the back door. e."
good,Working at dollar general taught me a lot on customer service and how it's worth going out of your way and giving them a pleasant experience will keep them loyal and they'll keep coming back.
good,The job wasn’t hard. The call ins and trying to get a day off was the only cons. Loved the customers and building relationships with vendors. Not a bad job .
good,It a good just for people just looking for a first job or and part time side job as much as i would like to say its good to move up the ladder its not more you move up the worst you get treated my the corporate franchise
good,Its nice there they are flexible and nice with hours they treat u with respect they are helpful they help me when i need help they always help customers when they need it even when they didnt
good,It is a good basic job with opportunities if you are looking for them. Start off pay will be low but in time you can move up. Everyone there when I worked there were good people
good,The dollar general store I worked at was in a really bad neighborhood. The customer were the main reason I wanted to stop working there. The company isn’t bad overall. The upper management team just isn’t good with helping with in store issues like being short handed
good,This jobs does not pay a lot of money for the amount of stuff that they are asking you to do but it was one of my first jobs and it helped me get a taste of what working was like.
good,It was a good job to have but it was just certain things that made me feel uncomfortable working there besides I feel like I can take my customer service skills somewhere else
good,Its hard communication  and technology in this job. Corporate  don't give direct information that you need to help situation. Over all I love the job fir as customers
good,"Working in retail you are always on your toes, patience and good customer service is required for the job. There is always something to learn everyday."
good,Work environment is great and always something to do with store being so busy throughout the day. Shift coverage is always exceptional and you are not left alone during a busy day.
good,Could use some upgrades in the business as a whole. Outdated cash registers and poor pay for such a large company. Other than that the routine is pretty solid. And the ability to become management is very fair.
good,"You get an unrealistic list of tasks they expect you to accomplish. You're expected to work single-coverage for hours, and you're still expected to get the task done."
good,Tough dealing with the general public sometimes.  You won't have super duper management.  Hours are somewhat flexible.  Lots of stocking and other trivial tasks.
good,Good Beginner job for people without major responsibilities. Stocking was enjoyable and productive when done before store opening. Hours were flexible. This is the end of my review.
good,You don't get many hours and the pay isn't great. Employees are usually pretty cool though. Management is pretty chill and everyone is nice enough that if you need a ride someone will usually give you one.
good,Overall the experience was okay .. but I needed better benefits & pay to keep up with my daily life and they were very limited on staffing so it was somewhat difficult to keep the balance between personal and work life.
good,"I had only applied to the dollar general store because my other job was on a lay off. So I only worked one week, I did not have enough time there to accurately have an opinion."
good,The biggest downfall and disappointment to work for this company is the favoritetizum and certain District Managers feeling there superior and always better than you to where they will literally do anything to stop feeling intimidated by you to the point they set you up to get rid of you.  9 years...
good,Thier are no benefits for employees that are not a shift manager. Get paid 7.25 I feel we do to many jobs in one to be getting paid 7.25 you have to stock shelves and work the cashier by yourself unless you have an issue then you call the manger or if the line is getting backed up even though it's weekly your living check to check and it's really not worth it I loved working for dollar general but you can't come up
good,"While the people I worked with were nice for the most part and the customers are pretty friendly. Nothing compares to the way corporate runs this place. You will learn fast that corporate has no idea on how to run this place. For starters they treat the employees like trash, poor hours, poor wage, no more room for advancement, what else can I say."
good,At the time I worked there we had outdated registers that would always crash. There were no labels for the isles. Practically had to hold the customer's hand and lead the way. Lots of theft. AC controlled by corporate. No breakroom or real place to relax.
good,As a manager at Dollar General I had to make sure the money was correct before every shift. I had to help customers with any questions or help vendors with any questions. I counted the money every morning and every night. Also making sure the store was clean and stocked.
good,It wasn't a bad job slow i like working with my hands and being out side but my co workers liked me the customers too just wasnt enough there for me i found it to be boring and the promotions are not worth it
good,You don't get paid enough for everything you do. you dont get enough hours and it all depends on where you at and where they want you. It's not the greatest job but its good for a start out job.
good,I can not say this for all managers but my current manager is fair and compassionate. The most enjoyable part is working with customers. The hardest part is difficult customers.
good,I like all of the people I work with as well as management. I’d like better pay and more hours though. I can’t possibly pay my bills on 20 hrs per week.
good,Friendly co-workers were available when help is needed. The scheduling can get out of hand. The training I experienced was bismal and had to figure things out as I worked along. I was trained by 4 different people including my manager at the time and was not properly trained on closing. A lot of tasks were needed to be finished and I did what I could to keep up.
good,Fun working there just didn’t get many hours and rude employees. I loved the customers and meeting new people. I’m a hard worker and like to get my job done
good,"Dollar General was my first job. I enjoyed it. Although some of the higher management in my opinion wasn't the greatest, the store managers I worked with were and still are great Managers."
good,They need to worry more about service then their numbers.The places are always understaffed.They expect numerous job tasks done while you are trying to maintain good customer service.Always had to work thru my breaks due to being management.
good,"1. When i first got to work i clocked in then i signed into the cash register that i was assigned too and if it wasn't busy i helped stock the shelves until i had a customer or it got busy."
good,This job was a great job as I finished my college degree as it was part time allowing me time for my studies. This job was a great way to learn how to interact with the public.
good,"I came in the company as an assistant manager with high hopes of moving forward and getting my own store. I didn't mind the work at all because I have warehouse, customer service, and management experience which works perfectly with the job...but dollar general is always asking you to cut hours, but get more work done....how??? Most of the time I was in the store by myself. Customers constantly back and forth to the register so it was very difficult to pull away and get your other work completed. My manager was never at the store because they don't have to clock in and out, but when they aren't there...it really shows in how the store operates. All of the stores in my district was constantly getting robbed and upper management didn't care (because they don't have to be in the stores) they were only worried about who was coming in to work the rest of the day or opening the store the next day....I enjoyed my fellow coworkers though, we were like family, and you also get use to your regular customers, they end up becoming like family as well. Good luck!"
good,Couple of things you you must be able to do when working for Dollar General. First you must be able to do assigned duties and second you must be able to do those duties and work with the customers that need the help. Overall a good company to work for and it is easy to advance up with the company.
good,Great place to work loved the costumers needed more hours but over all I Loved it  needed more help on truck days. Needed more help for stocking and inventory
good,I really enjoyed working at Dollar General. The pay and hours weren’t that great though. At first they give you a lot of hours but then gradually give you less and less.
good,"Loved working there but Expectations of a store manager are too high and I burned out after 3 1/2 yrs, Long days, not enough days off to spend with family. Not enough hours given to run the store."
good,I liked the work atmosphere and they pay was pretty decent compared to other companies. Managment was good and think they could have done a little better on the hiring... attitude adjustments would be nice for some of the staff at that store.
good,My typical work day is stocking the shelves with overstock items. I have learned alot from this company. Management is ok.i enjoy the job all around. Ok.
good,If your a single person this job is for you. You will have to work nite. Depending on the store manager and how they operate the store your either going to bust you hump to get stock up or everyone will be working on truck day.
good,It was smooth sailing and the best job I’ve had for the first couple months but then we had some people hired that brought the store down a lot and made it miserable. So the company and the at the time store manager we’re amazing. Just hired a few bad people that didn’t wanna work as a team.
good,"I have enjoyed my experiance with Dollar General. I did like getting paid weekly, however it was never enough hours. I know we can voulnteer at other stores. They are set up differently"
good,"I enjoyed working at my main store and was able to work well with my coworkers and my manager. However, I was often asked to go to different locations. I was compensated for travel expenses. I noticed that the work environments, expectation, breaks, and requirements vary widely depending on the thoughts and attitudes of the manager of the store."
good,My hardest part was being in Cashiers that i didn't sign up for.. I only good with doing stocking is type of job that i joy with that experience in past worked.
good,I love my new manager! He has turned our store around. The customers can drive you crazy if you are not strong in the mind. Quick advancement didn’t take me long to be promoted.
good,It was minimum wage. Got paid weekly but even though i worked full time it felt as if my checks just weren't enough money to live off of. My first check was only 200$.
good,"It seems like I won the manager lottery, he was very nice, helpful, and understanding. He worked hard and you could tell he cared about his job. Honestly, if I got better hours, I would have stayed. But if I were to get any hours, I would have had to work weekends, and late nights, and as a single mother of a 3 month old, I just cant. I tried to work it out with my manager, but he just didn't have the hours I needed. As for the pay, I think that if this isn't your first job, you should be paid more than minimum wage."
good,Merchandisng job requires a lot of travel. Communication could be better.  Have to work when you are sick.  Remodel merchandisers work 2 weeks off 5 days.
good,As my first job I had no complaints I learned alot from them and I  it as a first job also liked the friendly environment also how the work culture-was
good,"I worked for General for 3 years while in high school and college. My work hours were flexible and I always got along with management so I have no ill words for them. I was even promoted after only a year and change to keyholder. "
good,"the company asks for to many roll ups,they micro manage to much"
good,My old manager was wonderful.Job was great.After manager left the store went downhill.I believe that the district manager should be more involved when the store was in termal.Overall is a nice place to work..
good,It was ok I just wasn’t getting enough hours to pay my bills. It was a lack of training for people who was new. Like they did know how to do some or what to do when there no costumes around.
good,"Waiting on customers cleaning and straighten  the store, and running a register. The hardest part of the job is putting up stock"
good,Work here if you have no work experience or want to find a long term career in retail with a less than decent income. Not many opportunities to advance in terms of wage.
good,A job that you can catch onto quickly because you repeat the same tasks everyday. The manager that I personally worked under complied with my schedule and made sure that I had enough hours on the schedule.
good,"As a store manager. You are on salary therefore you are responsible for all shifts to be covered.  If there is a call out and noone to cover that shift the store manager has to work. The store manager can be in the building 2 to 4 days a week open to close 15 18 hours a day depending on what time the store manager went in that morning.  Dollar General is a great company they need to work on their stocking and Instock strategy.  One person should never be in the store alone and expect to cover the front of the store (run the register, take care of  the vendors, plus stock the store, etc.) The company needs to arrange the hours per store not by market. If the store is up from 114% to 135% a week. The hours should to be where the store can be maintain successfully and be able to take care of the customers at the same time."
good,Productive place of work. Dollar General needs more hours to each store so each employee can get their tasks done. I do not like only having one person at night.
good,"I lived working there but things where crazy with my life.. And I had missed days due to my children, and having home visits that where court ordered.. And I just wanna be able tip start back to work with this company again because I loved it.."
good,I enjoyed working here it was a opportunity for me to get the bills paid I was able to juggle being a single mom and raising my kids. It was close by and super convienent.
good,"I actually became ill at The Dollar General Store. Unbeknownst to me, I had a malignant tumor in my brain that required the removal of the tumor, 9 months of chemotherapy, 30 rounds of radiation, multiple donor blood to to rebulid my white blood cells, physical, occupational and speech therapy to defeat the cancer that took up up residency with in me and yet, the district manager continued to call the me to ask when am I coming back to work."
good,"My manager at Dollar General was overall a very good manager. She understood that we all have lives and need time/days off every once in a while for other things. I did not like that I was told I would be paid $8 an hour but then 2 weeks into the job, I was cut back to $7.50. I also didn’t like that I only worked 2-3 days a week and some weeks only worked 1 day! This made my check only $50 for a whole week! In this case, why even bother driving to/from work? The cherry on top, I hated the actual job itself. So glad I decided to leave!"
good,Most people need at least 40 hours a week at minimum wage. In order to maintain living situations. When I worked there I rarely got over 20. Was willing to work more n do more and the store needed it but they cut costs/loss on the employees by giving low hours. They hire a bunch of people yes but the majority of them pull to few hours making them either having to quit & search of a full time or get a secondary job witch makes things alot more complicated on the employee. Dont wanna miss any of them hours yall or u will b punished instead of helped n reasoned with u will loose more hours n get sent to farther away stores if u miss a few days. I found it laughable when i stopped showing up and they starting warnings n such n im like this place isnt even providing much for me anyway i was still living with nothing (asfar as money). But the managers look like they pull around 40 or so. Any way would only recommend for a spouse as far as hours go if the other is at a main steady 40 hr week job.. Then it might b profitable.
good,"This is a good place to work if you can handle standing for long  periods of time and doing heavy lifting. "
good,I would work there again if i have too it was a job the hours was great .Dollar General was a great place to work .I learned alot working at Dollar General i was doing shipping and pulling order sometime if needed i would work 2 shifts ....
good,Not a bad place to work. Kind of stressful when others don't do their duties. Like working there and really like my supervisor. She's a excellent boss and works extremely hard.
good,Once was great to work for. District managers and regional managers come and go and treat you different based on their experience not your work. If you aren't a kiss but with uppers they look down on you and treat you bad. Plus they lie to benefit them.
good,I was able to move up very quickly. I loved my job but was unable to keep the job due to medical reasons.  I learned a lot from this company on how to be a better manager as well as a more dynamic sales representative. I miss the job and the people. Hope to find another company that I can grow and learn to love as I did this one.
good,Goin In to work everyday at dollar general was very interesting because of the different people that would come in some would tell crazy stories about their lives.  Work at dollar general tout me to be more open to people out looks on people perspective
good,"I enjoyed working. I enjoyed my job and interacting with the customers and most of the employees. The physical work required just wasn't worth the pay. In between shifts all I could do was recover from the previous day and even though being productive felt great, this particular job was breaking down my body."
good,My experience with working at Dollar General Market is a nice to place to work with when I started. I realized that they  cut my hours from half to two hours since my third month working there and continued to do so. This is also mentioned that they can only give about a few days a week to fit. I am not saying that this company is terrible but I worked probably enough that I don't want to work there forever.
good,I liked working here at first but as time went in it started to Demibish it was not that fu. To come to work everyday I was always stressed and didn’t have enough help
good,They don't give enough payroll to the stores to cover the work that needs done. So managment has to work very hard long hours to keep up with the stores. With not enough pay.
good,"I would rather not comment on Dollar General at this time, I gave my two week notice and walked away with a smile...Not the company they pretend to be...."
good,"I love my job at Dollar General. My coworkers are like family, we would do anything for one another. The problem is it's not exactly a stable work week. Some weeks you get up to 50 hours, and sometimes its maybe 20. Unless you want to relocate, there's basically no chance in getting promoted. You start out at minimum wage with a quarter raise a year. No health insurance, sick days or vacation days. However, I enjoy my job."
good,Working there was a nice place to work at. I had a lot of learning experience and it is a very good working environment just need more hours and more pay.
good,Dollar General was a very good place to work back then. customers started getting mean over the years and they were getting robbed a lot. got scary to leave at night when manager left to 4 flat tires one night. never seen so much theft in my life.
good,Dollar General is a growing company with lost of growth potential. I enjoyed my 10 yrs of service. I disagree with the terms of my departure and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to start a career in retail
good,"It was a great place to work, hard working team great customers.The goal was to get the work tasks done daily and thats what we did. Great managers they treated employees fair."
good,"As a store manager you have the greatest amount of responsibility of all management in the company. Very fast paced, lots of hats to wear and juggle. My last DM was very good at his job and very supportive. But not all were."
good,Working at Dollar General was a good work place.I feel like we could have had better management.I also love the people i worked with.They where very nice.
good,I enjoyed working for them other than working 6 days a week. I found the company a little cheap.  One of my associates resigned with adequate notice and they did not pay out her vacation pay when she left.
good,"I would only recommend this employer to retired individuals or those that need a minimum amount of hours.The management are nice and respectful, but the pay and amount of hours are not liveable. The job is mostly easy with customer interaction alongside running a cash register and stocking merchandise."
good,"Love the job, co-workers, and customers; but on the pay and hours I can't make it raising a child alone. Flexible work schedule. Works around special events in your life."
good,"Manager was top notch. Schedule rotated frequently. Hoursnwere decent. Merchandise discounts were a plus. And, the opportunities for management positions were always available."
good,You stock products while checking out customers so you have to make sure you are paying attention to everything. Its a good place to first start working.
good,"it is ok to work there, the prices are cheaper then most places and there is a variety of items to choose from. they usually have cute stuff for the holidays"
good,Pretty flexible but not enough hours. Barely make 100 a week on minimum wage. Very easy for the town I was in while working with dollar general. Everyone knows each other. Manager was probably the best worker I've ever seen.
good,you are very busy from time you go to work til time you leave. there is not enough hours alloted for the staff to get their job done appropriately and on time. staff is usually easy to get along with. you work around alot of people obviously so you need to be able to get along with people well.
good,Dollar General is a fast paced inviroment. There is always a lot of work and no hours for help. The benefits are great for management staff. Not so great for part time staff.
good,"I worked for dollar general for 6 months it was very steady, but the hours would not be much as i would only work about 12 hours a week. The management would sometimes be bad, as sometimes the assistant managers would not be cooperative. If i would need help at the register, one would say they were always too busy to help and to do it on my own even though it required management access."
good,"I worked at a Dollar General very close to my home, so I had no commute which made the low pay and sometimes late nights much easier to handle. At the store I worked at, we had a great, awesome manager and assistant manager! So, if I didn't have them leading me and supporting me, I would not have been so happy there. In my 11 months employed there part time, I was offered a promotion two different times. First, after the first 2 months or so, I was offered the assistant manager position, then a few months after that I was offered a lead cashier position. I declined both offers because the pay increase did not make sense to me for what was expected of you. I didn't want to give up the daytime cashier position I had at minimum wage, for a few dollars more and a lot more responsibility (for assistant mngr) and also declined for the lead cashier position because the pay only increased by .60.... so, all in all I was happy there due to the management, clean environment of a new store, and the regular customer you get to know. The hardest part was swallowing the low pay vs. super hard work. And then no recognition, because 'it's just expected of you'. Expectations are very high, almost like slavery, with no incentive unfortunately. That starts to wear on you mentally and it takes a certain type of person to handle the work load. However, if you bring a good attitude it does attract like minded people and if you like working with people, this isn't a terrible job part time."
good,"Working at Dollar General isn't bad, just don't get the idea you will get much hours. Anything above 40 hours can get you fired . Decent pay 8 dollars per hours was good for me. Sadly you get barely over 25 hours each week."
good,This company is a decent company to work for. They will give you opportunities to travel and work in different counties and even states. Work life balance is decent also.
good,The Dollar  General wasn’t a bad place to work. Of course like any other place it had its ups and downs. Definitely if you are looking for a job you can progress in Dollar General is a great place to start.
good,our regional manager sucked but in store we had a great time. small store small staff makes for fun times. sometimes i miss those days. i don't know what else to right on this.
good,"My biggest issue with working for Dollar General is the outdated computer systems. We have new sales every week, and a lot of products don’t ring up the correct price so it causes inconvenience for both customers and employees. The digital coupons have a lot of flaws as well. If dollar General would update their computer systems and put a little money into the business I believe it would make a huge difference in customer satisfaction. Also the cashiers are under paid for the amount of work they are required to do."
good,It was okay working there at first until I went into management and then it got stressful when hours got cut and we became short staff. Severely. Otherwise it’s a great environment.
good,Good job for a working college student. Keeps you on your toes—and on your feet for sure. Gets you in the mind of good work ethics to make sure customers are well taken care of.
good,It's was a ok place to work. It would have been a better place if the GM was doing her job the right way.The down fall was that she wasn't holding her team accountable .
good,"In my experience of working up at Dollar General, it is like any other grocery store. You have your typical customers and co worker with you. It's just that everything wasn't going well with ours at the time and no one got along with each other."
good,Dollar General was a safe and secure place to work. I would recommend this job to one of my friends. The pay was good and most of the managers were nice.
good,I learned to have a positive and productive attitude dealing with unhappy customers that lighting them up and change they attitude into leaving happy with my service. i learn to work at a fast enough pace and was very well at keeping the store clean and up to part especially as a team worker.
good,"Be prepared to sweat the job provides good pay but they work you until you’re exhausted. It’s really fast pace if you’re an order picker. The job has really great benefits, you just work 24/7"
good,"Dollar general was a great place to build a retail career. I learned so much through this company."
good,Lot of potential. Exciting place to work. Room for advancement. Competitive hours. Good benefits. I learned a lot working at Dollar General and I enjoyed my time there.
good,A day of work is making the customers feel welcome and have a neat and organized store. Helping the customer by ask for assistance. I've learned to always have a customers satisfy and to be always a help to any problem. The management is alright the workplace culture is a helpful environment. What I do is basically easy and the most enjoyable part will be a customer leaving with a smile.
good,Dollar general warehouse was a good place to work when I first started. Over 6 months I was given an opportunity to train people in my department. The work was not that difficult it was the people that made it very difficult.
good,Your expected to do a list of things plus whatever wasn't done before you started your shift. Customers vary between sweet/patient and unreasonable/demanding.
good,"I love my job I love my costumers and coworkers, I enjoy running the register and greeting and interacting with the costumers. It's not a hard job at all. My manager's cool too ."
good,"Great place to work if your not married with no kids."
good,a typical work atmosphere
good,You take on more roles than the one you're assigned. Must be very productive coming into this job. One non-productive can cost you a week. One week can cost you a month and so on and so forth.
good,A good environment to work in good benefits meeting new people every day. Always some thing new .a lot of hard work but also very rewarding.the customers were the great part you always have a lot of thank you from all.
good,This job is very hard on a persons body!  Would be nice if they had hired additional help with working freight.  Enjoyed my co-workers.  Work schedule was flexible.
good,I really liked my job and working with the puplic and the other employees there. There was always something to do but it wasn't like you were repeatedly doing the same things.  I just felt I could make more money somewhere else.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Most of the customers are regulars that live in the area and you get to know them and there families. I get along with all the employees except for one. Working here is not bad usually busy so the time goes by fast. I enjoy interacting with the customers and employees. If you want to move up there are opportunities.  The bad thing is they don't pay enough for the work you are expected to do. More concerned with profits than they are with giving people hours or better pay. So turn over is high and instead of paying people better the attitude is just keep hiring people. Another thing is as a manager there is no true lunch break. A manager has to be in the store at all times so you can't leave and get away for a few. You also have to go up to the register while on break for voids, returns, complaints and other things all while you are not on the clock. If they paid more I would stay have a job lined up 6 more dollars a hour plus full time. Learned a lot working here and really don't mind the work but the only reason why a person works is to make money and there are plenty of places that pay more. Been here close to a year."
good,"A strong background in handling, customer service. It was a 24 hr a day for running the store. I provided support to my customers, store team, corporate and to other store managers in my area. You each one to have a great store."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people and helping others.  My co-workers were easy to get along with.  Running the cash register was fairly simple, but some of the other duties were tough sometimes."
good,I liked some of the customers and my managers just wasnt getting paid enough or getting enough hours .and i like my co-workers when they was actually doin there job.
good,"A fast pace environment, great for a high school student. You really don't get many hours and the pay is only 7.25 in my area with the cost of living that's really nothing."
good,The dollar General I work at is going through some ups and downs once we some people in there that want to work it will be ok. It's an easy job but the pay could be better
good,"a typical day is me stocking and cleaning the store to make it look presentable for customers. additionally, i count money and lock up the store at night."
good,"They except their employees to work more hours then they actually should being a salary employee, I love working there, but the new DM is making it very hard to enjoy it, and everyday he tells me I can be terminated"
good,"Worked a lot of hours, some days with no help.  Loved the customers and employees.  A very hard company to work for.  Especially for the managers, had to be there almost everyday."
good,"Enjoy developing people."
good,Boss was cool and on to things making sure the items and the store is stocked and cleaned. Minimum wage pay and the cashier had to clean and stock everynight not good because ot takes up a lot of time when your schedule to leave at a time i mean we would want to go home at the end of our shift. Needs to have only stock do stock and cashier do cashier.
good,"Opening and closing the store ,cleaning talking care of customer."
good,"Dollar General is a slow-paced work environment. They make low pay, and the management is unorganized. I learned how to stock, and organized shelves properly."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dollar General. the only thing that was uncomfortable about the job, was lack of security. but other than that it was a great job. I learned lots of things under a year, and moved my way up pretty quick. I had a lot of responsibility on my shoulders since I was being relied on most of the time. "
good,I have worked there and can do the job I would be the best worker I can do over time and help out in different ways we need to works as a team and help each other when on the job
good,"I hadn't worked anywhere else prior to this, so it was fine for the time being, but corporate were very unprofessional and didn't care about anyone that wasn't management. My experience with the management I worked for was good at first, but it turned sour very quickly. I most likely wouldn't work for the company again unless I absolutely needed to."
good,decent work environment with potential to advance. good training for retail managers and or store merchandisers. relocation possible. compensation could be better.
good,"Even just being a cashier I had a lot of different things to do. Run register, recover, and stock at the same time. I feel as though all the work is underpaid and we should be paid more for how much work is being done by one person. I loved who I worked with and my boss was very nice."
good,"Great place to get experience but the hours are long and the pay is minimum. Hard work lifting heavy boxes and dealing with ungrateful customers."
good,I really struggle with money but I love working outside . Working inside is not really what I like doing at all I’ve always loved being outside and dolled general was an inside job.
good,Fun place to work good hours just got to much for me to handle with all the stuff that was going on in my life also my old team was lovely and loyal to the bone so it made the day better but now there gone and the new ones are subs but there just ....I don't  know how to explain. Srry
good,"This company has 13,000+ stores nationally and therefore enforces restrictions and standards across the board. Requests for flexibility to accommodate local matters are denied or ignored including safety issues."
good,i enjoyed dollar general it was very fun work place.it was not very much room for advancement and the pay was not very promising.i had a very good store manager that made working for the company promising.
good,As far as retail goes it is a pretty standard setup. They do cross train you into multiple positions to help cover the very spread thin shifts. Your schedule is given a week or two ahead of time and they may have you help out at other nearby locations.
good,"It was okay while it lasted. Then it became stressful, then I was the only one there doing everything because the people who were supposed to be on shift were late."
good,"The benefits were way over priced (there are discounts for non smokers). I was full time, but I rarely got full time hours because corporate continuously cut hours and projected payroll. There are serious consequences for stores that go over budget even if overtime is approved by the higher ups for special occasions. They cut our hours Christmas week, the busiest time of the year, to make up for the extra hours that had been approved for inventory earlier that year. Customers generally get mad at the cashier for being slow, instead of at corporate for not giving out enough hours"
good,very busy need improvement in management bad need paid sick days different from vacation time need new lift trucks stop changing the way to work  need to let the worker know more on the workload an the direction of the company
good,"work at fast pace and organize shelf and conduct yourself with manner to customer, able to lift over 50 pound, able to stand to do your work,been on time was a must and always keeping a smile on your face,greet customer with a wonderful smile and always say thanks and come back"
good,"This is a fast pace, customer service job.  If you like to work and make customers happy, this is a great place to work.  Most Sales associates arr part time, and management works a lot of hours.  But most of the teams work well together and get the work done.  Good support from upper management."
good,"I found myself constantly behind schedule on a long list of never-ending tasks. "
good,"Working at Dollar general can be fun it will most definitely keep you on your toes all of my employees are wonderful productive workers,that respect the work environment and each other."
good,I loved my job at dg. Great work environment with understanding and respectful coworkers. Alot of hours to work which meant not alot of balance between job and family.
good,"It was a retail job, the work is never hard or bad but the customers are. While working there I felt like I was part of the team and that makes the the day more enjoyable."
good,The managment wasn’t all that great at dollar general but the customers made everything better. It was a fun place to work but I did not like the hours.
good,"We began new store set up without the store manager she was out on a medical leave. We worked long hours putting up shelves, following plan-o-grams, checking in stock, training employees, and filling shelves. The store was located in a nice small town where people are not scared to work. The store was a great asset to the neighborhood and it was a pleasure working there."
good,I really working with dollar general. my favorite part was getting to work with my customers daily and building a friendship and bond with my regulars. The worst part of the job was when people would call out i was always the one to get called in but that was mainly because the manager who always took weekends off and gave her favorites the days off they wanted.
good,"working for them was a great experience until i got married and had a child. They tote the idea of a good work life balance but do not hold up their end.  If someone is single, with no children, it is a great place to advance at."
good,"The job itself was okay I learned more about customer satisfaction ,computer skills, inventory control o went from a cashier to manager in less then six months the down fall was the store getting robbed"
good,"Slow-paced, easy environment"
good,"Dollar General is a very fast paced place to work. Overall it's a pretty decent place to work. Being it is retail, things are always changing with the different seasons. You have to be prepared for change!"
good,Fun work atmosphere. Fun coworkers. Customers were fun sometimes. Overall store are easy to work in. Once you get use to where everything is it's a simple job.
good,"A good company for a first time job position or as a second job for a little extra income. They are not very competitive as far as pay rates unfortunately, but you can learn a lot and there is some minimal room for advancement."
good,"Some days are relaxed and fun, while stocking days or weekends can be stressful. Overall, it is a fun job, but I see no career benefits or any other benefits coming for me in the future, at least not for a couple years."
good,I love my job I had five manager from the time I started to I got fired. The manager that we got last was very ruled she made up a lie to get me fired
good,Supervising and operating 20 to 30 stores.  Communication with my managers and their personal on a daily basis.  Ensure training and follow up with each store.
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General in Clarkdale AZ.  I was unable at the time to balance work and school as my hours kept increasing. I was unable at the time to properly communicate to my manager.
good,Unless you are the general manager. The pay is low and tends to stagnate. Bonuses do not really affect anyone but the manager and district manager. Workload for shift managers is not worth the low pay.
good,Learned a lot of retail.  Good experience.  Hours erratic.  Too many chiefs.Running back and forth from register to aisles was aggravating and exhausting.
good,typical day at dollar general the morning would be spent restocking shelves and putting delivery trucks away the rest of the day would be cashing out customer purchases cleaning and refreshing stock as needed.
good,"I like working here but it's just a job that I took because I was having difficulty getting a reasonable job in my selected field. What I do is recover product shelves, stock beer and milk, sweep and mop floors. Remember, I only took this job because I had just recovered from an illness and needed to prove that I could handle working again."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at DG just the management was not to sharp on people that really did their jobs. I have been to DG that you cant even walk in cause there are rotainters all over the store, boxes every where but they have a daily and weekly plan that if you follow you will run a productive store, like I did"
good,"I didn't mind working at DG, my manager was fun, and the work, though tough at times, wasn't too much. The district managers were my main turn off. They expected far more from everyone in the store than anyone could handle. That is why staff is constantly changing there, they rotate them like stock."
good,"Fast pace and demanding with a high turnover rate. Easy to talk with management; but, slow to implement. Some friendly coworkers and lots of stocking required."
good,"If you like flexible work hours, or have obligations or need a foot in the work place, DG could be a match.  The only real issue I have had is that work hours at full time don't always match what is signed up for (meaning sometimes PT hours are a thing even when there are FT benefits).  If you like working and helping people, this is also a good thing."
good,"A typical day of work would consist of checking customers out, keeping work areas clean and neat, balancing money drawers, restocking shelves. I learned a lot about dealing with every type of customer. It helped me learn very quickly about the types of people you have to deal with in the world (customers and coworkers). I feel like management for the most part was okay. I feel like they had their favorite people (just like any job), and I feel that sometimes they took me for a joke because I was practically the youngest one there. I feel like non of my complaints nor the customer's complaints really mattered to them. The most enjoyable job was that I was able to scan the Items and learn how to work the cash register. It assisted me later on when I went on to work with Wells Fargo."
good,"Ive been with dollar general for 4 years now, it is a very high volume store and there is really no time to sit down its always busy you can not get everything done that you need too"
good,Nice place to work . Nice employees to work with. The floors hurt your feet. Don't know what else to say to say. Alot of people stolen stuff from the store.
good,Dollar General was a fairly stress free work place but the opportunity for advancement seemed to be very limited. The pay wasn't acceptable even for a manager with over 10 years experience
good,On a typical day you get a lot of customers. There is one person in the front and you have to multitask with each customer. Sometimes you have no help and you have to think about each situation and how to handle them.
good,cool when slow not to bad but when busy and lack of staff makes the job a lot more stressful and hard to stay claim and focus but the paid is very reasonable
good,I enjoyed the regular customers and enjoyed learning to do things differently. Management was good as far as keeping overtime to a small amount. I enjoyed the job
good,dollar general is a nice friendly atmosphere customers are nice and understanding however there are just not enough hours available to make ends meet.
good,Fast paced a lot is expected bit you get paid good and 3 days off most weeks. Some weeks you have to work 5 days but the over time is well worth it. You will be sore everyday for a few months
good,great place to work. You get to meet new people and learn how to be positive and respectful to others. Teaches you to have patience and how to have great customer service.
good,"there is always something to do."
good,"Working at Dollar General wasn't all bad. There were some fun times as long as you have a good staff. The upper management was the problem. They will assign tons of work to do around the stores, especially during holiday seasons, but then cut back on the hours allotted to bring people in to help get things done."
good,"Great job for those who want to break their back doing a workload that would otherwise take 4 people. Management is extremely nice though, and is easy to move up in the corporation."
good,"Management is forced to work crazy hours due to lack of budgeted hours. As a store manager, you have to basically live in your store in order for it to continue to meet company standards. They're constantly having last minute, big visits. It's very stressful. Store's that have been robbed multiple times are still put on the back burner as a ""things happen"" incident."
good,I was there when all employees that were not management were cut to part time. I had to tell people that had been there 20 years that they were doing away with their jobs the first week I was there. They did not give you enough hours to operate a grocery store. That is why the lines are always so long.
good,"What I learned is you cant please everyone just do your job the best you can and make as enjoyable as possible, youll have customers that are just down right rude for no reason"
good,i started out stocking shelves then i became a cashier again. I always helped the customers find anything they needed. Im the kind of person who likes to help people
good,"The Management position is stressful and competitive. They require a lot of paperwork and time, as well as physical labor. I enjoyed working with the staff and customers, but the company itself has to improve. Since leaving I have kept in contact with many store managers, they state the company still have not improved enough to create a positive work environment for their managers."
good,"I worked there as a second job to make a little extra money, it was nice for what I was using it as. Fast pace, however management wasn't the best. That was do the the management at that specific store."
good,The staff are very helpful as is my manager but the overall job was poor. pay was low and the inconsistent hours are a definite downfall and no discounts.
good,Dollar general is a very stressful place to work. I liked it for the most part. the other employees were awesome. some of the customers were very rude and that was difficult to deal with at times.
good,"The hardest part was unloading trucks""and dealing with rude customers.And not having enough help when other employees don't want to do there job the right way!"
good,Always hiring and can not keep good employees. Manager changed every 6 months. More worried about employee theft then customer theft. Store is under staffed and always messy. No support from upper management such as DM. My store was robbed twice. Scary place to be.
good,"Not a bad place to work, it really depends on the Store Manager. Very fast pace place to work. I Love my store. The staff I worked with was great and very polite."
good,"The customers are nice that come in, but some of the assistant managers are not. There is always work to be done do that is good. The Head manager was quiet and was barely seen."
good,Its a good first time job if you still live at home with family and you dont have to pay for anything.  I had to leave do to relocation but if I still worked there I would probably still be making minimum wage.
good,"typical day at work at dollar general is coming in and clocking in , count your drawer, open your register and ring up customers and stock the shelves"
good,Every job has its ups and downs. The main thing I do not like is that I get left alone for hours on end and it is terrifying to think what if someone comes in and robs the place...
good,it a good place to work at it just i was making minimum wadge i want a full-time job that pays more and more hours the manger was cool and the other employees were to
good,I learned how to open and close the store. I also helped customers find merchandise they was looking for. Carried they bags out to their car the ones that needed help.
good,Dollar General is what you make of it you will either sink or swim the choice is yours.  Dollar General is very busy and a lot of working alone.   You need to make it your priority
good,"Loved setting planograms, Hardest part is having to put out stock everyday. Easiest part is running the cash register. I enjoyed fronting all of the products."
good,I liked the job but I'm not the type of person that's so drama. Dollar general was my first weekly paying job and the weekly pay was actually good to relie on.
good,My coworkers where great.I learned how to pick and stock.But the managers where not cooperative with the coworkers as they should be.And the workplace culture was okay.The hardest part of the job is when you go up to ur supervisor and suggest something unsafe and them ignoring you.I enjoyed the people cause after so many years you treat them like family.
good,Okay store. It was my first retail store so i learned the basic in retailing store was barely clean and the items were never stocked up leaving with lots of angry customers
good,"The employees are usually great. The company doesn't trust you. The company will not allow adequate staffing to increase sales and lower shrink. Most of the time there are only two people working, which can be a safety issue. And forget about an uninterrupted break."
good,"Fun environment and enjoyed getting to know the customers. You always have to be on yours toes with people coming in and out cause you dont know if they are their to shop, steal, or rob the place  Only down fall I had was dealing with people that would steal. Some of the work can be difficult but some of the work can be easy."
good,if the key carrying person liked you everything was wonderful.  Learned about there ways of resetting floor merchandise.  Not the best location in the world but some customers were exceptionally nice to be around.
good,Had a great time working here. But my chances for advancement are not going the way I would like. I have been working hard for 2 and a half years to move to the next step and others keep getting to opportunity I have been trying so hard for.
good,I've work in two different DG's with 2 different positions. Overall both experiences were fantastic. The only downside is if you're unlucky and don't get decent coworkers.
good,"Would recommend this job to anyone,  fun work environment.  The management team are very professional. Enjoyed the different areas i worked. Learned more on how to manage a store."
good,Working at dollar general is an ok job for a person that still lives with there parents and doesn't have to pay rent . However for someone who has children and bills to pay I recommend some other place.
good,"I was 1 of 2 asst. managers at the time of my employment and we where overworked with a significant lack of any help.  We where not given the ability to properly repremand poor work ethic and behavior making it almost impossible to be productive.  More time was being spent on trying to get people to show up keeping me from executing things like plan-o-grams, and displays in a timely manner.  I loved seeing the before and afters when I was able to complete such tasks. My homelife suffered because of the over hours I had to stay simply to find time to work on managment duties."
good,I need a job so i can pay my half of rent. I am attending tulsa welding school i go to school from 1-6. I will be attending the achool for 7 months ill b finish in February
good,"This was my first job, so take everything with a grain of salt."
good,"I loved my job at Dollar General, but everything was very unorganized, and there is not enough employs scheduled at one time to get everything done, that's needed to get done."
good,Could be a fun place to work depending on your management. Great place to learn and get your feet wet in the retail industry.  Very fast paced environment with no room for breaks.  DG allows 1 lunch break in a 8 hour period when other companies allow 1 to 2 breaks in between lunch.  I believe employees could be far more productive if more breaks were authorized. Other than that benefits aren't the greatest but it's a basic coverage and affordable to employees. Store Managers are under compensated for the work loads and hours they have to put into their stores. With a higher salary DG can gain much better management to run their stores and require no less than an AA Degree instead of a high school diploma.
good,"Dollar General is a great place to start if you are on a path to becoming anything that has to deal with Sales Associate or Store Managing. It takes time to move up but even quicker to get fired, as Dollar General does whatever they can to help bring in the right employees."
good,"I started off with 16-27 hours a week and it's dropped down to 4-8 hours a week. I've asked my manager why my hours are being cut so bad and she said it's because the store has recieved less hours to give us since the college kids are out. It's absolutely insane. It's a fun place to work, but it's hardly even worth the sucky pay. Looking for a new job."
good,I had a lot of wonderful customers who really made my day enjoyable. I had the opportunity to make life long friends while doing my job. The store in Gilman Illinois needs to be much bigger.
good,"Job security and opportunity to moved forward. Depending on store manager, will have detail well educated training. I do feel their pay rates come up short."
good,"Very fast paced, have to multi task. Not a good balance for a someone with young kids. You have to work a 5 1/2 day work week. That half day usually turns into 6. It may be a good fit for someone with older kids , but I wouldn't suggest for someone with young kids, not a store manager."
good,Great for first starting out. Not very good pay.  Management is friendly and you stay busy. You just don't make the money you are working for. And be prepared to work weekends. Whether you want to or not.
good,Its fast passed very demanding and you have no time to spend with your family with a mandatory 6 day work week and a revolving door of employees.  Very much enjoy working with the public
good,"I never could find much to do, so if you're a fan of that this is the place for you. Customers are very impatient, as with any general store job. It was okay"
good,They are always understaffed expected to get at least 4 rotainers of freight an hour while checking out customers.  the store is always dirty can never find anyone to help customers
good,Dollar General is a good company to work for it's usually the other employees that make it worse. That's in any job though. I believe if the supervisors took more time to pay attention to the work that the employees were doing it'd be a better place to work. By that I mean if they took the time to see who was actually doing the work and who wasn't it'd be a better place to work.I was the kind of person who left sweating every night because I spent a lot of time running around making sure everything got done. While others did not do much of anything. Basically I don't think there are penalties if other employees sit around and do nothing. It is also a high stress job for minimum wage. I would work there again if I had to though.
good,"Worked for this company for a while, did everything and some and never got the pay out for it. I was never given a raise that was promised, the management was testy, no real benefits at all for a married individual like myself. The company was close to my house, which was a plus but i did know that i always had a job working with this company, things didn't get bad until i transferred to my Pensacola location from the Texas location. The staff was always awesome to work with minus the few bad apples here and there that caused issues."
good,"Always on the move throughout your whole day, which I enjoyed because I seem to get bored very easily. Friendly type atmosphere with plenty of personality to go around."
good,"stocking shelves, cashier, customer service, vendors, opening and closing store, hiring and firing, keeping store clean, work long hours, pay is not to bad"
good,The company does not care about the managers they just want more from you. You get paid to work 48 hours a week but they want you to work 60 plus nobody should have to work for free.
good,"Great place to quickly advance in retail career and knowledge of retail strategies. Work hours vary dependent upon store and staff.  Hardest part of job is working store with few employees, typically no more than two at a time."
good,"Good place to work, with very friendly coworkers. Everyone gets along well, but there are rarely enough people working to allow for anything less than the employees rushing to get things done."
good,"Must work hard and be dedicated if you want more than part time hours. Easy store to learn the layout. Good system for payroll. Pay is either direct deposit or uploaded to a Money Network card, which is good everywhere."
good,"Dollar General likeoat companies has it's downfalls there is,quite a but I don't agree,with and there are some that I do. The great thing about DG is that we get weekends off all the time and we are off at a reasonable time during the week and we get paid well"
good,"work days were almost all the same, you see the same people come in everyday which is kinda nice. There's a lot of work on register if you're at a busy store and things can get kinda messy and unorganized. Register is probably the hardest and most annoying part of the job as customers tend to be jerks a lot of the time. I enjoyed the presence of my co-workers. They were really nice and made the job more tolerable"
good,"be in charge of the register, help the customers to find things and provide prices, keep the store clean, accomodate merchandise in the store. work in team and help us each other."
good,Running the cash register and helping customers was a typical day. I also had to help run inventory and clean the store. The management was always changing and the store is unorganized and filthy.
good,I learned a lot at my time spent with DG. They were a decent company to work for. The positions always felt like a job not a career. There is a strong sense of pushing the clochard   populous to complacency.
good,"The environment was good but its a place that I only plan to work at temporarily. My typical day at work could go good or bad depending on costumers. Its nothing that has to do with the company, Its just how things go when you work with the public. You have to have lots of patience and remember that the customers are always right."
good,Dollar general is a great place to start your beginning career off. It has taught me things about myself that I never knew. Great customers and great training from co-workers.
good,"I have mixed feelings about this company. In general this company is good to work for if you need a part time job. In the long haul though, this company wouldn't be suitable for anyone with big dreams. It all depends on the manager you have. I've had multiple managers and only one was great. The other one came to work drunk a lot. You don't get any discounts here and the pay is horrible."
good,"On a typical day my job is to watch the register while maintaining other duties that are given to me (Restock, Recover, Clean, Etc.)."
good,Liked the job but not enough hours. Hated being called a liar and a thief that's the reason I quit. Need a job to support my family. Need money for bills and other important things
good,"A typical day is merchandising,stocking,a lot of paper work,assigning daily task to employees. The hardest part of my job is the different personalities of my employees.The most enjoyable part of my day is watching the competition between my stockers.One thing Ive learned is patience with customers."
good,"They won't put you in for a raise even if you deserve it,  and they expect you to drop everything for the hours you aren't supposed to work,  but they do work hard"
good,"Was a fun job , very diverse , a lot to learn and to do . "
good,"Always busy, somewhat flexible hours, something new every day, close to home, no graveyard shift, can quickly move up the ladder.Weekly pay, close to home, made friends with customers."
good,Typical day at work starts at 6 and ends sometimes at 2:30. Very fast paced and you need to keep up. Great trainers to help you and supervisors are generally okay. It is very dusty so allergies will get to you.
good,"A usual day would included projecting the volume that needs to be shipped out that day and how many people in each department it would take. Next I refer to a spreadsheet to see who's turn it is to be moved if necessary. At start time I take attendance and take part in my department's meeting relaying the what projections are and where they need to go. Throughout the day I utilize equilibrium and send employees from ""ahead"" areas to areas that are behind so flow is even. I complete cycle counts and also make adjustments and correct errors. I'm very hands on and help employees complete their tasks when possible. End of shift I plug in what we did and compare it against what was supposed to be done. Finally I'll set up the next doing a rough estimate and a rough roster."
good,The neighborhood that the store was in was horrible lot of theft and I have been assaulted at work. I also had people that was just unruly and mean. It just not the greatest place for a business to be there.
good,"Very physical job. Big on safety, up to date with training. Management is supportive. They will try their best to give you whatever answers they can give you if you need something answered"
good,"I learned a great deal about how to treat my employees and leaned from others how not to treat them. I learned how to become a better person and lead, everyday. I learn my stores as well as my products and customers."
good,Dollar General needs to compensate the employees more and the turn over would not be so great. I enjoyed working there it was a neighborhood store. The people were regulars and very friendly
good,IF you have good management then this job would be great. I would suggest not having kids and working here. Because you don't have a life outside the store.
good,"good management, easy going atmosphere, easy job. "
good,"The pay was minimum wage, even if you have experience in anything they want you to do, so that sucked. The manager was lazy. Our assistant actually got most of the work done."
good,I enjoyed working there it was not bad. I liked the people who came in and the people that worked there. All very nice for the most part. The corporate side is kinda jankity
good,"The store was ok.  Not a lot of employees at first.  Got in and helped hire a crew, trained and had good customer service.  Got stock up quickly and cleaned up the store."
good,It's a decent workplace. Fits my schedule and needs. Customers can be over the top at times and you always have to be on your toes watching for thieves.
good,I love my Job and the people I work with but the pay is killing me I have two kids and making 7.75 is ok but I need to make more money so that I can make my life just a little better for my kids
good,"First retail job as a high school student, worked well with school schedule until after awhile. Hectic days were the easiest days and made time go much faster. Nice staff and management."
good,"Dollar General is very straight and to the point.  The job is very much like what you would imagine from a retail store, handling the cashier, setting up adds, and stocking shelves.  The management, however, can be very lazy and likes to push their tasks on underqualified employees.  With that, though, you do learn a lot more about the job but it gets hard because they like to leave one cash register open and sometimes things get backed up with so many customers."
good,"Jobs is overall easy, and enjoy it. Flexible schedule. Hardest part of the job would be frait. Co-workers are easy to get along with and are friendly."
good,good place to work good people stocking is not to complicated if you have adequate communication skills it would be a good place to work
good,Has opportunities for advancement willing to work with schedule. Hours are very inconsistent.Good atmosphere high turnover rate.
good,"For minimum wage, the job is pretty easy. This is a job for someone who is looking for a second  part time gig or just a little extra money  on the  side."
good,"I enjoyed working with dollar general. The company is friendly and offers good customer service. I received benefits, the only downside was when i got pregnant and the boss found any reason to write me up just to get me out of there because he didn't want to have to have a pregnant Assistant manager the would be gone for leave and him have to hold the position."
good,"One bad thing is the management at the time. Plus they expect you to do too much for too little. I almost lost my girl, I was pregnant. It was lose her or my job"
good,"Enjoyed working here, always something to do. It was a disappointment with the amount of work that is expected, the pay rate does not reflect. Unfortunately one cannot support themselves or their family on that income."
good,I think Dollar General  is a good company to work for but I didnt like the work environment I was working in at all. I felt uneasy everyday at work.
good,Everything is based off of a production rate system and dollar general is normally lenient with the system but at the same time very strict when rate is not reached at 95% or higher within a single work week.
good,"A typical day at work would see me normally check out customers items and work on freight,totes,and recovery if I had the time. At Dollar General I learned he latter as my previous job at Giant Eagle only had me work at checkout with nothing else. Management was somewhat heavy with managers havinf to step in since starting cashiers lacked the ability to perform tasks such as void items and were unable to complete returns without a manager stepping in. The fellow co-workers were somewhat small as a group since even when fully staffed we were often somewhat small as a group. The hardest part of the job came with balancing tasks since even a starting cashier would be asked to complete tasks around the store while trying to keep an eye on customers ready for checkout.The most enjoyable part of the job, however came with interacting with customers which also helped me grow in customer service."
good,"dollar general is a fun place to work but pay terrible. you fun into a lot of people that you've met. the job is almost stress free. some people do get an attitude, but you can be nice to please them."
good,"I wouldn't want to work there no more . there a bad company to work with they give low income,bad management, and unorganized environment."
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking the store, cleaning the store, interacting with customers, and counting money. I learned that retail is a very demanding field, but it is wonderful to interact with many different people. Management is very nice and works well with schedules outside of work. The coworkers are generally good people, though the turnover rate is high. The hardest part is getting the stock out on time."
good,"Dollar general is a very good job for someone without bills, responsibility, kids, anything that takes financial upkeep.. Pay is garbage. So like if you're a high schooler. Management is hit or miss. They're all lazy though."
good,Easy work. Fun environment.  Needs better employees. Stocking and being a casher keeps you busy. You gotta keep a clean and organized working space. Sometimes if you close you're there about a half hour after closing.
good,"Dollar General treats it's employees horrible. The whole company is built on empty threats and promises they can't keep. If they see that a store is struglling, they don't offer to help somehow until the whole store is begging on their knees for help. Upper managers (out of store) are constantly threatening to fire you if you don't get your job done but when you do get your work done they have nothing to say until they can find something else to yell about. The only way you will ever get a decent raise is if you're a fantastic worker who threatens to quit, and even then, your store manager has to beg upper management to allow a raise to be given. Then after the company gives you the raise to keep you around, they go right back to threatening to fire you. The company treats their long-standing employees like animals, constantly trying to convince them to quit or retire, even though the older empoyees do anything they possibly can for the company. They fire their best people who need the job and replace them with people who don't even want to be there in the first place."
good,"Employers are great, company itself doesn't compensate, nor treat their employees well enough. The Hours are crazy, Sometimes you leave work at 11:15 pm, and have to return at 4 am the next day. Work days are sometimes long sometimes short. You sometimes stock shelves, or sometimes run register. You also do various cleaning chores."
good,It is a interesting place to work at. And you get to meet different people.Some of the people were good to work with and then you had just one that was difficult to work with!
good,"I like my job.  A typical day consists of coming in in the morning. I help set up displays outside, stock cigarettes, balance the area around the registers, and do recovery/stocking on the front end of the store.  It's a typical cashier's job; ringing up customers, helping them locate items, stocking/re-shelving items.  I love my co-workers and my boss, they are very supportive and compassionate.  They also are very professional and do their jobs well.  I am very proud to say I work with them at the Dollar General.  The hardest part of my job is being quick at stocking. I'm just a naturally slow person."
good,I helped stock on each Sunday.We would go in around 5:30 latest 6am and get the trucks unloaded and then rest of the day we stocked... I ran the front register when i wasn't helping customers find what they was looking for...
good,"Good training "
good,"Must be good with money handling, fast and hard working.  Great advancement opportunities with the option to travel to different locations.  Training provided."
good,I got wrote up for being 40$ and 5$ over. I then got terminated. In my offense it sucked as my first job. Everyonewanted to laugh but hey I did my job. I did what I had to but minimum wage was not enough to feed my family nor to pay any bills.
good,Dollar General expects way too much out of their Store Managers and do NOT pay enough to other staff members for what is expected of them.
good,I was with this company for under a year before I made store manager if u want a place to advance your career this is the place to do it I started as a pt cashier most of the dms are very understanding and supportive although the turnover for them in really high the pay is great but the hours you have to work to get that pay as a manager is absolutely exhausting you can not have a life outside of work at all the customers always seem to get incredibly irate about things I don't have control over but I guess that's normal for retail it is very hard to find good people because the pay starts at minimum wage at the company still expects a lot even for their cashiers changes could be made to make this company excellent and I hope those changes eventually come because I'm not going anywhere
good,"It was a good Job, definitely for someone who can work independently. Could have been more challenging. Loved my store manager and assistant manager."
good,i work hard for many year because I love my coworkers we have fun where there is none we work and make fun doing so the people that are regulars puts a smile on my face when having a bad day it is a great feeling to be recognized
good,"I really liked working for dollar general, there was plenty of room for advancement. There wasn't really anything too hard about the job, i defiantly learned a lot working for them and i would defiantly do it again."
good,"Clock-in"
good,I started here stocking while in school.. Basic Part time job.. Management was good.. The Co workers were good they were what made the day go by
good,"Always something to do, never a still moment. Customers can be very nice at times or the opposite. Would work there again."
good,"I liked that I became manager quickly but it was a lot for one person to do. They gave you things to do in one day that needed at least 3 people,"
good,The  co workers where friendly they treated everyone alright. company was ok to work for but has very few benefits to the workers.
good,I used to love working for Dollar General. It was my favorite place to work for a while until the GM moved me to a certain location (my last location). I was a manager for almost 5 years and was doing great then I was relocated to this one store. I was told to clean it up and I did. Then they left me alone. What I mean by that is that they stopped coming around and helping me when I asked for the help.
good,"Spend the day re-shelving products, unpacking deliveries, taking count of cigarettes and keeping track of suspicious customers.It's a typical retail job, same repetitive actions daily."
good,Hard labor and long hours. But good pay and benefits. Day consists of picking boxes and dropping them off to shipping very simple job to understand and do.
good,Great place to work. The only reason I left was to enroll and take college classes. The work environment was great and we had a wonderful team.
good,I loved working at DG but at the time the schedule didn't work for my family. It was a very busy work place. There was always something to do. We could of used more help and it was hard to keep help.
good,"A typical day of work included stocking items, dealing with customer complaints, setting up new plan-o-grams (isle segments), working the cash register if the cashier was overwhelmed, working returns, responsibilities with the safe and handling large sums of cash."
good,I typically stay productive and it is a fun workplace at times. it can get very stressful at times typically because of the high theft volume but overall workplace is great.
good,I learned a lot working there. daily interactions with customers. and how to manage a store and work with hand held machines to order and review merchandise.
good,"I did enjoy working for Dollar General. I clocked in, went to the office, made deposits, dropped deposits off, counted a cash register, and checked out customers. In the lead sales position, I made sure my cashiers were giving excellent customer service and kept the store clean. The hardest part of the job was working unset hours. However, I could volunteer for as many hours as I needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was building long-lasting relationships with our customers."
good,"I currently am employed at Dollar General as a cashier, stocker and maintenance assistant.  I provide excellent customer service, and am learning necessary skills to do all assignments given me."
good,"When going into work, I would go straight to the safe get a drawer, take it to the office, count to see if it was correct. Put the slip of paper to show the drawer was correct the beginning of my shift. Do my morning paper work. make sure all the nights paper work was correct. Start my day off by working the truck, get as many things out as possible. After lunch i would clean the bathrooms. Sweep the floors. Then begin on more of the truck until one hour to leave then i would do my end of day paperwork. Make sure my evening manager was there then i could leave. I learned that you wont always have a smooth day. Management was a great experience for me, i loved it. My co-workers was the best, they always could get the job done for me that i had ask to be done. Hardest part of my job was that i had to get the paper work done and for it to be correct. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers."
good,"Must be reliable and be able to take orders. Keep up with a fast pace environment and work diligently, must have good customer service skills"
good,meeting goals for the day. you will work a 10 to 12 hour shift. I learned about assembling car parts. Management is poor. Co-workers could be drama. The hardest part of the job is that you have no control over your shift. Your shift will change every 2 months. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting over time money.
good,"A typical day consist of providing great customer service while controlling store shrink and providing a safe and clean environment for associates and customers. I've learned a great deal of information on how to be a better leader while working for Dollar General. I learn a great deal of how a business is truly ran. My supervisors that I have had all have been a great deal of help when needed and are almost always there to lend a helping hand. I would like to think that I have some of the best co-workers. I have trained them all and they are great people to work and be around. The hardest part of my job is controlling external theft. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with different types of people. Also learning new things from people of different nationalities, religions, and cultures."
good,"Good solid company. Daily operations of a retail store, Good Team. "
good,A typical day at work would be stocking items in their designated area. Ive learned that patients is good to have and understanding. The management is needed to be viewed. We all get along great everyone is friendly. The hardest part of the job is customers. Some are very moody some are not understanding and very verbal abusive. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is counting money and getting ready to close the store.
good,"A typical day at work is mostly busy, with a lot to get done, and too little productivity done. I learn it's best to not argue with customers, and just walk away from confrontation. Most of the time I get along with my co-workers, the hardest part of the job would have to be getting what I need/want to do done before I leave work because we get so busy at times we don't have enough time in the day to get done. I enjoy for the most part working days and with others, sometimes it can have it's own rewards by just someone saying something nice when you're having a not so...good day."
good,"I usually started my day at 6am with either administrative tasks that must be completed before the store opened (such as inventory scans once per week on shelf inventory & backstock), or stocking shelves & putting away trucks that were sometimes 1700 pieces with a completion goal of 48hrs.  I would generally continue this task until which point I covered each employee that needed a lunch break that day.  (This was my first tas of the day on closing shifts)  I would return to said task until the store's goals were completed for the day, and close the day with administrative tasks such as scheduling, interviewing, reviewing reports, communicating key points to my D.M. regularly, etc)"
good,"I feel that it is very unfair that they have started asking the people that have been there awhile and "" do good for them every day"" to work the 10 hour, 4 days a week shift, not that I don't think the better ones deserve a little recognition but What is so unfair I feel is that they are hiring brand new People to work the 10 hour, 4 day Shift as well, this makes Sunday's for everyone else really bad because we have just a handful that works on Sunday's now and overall is just not right, the whole shift needs to be working the 4 day thing, I really like it here but have to say that I really feel that is wrong."
good,"I didn't like the hours, I didn't receive enough to financially support myself. I liked my supervisors and my coworkers, it was an easy job."
good,"This store was left by a store manager, and wasn't kept up to standard, stock room was over filled with back storage. The general manager was always on our back to get it clean out, which we can't make customers buy stuff they don't want, so I would say the hardest part of the job was working for the general manager. The most enjoyable part was working with the store manager, co-workers, and the customers. I learned how they stock things, the book keeping, the store programs, the depositing of the store profits, the opening and closing of the store."
good,The store itself is ok to work in. Unfortunately you have to spend a lot of time watching out for shoplifters. The store has been broken into three times since I've been working there. They has also been robbed at gunpoint.
good,"This Company was a good place to work part time to make extra money. Great team workers, hard working management team and great store to shop."
good,"It was great to help peolpe out.I love helping people out and I love stocking,so that was the best part.They could care more about there employers."
good,"I enjoyed working with this company, but I later found out after a year, for me there was no advancement  in this company, at least not the store I was working in."
good,Its a good company to work for. They're very open about your hours and what shifts you can and can't work. The managers are very nice and caring.
good,Love my coworkers they are the reason I'm still there. Horrible pay and hours. Its only part time and pay is 7.50 and you don't get any raise until after a year of working there. Other than that its easy work.
good,"I really enjoyed interacting with new customers daily, learned a lot about management skills, and how to become very organized."
good,"Could have been better if they had hired me on full-time. I don't know why, but I seemed to not impress the boss enough to hire me on a full-time or otherwise."
good,"I did a lot of work. Management was good. The hardest part was not getting breaks. I didn't get to eat lunch for a while., I didn't have a good schedule."
good,Good work place but poor district mangement skills. All about number sales rarely about the workers. Organize but often changes occur with the company.
good,"Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop."
good,I enjoy helping others with anything they need in the store shopping wise and also checking them out at the cash register.
good,"I'm lucky to have a store manager that knows what they're doing, but that's where my loyalty ends. The pay could be better, especially for the work we do."
good,they pay scale is great but you really dont get a home life to much computer training and not enough hands on not everyone can learn just looking at a computer screen
good,"on your toes at all times, better be a multi-tasker, and some.. loved my co-workers, I learned it wasn't for me, management was not around, was very young, co-workers were excellent to work with, the only thing I liked was the independence, able to change what I wanted to, I enjoyed the customers"
good,"constantly busy, fast paced, patience needed, better management needed, co-workers were mostly friendly, hardest part of job was dealing with poor store management, most enjoyable part of job was interacting with customers and processing merchandise and running register when we had money."
good,It was a good place to work because of the customers I came in contact with on a daily bases as well as those I had never met before. The store manager seemed to spend more time away from her job which led to me running the store and going to school at the same time.
good,Because of the structure of the business model it doesn't provide much support or work life balance for its employee's. The store does not get enough hours to meet company expectations without the manager doing basically every role in the store.
good,"Fun place to work."
good,My job was not typical from the start. I learned that if you dont have support from your DM you would have to rely on your coworkers. Hardest part of my job was no support.Most enjoyable was te customers.
good,"A productive work day, with in store management that is really relaxed. There is nothing difficult about this job. Most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers."
good,"Customer service starts the day.  Opening the store and register duties consist of cash handeling, merchandise management, vendors  and deliveries, ordering, stocking, cleaning and customer care.  I learned that everything you do can help or hinder the person coming after you either a customer or an employee. So do your job accordingly.  Management is usually training so be patient and help when you can so they have less stress. Customers need help NOW and there are never enough Cashiers. Vendors are on a schedule and customers just want to get in and out quickly.  The hardest part of the job was theft and dealing with returns without a receipt and closing procedures. The closing procedures were rushed to balance, rush to finalize, and questionable, especially the handling of another cashiers drawer.  Sloppy closing efforts from the previous night are a nightmare the next morning.  The best part of my day was when everything was in balance to begin and end my shift."
good,All thats needed to be said is that that company needs to be ran strictly by policies.Manager's have the tendency of running things how they want it to be ran.
good,"My first retail position. I had never operated a cash register before, but I got the hang of things rather quickly. When I wasn't assisting a customer at checkout, I was to help unload freight and stock shelves, which I enjoyed. I was quickly promoted to the third-key position, and I took on even more duties, such as opening and closing the store, setting up cash drawers in the morning and counting them down at the end of the night. I enjoyed the third key position, because it allowed me a bit more freedom to move around the store, focus primarily on freight, and assist my coworkers when the lines built up. Most of the difficulty came from being in a small town, and the vast majority of our customers were regulars, who - because of their status as regulars - were under the impression that they were an exception to a lot of the rules and policies DG as a cooperation upholds. The most enjoyable part was my position allowing me to tell them that they were not an exception to the rules."
good,"On a typical work day I would stock shelves, recover the entire store, complete transactions between customers, count till at the beginning and end of each shift."
good,"Learned a lot of computer based programs, enjoyed the change of pace everyday. Enjoyed training new asst. managers and store managers. The hardest part of the job is people management."
good,"good,fast paced environment.Great for people that enjoy working with the public.Pay is low to fair for the tasks.Some managers do not accept their duties and put them off on assistants or part timers."
good,"Overall this company was great for me. It was not hard unless you did not have the proper staff. which could easily be fixed by hiring new people and training them the correct way. Most everything about this company was good. They follow every policy there is and don't not except anything less and they provide all training necessary to make sure you are aware of job description and expectations. I was a store manager and I did a little of everything such as hire and trainee staff, budgeting, inventory, stocking, freight, cashier, etc. all job descriptions for all staff a store manager must be able to fill. So I had to know and do every other job there plus my own. That was not easy but it is possible. It takes time and hard work but you will be successful with this company. Always opportunity for advancement because of how fast the business is growing."
good,nice job to have I enjoyed working there I meet a lot of people in the community and management wasn't to hard to deal with I did the typical thing cashiers do nothing more or less
good,"i worked at a dollar general for a year and it wasn't bad but the store manager did not do a thing she came to work then left to do personal  tasks while she was supposed to be working and she was gone sometime 2-3 hours at a time and when she was there all the work got put on everyone else the work that she needed to do i might add and made everyone work sometimes 50-60 hours so she didnt have to work.the co-workers there are all nice to work with i had no complaints and iv learned how to be more of a people person and how to manage a store (count deposits,refunds,check in vendors ect) i would have loved to stay but the store manager did not know how to run her store everything fell on me and the assistant manger and there was no hard part about my job i liked doing everything i did including stocking,being on the register and running the front of the store."
good,this job was interesting. the weekly pay is a plus however depending on the staff it can make the job more stressful than it should be
good,"My typical day at work varies on the shift that I am currently working. Opening the store requires checking emails and the company project center to ensure that we are accurately prepared for the business day. I am expected to complete or give assigned tasks to employees in order to begin a productive workday. Closing our store includes counting all systems and making sure the store is fit for a fresh start the next day. I truly enjoy having multiple tasks to complete during the day. I usually keep a checklist to management my productivity as well as my employees. However, it is sometimes difficult to operate efficiently on a short staff. My work week usually flows well with hard work."
good,"I loved working for Dollar General.  It is hard work but can be accomplished with the right team  to work with.  Managers need more training before being put into their positions.  There were times that there were great team efforts and then there were times that there were no team efforts.  I picked up the slack of other workers quite often."
good,"running a cash register, serving customers, sometimes busy, hardest part was not having enough hrs and/or enough pay."
good,Really laid back type of job no real issues ever occurred  that I couldn't handle. I learned how to take initiative and to be ambitious. Management always gave chances for advancement opportunities.
good,I realized how much of a leader i am by working at this job. My manager was ecellent i couldnt have asked for better but other people apart of our managment team were not prepared for this job and i took charge in alot of cases because of that so i would like to get back to an assistant manager spot immediately
good,I did not like working for this particular store because it was all friends and family working together. I did my job the best to my ability and did not let this effect my work preformance.
good,I really liked my bosses and mostly all the customers that would frequent the store.
good,"Dollar General is not a bad place to work at all! There are, of course some cons to working for this company, but there is definitely potential for the good to outweigh the bad. A typical day at work for me could be a number of things. Being a smaller retailer, DG workers MUST be able to multitask. There isn't just cashiers, or just shelf stockers/straighteners. We all have to pull our weight in different areas, whether that be serving customers at the register, or out on the sales floor. I help customers find certain items within the store, so knowledge of store layout is a must, but becomes a no-brainer after a few weeks. I stock shelves on certain days and certain times, I straighten shelves in the evenings, and as a lead sales associate (key carrier), it is also my responsibility to balance the register tills, make out deposits for the bank, make out change orders from petty cash, check in vendors, handle voids, returns, and exchanges, things of that nature. Management quality all depends on your specific store/district. All of the managers I work with (Store manager and higher up) are all pretty awesome to work for, but even so, management could use improvement in the way of organization. I never know what my schedule for the next week is going to be until the night before the next work week begins (and we're supposed to have a 2 week schedule), and I get called in early a lot and on days that I'm actually supposed to be off ALL THE TIME. (of course I'm not told that I have to come in, but you can imagine what it might do for my work environment if I don't come in sometimes)."
good,"I had a great store manager, who was very supportive, helpful, and flexible. Coworkers were nice. The most difficult part of this job was lifting boxes. The cash registers at my store were particularly dated, which was a pain at times. Lots of opportunity to gain more hours at other locations. . Little skill is required here. Not a bad place to work overall."
good,"Was usually busy especially during the holidays, always had something to whether it was restocking items, straightening the aisles, cashing out customers, or cleaning. I learned how to communicate more with strangers on a regular basis and they became regular friends who always visited for their regular items. Also learned how hard of a responsibility it is for store managers to maintain those type of discount stores. My manager was a hard worker and aways filled in for those who called off. Even if she was super sick she was there working. My co-workers were good friends of mine and we usually got along well therefore it was easy to work as a team. Sometimes one may deal with the occasional attitude from customers which could spoil your day. However I was very talkative and usually had most of the customers smiling."
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and staff. The store stayed very busy which I liked. My co-workers were fun to work with and most of the customers that came in were enjoyable. The hardest part of the job were the disgruntled customers but I handled them well. Even though I enjoyed the work my place is in business and health care. I also need employment that can offer more pay and more hours.
good,Great people to work with. Unless you are a key hold as little as 4 hours per week.
good,To checkout guest in the store and clean work area before and after shift.
good,"Theres never a day the same as the last in retail sales, especially in Dollar General. The more personal and smaller environment provides a chance to connect with customers at a personal level. A typical day involves providing outstanding customer service, running a register, cleaning the store and maintaining recovery of items on the shelves, counting the deposit and change fund and delegating tasks to employees. Ive learned a lot of useful skills from my time at Dollar General which include how to close a sale, how to cater to each individuals needs and personality, how to be professional and proper and how to present and word my opinions in a professional manner. The most challenging part of the job has to be how to resolve the various random situations that occur. There are still things that happen that no amount of training or computer based testing can prepare you for. I do however, really enjoy making personal connections with customers and leaving them with a smile. Customers come to me and tell me about how they discuss how good of a job Ive done with others outside of the store, and that is enough to make you smile."
good,"When I started working there it was decent. I got good pay, good hours and a good understanding on how things work. As time went on I realized I was not properly trained on certain things such as recovery. Hours started getting cut  and it all went downhill from there. You are expected to stock the store while watching the register and if you are closing you are to zone the store as well. There was a lot to do which i have no problem with but the expectations are set very high. I feel that minimum wage is not proper compensation."
good,"Nice paced environment. Management was good, and coworkers were friendly. I learned how to deal with everyday people, and just how to understand and take it how it comes. The hardest part were the customers who were not very appreciative but I just realized everyone has their good and bad days."
good,i love the work that i was doing my co worker's were reasonable to work with our job was making the costumer's happy and it made me feel good knowing that we or i could provide that.
good,"I worked for three weeks on certain days to help move around the store and get paid. It was an average work day with me picking up boxes, steel bars, and carrying them around the store. I did more heavy lifting then shelves placement."
good,Have really learned a lot from DG. I am now looking to move forward and take my experience to a company that has more to offer and that can really acknowledge and appreciate hard work.
good,It was full of fun and excitement. I learned a lot of new food dishes.  My management staff was ok. My co- worker was probably what I liked the most about the job. The hardest part about the job was my work schedule.  the most enjoyable part was getting to work along side my co-workers.
good,basic manager duties and customer service traveling manager
good,"The management was very unorganized, and the managers clearly only look out for themselves. Pay could be better, great if you are going to college they work around your schedule. The job itself can be fast paced at times an slow at times. The Company focus's on store appearance more than sales and regulations. So if your store looks good it doesnt matter how much you sell. Customers will be very rude at times and at times you meet people and grow attached to them. Its hard to move up in the company unless you have someone helping you managers tend to hire new employees then promote the ones they already have."
good,"* on register as cashier"
good,"Demanding and fast paced. "
good,"Cashier duties, product facing, stocking, customer relations, cash handling, planogram resets, seasonal displays, transaction logging, employee coaching, interview applicants, etc"
good,"good advancement but pay sucks but you do have good high benefits,"
good,"When I first clock in I report to the person in command on the site to find out what the day's duties are. Most of the time, the whole day is spent putting product on to the shelves, but sometimes there are planograms to do (taking the product off the shelves and re-arranging them). Depending on how the schedule was made, I may have to work the register. Helping customers at all times with any questions and/or concerns. I learned how to handle the vendors and count money drawers. Also how to open and close the store on my own. Management was very, very poor. My co-workers were the absolute best. The hardest part of the job is making sure that the money is right at the end of the night, because I am responsible for the outcome. The best part of this job is the lunch breaks and my fellow co-workers."
good,A typical day includes a lot of customer interaction. I learned how to multitask and also be friendly.
good,"Processed vendor orders for product coming in and products coming out Daily bank deposits ,processing incoming freight from truck"
good,was a cashier and stocker. learned how to read bar codes and do resets for new products. great co-workers. the hardest part was trying to get time off for doctors apt or vacation time. meeting new people and letting them trust me in what they need.
good,Productive place to be on a day to day basis. It really worked around my school schedule and I got the chance to show that I could lead as well as follow.
good,"I'm a sales associate at Dollar General my daily day at work is running the register, running rolltainers (stock) and cleaning."
good,"Co workers are good to work with. Company does expect you to multi task.  Hardest part is getting done whats needs to be done with little or no extra hours.  Some customers are great, but there are a few that really try your patience.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers when they need help carrying something out to their car, or helping them when they are not feeling well.  Giving with expecting anything in return.  So fulfilling."
good,I work alone for long hours at a time. The hardest part of my job is the lack of team work I receive from fellow employees I work with. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to clean and merchandise my store after all my freight is out. I also love working with my boss when we have payroll to overlap our scheduled time at work.
good,"I love working with the people at my store. DG employees definitely form a family-like bond, but advancement is slow and the low pay makes it hard to support a family."
good,just recently decreased pay rate. Dollar General wants too much work done for the pay they are giving.
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, and we do not have enough workers for everything that we need to get done. My manager is really nice to me so that is a plus, but I can't say much about my co-workers because everyone is always quitting. The hardest part of the job is having to stock so much, then recover the entire store every night which is always a mess, plus finding time to take your lunch and give the cashier their's, while also having to run up to the register every time someone needs to return something, the cashier needs change, or having to do voids because the cashier double scanned something, etc. I feel like I am constantly running back and forth and it stresses me out that I cannot get done with everything."
good,Interacting with nice & friendly customers. I learned how to multitask much better.
good,"I enjoy my job very much. I have always enjoyed working with people, The only issue I have with Dollar General is I am a part time employee and looking for more hours."
good,i felt job work and life was not balanced. I would work about an average of 48 hrs or more a week. I felt the compensation was low.
good,"Customer Needs were needed to be met daily and timely."
good,Customers are difficult but Employees are Helpful. Blah Blah Blah.
good,I really have neither positive or negative things to say about my time at Dollar General.  I'm completely neutral.
good,"each day I would go in and count the safe, count the register tills, opening days counting and making the bank deposits, I learned how to receive a truck, how to set planograms. The hardest part of the job was running a store with no payroll and traveling from store to store everyone had their own way of doing things. the most enjoyable part of the job was all the people that I spent time with and meeting all the new customers that I hadn't met in my 25 years of working and supervising in retail."
good,"Average work week 59+ Hrs"
good,"when I started at the store there was a lot to learn  ,  I   learned a lot fast. I learned how to  run the registers, talk to people, and get my work done on time. In a short time I became a shift manager and had to learn even more stuff to do . My managers and co-workers were all good teachers . The hardest part of this job is to have a lot of patients with the people you are waiting on. The most enjoyable part of this job is when you help someone who needs it and they smile at you and thank you and tell you that you are such a good person for helping them out. To me that means  a lot."
good,"This job helped me learn skills vital to any other job. It helped me learn how to handle money, work under stress, work with lazy and good employees, learn a schedule, interact with customers and take inventory count. My co-workers were usually good and reliable with only a few bad apples. The most difficult part of the job for me was I really never had time off it seemed I was at work everyday all week for 8 hours or more. The most enjoyable part was the staff, I really enjoyed working with them and they made the experience better all around."
good,"Manager was not always in control of employees. "
good,"This job is good for students starting to enter the working world. Typical store job, very nice. Not so flexible with hours."
good,"Dollar General is a good place to work if you enjoy meeting new people. One of the most enjoyable parts of my day was seeing the clients, specially the regulars. I also made friends with some of my fellow co-workers. A typical day is fairly easy going, but recovery and stocking can be stressful. The hardest part of working for a retail store is dealing with the theft on a daily basis."
good,Management could've been better but overall was a fine place to work.
good,"On a typical day I would come in and count my register, then make cash, debit, or credit transaction when necessary. I also helped stock inventory as well as assist customers during their shopping experience. The management and co- workers were okay in my opinion they could've have been more professional and disciplined."
good,I would operate the register as well as help the customers find anything they needed. The management I was under was not one of the best as the time but the co workers were great.
good,"I worked for this company for two years, In that time I took on management roles while I was still a cashier, It took me two years to get a raise and even that wasn't enough to make up for all the drama; the managers and other employees would bring their family drama into the workplace which i felt was very unprofessional, we even had another store manager come in and harass a young female worker, then when I confronted him and our store manager they both dismissed it."
good,"Innovative Leaders in the ""Small Box Retail"" section. With over 3500 locations they have made their brand name well known."
good,I enjoyed working with customers and doing all I could for them. Hardest part of the job was all of the paperwork that needed to be filled out. Upper management rarely appeared or was available for assistance when needed.
good,"1)Checking in vendors doing planograms refunds exchanges and "
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was working with our customers!  "
good,I was a cashier and stocker but toward the end of the job was a 3rd key holder. this was just a part time job while in college. I learned about customer relations and how to influence people in a positive way. The best part was the customers and seeing that hard work does get recognized. Breaks always depended on customer traffic and we had a store manager that never wanted to work any weekends so we always had to work on weekends.
good,"I had a great store team and manager to work with, we always executed any task or project given daily. I loved my customers and meeting new ones.Training new employees was always fun because seeing them progress was always an enjoyment of seeing how well you had trained them."
good,Customer service was Number 1. The rest came in the flow of the business.
good,"Dollar General was the most laidback company I've ever worked for. Small stores meant only one or two managers with only a few other coworkers...you became friends with everyone very quickly. "
good,"good co-workers and job enjoyable, management is good depending on what store."
good,"The store is always short- handed but not a very bad place to work. We have great managers and assistant managers . The hardest part is the customers are sometime very rude and impatient, and at the same time your customers are also the most enjoyable, you get some characters that come in and make you laugh."
good,"I did not like the way the corprate worked. Corp. men changed very often and all wanted and expectedd different things. You couldnt keep up, very stress ful job as a asstiant manager."
good,"Most days my day consist of being there at 6:30 am and not getting home till after 9:30 pm. Worked 7 days a week. Most days worked shorthanded, job title included being store manager, bookkeeper, unloader, stocker and cashier."
good,"We had a good crew, good manager, and we could get the products out really well off truck day, I guess the hardest part was undloading the truck, and the pet,deterdent was heavy, but we had some good men that really done that part for us,it would get hard at times when alot of customers would come in at the same time to check out."
good,"My work days consisted of greeting people, stocking and recovering the store, merchandising, solving issues customers may have had. I learned many thing, mostly was haw to resolve issues between employee and customers. management is a good position, but not exactly what i prefer to do for another ten years. We had many good and loyal employees, positive and willing to do what ever was asked of them. Hardest part of the job was just trying to get all things that needed to get done - done. most enjoyabel i feel was getting to know customers on an first name basis."
good,"typical day at work open to close hours assigning projects to be accomplished ie stock, plannograms, cleaning, customer service and over seeing that all are accomplished within time constraunts"
good,"Meeting and greeting people, putting up stock and straighting shelves. I learn that some things are easier than others if I do them a different way. My co-workers are helpful and easy to work with. My boss shows me easier ways to do things. The hard part is not being able to wait on every customer. I enjoy meeting and greeting new people."
good,Good company to work for. I would work for this company again if full time employment was offered.
good,A typical day at dollar general is very busy and always helping customers. I have learned that patience is the key when dealing with different types of customers each day. My co-workers were great and the hardest part of this job was sometimes not being able to help a customer or not having the product that they need or want. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting along with everyone and making sure each customer left satisfied.
good,"A typical work day many tasks at once which is a challenge, but I love it. The hardest part of the job is completing many tasks with limited payroll but we get it done.The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy."
good,I would not wish this on my worst enemy. They promise good money but not enough for the hours you work.
good,Great company to work for with positive growth potential. I ensured customers were promptly greeted and maintained a positive shopping experience.
good,"Job consisted of checking out customer purchases, helping customers locate items, stocking, inventory and store security."
good,"a typical day at dollar general for me was clock in gather shopping carts proceed to my designated area and stock shelve, occasioinally being called away to back up the cashier when long lines appear. sweep mop and clean break room bathrooms. spot mop any messes throughout the day."
good,Traveled from store to store to run the day to day functions.
good,"This company will give you excellent training and pay. You will need this excellent training and pay; however, to survive the crazy amount of hours you will be subject too. If your a manager who cares about your store be prepared to work 70-80 hours and NO this is not a joke."
good,"Working at Dollar General stayed to myself, but the people will help you when you need help. It is a job that you mostly know everyone because everybody stays in the same area."
good,they have to make sure new store manager have skills to deals with employees and customer
good,I enjoyed working here. The people I worked with created a friendly environment.
good,"approximately 10 hr shifts"
good,When I worked there it was very slow. I usually worked with one of employee. I usually stocked in the back while they ran the register and straightened things up. I was only given a raise of $0.50 to become a manager and I was only scheduled for about 15 hours a week. I didn’t stay very long because I had been offered a better job.
good,"My location was turned into a grocery store in a very small town, so it was very fast paced. There was a lot of stocking to be done. My manager was very understanding and not mean at all."
good,Not enough hours or enough pay. Part time employees do not get holiday pay. Do not agree with the way company does things on a corporate/ entire company level.
good,The work environment was great just no security. On a typical day I could stock more product to fulfill customers' satisfaction. I cleaned often to guarantee a clean environment for everyone.
good,Fun place to work especially if you enjoy working with people. Anyone who works at Dollar General must know how to multitask and use time effectively and wisely.
good,It was okay. I worked with my friends so obviously it was bearable. My managers were okay people. The people that came in were mostly regulars. It was a decent job honestly.
good,Company is good to work for. Career advancement is easy if you prove yourself and do your job well. Always room for improvement and advancement. Apply today
good,Dollar general is a place that always busy and always have something that needed to be done. You always met a customer that very friendly or not but remember to always listen and see what can be done to make the situation more comfortable.
good,"Realist goals were team oriented-But corporate limited hours and made goal attainment either impossible or unrealistic. Poor supervision by then district manager. Doing a store remodel, staff was very cooperative to attin needed projections-but corporate staff sent in to supervise store remodel were arrogant and not friendly"
good,"When I worked at the dollar general, it was a simple job that kept me on my feet, I stocked candy and other products when there was no customers waiting in line to be checked out, When I needed a day off they were usually okay with it depending on what other workers were doing, They did call me in a lot to take over others shifts though, the customers were very unique."
good,Dollar General employs some good people. I started as a cashier and worked my way up to store manager in about a year. Once I had a store assigned to me I didn't get the support or training I needed because they were so short staffed I was quite often playing cashier (which I am not above but at the time I needed training in the office). This company needs to put more into staffing and training to have more successful stores and happy employees.
good,"Not enough employees, not enough hours. Very easy advancement. Strange hours. Relocated. Way too far. Dirty stores. Many many hours. Not very many employees"
good,In order to succeed in this role you have to be very disciplined on following processes. The job is what you make of it. You have to be able to manage and hire the right people to support your store. The hardest part of this role and any role with this company is the work-life balance. At times it becomes exhausting and overwhelming.
good,Working here would be great if you have a good manager and a great team. But the company doesn't seem to care if you have no employees and their expectations seem to be too high and demanding.
good,"Enjoyed the people who came through my line every day. Always glad to help .I would recommend them for anyone looking for a good starter job. If you don't have much experience in retail , then dollar general is the place to start learning"
good,It was a good work place. I worked there from August 2012 to August 2017. They have flexible work schedules that you can work around with dr appointments.
good,"I like working for the dollar general it just wasn’t enough hours. I would get less than 20 hrs some weeks. I love working with customers, and enjoyed the people it just wasn’t enough hours."
good,I loved the job and people but it was not the shift for me. I prefer day 1st and second shift. Not 3rd. It’s high and fast paced work if you are in Non Cons.
good,"Dollar General is a good company who has developed a lot and still growing, they well a small store style chain offer up a lot of beginning careers to new comers to learn the Retail part of it and get their careers going."
good,Its a great place to work if you love retail. Job can be extremely stressful and hectic though.They are flexible with hours which is very nice. Over all i would recommend working here.
good,It was an amazing place to work amazing people great training all the overtime. If you as to be moved departments they will move you hr is amazing I definitely would go back
good,"If you want a fast paste easy money second job I’d apply here. Dollar general is a really stressful job if you’re a cashier but depending on the people you work with, it can be fun at times."
good,"Got my manager experience "
good,I liked working there but I worked in a small town one so my experience may be different... I moved from entry level to management within my first year along with two raises... If I didn't have to move I would probably still be with the company
good,"It was usually difficult working at Dollar General because we only ever had a staff of 7 people. So, the people working there were always sick and tired because they were the only ones doing all the work. They would work the managers to death, over 40 hours a week. Then they would only work regular cashiers, maybe, 10 hours a week. But the people I did work with were usually very friendly and easy to get along with, as well as the store manager. That store manager was the best boss I've ever encountered. I learned how to manage a team and schedule people where they needed to be scheduled."
good,Being a cashier is not bad but the customers were so rude and people use to steal from there almost every single day. The manager did not care for anyone but himself.
good,"Employees are great,  I loved working here. I know the whole store and am always there if a customer needs something. We don’t have enough cashiers or floor people to do what needs done."
good,This is a great place to work if you are in school and do not require many hours.  It is hard to get more than 20 hours per week unless you are a full time key holder.
good,cool workplace but needs better upper management and more pay plus benefits. good hours but doesn't  wanna pay time in a half for overtime you meet some nice people and you will meet some bad people
good,"Overall not a terrible first job for people coming out of high school or similar situations, but not a career for other people. Now, if you enter at the managerial level or the corporate level then I'm sure that the compensation is not too bad at all. Yet as a regular sales associate, you'll find a lack of challenging work to do which isn't always a bad thing, but also there's a lack of potential. The second you start working here, if you aren't pursuing any learning or additional work on your own, you will stagnate. The upward mobility is pretty terrible if you are at a well-run store, so maybe apply for the ones that look not too great on the outside? Also the actual work environment isn't the safest, not from the employer's side but rather the customers. You never know who is going to walk through that door, and more often than I've seen at other places, it can be some more unscrupulous characters. So be careful accepting this position, as a summer job or a manager type of arrangement you will be fine. Better than fine actually, it's a very nice job on the upper-tier. However, that being said, the lower end really is the lower end with no foot-holds or ropes for you to pull yourself up to that better side of life."
good,"It is a great place to work. I made some new friends when I worked there. It's a friendly environment. You'll never be bored, there is always something that needs to be done."
good,"Super fast paced, high priority for customer service, flexibility in schedule increased performance, compatibility with full time student status was a plus."
good,The job was very easy and enjoyable but also came with some high stress. Everyday was different and was unpredictable. There was a lot of cool customers that gave you respect as long as you tried to relate and get to know them. There was also a lot of undesirables to enter the store.
good,"While General Mgr. Is great"
good,Really I had no problems with my co workers. They were all nice and I made a few friends there. It’s just the crazy hours and the people I had to deal with. Customers trying to tell you how to do the job you trained for. Crazy man.
good,Fast paced. Need to be able to learn quickly. Time management is very important. Physically taxing putting up freight. Good team feel with the crew and supervisor.
good,"Store managers work 6-7 days a week , pressured by upper management by all levels of the business , No support from corporate office with payroll hours ."
good,"sad no time for  family always there,no holidays but cmas closed,work hard no communication with dm,lp no one seems to care.so we work and say wtf cause thats what we get back"
good,"Been there for about 6 months now and still haven’t gotten a raise."
good,"Direct Supervisor to 40+ truck drivers and a Planner.  Nice environment to work in, although sometimes noisy when drivers are in office.  Hardest part of the job is being worked to death.  No work/home life balance at all.  Easily worked 60 hours a week.  Usually work 7 days a week."
good,Bust your butt for a company and get the store in a way better shape then it was when you started then go to transfer to another state and the cancel your vacation time and don’t transfer till you have to start from scratch
good,Engaging with vendors and customers.  We put out a lot of merchandise keeping the store clean and uncluttered.  I learn alot of patience daily with people and employees.  Hardest part is keeping merchandise on the shelves for customers.
good,"I Am A very hard worker"
good,"I enjoyed working there. Just was way over worked and no days off. And assistant manager would not do her job so, I was left to pick up the slack and called to help her on off the clock"
good,"I was a full time lead. A typical work day would be me as the Manager on duty (MOD) and one associate to run the register. The MOD was responsible for doing pretty much everything that had to be done, while the associate was pretty much responsible for keeping the line moving and keeping the front area clean. As the MOD: I would handle putting out shipments all while cleaning the store, handling questions and complaints, helping the cashier when the line is too long, or when there is a return or exchange, check in vendors, recover shopping carts from outside, clean any spills,recover the aisles and do go backs, guide customers to products they can't find, clean the bathrooms, empty the trash, handle bank deposits, as well as being in charge of opening and closing procedures."
good,"Loved being able to handle the work load.  The management and higher, dm, rm, etc. lost their jobs after I left.  Needed to.  Was a great place to learn new objectives"
good,Definitely a fast past environment but the staff there does a really good job of trying to maintain the store . With short handed staff but pleased overall all
good,"The work at the store consist of cashiering, receiving merchandise shipments, shelving/stocking and recovering the merchandise.  The hardest part of the job was mopping the entire store."
good,"They don’t pay their employees what they should. They don’t have enough employees working, and the managers get the worst end of everything. There were only ever 2 employees  ; 1 being manager the other being a team member. Very unsafe for retail."
good,"They need to get out of the 60's technology sucks, hard to get things replaced or fixed, pay your employees better don't always hire from the bottom of the pot."
good,"Dollar General is a very fast paced company, they have very long hours, and are very short staffed. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet new people everyday."
good,"Not a terrible place to get started but be prepared to get things done quickly and timely. If you have a good manager, you will have a good experience. If you have a good or even a decent team that doesn't call in all the time, you will also have a great experience. This is great for starterting a career and there's plenty of places to move up, not just in the retail section. Look for hat corporate job in this company and you will be just fine. Or be a cashier."
good,"I really liked working at Dollar General. "
good,Absolutely loved working for this company. Manager was awesome. Store was great. Upper management was friendly. Hours were flexible however the company would prefer to have more employees working less hours. This is an issue for me as I am a one income home and need the hours to support myself. I was unable to continue working for the company on only 18-23 hours per week. Was saddened to leave.
good,"Heatlhcare and retirement for sales associates too"
good,"Dollar General is a mediocre job with little to no room for advancement, unless the Manager gets tired of having 1 day off and 6 days on every week and decides to find a new place of employment. Then there is room for advancement. Because after all, now, they need you."
good,not enough hours allowed in weekly budget to get all the work done that was required.left managers working 70 plus hours a week. employees called in often and most stores were short staffed
good,"My experience at Dollar General has taught me a lot in just the 6 weeks that I have been here. I’ve learned to not allow people to walk all over me and talk to me any kind of way, i’ve definitely gained more skills and knowledge in the work field, and I have learned how to multi-task much better than before, and be quicker on my feet."
good,"i liked working there when i first got hired, then they changed up managment and everything else changed . we worked hard, and the co workers were good people"
good,I liked it all in all i liked being cashier but the reason i left was because of personal reasons. I liked it but i didnt was t the 100 percent best job bit went by fast
good,"I started as the assistant manager after 2 months, I became the store manager. The customers were wonderful. I had a few good employees but I also had some not so good employees. There was alot of responsibilities and it was often difficult to find good responsible team members in the small town the store was in."
good,I loved working at dollar general. Bit i do think that theu expect you to do too much stuff in one night. Its almost imposible to get it all done dependong how busy the store is.
good,Worked account for a year-and-a-half definitely need two people on the truck I had somebody with me every time if they had two people unloading I don't think I would have left the account
good,Dollar General can be stressful and if you are a Store Manager be prepared to not have a family life or a social life. It can be a fun environment depending on the location you are working but it can also be very dangerous.
good,I would highly recommend Dollar General as a great place to be employed. I really did love working there. I even aided in my daughter becoming employed there.
good,"Dollar General, if under the right management, can be an amazing place to work. It does get stressful if lines become long, but it does not take a long time to get the line down if two registers are open. A typical day of a Lead Sales Associate who is manager of the current shift would be to stock the shelves, front the products on shelves, keep sales floor clean, assist customers if approached or if you happen to notice someone is in need of assistance, working register if the line becomes long or the other employee is on lunch, counting cash drawers/handling money, and opening and closing the store. I learned great customer service skills, how to handle a customer who is infuriated or under the influence, how to write a deposit slip, and how to stock shelves. Management is, for the most part, lovely and very friendly. They are willing to work with you on hours the best they possibly can. The hardest part of working at Dollar General would be asking for someone's ID when the customer in question purchases tobacco or alcohol and they become angry. Some customers take their anger to an extreme level and may throw things. The most enjoyable part of working here is the lovely staff members and the friendly environment."
good,"At dollar general i made $8.00/hr. which wasn't all bad for a 20 year old who had no responsibilities, but I lacked hours tremendously. My managers were nice. I wouldn't mind going back if i was a full-time worker and i got $9.50/hr."
good,"I traveled between 4 different store as an assistant manager and all management has very different ways to manage the stores, no one does deposits the same so you will have to relearn everything depending on what store you go to. It is very fast paced some stores are gross and some are immaculate and you can tell what employees really want to be there and the ones who don't and they make it very obvious. I liked being able to travel to different stores for the change in everyday routine."
good,One of the hardest jobs I ever had. No tine for family and just daily life. Working days and then nights and back and forth was hard on everyone in my household.
good,Would be better if they had a manager that would train and treat her employees with respect. I was trained one night as a night manager and then expected to make no mistakes.
good,"Depending on upper management its an okay company to work for. Very long hours daily. Very stressful, fast paced atmosphere. Not enough work/family balance."
good,"I love my job here. We finally have a good manager, but the pay is killing me. $8.50 for hard long hours. The work itself is doable, but it’s hard when you’re constatly busy. I’m in college and might have to quit for better pay. I don’t want to, but still."
good,"Working here was fun. I enjoyed my coworkers but the hours were bad and so was the pay. You stayed busy messing with the store, stocking shelves and checking people out. Some days were hectic, especially around the holidays, but it was a nice experience."
good,I loved my manager we had a great team who all worked together and who was not a cut throat team all together as it should be at all times. We had great customers as we also had great customer service with all customers who came we all took that extra step for dollar general so they would repeat and come back. I can say I enjoyed my job.
good,"The pace was slow, not too bad"
good,It's a nice job to have if you like to only work 1 or 2 days a week. The benefits I will say isn't great when sometimes you only get paid for one day which is minimum wage $7.25 so a one day work is only $50.12 which isn't much. The work hours are not that good when you only work 4 to 5 hours a day.
good,"Same thing every day the job never changes, your either running a cash register, managing money, or stocking shelves. cleaning floors and back runs are also apart of the job."
good,Was away from home to much. I believe it was more the area that I worked in that was the problem. Lots of theft hard to find good workers. Job would have been better in different location.
good,Fun workplace with flexible hours and low wages. I would usually get called in due to someone skipping work but I almost always went just to make a couple of extra bucks. The manegement depends on the person and the best part of working here is the people you get to meet. The worst part is also the people you meet.
good,My overall review on dollar general is good. I felt like they paid well I learned quite a bit a bout working at quick paste and learned a lot about team work in the process. the worst part of my job was the day in day out 12 hour days working on night shift. The best part of my job was learning new positions and doing different things daily.
good,"So many stores, easy to find your niche!  With dollar general, it was limitless as to what position you could land.  Management potential at store level or corporate level, your hard work determined how far you could climb the ladder.  Good company to work for"
good,"Location and leadership are very important components in the success of DG. There is little breathing room to not be on point with all the SOP's for our store. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is how close each person who works there gets along and helps each other out as a team. I enjoy working to improve the store floor.
good,"I believe this company is more focused on making the customer happy, that they forget about loyal employees. I would have loved to stay, but I didn't have a personal life working for this company. Managers work 55+ with a measly salary."
good,the hardest part pf the job was having to go back and forth from the register to stocking shelves because some of the customers would be rude because they had to wait for me to get back to the register. The best part of the job was working with very kind employees that didnt mind at all helping me learn the ropes.
good,"Typical day would include counting tills in for the cashier, counting the change fund once or twice a shift, and working projects. The projects could include putting out freight, pulling the back stock off of the top shelf and refilling product, or setting up sections for seasonal items."
good,"Their business model is LEAN.  Lean on staffing, payroll, compensation, work life balance, technology, business tools, building maintenance and employee appreciation.  They love profit but they're business model makes it hard to keep good people unless they don't think they can do any better.  Very hard work even after you fix the store and become more routine, because hours are so lean you can't afford to fall behind or lose a key employee.  You need self gratification, tremendous work ethic, and extreme focus to be a manager at DG."
good,"Nothing really bad or good to say over all it was okay , the store was a complete mess when I came by the time I left the store was much more put together under new management"
good,"Learned a lot there as I worked my way up from full time key holder to asst. store manager to store manager...Learned scheduling, receiving, setting end caps and g sections, etc."
good,"Great job to have while in college, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else since the pay wasn't enough to live on independently. The hours were always flexible and my manager always gave me time off when I requested it in advance. Great for building up your customer service skills when you're young. Also my tip if you're really considering working here wear comfortable shoes you do a LOT of walking and standing in one place for extended periods of time."
good,"I enjoyed the environment at this company. It was occasionally fast-paced and high-stress, but the staff there and customers made it easier. Management was harsh at times and didn't take fellow staff's scheduling issues into consideration all the time."
good,"My day would be to open the store and stock items on the shelf. I would then rebuild displays and take care of vendors, payroll, orders, and customers throughout the day."
good,"The schedule was at times inconsistent, especially when sales are done and hours must be cut from payroll to offset this. Had a great manager at my most recent store, really tried to work with your schedule. Some customers were rude at times, but for the most part the customers are great."
good,"This is a great workplace it all revolves around the support and management you have behind you, overall review it’s a good career choice the insuarabce and benefits are the best"
good,"You don't have enough help. Management is only allowed a certain amount of hour each week. Only one cashier, who also has to stock in between customers."
good,yeh what i said in the summary its pretty good  guess. im just typing randomly to fill out the minimim that i really dont know why im doing thois in the first place but whatever go with the flow man
good,"I really just needed something to make money while I was i was in school. Free meals are good, but not enough for a long career there. Leadership needed to be more heavily issuedbas well."
good,Dollar General is a great place to work if you are already fully trained. They do very little training. I would have never made it if I did already have extensive experience in retail management.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working for Dollar General. The only downfall I didn't like is the pay and hours. I feel they should take that into consideration. I do recommend this job somewhat."
good,overall a good job. Learned how to engage people from different economic statuses. The hardest part of the job was the sheer amount of traffic that came in through the store but overall I enjoyed it
good,Working at Dollar General was sometimes stressful but always stable. The schedule was fixed for the most part. there was very little opportunity for advancement.
good,"If you enjoy retail DG is the place to be. Its easy advancement  a longs you are doing with you re suppose to do. You will became an asst./ mgt. in no time. The only thing I did not like was the pay was not enough. However, its a great company to work with fast advancement."
good,"Typical days involved great customers, and always busy. Facing was a term I had not heard before. The management was and consistent. The culture in the store was up beat and steady. the hardest part of the job was when the trucks would deliver and multiple items would need to be disbursed in a timely manner.It was overall a good experience."
good,Dollar General is a good company to work for but it does has its cons. Not enough hours to complete all the task given to you. As a store manager you work between 50 to 70 hours a week to make up the loss of hours.  Also DG pays the employee less than most other retailers. Which it makes it harder on the Store manager to keep store staffed.
good,The manager was awesome. The only problem I found working at Dollar General was the pay. It was very low and I think that is why they have a difficult time keeping great workers.. I wanted to be a key holder/ manager but the pay wasnt affordable.I loved my customers.
good,"People took time to train  you on several jobs in the Disturburtion so you can move around and not be in the same area if you want to change jobs to learn how to go from production to lead  to floor Manager,! Now  that is what every Company  should strive to their Employees"
good,"Job is easy, however the schedule is not. It is inconsistent and few hours. As far as I knew there was never a chance for full time and hours given to employees depended on the store accountability in sales.  To work only part time it did not bring in enough money to support the gas or the time taken for the job, would need at least another 1 or 2 part time jobs that would coincide with scheduling to make ends meet. IF you only needed to work a few hours and not make much, then I tis for sure a good place to work. meet many people and it is relaxed."
good,a typical work day for me starts at 5:53am. Walk to your zone for start up meeting stretch and get your day started. I learned a lot about myself also about the job. I really don't have much to say about management because i had my picks and chooses but i can definitely say they need a better team. i have never been in a work place environment where management constantly lets you down If its not about making dollar general look good they don't care. If its not about picking cases so they can go home and have the biggest production numbers they don't care. The hardest part of the job for me was having to deal with the different levels of uncoordinated ways they did things and the low rate of maturity in the work place. The best part about that job would have to be that you get paid every week the bonuses and how easy the job was.They also make sure they have somewhat of a fun day for the workers every year that was fun and appreciated. The only person i truly miss from dollar general is two supervisors and they both left for better jobs. i would recommend this job only because the it gets the bills paid but as far as the staff trust no one.
good,It's hard work but there is opportunity to move up in the company which is nice. If you can deal with customer service this is not a bad place to work.
good,They didnt care about anything.I had to work evtra hard just to keep the place up.There was no room to move up.They over work due to calls offs.Hsd to find a brterr job
good,"I loved my manager and my co-workers whole heartedly and we worked as a very stable team together. No drama. Consistent. However, there is no overtime and I need to find better pay suitable to being a single mother and student. Retail can be very stressful and the wrong people can be dangerous in a store."
good,"Being an assistant manger, you were expected to handle all manger duties plus handle the stocking and truck receiving of the store.  Especially if the other employees didn't do their assigned tasks.  Required long hours every day to keep store in shape per company rules."
good,"Dollar General was challenging, but stressful. Turnover is very high due to the workload and salary. The job is geared for part time primarily with one or two Full Time to operate."
good,"Open every day and work long hours each day, you have to cover if some one calls out! Work your on trucks weekly  and stock store daily.This company is a good business and fast pasted constantly on duty with no home time."
good,Need more stockers and store recovers so manger can be more productive in other areas.  Managers should receive a higher pay. The most enjoyable part of the day is being the store clerk. The hardest part of the day is recovering and closing. Workplace culture is very mellow and friendly for the most part.
good,"One of the most enjoyable part of the job was within the downtime of customer flow where I was able to complete the tasks given to me at the start of the shift. Another was meeting customers that I otherwise would not have met. The hardest parts of the job were multitasking between answering the phone and taking care of customers at the register, and being dependent on the key holder on duty to perform tasks such as returning/exchanging an item or removing an item off the register. Another was being left alone to take care of a long line when the when the other employee on duty was unavailable."
good,"Very limited time to accomplish work, do not give enough hours for the location I'm employed at. New Manager no experience as a store manager at Dollar General before arriving at this store."
good,very busy high paced..very physical job and under paid. The work they expect you to do should come with more pay. They ask you to help other stores and if you refuse your hours are likely to be cut.
good,Manager needs to give more hours ....................and stop keeping the hours for there self then I would love my job not when you don’t let me work then I’m going to hate my job but hey I’m just saying
good,The management and coworkers were very nice and understanding sometimes stressful have to be a people person sometimes there are no hours and sometimes you get called in on days off so you just never know what kind of schedule your gonna have.
good,Working at Dollar General was my first job and it was cool. I really enjoy the customer and co-worker. The manger always made sure I was okay. I really think Dollar General for everything.
good,Its a fun atmosphere to work in but the  pay rate isn't enough . The hours vary  depending on the schedule.  You can work all shifts . You have to flexible.
good,"Dollar General is a hard place to work at, depending on the location of your store. It is a physically demanding company, that pays you a small amount for a lot of work. At the end of the day, you are physically exhausted."
good,I enjoyed it but salary employees worked all hours needed to get the job done. The pay was not as good for the hours on the job. I would recommend this for a young person with a lot of energy and drive.
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in,  switching out the cashier's drawers and counting them down. Stocking shelves and helping customers when they need assistance, counting money down for end of day shifts and deposit, also making sure change fund is accurate. I learned a lot from my store manager, my first and only job I worked there for six years. The people I worked with became family and always worked as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing all the regulars come in daily, knowing their face and their name and them also knowing who you are even without the name tag. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the stress of angry customers, or shoplifters coming in all the time."
good,"It is a great place to work if your looking to earn your pay, but dont expect to get a raise or advancement for just being a hard worker.I have worked in a total of 4 Dollar generals and all have the same stingy payroll methods and ironically underpaid management."
good,Dollar General was my very first job. This was a smooth company to transition into young- adulthood with. I learned a lot and the employees welcomed me with open arms.
good,"Store opening or closing was easy, you had a lot of paperwork and money counting, I didn't have a full crew so I worked every night while the manager worked every morning. The employment screening is so tight that anything bad on your record could get your application thrown out. Lots of potential employees out the window because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The company rules changed every month, they would have you do it one way this week, then change their minds the next. I loved meeting people and being able to assist them when I could."
good,"terrible job , manager was racist against minority's and retaliated against me because i gave my keys back after she lied about my pay raise.Do not work in the shafter dollar general"
good,"The Distribution Center I worked in initially was a very unsafe work environment.  I partnered with Senior Management, my supervisors and my team members to make it a very safe work environment.  We were able to work together to build rapport between management and team members to create a very competitive but enjoyable work environment"
good,"A typical work day at dollar general is a lot of stocking, and providing customer service. The management at my location was very helpful and kind, they created a great atmosphere to work in. We were understaffed, so hours were never a problem. I could get as many as I wanted."
good,"The job required to be working at all time such as stocking, cleaning, helping customers, and working at the register. I learned to be quick , willing to work whenever needed, and a smile can go a long way. And thhe most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the regulars and helping them."
good,"The job itself is not hard. Basic cashier and stocking tasks. I wanted more hours. Some weeks I had 30 hours, others just over 20. I loved my management both AM's and the manager. However, most of the other Sales Associates didn't care about the store.  I have just grown tired of being at a level with coworkers who simply do not care."
good,overall not a bad company but it does not allow for a private life you are not rewarded if you are a good performer. no matter the way you run your store it is exactly the same
good,"Dollar General was very different for me, but I enjoyed being a manager. It taught me leadership, and to handle responsibility very well. There were times I wish I could have worked more hours."
good,I learned a lot of valuable things.  I learned how to manage and work retail which is alot different than waiting tables.  I learned i was a pretty good at managing a team and pushing my limits
good,"I was in Management at Dollar General, very fast paced environment."
good,"you do everything, from stocking, checking customers out, resetting shelfes, maintanence they need to pay more for all the labor! expect way too much for the pay"
good,I felt like I was doing too much for $7.25. Had to restock and be a cashier at the same time. Only 2 people at the store. We couldn't get everything done
good,I like dollar general in general good prices after couponing.i like meeting new people and helping them in any way I can overall good place for shopping!!!
good,This what a good job to work at. I like the people that I worked with at the time.this was some thing that I learned from on how to do different thing.
good,DO NOT be afraid to ask questions pertaining to customers or priced mercandise. always be aware of policies for the company you work for. be confident in your job and take pride in what you do even if it goes unnoticed.
good,"Stocking, register, ordering"
good,"If the store managers had more support from the company, like a reasonable payroll budget where tasks could be completed without the manager killing themselves, it would be a great place to work. The team members at store level could make or break the store though...people don't care so there are many no call no shows, high turn over, and little to no resources for the store manager to deal with such issues.  When staffing drops to a critical level, it's extremely difficult to get support from the district manager.  Store managers often feel like they're ""on their own"" to handle any situation."
good,"Depends on district you work in and if the store is new or broken due to working in a store that was broken, new district manager, and understaffed my experience has been different"
good,"Honestly i was young, and inexperianced with barely any training and felt like it was hard to get by sometimes. I loved the people, and i really enjoyed cashiering."
good,"It is very fast paced so the days move by very quickly. the hours are however, very unpredictable and it is hard on my family life and it is hard to have set hours at daycare for my son. management was very good."
good,I enjoy working there because of my crew members. Not many people get lucky enough to have a close knit work environment.The only complaints are the fast shifts and  low pay rate. I only got a small raise after working there for well over a year and a half.
good,"I can be a hard job, but a good source of employment for a small town.  It is easy to advance if you are a hard worker and dependable.  The pay is good for a small town as well."
good,Its a great and convenient place to shop but not ideal if you enjoy working as a team. But if you enjoy working alone then I would recommend. Easy opportunity for advancement if you set your mind to it.
good,"It's not the typical horror stories you hear previous workers say although shipping is where all the horror stories come from dont do shipping, if they offer it to you decline it."
good,You would have to run the cash register intill it was your time for break or intill you didn't have any customers to go and work on all the things that have to go back on the shelves.
good,I enjoyed working for dollar general they are very customer friendly and I loved having a connection with people in the community.... I like that they felt they could rely on us as well
good,"It's unlike any other place I've ever Managed. If you reach out for help and you by chance get it you best be greatful cause it don't happen here! I had other issues on top of having staffing issues, no one wanted to do the work for the amount of pay they pay employees. I had no idea as to what I was getting into at this business!"
good,It's a decent place to work if u have no better options. It allows no overtime.. it's not really an employees supporter..  it could provide better pay
good,it would a great place it the people would come in and work. i was a shift manger and if the cashier show up and the hardest parted was when you get two track and you have to get them out in 3 day.
good,"I worked at Dollar General as a way to make some extra money while going to school. The manager I had was very nice and understanding, and the tasks that I had to do were fairly simple and easy."
good,it was a fun work place but some of the mangers play to much with the employees. the pay is good the hr are good they feed you on holidays and give you gifts om mothers day and fathers day they also give you cake on your birthday
good,"• It stayed busy"
good,"Customer service is number one"
good,"fun, fast paste, and healthy place to work at with helpful team work.  The hardest part about the job hitting production the variety of the work load change every day."
good,"It was an OK place to work, great people to work with, loved working around the public, just not enough hours to support a family with extra needed income."
good,If the management was better I would have stayed with the dollar General for a long time however school was way more important and the wouldn't work with my college schedule . I put up stock was a cashier and cleaned and I have very little complaints.
good,"It can be a good place to work, but if you stock and not cashier....its hard work and you will sweat.Early mornings for stock and quick paced. There is alot of inventory involved and if not properly stocked, it throws the numbers off very easily"
good,Store manager is very rude and doesn't know how to talk to her co-workers.Takes away hours if you don't come in the days you are off. Will sign your name on the cash paper and not tell you. But other then that its very laidback and a great experience to build your social skills.
good,I loved my time at Dollar General. I had a GREAT store and did a wonderful job merchandising and increasing comp sales.  I loved doing resets and making the customer experience real!
good,"A typical day at work is standing at the cashier, keeping my area clean. What I learned was to keep things nice and in order, always greet people with a smile. There really was no hard part to the job everything was fairly easy."
good,"I have had no problem with this company. However it is hard at times to complete tasks seeing as how few employees are allowed in the store at once. Other than that the work isn't extremely hard, just tedious."
good,"Dollar General is a great place for someone who loves to work, and would love to move around more in their work place. Also allows people a chance to have benefits to cover themselves and there famlies."
good,"I worked all shifts scheduled, most at night. Lot of heavy lifting and reaching over head, always cleaning and stocking shelves, but you would get something set the way they wanted today and in the morning you would have to move everything to another area of store."
good,I don't think the worker should have to unload a truck. It was a stressful place to work because it was unstable  and slow. It's hard to work at a place that is unstable
good,"Dollar General was my first job, it kept me on m feet and I had a lot of different things to do. I enjoyed working the truck the most. Even though I like Dollar General they were not giving me enough hours."
good,"It's an okay place to work for someone in college, a student, or a second job, but not for a family. You just don't make enough, and you'll have To do. Lot of overtime just to make enough. They never let me go home when needed and constantly smoke cigarettes outside and don't give me my breaks as should because they want to avoid the register."
good,"Dollar General isn't a good company towards it's employees. The thing that makes this job decent is your coworkers. I have stayed with the company because I was attending school. They're very flexible with your schedule and days off. However this all really depends on the manager you get! There is opportunity for advancement in this company which is nice. You can become a LSA fairly quickly, then ASM somewhat fast, like first year or year and a half. Becoming a store manager may happen within two to three years, and they earn an fair amount salary wise."
good,unorganized place to work.... Hard to get into a Routine with so many changes daily.. system fails daily. stressful job.... under New Management.. lot of changes taking place...
good,"A typical day at the dollar general was exciting because of the new and very different people that I would come across, I learned heavily from my manager and also the managers on duty. They taught me specifically how to be more organized and showed me much quicker and efficent ways to get my work done without over working mysef. I think that the hardest part of my job would be that while I was walking around the store stocking items that I couldn't keep an eye on the register while I was in the back of the store. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that I loved my coworkers. They made my day go by a lot quicker and easier and plus they were just great people to work with."
good,Enjoyed the productive workplace being that I loved the working at a pace. Workplace has great benefits and enjoyed the company cookouts and gifts awarded to employees.
good,This is a wonderful place to work IF management is on track. If management is messed with life at this job gets very overwhelming and hectic. I loved my job until my new DM fired my boss and basically threw everyone into jobs we weren't trained for.
good,"Not organized, pay is low, and always never have employees or no payroll,  they send you to other locations outside your home city and tells you they will pay for mileage but avoids employees when their mileage not on their checks, they asked me to transfer to another location in another city to help out and after I was done and located me closer to home  they cut a dollar of my hourly without me knowing, it's all messed up, I did everything they asked me even out of town and that a what dollar General treated"
good,Dollar General in Maben when I started working was a mess. There boss just quite. They only had assistant manger working the store. The employees there never wanted to work or do there job or put customers first. I believe they are in a better state now with a head manager and other key players. I just could not stay because of stress there and home life.
good,It was a good job overall. I mean I may not have been there that long but for the time I was there I had no problems with catching on to the job duties....They were also helpful with the situation I was given.
good,"This job was probably only kind of bad because of the area I was working in which was very ghetto and hood. Overall though the job wasn't bad, just the customers."
good,The problem with dollar general they didnt pay their people well at all but the company it self is great to work for other than a few mangers th3 manger i had wasnt very nice at all
good,"Overall, DG is a good company to work for. They are fast, friendly and strive for excellence. Your attitude is everything! You have to be a happy person."
good,Have to be able to lift a decent amount of weight. Multi tasking is very helpful. Help is always plentyful. Hard to keep stores clean which piles up assignments.
good,"A typicial day at work would be cashiering and doing a side project whether it be stocking product, setting planograms, or recovering product. You are always constantly doing something, but if you do it right, you'll be successful!"
good,"Working at Dollar general was a cool Job. A typical work day (being that the store was new to the are) was busy and a constant work flow. I learned almost everything about this company being that I opened up the store as a key holder. Management wasn't much to complain about, very laid back. The hardest part of the job for me would have to be running the store, dealing with customers and new hires all in the first days of opening. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a success in what I helped put together from nothing."
good,"the pay is low, for everything that they want you to do. The customers and couponers are a nightmare. Upper management has unrealistic goals for the staff."
good,"The job I preformed included driving a stow jack, I would pick an order book, drive my stow jack to each picking location, pick the amount of product needed according to the order book, and strategically stack it in my stow jack. I would do this until my book was gone, and I would take my stow jack to the shipping department, and unload my carts for them to be sent to the store. Then I would do the same process over again. Fast work. Management was not good though, they did not really care about employees."
good,Stayed busy. Learned new things. I enjoyed all parts of this job. The only thing that could have made this job better would be better pay and hours; no body wants to go to work for four hours.
good,You have to be very kind to those who surround you. Not a lot things will go the way you intend them to go but you do some of those customer that make it better. Building strong relationships with your customers almost help in the long run.
good,"At this location I only work weekends, so usually it is very fast paced and there is opportunity to get to know the regulars. There is ability for advancement in the company and you can learn a lot from different positions."
good,"I liked this job a lot. I had no complaints at all, other than the lack of hours. The management team was very helpful and allowed me my space to handle customers and complete my work."
good,it was okay. i like the people. but they will lie to you. I like my works and my job until they brought in a new store manager that only worked there for 5 months and does not know what she is doing.
good,I think that it is a good place to get some experience in to prepare you for something more serious. Not saying that you cant make a career out of it but the pay isnt exactly substantial and the benefits arent anything great until you really move up in the company.
good,Is a good place to work especially if going to school or needing part-time work.  Does have a high turnover rate with employees and management but advancement is good.
good,Staff is good. A good place to work. The patients are lovable and caring. The staff work together and cooperate together to get the job done. Excellent
good,The company was good. They don't do much to support the new managers. Hard to give a great review when you worked in the lowest rating store in a 100 mile radius
good,As a store manager you are on call 24/7. You are required to work 6 days a week. I get to met new people every day and are constantly thrown new challenges. I am always on the go and it's never a dull moment.  I am required to do a lot but that is expected to be with the title of store manager. I do miss my family and friends dearly and wish I could get more pay for what I am asked to do. The hours giving for payroll are small and whatever is needed to make it up in the end is done by me. I am supposed to work no more than 50 hours a week but it is more like 60 when I am lucky.
good,"boring job, not very fast paced at all, staff is okay but certain managers are rude, they have flexible hours . being a cashier you have to stock shelves while watching for customers because of low staff"
good,It is a good place to work but the only problem about it is that the theft problem at the store is high. Overall it is a nice place to work.
good,A great place to work on average note.   benefits were nice.  some flexibility with schedule.  Providing customer satisfaction was a honor and to supply a multiple of different products for all.
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work, but you can never get caught up.  Too much overstock and not enough room to put things.  Normally, that spells opportunity, but the money just isn't there to make it worth while, for most people."
good,Good company to work for but the big bosses dont listen to the little people. The company does have great insurance. And if you work full time you do get a vacation after a year.
good,"wonderful co worker experience along with management !"
good,"A Normal workplace, work load was reasonable, and training was good and concise. Management were well trained and patient, only difficult circumstances would be when a difficult customer comes through, but even then exhibit excellent customer service and continue the day. So overall not a bad place to start."
good,"It was a laid back environment and customer friendly service as well"
good,"Enjoyed my time there just needed a new job."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and my customers. It was very tiring and spent a lot of my time there. I didn't get very many days off and worked from open to close most of the time
good,"Great Team Work..."
good,"I enjoy the people I meet working at the Dollar General and I love my other co-workers, this position is just part time.  I usually only work 4.5 hours per week at this particular job."
good,This job is a lot of physical labor than you would at first thing it would be. You are paid a little above minimum to compensate for labor you will go through and it still isn't worth it
good,Ok place to work. Changed store hours didn't get anyone after 10. Need to follow everything by the book no matter what a manager tells you to.
good,"Stocking, helping customer, checking in vendors, filling out reports"
good,I learned how to help customers find what they were looking for.  I was always keeping a clean store for customers to notice and have repeat customers. I like to help when help is needed for customers and employees.
good,"I cannot say that DG is a bad place to work. Your attitude is a huge determining factor. Sometimes you pull the weight when others slack off and may receive the backlash from management. If you have a great team, it is worthwhile, as far as work environment goes. There are rude, mean, and awesome customers. Just take the bad with the good. If you aren't a people person, I'd recommend sticking to stocking. The pay rate begins at minimum wage and only increases with promotion. It is a great job for students or a second job because of the flexibility of scheduling."
good,"this is a fast paced work environment, and because of that there is alot of turn over. very stressfull job. the entire time i worked there i was never able to call off when i was sick because we never had enough employees. i was called in often on my days off, and it was not uncommon for me to work more than 10 days straight."
good,"I enjoy working with my customers everyday giving my positiviness also is a plus.My Managers are also very flexible for me if I ever have a situation with my children.I really love working with people ,so this job is really good for me."
good,"Working at Dollar General taught me how to be flexible with my time. Sometimes the manager would call me in to help organize the store. My job as a cashier included greeting customers with a smile, assisting them with their needs, providing good customer service, answering any questions customers may have, ringing up their items, bagging their items, and organizing the store so items will be easier to find for customers."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and leading my team. The hardest part of this job is the high turnover rate with the entry level employees. A downside to this job is the numbers of hours required of store manager. I often worked six-seven days a week with long shifts. A good side to working retail is interacting with customers and running the store efficiently.
good,"Great place to work, lovely associates. Absolutely love the inventory delivery methods. Palletized inventory makes it so much easier and more sanitary"
good,The store was in very bad shape. Not enough hours given to straighten store out . You are salary so 45 hr weeks turn into 65 hr weeks.Employees are mostly ppart time and paid minimum wage. Big turn around.
good,Company mandates you are there 6 days a week which is outrageous for any company to dictate that their employees.  I do think the company forgets about personal lives.
good,"This company is mostly a stepping stone for employees as they pursue higher education or part-time employment. I was able to enhance my customer service skills and abilities as well as conflict resolution.  For the most part, my co-workers were great to get along with, but like every career, there are bad apples that need to be weeded out."
good,Dollar general has a well balanced workplace with good management and co-workers. Help was always there if needed. Always on the go work environment. Customer service and stocking.
good,Not somewhere where you can grow. Fun place to work and learn better customer service skills. If looking for a career not a good place to start.
good,Management friendly but extremely low pay and minimum room for advancement.  Such low pay that the company has a pretty much revolving door policy.  High turnover rate because unless you are in the upper echelon of management you can work endlessly and never get ahead.  They do not care about their employees.
good,"Typical days at dollar general include managing employees, providing excellent customer service, managing payroll and producing a weekly schedule, resets and planograms, managing money, watching CCTV and stocking."
good,The days was fun at the time. I learn great things such as good team work and management. My co-workers taught to things that I needed to improve in.
good,co worker was very fun to be around but the environment was unclean and a typical day at work was always before after 5:00 ! I worked for this company for a while I enjoyed both stores I worked at . I transfer from one store to another because one was closer to home
good,Dollar General is a good store to work at if you like working all week with only two days off. Need more employees and better pay.
good,"a good company to work for. good training, customer comes first, they let you stock and check in vendor. the manager are good and workers are very helpful."
good,"I'd say I spend an equal amount running register, stocking shelves, and helping customers. I've learned a ton working here. In general I learned what its like to get a job and to keep one. I learned a lot on how to go about helping customers in a way that leaves them happy and satisfied. Prioritizing the tasks I have that day and time management is another major thing I learned wile working. "
good,"Very Nice place to store as a teen, Had issues with people there that i worked with that were disrespectful toward me but was always easy to avoid."
good,It was a job I needed for the money. The people there are incredible and really nice. The worse part is that you do see the uglier side of the community there at points.
good,"There really wasn't a typical day due to unforseen issues that would arise. But in general I would open the store recieve in vendors as well as recieve in a truck once aweek. I would do price changes, set plaograms, do scheduling, reporting maintanace issues. I learned that people in general are kind but can also show sides of dishonesty that you would not expect out of that particular person. Customer and co-worker alike. I wwould say that the hardest part was finding people to hire that would actually continue to work as hard and well as they did when they were first haired. Helping my cusstomers find what they were looking for or suggestting an alternative solution for them and getting to know what they liked and wanted."
good,I have learned a lot at dollar general and been given a great opportunity to advance.I had multiple years of manufacturing experience but wanted a life change and found that with this company.My co-workers for the most part are a joy to work with but as with any job you learn that your work ethics arent always the same as others.The hardest part of the job is keeping all the customers happy on a daily basis and managing to accomplish all of what corporate asks of you in a given time frame with limited amount of payroll.The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers.
good,I loved my job and the people I worked with was there awhile worked hard to get where I was. Customers were awesome had alot of thugs that would steal and tear the store up. Work all evening shifts which was hard to get task completed especially when you train new cashier every week. Needless to say I got fired for not getting task complete and working hard. I feel that was wrong and the store needs new management.
good,"I had nice co-workers, it was actually pretty easy once you got the hang of it, I will admit there were some bad days though when you would have to put up with rude customers though. But I guess that would be anywhere."
good,Great management! The employees were easy going and fun to work with.I would check out costumers and stock the shelfs.The hardest part about this job was dealing with the coupons.
good,"The job itself is highly fulfilling, and allows an employee to develop excellent customer service skills. The only problem is that many of the general public are very rude, and have limited understanding when it comes to being short-staffed, having aisles filled with items to stock, and the fact that employees and managers have little to no say in what product is delivered from the distribution center. "
good,"Open the store or close, sweep and mop, garbage, stock the shelves. Cashier, handling money, customer service. Co-workers were great to work with."
good,"Open store count cash welcome the consumer"
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General for the fast paced settings and the daily interaction with the customers. Most days had something new to do. I enjoyed the opportunity to use my problem solving and people skills in my day to day activities with the customers.
good,"Decent job , but not a carreer, it felt shallow and repititive i do not want to work here forever. to be fair its a great part time position"
good,"I enjoy working for Dollar General and love the interactions with the customers. my employees are great to work with and very helpful. "
good,I love my job. although i would love to advance to a higher pay scale. I am a people person and a hard worker. I am also very trust worthy. I'm sure if you contact management they will say the same.
good,"A typical day at work was busy. I had fun, energetic co-workers and I loved my customers. We all worked together as a team and got the job done. I enjoy working with the public."
good,"If you are a student, single parent, or just have a limited work schedule. Dollar general is a great place to work, they will work with your schedule as best as possible to suit your needs."
good,Working at Dollar General is fun and easy. You have the chance to meet new and interesting people everyday while making it a place customer will want to keep coming back to when think of getting their needs met.
good,good place new people everyday not much for long term but  a good filler for a couple of years.daily goals are a little much for cashiers and managers everybody else is cool
good,"I cannot put a review for this company. I don't feel like giving an explanation as to why they treat their associates they way that they do. I can say when you are hired, you are given a number, remember that number because you will be treated as such."
good,"I enjoy working at the Dollar General, it is a small store with only 2 employees working on the same shift. It can be very quiet but very busy as well."
good,Always busy either being a cashier and stocking shelves. Seeing familiar smiling faces everyday is a nice feeling. There are many opportunities to advance to something more than just a cashier.
good,"Dollar General expects a lot from employees with very little pay and no benefits for part time employees, which most are. Very few benefits for full time."
good,My Manager many times was trying to find something to fire me for. I couldn't get a new job in enough time and they found a reason to get me out. They changed the schedule daily so that it was so hard to schedule daycare it was just impossible
good,This job made my customer skills advance because you talk and greet everyone that comes in but the pay was not good and ended up finding a better job
good,Fast pace work place with wonderful management. Always the same things to do everyday of every week. My favorite part of the job is working close with my team to get our duties done.
good,"Ok place to work, but they set you up for failure, by asking to much out of the manager. They do not give you enough labor hours to schedule the help needed to keep the store maintained the way it should be. Other than having to work 60-80 hours a week, I enjoyed my job"
good,"Early morning start time with heavy work load. Usually, worked passed end shift schedule."
good,"Great entry level position for someone straight out of school to enter the workforce.  Management was ok, some co-workers were very rude to customers and used profanity"
good,"fast paced work environment. stocking was easy most of the time, things were very set. helped me with customer service skills and talking to people better."
good,"Good place to start at work.. They have good schedule to manage your time with family and job.... The management is good and responsible...My duties are use a register to collect the payments and organize and keep the store in good shape for the customers, clean the floors and answer questions about the products or the discounts in the store, among others.... The best part of the job for me is use the register, answer questions and organize the store..."
good,"The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with some customer, they can be very difficult at times. I've learned to deal with upset customers properly. Its pretty much a very easy job, I really dont like the fact that some co-workers dont do their job and get away with it."
good,Steady work environment. Always something to do. Got to meet a lot of interesting people. Stocking was fun. Management was easy to get a long with.
good,"daily paperwork, merchandising shelves, stocking, ordering. waiting on guests. i like working with the public. always changing the the store to each holiday"
good,"A typical day means lots of stocking. There's always more product to put out. Then there's always changes to be made on end-caps, seasonal areas. And this is what is to be done when you're also checking out customers. There is, of course, always a 'key-holder' on duty, along with a sales associate at the minimum. So the sales associate is given an assigned cash drawer for checking out customers. The key-holder (manager, asst. manager, or a sales associate who's been trained to be a key-holder) often takes care of new plan-o-grams/projects."
good,"productive and highly fast paced"
good,typical day at work and the morning come in turn the alarm off and punch in start counting the draws down and wait for other cashiers to come in to work. I learned about people skills working at this store you have to have patients and a good mind set. the hardest part of the job is watching product in the store but in overall the company was good to work for I learned a lot.
good,Most of the people were great to work with. I loved being assistant manager besides having a jealous employee getting me fired for my job. Lots of hard work but it was enjoyable.
good,I love my job at DG. I have been there for 4 years. There in the last yearwas a change that upset everyone. It isnt on the corp with the company it was just a the local level. If that were changed I would continue there. I am very loyal once I get into a job.
good,I like working in a fast paced environment and this is just that. I also love the people i work with. Granted something I dont agree with but that goes with out saying with any company one works for. But over all its not that bad of a company to work for
good,job is very fast paced and hard to balance life and work. Work is time consuming and constant even on off days. Averaging 70 hrs per week.
good,My weekly objectives are provided to me in advance which allows me time management around projects.I learned how to build a master budget for my entire district.
good,"Throughout my years working with Dollar General I have had the privilege of working with some amazing coworkers. I have working in several store locations under several different managers. They all had their ups and downs; however, in every store I worked in it was like being with family. All of the employees watched out for each other and helped one another with things like lending a hand inside or outside of work and at times ensuring everyone had something to eat for lunch that day. I enjoyed the family-like environment the most; however, after the years went on it was like I spent more time there than at home so that was the hardest part of the job."
good,"Beggars can't be chooser, so I am very grateful to have had the job with them. My main complaint would be pa y; At the store I worked at in Verona MS, I was listed as a cashier, yet I had to stock shelves, clean the entire store, help with inventory, all while assisting and checking out customers in a timely manner. The only other employee would be one manager. A manager of which didn't fully grasp her job. She was there for 2 years and a manager for a few months, yet didn't know any of the managerial responsibilities that I ended up having to do. So there I was...a cashier making a cashier pay of $7.25/hr, while doing my managers work, meanwhile there are workers in places like McDonald's who make a starting pay of $9.00/hr doing less work. Aside from the low pay, Dollar General is a pretty decent company that, I could see myself working at again (if I ""Needed"" to)."
good,"On a typical day, we'd be pretty busy. I'd be running the cash register and helping stock/recover the store. I've learned that it is alot of work to close down a dollar store. The management at the first store I worked at was awesome. But once I transferred, the management was more demanding and wanting what's best for the business rather than the employees. My co-workeres were always great and I've made great friendships from there. The hardest part of my job was catching thieves. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday."
good,"I learned to manage the time that was given to the store, it was very difficult as we were not given a lot of hours to accomplish the tasks that were assigned. I had a great team and they did their best to accomplish the tasks at hand. It was also difficult because District Managers changed so often."
good,"When I come in I am required to clean and greet customers ect."
good,Customer oriented environment. The most enjoyable part of my job is merchandising and building seasonal displays and the office duties. The hardest part of my job is doing what needs to be done on a daily basis in the amount of hours I'm scheduled. I've learned many things while on this job from time management to communicating and overseeing employees to office duties and responsibilities.
good,Great Company. Do have its ups and downs but overall great career if u want to gain retail experience.
good,"In working for dg ,I found it to be very time consuming working 6 days a week ,no payed holidays and being made mandatory to work on these days ...The work was acheivable with a productive crew which was very rare ..The work was physical and not hard but overwhelming at time with so many marketing strtagies changing at the same time.  The returning guest really made the job fun and,especailly when they knew your name and  you knew theirs."
good,"Prior to being assistant, I was a manager but voluntarily demoted myself to be closer to home due to my daughter being ill.  I opened and closed the store, monetary handling, bank deposits, went to different stores to help them open or close the stores down for rebuilding, also help in inventory.  Also ranked lowest shrinkage percentage in my inventory."
good,"Took this job thinking I could be a rising star for a company that is exploding in growth. I had * Management Stars * in my eyes! The sad truth is this, the company is extremely top heavy in profits, with the administrators getting wealthy off the backs of the everyday employees that work for minimum wage. Raises are the absolute minimum when rendered. Hourly workers have to work full time and overtime to meet basic living expenses while salaried managers work 60-80 hours per week. "
good,"Enjoyed working the company, but they were not willing to work with schedule when mother was diagnosed with cancer. Overall it was easy to move up in the company and they pay increases were fair and worthy of all the hard work and dedication needed to advance."
good,great company. low pay. stable work. enjoyed the laidbackness of the job.employees were like family.
good,On the phone helping customers with problems that had about whatever package that they recieved.
good,Bad section of town to work. Low pay. Company cares more about employee theft then customer theft.
good,You had to get things done in a timely fashion and management was always a test especially juggling school at the same time.
good,"My typical day at work is coming into the work environment with a positive attitude ready to perform at my full ability making sure that I am able to do part so that my co-workers, management team, and customers are not dissatisfied. I have learned from my current as well as past work experiences that the by having a positive attitude you are able to make a difference in someone's life by simply asking how his or her day is, smiling, asking if he or she needs assistance, etc no matter what job/career you have one's attitude can impact the successful of the company, as well as his or her opportunity for advancement."
good,"It was a good place to work,but not enough pay,and cant keep manegers,or employees"
good,I meet a handle full of very different people everyday I've found that  a challenge is a good thing it keeps me motivated to do my best and to learn from my mistakes. Management is more difficult because of the responsibility but it has shown me how to lead a team and to use time wisely. Co-workers are usually fun and make the day go by quicker but some make it worse.Hardest part was dealing with angry customers. I loved interacting with new people daily.
good,I learned a lot of good skills there. I just didn't earn enough money and the benefits didn't really help and were too expensive.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General for me when I was employed there was busy and always fun whenever I conversed with customers and other employees. The things that I've learned while employed there such as: providing excellent customer service and always giving one hundred percent when performing my duties paid off because I was one of the most recommended sales associate there at that time by the customer and my manager at the time loved the way I performed and managed my time at work. My co-workers were very easy to get along with whether if we were on the clock or off, we also love to complete heavy task together like stocking inventory once truck day came. The hardest part of the job I would say is trying not lack motivation and try to continuously show my manager that I was a great employee but, the most enjoyable part of the that job was seeing each customer leave with a smile even if they might have came in the store mad some how I would just get lucky enough to give that person something to be joyous about before they left."
good,Low pay - Low hours... only male on staff.. harassed daily by women on staff.. did learn how to manage a store..
good,"I loved going to work, my co-workers were great and the customers were wonderful. I was there for three months and worked very hard and got the Assistant Store Manager position. I really did love my job but as things go nothing lasts forever. I got injured on the job and they made me file a workers comp claim and after it was all said and done I was the one who got hurt and then was made to resign. Sadly I resigned from there and I really miss my job."
good,you have to work all hours. when the weekly truck comes in you have to schedule accordingly. the district manager is a great man and very helpful when you need him. the hardest part of the job is being away from home so much do to the hours you have to work weekly to keep your store in shape
good,Just your normal around the corner dollar store. The workers were yound boys that came to work and did what they had to do to get a pay check.
good,I was bullied by both of my managers to the point of tears. Yvette from south Williamsport store was constantly on my back about everything. And Dottie from the Jersey Shore store hated me because I gave her a two weeks notice because I was going back to school.
good,A Great Small Company To Work For. Friendly customers low low prices
good,"Dollar General was a proactive place to work I was a cashier, and stock the shelves, front faced items at the end of the day. You stayed busy. It was located in a bad area, and we were robbed at gun point. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay there afterwards. The bests part of the job was converstating with your regulars and helping those who needed the help. My co-workers and management team were very helpful and kind."
good,Very easy job as a stocker and cashier.  Not so great pay.  Management was easy to work with
good,"A typical day at work would be coming into the store and clocking in, look at the task wall for the day to make sure of your duties that are to be completed before your shift ends. Greet and assist all customers you see in the store. Periodically watch and walk around the store to seek out people of suspicious acts. While communicating with other workers through walkies-talkie. I am learning that I am a very focused and detail person when it comes to stocking and management appreciates my work ethic. My co-workers are great to work and are very reliable. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming in to work with people love being there as much as you do."
good,almost everyone who worked there were enjoyable to be around especially the manager. the best part of the job was connecting with the customers and the worst part was shortages in the money
good,"• A typical day consists of recovering the store, working the cash register, aiding customers, counting cigarettes, and closing the store at the end of the work day."
good,"Open store, handle customer concerns, drive sales, freight management, many variables occur during the day to distract you from your daily planner, you must be able to multi-task and handle operation in the order of importance."
good,"My day at work is good, I enter act work all kinds of people and check customers out, and stock the store, the hardest part of about my job I would say is, there really isn't a hard part, its really what you make of your job that determines if its hard to you or not."
good,"The Pay was not good , They try to put you at a different store everyday."
good,"Great customer relations, friendly co-workers, a great local company."
good,"Cashier"
good,I would open my store then usually get my cashiers started and go on with my customer service duties.
good,"Daily tasks are assigned, anything from stocking the store that day to managing vendor deliveries. I have learned at this job what it takes to maintain a store and keep your staff busy. Management would give me a list of tasks that needed to be done for the current week. I then would determine what was of most importance and assign them accordingly to the associates that day as well as myself based upon performance and strong points of those working. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was always staying busy and being able to communicate with everyone working to make sure the store stayed at model level for the corporation."
good,"Dollar General is a good place to work, my manager and upper management has an open door policy and actually listens to the workers. Most co-workers are hard workers and good people. There is nothing hard about my job I enjoy it, and look forwards to going to work, especially seeing all the friendly customers who come i just to say hi. A typical day consist of checking in vendors, checking for new planograms, working out freight, cleaning up the store and parking lot, counting all registers, making nightly deposit, running end of day reports, locking the store at night."
good,Job can be high stress at times but overall it was a good work environment. 
good,"A typical day is usually not too bad; customers that are consistent become friends, and time goes by quickly!"
good,"Employees, were very nice to work with. Management was great. I enjoyed my time there however I was only there for a week due to number of robberies and was uncomfortable. "
good,The job was a good job but there was a few problems like the hours and the tings they wanted us to do. there was some week when we worked 12 hours and some when we worked 6 hours. They will fire you for small things like if you drop paper on the ground. some people couldn't help it when you have to meet your percentage at the end of the week.
good, I had very long hours; hard on having a family. There was a lack of communication a lot of times between upper management and lower management. I have to say the benefit were good and so was my salary. With everything else I still enjoyed my work and my accomplishments with the company.
good,"   Dollar General started as a great place to work and begin a career. DG is why I am currently enrolled into school for business administration with a specialization in marketing and management. I worked hard for Dollar General for almost a total of 5 yrs. I had to move to GA after my divorce, but couldn't transfer there wasn't any positions open at the time. I resigned from DG and as soon as a position opened up I got back in. After working in GA for a yr. I agreed to go to a store nobody in my district wanted. I worked very very hard in this store trying to prove to my DM that I was store manager material. "
good,good job. I loved working in the nursing home with the residents.
good,"a typical day at work was counting the tills, doing the daily bank deposits, running register when needed, checking in the vendor orders when they arrive for delivery, and putting out stock when needed and did freight when the truck arrived every friday. co-workers where alright to work with, some a bit chatty, the hardest part of the job was dealing with high school drama between certain woman who worked there. The most enjoyable part was being in management and having the opportunity to be apart of the team."
good,"A typical day included stocking and being a cashier, and helping customers find what they need."
good,i learned alot from the company and was able to grow as a manager. Until the last store I was employed by. The store manager was new to the company and was fearful I was after her job so she set me up to be fired.
good,On my feet all day with my coworkers ordering me around like a dog.
good,I love to work around customers and this place kept you busy and have lots of learning opportunities.
good,"The hours are long, the work is hard, and the wages are low, but you advance quick and are able to travel and meet a variety of people."
good,"As far as the job goes it's fine for what it is, minimum wage cashier. My location is in a very small town where it's hard to juggle hiring employees (there are only so many) and getting the work done according to company standards. My manager works hard and cares about the store and her employees but upper management is from a big city and doesn't seem to understand her particular problems. Instead of finding ways to help her, they blame her."
good,I would do inventory on any items and merchandise
good,"Ran the cash register, also stocked shelves. was a very fun job."
good,"Great Company, great people, easy work. no breaks, retail hours not the greatest all in a good a good company"
good,helped customers and enjoyed helping them.Learned to lead other associates and check in vendors.Management wasnt the best.People very nice.Doing my work plus somone eles.Seeing my work done on time.
good,"Work day was always busy and I love to stay busy. I learned that not all people can adapt to pregnant women, Management was great till we received a new manager, Co-workers were wonderful and kind, hardest part of the job was being made to lift a 50lb box when your 3 months pregnant, I enjoyed helping the customers and working with my co-workers."
good,"very fun enjoyable in every way by dealing with customers.I learned how to be a cashier how to stock an unload the truck managment was very good,co-workers was very helpful to one another hardest part was dealing with customers that had a bad day.The most enjoyable part was getting 30+hoursa week."
good,wish i still worked there. i would be a store or regional manager by now.
good,"I go in at 8am and i work the register. If I am not on the resgister I am setting shelves in the store or I am putting up stock.I htink management could be better.I have good co-workers, some are more fast and advanced than others. I believe the most enjoyable part of my job is making the customer happy."
good,"The typical day was stocking shelves while cashiering the store was usaually hot. Store managers are ok, upper level management over micromanaged store. Hardest part of job stopping theft while doing job description"
good,"Work was fun at times, i didnt really learn much but my manager was great. My coworkers we're friendly. The hardest part of the job was finding where everything was and the most enjoyable part was getting to know my customers."
good,the hardest part of the job is the short hours a week if you are a cashier
good,Flexibility and good-natured patience are personal skills that can be picked up here. My managers seemed genuinely interested in my well-being.
good,"A typical day at work involves multi-tasking through constant changes and challenges that employees undergo on a daily basis with the company. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the constant changes throughout the company on the store level with absolutely no consistency within any area of the business. My colleagues are invaluable, but are human and are capable of human error from time to time as well as the management staff. The most enjoyable portion of the job would have to be the relationships built within the company among colleagues and customers."
good,I had very good co-workers We seemed to work together very well.
good,"I was hired as an assistant manager, and within just a few months I became the Store Manager, It was my job to oversee all store operations,everything- I also represented the company at job fairs, certified/tested assistants, and participated in OSHA meeting and training. I really enjoyed this job, I like being a leader as well as training others!"
good,"Seems to be a good job, I only had problems with some management which is now gone. But watch out they WILL give u a bad reference"
good,This job is very demanding and lost of over time.... it's a high speed job with long hours. But the pay is good and the management are there to help you. I work night there..
good,My experience wasn’t very good due to upper management. I was working here as a senior and I was left doing more work and having more responsibilities. It’s not a bad place to work as long as everyone works and does their own part.
good,I loved my job when I had a certain  manager there but when they left and had a step in manager things got a bit disrespectful. While being a customer shopping with my kids they felt the need to correct me on something that could of waited till I was on the clock and in private instead of infront of everyone in the store
good,"As soon as I arrive to work, there was always a good warm feeling when i walk through the door. Everyone would be at their station and working as a team."
good,I would work very long hours in the store by myself most of the time. The manager at the time was not very consistent at all which eventually led to me leaving the company quickly.
good,"The people are great but the pay isn't enough for all that we do. And as asst. manager I get called in at ALL times of day. I need more consistent hours to be home with my family."
good,Good  job to work if you don’t mind hard work very busy and fast pace but not a lot of payroll for workers  to  keep  stores stocked  and cleaned.....
good,Great company. The only thing that I would say that was challenging was some of the customer that came in and out. But other than that Dollar General was a  great job.
good,i dont know yet hopefully i get a job there the times i have been there to do some shopping i thought it would be a nice place to work because the employees were always nice
good,Most people think it's an easy job but it isn't. It's very strenuous work. Working with the public is never an easy job. I enjoyed my customers and coworkers but the time they allow for putting away a truck before getting a new one is almost impossible for how many hours they give to spread out.
good,"I enjoy working with the customers that come into Dollar General on a daily basis, and I enjoy my responsibilities, however there is more work to do then Sales Associates are allowed to work and therefore there are not enough hours and very low pay unless one decides to quickly move up in the company."
good,It’s a very fast paced job the work life balance isn’t too good but it’s not a bad job. The company needs to more attentive to their employees pertaining to the workloads and equipment in the store.
good,"The company is gradually expanding. There are good benefits but the pay is extremely low for the amount of work that you are required to do, and not to mention you have to deal with rude customers all day."
good,Dollar General is a nice place to work. You will get to learn how to do things quickly. Another thing is that it is fast paced and keeps you busy. And most of the staff was very nice.
good,"Working for Dollar General was incredibly  easy but the pay was too low to be able to survive without government assistance and/or a second income. It's best suited for someone who doesn't have much as far as financial  responsibility. "
good,Ran the register and waited on customers.stocked the shelves.opened and closed the store.counted money and did closing paperwork for the day.you had to go back and forth between stocking and waiting on customers
good,"It's fun to learn new skills that I can apply to checking out customers and stocking. The pay isn't too great, and I'm hardly getting any hours as a sales associate, but it's a nice place to spend your day away from home."
good,"great place for starting out In the work place most places pay well above minimum wage, the con to that is no work life balance. Also be prepared to get lots of different reactions to saying out loud that you work for them lots of different opinions of the company !"
good,"I absolutely loved all of the district managers I had while working for this company, they did a wonderful job working with me and doing all that they could for me and other managers. I would work for them again at a different company. I enjoyed my responsibilities at the store. I loved setting MAG, running the truck, office management, and all of the pieces included in running a great store. I loved being able to look at the store and feel proud of myself for what I accomplished and maintained  But, the company seemed to be very greedy in not providing the payroll required to maintain the store so I would have to work way too much in order to get everything done and do everything myself. Before I had my son, this didn't bother me. I love to work, but I really value having that time with him and it is more important to me to not throw these special moments away for a company that does not seem to care. I love being a manager so I hope to find a company that does."
good,we meet in the morning assess the day and drive to get our goals met on time if early. that time management is key. team players is a must in the work environment. learning new things everyday.
good,One of the easiest jobs I've had. Not hard to learn and advance. Fast paced environment. Weekly pay was really helpful as well. Management was wonderful where I worked.
good,"Too much responsibility for not enough pay. Responsible for closing deposit at end of night and must take to the bank. "
good,This store was great to learn customer service and patience.  I'm a very needy clean organized person so I was constantly cleaning out expired items or cleaning underneath stock shelves or making sure items were off the floor. The customers can be friendly or rude you need to take it the best way possible.
good,It is a pleasure workimg for dollar General I had a beautiful store manager she was kind and caring in everyday understood my personal life and worked around my busy days. I never recieved any benefits as I was not full time. The pay is garbage as they pay minimum wage.
good,Working here has been enjoyable for the most part. I was responsible for hiring and training of new employees. I did payroll and scheduling for up to 7 employees. I delegated tasks to ensure strengths were properly utilized and weaknesses could be improved.
good,Not the best to work for but ok they had a lot of problems with district managers while I was there.  We switched district managers at least 3 times in a matter of 1 year.
good,Working night shifts gets pretty busy and hard to multitask. Line will get long with only one cashier working up on the register. Customers complaining about discount price.
good,I had a worth while time With the company. I asked every One of my customer for donations that they were collecting at the time. i led the store in it. i learned a lot of lessons that carried me one through my other jobs.
good,Very laid back from what I’m used to. Just wished the pay was more from my experience. Family dollar pays a lot more . I have over 10 tea customer set/assistant mgr experience
good,"Working through Dollar General, it is an alright environment to work on, but it's not as consistent with usual work days. It can go from having a group of workers doing their jobs accordingly, or have just two people running the entire store which at times even prevent you from taking breaks (because of how hectic it can get), and you know for sure that you can't get the work done. A lot of the co-workers are super cooperative and very nice; when asked for a favor they do it right away, and vice versa, cause we all have the same goal to accomplish, to make sure the place is clean, the customers are helped out, and all the misplaced items are back where they belong. We have faced shoplifters and would confront them, but if they try to run off with it, we don't have any security in-store to prevent it from happening."
good,I have grown and learned a lot from this company.  Working with others and customers  daily.  Keeping  my store in great  shape. Just looking to progress in my learning.
good,I enjoyed my job. We just had a hard time with people sticking to the rules but that's anywhere I believe. We were no successfully trained so people had their own way of doing things and it wasn't the dollar general way
good,I enjoyed working there.i was 3rd key.i did everything the store manger did.great work environment.good place to expand on custermer service skills.i opened closed the store
good,"It started off a good college job, but I lost interest after the first year and stuck with the job out of necessity. It's a great temporary job but gets old fast. The higher-ups tend to give more and more responsibilities and tasks to the workers over time. I am also fulltime but rarely get above 28 or 30 hours a week and it is hard to live off of that. I lost interest and passion after the first year."
good,"I've been well trained and the current manager is doing her best to make sure everyone gets to work, but corporate refuses to give hours despite the increase in customers. Making it hard to maintain the store, and pay my rent."
good,"Dollar General can either be constant productivity or laid back, just depending on the volume of the store and management. Overall, this job is not hard at all."
good,Working 60 plus hours 7 months pregnant and the dm did not care at all I ended up having my water break early from working too much and being overly stressed....
good,"Great environment for those in school or fresh out of college"
good,"Being a Dollar General store manager can be exhausting. With not enough payroll and high expectations, it can be hard to keep up even working 60 hours a week."
good,Im a good learner and a real good helper im good with people and communication i would like to do part time because im in school for cna so i can have time to do my school work
good,Thus is a great place to work with a great manager. Flexible hours. But the pay is not enough. Great co-workers. 401k is the only benefit you get as part time. Nit enough hours.
good,She often played favorites with other co workers and was rude to other ones. She was even rude with some of the customers as well. Just wasn’t a very good manager in my opinion.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar General. I am the type person that likes to stay busy. i was a Keyholder to start and was promoted to asst. Manager within a short time. I helped customers if they needed assistance in checking prices, taking there merchandise to there vehicles,  searched stock room for products that was not on the shelves if someone requested it. I made deposits, counted money, anything that was required of me."
good,"I liked working with company as a cashier, but there's definitely room for improvements regarding hours per week and hourly pay for entry level positions (cashiers and stockers). but like many people's perspective, I'm better off with a job than without."
good,It was a busy workplace and always something to do since there are generally only two people working at night. Opening shift comes in two hours early to stock the store so its an early start.
good,"It's a great place to work, flexible hours, great people, and a great first time job. The only downside is once you get promoted the harder it is to keep moving up."
good,"Dollar General was a good place for me while attending college, my goal was to stay out of debt and it served that purpose nicely.  However, my experience isn't typical as I understood it.  The overall quality of the workplace depends on the location, and who is running the store.  "
good,"Cashier, customer service, stock and cleaning. I would work 8 hours shifts and my co-workers were easygoing and easy to get along with. I liked this position."
good,Loved working there it's an awesome job but pay it's that good. They have awesome benefits as well but only for full time employees and you don't make enough to cover the benefits and pay bills
good,As a store manager for Dollar General you have a lot of responsibility and must excel in fast pace high pressure job.  If you work hard and hire right your store will succeed and your job gets easier and productive.
good,As this job was fast paced some of the other workers only cared about themselves unless you wasn’t busy then they wanted your help. A lot of the workers stood and played on their phones instead of working.
good,The people are amazing but the pay isn't as good as is should be. Some managers shouldn't b a manager.  Working on certain holidays like Thanksgiving isn't fun when everyone should be with there family.
good,This dollar general was chill nothing out of the ordinary from what you expect from a job but don’t be lazy and just do your job and everything will generally be okay
good,Dollar General has plenty of opportunities for advancement. It is an ok job to work if you like the fast pace retail kind of job. The work load is hard because hatchet want you to do a lot of changing of the season while still taking care of customers and there is a lot of deadlines to meet.
good,"Competitive pay but not enough labor hours to get the job done. "
good,"Comfortable working, no problems with the workplace. Everybody was friendly and worked together to get the job done. On first day they trained really good."
good,"Depends on the management it is really a good job "
good,"If this job was my first job, I don't think I would have cared, but it was my third job. I enjoyed the fact that the pace of the job was very relaxed. Although, I did not like the fact that I pretty much never got even 20 hours a week the entire time I worked there."
good,I learned how crucial it is to take every second of the workday serious and remain focused on productivity. This company also instilled in me that customer satisfaction is just as important as productivity.
good,company phrase should be live to work. managers usually work 6 to 7 days a week. Being able to take a vacation is also difficult. Though i did enjoy the people i worked with and i enjoyed what i did.
good,I liked working there but the manager kept taking my hours and was under paying me I was always at work and my overtime that I made I would never see it on my check.
good,"Starts at minimum wage, goes up by 25cents a year or with promotion. Flexible scheduling but evenings are required. The environment honestly depends on your manager and the team the build around them. Not a bad job but not really a livable wage."
good,This was my first job. I liked working at Dollar General. I was excited and happy to go to work all the time. My co-workers were soooooo helpful and never made me feel like I was annoying them whenever I had a question. The managers there overall were easy to work with.
good,not all managers where serious about their jobs and some liked to slack off during shift hours. the employee break room was not very useable and the staff was not all together friendly.
good,I left my position at Dollar General for a job in my field of study. By doing that I left behind an overworked and underpaid store manager that has had no help from his higher ups.
good,"It is a nice place to work as long as you can multi-task and have good customer service. The hours are flexible, but managers are required to work a minimum of 48 hours in a week."
good,My time at Dollar General was fine until my last manager. The hours she made me work were inconsistent & did not allow me to have any time with my family
good,Easy to ask for time off but they have no empathy for unexpected situations. High insurance cost that don't really cover much.  Production expectations can be unreasonable on busy days.
good,"Usually, everything runs pretty smoothly on a day by day basis so long as everyone cooperates. Depending on the manager, it can actually be rather too high of expectations or just reasonably high enough so you're not running yourself into the ground. The hours are there if you actually want to work and not just there for a paycheck. I'd say the hardest part is whenever you have to work alone for a couple of hours because it's much harder to get things done when it's busy. The second hardest thing would have to be when someone calls out at the last possible second or doesn't even bother showing up which make it difficult to get someone else to come in if the hours are already low or if the store is low on employees to call in. Also depending on the manager, you may learn a lot of new skills or you'll end up having to figure it out for yourself, such as ordering supplies for the store, checking in vendors, or how to set a planogram."
good,I had a really good store manager who was really helpful with anything. I needed extra hours to pull some money he let me as long as I didn’t go over 40 hours
good,"As a cashier, it was a great job, plenty of hours and a lot to do. As a manager however there was no balance between life and work because you're always on call."
good,Overall working at Dollar General was a good experience. Working with the public and learning new things everyday was great. There is always something to do.
good,"This store is higher volume and a lot of work, but I also enjoy working with my co-workers. A typical day of work could include stocking shelves, resetting planograms, directing the other employees, assisting customers, etc. The environment of the store varies on the customers you get and what day it is. During weekdays it's less busy, but on the weekends it gets very busy. During the holidays it is busy almost every day. The most difficult part of the job is when the seasons transition, there's new planograms to be set, and on top of that your store is receiving a 1500 piece truck that has to be done i 3 days. Needless to say it gets stressful at times. Thankfully we have a great staff at our store so these tasks are manageable. The most enjoyable part is working with a kind, hardworking crew, and having flexible hours so there's a balance between working and your outside life (especially if you're going to school). Also, it should be noted that the pay isn't great, but if you're looking for a job to get you through school (or anything of that nature), this is a good job to have."
good,"Dollar general was a great place to get to know the people in your area. However, the downfall was not enough pay and not enough hours unless you were management. I worked under the supervision of an amazing man. It was a pleasure working for him."
good,Too Many Tasks To Complete Without As Many Hours To Complete Them In . Overall A Good Place To Work If You Wanted A Side Job For Extra Money & You Are Able To Conduct Yourself In A Positive Manner When Undergoing Various Stressful Situations .
good,Dollar General is a great job for growth. However it is important that you can do good under pressure because the store can get really busy at times. The team is very welcoming so if you ever need help with anything don't be afraid to ask.
good,It's an easy learning experience and you're always busy. If there's customers you ring them out...if none...you stock shelves or move items on shelves. Pay was minimum wage for me as a cashier. Manager was awesome and down to earth and easy to reason with ya.
good,Dollar General is a great place to work as a second job because the hours you want are not always guaranteed. It is a busy store and does not have enough of hours for a descent weekly paycheck.
good,This is the best job ive ever had  its such a positive enviroment every day i look forward to comming to work my fellow co-workers are so amazing we help each other and build each other up the customers are happy 98% of the time
good,"in a nut shell....  shifts are 4 to 5  hr long  so you have the rest of the day to do what you want.  while your working  they expect all takes to be completed and store clean, and out of the store no later than 10:15pm."
good,"Pretty good job, but must have good customer service skills and patience.Flexible hours and getting to know the ""regulars"" needs/wants is very beneficial."
good,"gave me a chance to learn a lot about the planning and approval process that goes into commercial projects ,also time management and running multiple jobs all over new york state ."
good,its always work very busy the truck hard a typical day at work is punching the clock in taking care of customers the customers who makes the day go by.
good,"Great benwfits to offer n other programs within the company ,but its told to onw unless we look. Schedule can change within the week once it has been posted .management forgets aome thinga n claims wasnt told to."
good,Great company with advancement opportunities. Great culture and co-workers are more like family. The most enjoyable part of my position is the time I get to spend with my co-workers.
good,Dollar General was a great company for me to gain knowledge and experience in the retail business. Supervisor was very helpful at teaching me shrink prevention and customer service. Overall a great learning experience that I can carry with me.
good,Dollar General is a really friendly environment with great customers who you can build a strong relationship with. I would tell a friend to work here asap.
good,Best choice I made but they over work thier Store Manager very high standards  alot of internal advancement opportunities. Pay could be better for the expectations
good,"The work experience was worth it, I met a lot of new people I never thought I would ever come in contact with. My managers did their absolute best, but honestly the district manager was not worth his position."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy working with the public and assisting customers. On the job training available and room for advancement pretty quickly.
good,"Job asks a lot for what normal pay is, if you find a good manager you will be able to be happy at work. Customers can be hard to deal with since this is discount retail. Good first job for 18+, good for building a resume."
good,"They are great company and many good people just making a living. I enjoyed a ton my time working for them, they treat people fairly, and loss prevention does fair investigations, also the DM's they hire are really smart and know their stuff."
good,This was one of my first jobs out of high school. It was not a bad retail experience at all and the work was not too hard for someone who had never done retail before.
good,It was a fun place to work great customers and a pretty laid back job.I enjoyed the regular customers that came i their smiles made the job worth while and began to build a connection with them.
good,Dollar general employees are very nice and will take time to help you adjust to the new work. You will at times encounter working with many different people and never be afraid to ask questions
good,"I always did a really good job up there but with really low hours and management always on our butts about little things was no fun. i was always stressed about the job and hot to make ends meet with what little hours they gave me. but overall, i liked the position i was in"
good,The work environment was ok. I learned how to be resourceful. it was a great first job. i learned how to be creative and how to overcome obstacle. the people with nice. I liked my manager.
good,"Lots to get done on a daily basis with crazy schedule. greeting customers and assisting them when needed."
good,My job at Dollar General is pretty easy. I'm a cashier and I also stock too. My jobs and its pro's and con's to it. The pro's you get to meet new people and also socialize with the consumers. Some con's the consumers always right even when they not right. You also have to deal with their attitudes too.
good,Dollar General is a nice place to work.  They receive a lot of freight with limited space.  Fast paced environment. I left reluctantly because of a racist comment from my supervisor.
good,Working for Dollar General taught me a lot about the kind of manager that I was always meant to be. I was very level headed and calm under even the most stressful times.
good,This was a good job. The days were fast at times and slow at time I didn't work here that long. In all honesty I was young and still living with mom trying to find my way
good,People where nice but pay wasn't great. Always doing the same thing over and over again. No room for learning a lot of new things. Wish I could of got paid more.
good,They label me as full time but only promise a minimum of 29 hours a week and on average I only get 33-35 which is not full time. They don't appreciate they're employees and much as they should either
good,I learned how to compromise with people for scheduling. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out how I was going to give so many people the same requested day off. The most enjoyable part of my job at Dollar General was meeting so many new customers. A lot of the customers became very close friends to me. It always felt so nice when customers would ask directly for me or were happy to see me.
good,I'm a hard worker and very dependable.  I'm ready for something different in my life. I can't make it on my own with a minimum wage job. I'm tired of retail.  I don't like fast food or factorys.
good,Loved the job. I moved up from a key holder to getting my own store in seven months!   Unfortunately  the  District manager in my region was very  unprofessional and hard to work for.
good,I loved my customers & coworkers! I loved getting up and going everyday! Stocking kept the day going along with taking care and helping the customers. Unfortunately I had quit because I was promoted to a key holder and wasn't being compensated properly.
good,the pay or hours could be better team is pretty good  there is no employee discounts or health plan....................................................
good,I wouldn't work here if it weren't for the people included. The management was ok. Due to unexpected family issues I had problems with attendance. I feel like the people there are underpaid.
good,"The day at Dollar General. I come in and count drawer for my employee or myself. Inventory check was the hardest part of my job you had to know how much to order, and what not to order. I enjoyed working with my employees at Dollar General."
good,This was a great place to advance but the turnover rate was high. Really enjoyed working with customers and helping keep the store nice. It was actually fun to stock and set things up.
good,"Once you learn the job and who all the regular customers are it's easy to make your day fun and have some laughs.  Very low stress.  I love my Boss! I was asked to become a store manager at one time, that would be the farthest I'd be interested in going up in the company.  The benefits of that particular added responsibility don't add up to the flexibility I wish to keep at this job. I see many people start out who complain about the usual things like hours, pay, breaks; those who don't stick with it either have never had a real job or are actually good at everything and find a better job and move one.  You have to be personable and have retail sensibility- it's so adaptive."
good,"I have worked at Dollar General for a few months now as a truck unloader and relief cashier (only on weekends), and thus far I have no real complaints."
good,I loved my job at DG . I knew my job well and my customers . My employees where great at what they done and we kept up . My manager was awesome and she taught me a lot and done her job super .
good,The store needs more people .So customer do not have to wait inline for ten minutes until someone else comes up and help.They put up holiday item to early.
good,"Very fast paced retail discount store.  Not always staffed appropriately. Sales Associates were expected to interact with customers in a positive way, being friendly and outgoing."
good,"*stocking, clean, customer service, and cash handling"
good,Enjoyed the staff I worked for and the customers that came in daily. Learned alot about management from my store manager who was very patient and kind.
good,"A typical day at work would be money handling  and customer service, stocking shelves and making sure the store was neat and clean for customers "
good,"my job at Dollar General was great when it came to dealing with customers and doing the work that inwas assigned ,but when it comes to the management team they need more help in theyre people skills with how they talk and treat theyre employees ,they are very inconsiderate in the way others have opinion veres theyre own .but overall it was an ok job to work"
good,"It is a good for high and college students but do not make a career. Advancement is kinda hard due the fact the people are in their positions and work hard to get there. So as a part time job is fine. Do not expect so many hours as part time, but you are school for a reason. plus it is minimum wage."
good,A typical day at this job is always meeting new people. I enjoyed when we gave back to the customers rather it was customer appreciation day or them winning a drawing from raffle tickests
good,"Dollar General was an okay place to work for. I believe the job is what you make it. No matter how busy or slow you are, it's you that decides to make your work experience great or not."
good,"I worked both morning and night shifts and I had a lot of tasks on my plate. Sometimes I worked over time and did not see any of it. I would work morning shifts and I would work the product while running the cashier register. Like I said a lot of multitasking and patience with yourself, management, and customers. The store manager and I were not really cordial with one another.The rest of the co-workers and I were applicable with one another.The hardest part was management and their constant pressure to put out product in a timely manner. I enjoyed the holiday season in the store."
good,Their wasn't nothing hard about this job.I just think the training was done in a good manner it was like as was told to do this do that with out hands on training.You are pretty much just thrown in the water and fend to swim
good,"I worked for Dollar General for 3 years. I would say that the job security was ok, but I was a part-time employee. The benefits were limited because of my part-time status. I enjoyed working for Dollar General. I enjoyed most of all, was the customers. The management was poor, lack of communication."
good,good company if you work hard. district managers can be a pain in the butt. I love my job and im really good at it they just dont ;like doing transfers even of it is for a hardship.
good,"I had a lot of work to do being a key holder, I had to look over other employees, had to do cash handling ,stock, returns, open and clothes the store"
good,the customers is what made me enjoy working a Dollar General I met so many people on both stores. Greet respect. the customers really loved when they were greeted so often as they entered into the store
good,"I absolutely loved everything about working for dollar general. Great place to work for, nice customers, friendly atmosphere. A typical day at dollar general was very productive, the management were motivating. I was always learning something new."
good,"I loved working at Dollar General.The place is awesome.I would come in and start stocking.If the lines got overloaded i would jump over there and open a new register.That is the hardest part of the job when you are trying to work as fast as you can and then people are yelling at you,but i had a awesome supervisor who would tell me just stay calm and do your job.The best thing about the job was when elderly people came in and i got to help them.That made me so happy and feel great about myself"
good,Hard work and heavy lifting required. You have to be willing to work past your assigned time to get off.  It was a good place to work.
good,"I was in the military, therefore you are always working. The pay was good. I learned many tings in the Navy and that's what i enjoyed most about the job."
good,A very fast paced experience.  A lot of multitasking required.  Have to have great customer service skills even in the toughest situations. The coworkers are great however there was only one cashier and one manager working at anytime but the managers are great. They are very helpful and patient.I learned how to better interact with  customers and increased my multitasking skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers who were very pleasant.
good,This company offers advancement if you produce hard work and have the ability to lead and dedication to provide to Dollar General.  This company is all about the numbers balancing family life is difficult.  But I do enjoy the challenge and pushing myself to perform my job at the best I can and have moved up quickly compared to other employees within the company.
good,"As long as you have good employees its easy to run a store, with the exception of hours. Not enough hours to give employees to accomplish tasks and to keep employees happy and which only left you with one day off a week. Hardest part was working alone or with few employees trying to get tasks done. Best part is making your own schedule."
good,dollar general is a nice place to be if everyone works as a team member.the people that works there give good customer service and the customers are always nice to interact with
good,I was cashier mostly. I had to stock some around the register area. I learned that the company didn't care about employees after the first robbery we had while I was employed there. No changes were made to make us more secure in the dark parking lot at night. I had great co-workers and bosses. Hardest part of the job was having to clean bathrooms and mop the floors at closing time. I really did have a great rapport with the customers.
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers, management and customers. Somed days the store was a little unorganized due to Cooperate or Devisional management not being organized."
good,"I enjoyed my days at Dollar General. I love the fast paced environment. My co workers were very nice and eager to learn. The hardest part of working here was truck day, You had to have the entire truck out by a certain time."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General consists of greeting and assisting customers, operating the cash register, and recovery. I have learned that in order for a store or company to operate well everyone must play a role. Management is good because you can display leadership and assign duties for everyone to complete given tasks. Co-workers work together and have strong communication."
good,"As a Store Manager, you have to really balance your daily activity from day to day. The main goal is to satisfy customers and earn their loyalty."
good,"I enjoyed every job they put me on there and I did the best I could do for them. But even trying as hard as I could I wasnt up to their standards, because they wanted me at 100% and the best I could get was 90. I am 51 yrs old and the people working with me were in their 20's having a hard time making rate. But management refused to consider the difference in age and left alot of good, honest hard working people go. I didnt see many happy people working there and I feel if people enjoy working in their environment they will do the best job they can do, even the ones making rate will get older with time. I saw a women taken to the hospital with chest pains because of how hard she was trying to make rate. Then they turned around and fired her, I watched people taken to the hospital because they got hurt from trying to move so fast they lost control of machinery or just pulled something or hurt themselves from jumping off machines before they completely stopped"
good,"I can't really say anything bad about all Dollar General stores, but this one was horrid! It was about nine months behind on everything, and the store was a disaster! That being said, it was an okay job, and learning how a large franchised store operates was really nice. "
good,"Typical day: Busy, non-stop, not enough time in a day to accomplish goals. "
good,"There was always something to do while I work so I could stay busy.  There was room for advancement and people willing to teach me management skills.  Not long after I began, management changed and I was able to learn how a store should actually be organized and operated."
good,"We stayed busy waiting on customers, stocking and keeping the store recovered. I got along well with my co-workers. I enjoyed doing the planogram resets the most."
good,my job was always on the go and rushing but I loved the busy part of it working our shipment down to delegating work to my co workers .truck days were the hardest but we all worked together and got it done with organization and time management
good,"A typical day was counting he money and opening or closing the store. Along with checking in vender, working  as cashier and customer service. most of my coworkers was easy to get along with and hard working. The manager was fair and always tried to make sure if you had a problem to help you out as much as she could. the most enjoyable part was the 4am stock shift."
good,It was a great place to first start working in the retail setting.
good,Learned how to correctly put away role trainers and break down boxes and to set in caps
good,"A typical day at Dollar General would require you to stand up all day ringing people up, or helping them find something."
good,"My day consists of opening/closing the store and working on the daily tasks at hand whether it be ad sets, planograms or monthly sets, as well as checking back stock or running truck freight. My co-workers are outstanding, hard working, friendly people. If i had to say what was the hardest part of the job it would be accomplishing task during very busy days, and other than that my job is very enjoyable."
good,"I loved my job working with customers. I didn't enjoy the attitudes of some of my ""higher up"" co-workers. I felt they were condescending towards me and made me do all the ""dirty"" work because I was new."
good,"Some of the times, the job services were not needed so i didn;t work"
good,"This is actually a great company to work for.  My only problem here was the district manager, who offered no support and seemed to throw road blocks at every chance."
good,i have used my skills and advanced them to the best of my ability. i get along with all co workers i come in contact with. the management staff try their best to help and provide with information needed to get the job done.
good,"I enjoy a fast paced environment where i am consumed by work to the point where i do not realize that the day has come and gone.As a  manager I enjoyed having a crew that feed off one another, where there weren't bickering at work, but a family environment."
good,Dollar General is a good job for extra money. The hours was short and the pay wasn't always good. but overall I enjoyed my job due all to my co workers who made Dollar General what it is. 
good,"A typical day at work is running the cash register until a cashier arrived, completed planograms, directed customers to items, stocked shelves, and counted money at closing time."
good,"Dollar General is a very high paced customer service oriented retail environment. A typical day consist of interacting with numerous customers, and checking in vendors. Each week the store receives a shipment of freight which the store manager and crew is responsible for stocking n 72 hours. This part of the job was VERY physically demandng. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with and serving customers. Throughout my tenor I learned that Dollar General provides opporitunty for advancement to its hardest workers."
good,i was store manager and there was always something that needed to be done
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is come to work. Then i would pull stock out of the back room. I was required to do 2 roll tainers per hour . I stocked chemicals,dog food and paper products."
good,ya never know if you will be there 5 or 10 hours or maybe more...somedays i spend it running from building to building to get things done and other days we are waiting for the trucks to be unloaded
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know all the regular customers.
good,My typical day was to come in and unload trucks and stock the shelves. Management was understanding and easy to work for. My co-workers where also fun to work with during my shift.
good,Its a great place to start working when looking for a job. Days that I work are good and hard. What I learn is having good customer service brings in good business. Managetment is outstanding they teach what they know to the worker so that the store can be ran in a professional way. The co-workerare fun to work with. There is really no hard part to tha job. The most enjoyable part about the job is we work hard as a team to get things done.
good,It's ok. They expect a lot of work to be done in a small amount of time. Working for my manager was great. She was very good at her job. They need to be a little better with their employees.
good,"A typical day at work consist of running the register, stocking, customer service, and cleaning. The management was nice and helpful. My co-workers for the most part were nice. The hardest part of the job was that it was extremely slow paced. I enjoyed the fact that the job worked with my school schedule."
good,"customer service, enjoyed working with people,it was fast paced,I dont like standing around doing nothing. I did employee schedules,hired new employees,unloaded trucks,always got along with my assistant and third key, my third key and I always were one step ahead and knew what the other was thinking. I opened and closed the store, did bank runs, paperwork matching invoices, end of the month reports etc. The hardest part of my job was the drive back and forth when I left my husband. Worked alot of ten to fourteen hour shifts, then drove sixty-seven miles oneway. The best part of my job was the challenge of the freight and my customers I loved my customers."
good,"Working with Dollar General was my first management position. I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. Benefits are good, schedule was decent."
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General, the environment was great.! By it being kind of a small business, not a lot of workers, me and my co-workers were like family. The customers were awesome.! You're going to meet a few rude, disrespectful people everywhere you go but the few that came through didn't bother me. The only thing I didn't like was the way employees came and went, some good some not so good. Overall, I really enjoyed working there and im still close to people who use to work there."
good,Loved working here. Team members were great. Customers were great. Everything above store level left a lot to be desired.
good,I don't call something I love doing work. I appreciate my stay there I really don't have much to say it was normal.
good,Benefits are good. You get to meet new people everyday. A typical day is when the truck comes in and you have to be able to get it straight along with working with the customers or helping the cashier with a problem.
good,"good fast paced work style, good advancement in jobs, close to home."
good,If you’re a good worker you sometimes over worked dollar general stops employees from getting overtime so if you like working this isn’t the job it’s also stressful but easy only bad think really is the little pay
good,I advanced within the company after three months from a cashier to Assistant manager 3/ Keyholder. Being understaffed about 85% of the time was one of the issues it had.
good,It can be pretty stressful but if your dollar general is in a small town some of the customers end up becoming like family. My own personal coworkers were amazing and helped made the job bearable they do however put a lot of their employees but for me the environment outweighed the stress
good,Dollar General is a great place to work.  They have good benefits including vacation days after employed a length of time.  There is room for advancement and pay raise based on competitive wages.  They are an equal opportunity employer.
good,Pay is good as well as benefits but alot of unfairness between shifts and alot of favoritism. Doesn't show much care for their employees aslong as the job is done
good,The management team were fantastic! I loved working there and only quit because I had a high risk pregnancy. The only downfall is not good pay or benefits.
good,"You would open at 8am, pull all of the equipment out front for customers to look through. Sometimes this job expects hard hours, long days and allot of time on you’re feet. The management is fair and understanding. Overall it is a great place to work if your are just starting out."
good,"High stress, physical demanding, tons of hours, hard to keep staffed store because even a cashiers job is not easy with low pay. Manager salary is good."
good,My experience being an assistant gerneral manager was quite challenging but an eventful one. If you are someone who like details merchandising and getting rhings done its a great job. People who need some flexability this is your job. My store manager was and is amazing. She has taught me alot about learning things and making them happen in an understanding way. She cares alot for her employees and makes sure to make them feel like her family.
good,"Great company, and a good place to work if you are not in management. Very little work/life balance as store manager, and there isn't many back up people if you have a family emergency or sickness."
good,"The job itself, as a cashier at a local store, is just fine. However, the work/life balance did not play out well during my time there while I was finishing my internship hours. This was something that was discussed upon hiring"
good,"You really learn quickly there being thrown to the wolves so fast. But still enjoyable to work, you get left alone a lot to as the only one in the store for several hours, most people don't do what their role is suppose to, so you'll have normal associates that do everything a key holder would do but don't get the title, shifts go by fast though because of the fast paced environment of being alone, but i still enjohed my time there."
good,"The pay was awful but other than that it was a pretty fun place to work.I started out as a team member and got moved up to a team lead within months. Boss always worked with me when I needed days off."
good,"they want you to do everything and you don't have alot of help doing the early morning, day and evening sometimes. they also want you to stock shelves and put merchandise away in a fast time and with no help."
good,"Over all it was a great pleace to have good."
good,"Great place to work, familiar faces come thru all the time. Easily managed if everyone is doing their part. Its a nice job to have, especially if you/re a people person."
good,Was a great place to work for the longest time. But I kinda felt like I was taking advantage of. I missed 1 day the whole time I worked there. Any time someone called into work they called me & I always came to their rescue. But never got a thank you or anything from the store manager.
good,"The job wasn't too bad, but the pay for being an Assistant Store Manager was pretty bad, and apparently what I had been making was even above the average pay for an Assistant. Benefits are included with the position, but that was the only benefit."
good,Very nice place to work at.. I have met alot of individual people from all over the world.. I really enjoyed there stories.. sometimes you have to deal with grumpy customers.
good,"there was lots of challenges with this company, it is a good company just have some issues with keeping  good employees which take a toll on the management crew. there wasn't many benefits to this position either, lots of hours for the pay"
good,Loved working the store. Not enough pay for the hours that I worked and never gave me enough people that I could hire. Theft was really bad in the area that I was in so that was hard.
good,Dollar General is a great starting point for working. Hours are available and hours are flexible with your everyday life demands. The only downside is the pay. I was fortunate enough to have a good manager that truly cared.
good,it was challenging at times when i worked there i did best that i could do that all you can really do at any place that you go to best you can do hardest just like any where else you work do your job everyone is happy
good,It’s a crazy place to work at I loved the job. But they don’t really work with you and it’s hard to keep staff in any store..  Ived gained so much experience and I’m thankful for that
good,"hours are just below full-time so you don't receive benefits, schedules alternate so no one is all morning or all night which actually makes work/life consistency not so consistent."
good,Dollar general was a productive and relaxed place to work. Keeping good employees was very hard for my dollar general because of how they treated their employees and how they promoted newer employees over loyal ones. The hardest part of this job was not getting paid enough and them just barely working around my college hours.
good,"As with most jobs in the retail field an entry level position at this company doesn't pay a lot but moving into management can easily turn it into a career.  Overall, I enjoyed working there and could recommend it as a good fit for many people."
good,"The tasks are very simple, but with very few hours in a given day to do it all. Sometimes workers are not given enough hours in the store and corporate still expects the store to get everything done."
good,"You end up doing everyone else's work, expect you to do roll tainers in a timely manner and work the front,low pay for hard work, key holders expect you to do there work aswell"
good,"Overall, This position is compensated very well, however it can be stressful. I would not recommend this job to anyone who has not had any experience in management"
good,I really liked working at Dollar General. It was my first retail job. It was a lot to learn. I was a keyholder for a year. I was able to open and close the store. Sign for deliveries. I made bank runs. It was a great experience.
good,"Good customer service, teamwork, cleaning make sure the store is clean and recovered.  Speed and making sure the money is right. Keep up with paperwork and keeping it organized."
good,"always had work to do, between inventory, cashiers, and customers. Work was never really stressful just had something to do at all times. Management was typically always open and if you needed time off it was generally granted."
good,I mostly word around the back area where i sticked most of the day and also cleaned. The only tool i probaly used was a pocket knife to cut the boxes open
good,"when I left DG it was because it was asking to much of their SM and asking them to work 60 hours plus a week, the SM was extra labor . I left due to the fact I felt I couldn't ask person to do what I knew I couldn't do myself"
good,the job was pretty laid back i had no problems with customers neither employees i would've like to receive more hours even though i was blessed to get the hours i did get
good,I highly enjoyed working for thier company and i was working towards becoming a store manager.  I loved our customer base and enjoyed the fast paced enviroment.
good,"Fast-paced,  quick stocking, my only real negative experience with this company was having a huge customer base and very low scheduled working coverage, which amounted to long lines and a few customer complaints"
good,"DG is a good company to work for however only managers are considered full time and eligible for benefits. My experience was good, fellow associates and managers were easy to work with."
good,"I like how much work you have to do, but you never know how many hours you work the next week. Your schedule is always random. I worked New Year’s Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Eve and didn’t get any kind of holiday pay for it."
good,Just like any other job in retail it is all down to your location. If you can find a great location with good people it could be something you could make a career out of.
good,"Normal duties were to zone merchandise, stock, and constantly run the register. The employees and management always have a smile on their face and a skip in their step. But although it was a good job, the hours and pay rate were absolutely horrifying"
good,"I had a great manager,  awesome coworkers. DG overloads their stores with merchandise its a never ending battle creating chaos and messy stores. UNFORTUNELY there are never enough hours allowed to schedule enough employees to keep order."
good,I had one manager to tell me i was fored bit gave me no reason why. But weeks later he quit and i was put back on the schedule.so all alone i never was fored he jist took me off the schedule and put that i quit.
good,"I received this store right when it was getting ready for inventory. I was forced to work day in and day out to get this broken store ready and cleaned up for inventory. All end caps and plantograms were wrong and years out of date. The whole store needed to be reset, and all the employees needed to be fired and replaced."
good,Working with people who you can consider friends is fun and helps the shifts go by in a breeze. The hardest part of the work is meeting the very strict productivity deadlines. They do not allow enough time to stock from truck while properly caring for the customers.
good,"Customer service"
good,"open store"
good,"Dollar General can be a slow of fast paced environment depending on the day. Here you will not only be a cashier but also a stocker, janitor and anything else the store needs that the managers do not feel like doing. Depending on where you work especially in the Clayton County area there is a high chance of getting robbed. Only take this job if you are really in need of money to live on or if you plan on becoming an owner of a Dollar General."
good,i enjoyed working at Dollar General and loved the ladies i worked with . But corporate gave too many duties to get done while trying to keep customers happy.  It could get stressful.
good,"You have numerous jobs to do as being a key holder. The pay is really not fair if your a key holder. We have to face everything, clean,, store  reports, bank deposit, operate register, stocking and unloading, etc."
good,"I would still be working there, but corporate came in and got rid of most of the workers. I was left to run the store without enough people to help.  They cut the hours of the other employees.  I worked 7 days a week . I didn't have time for my family."
good,"Dollar General is a great company advancement wise. I moved up through 6 positions in less than 3 years. I worked my way from the ground up. There were some poor choices in upper management made which made the job harder then necessary. I would recommend them for a first job or for a career opportunity. I was required to put 52 hours in a week as a Store Manager, which in reality worked 60-80+ I hardly ever left my store. I was in charge of scheduling, budgeting, hiring, training and development. Also, many other duties that come with running a business and business functions. I can say leaving the company was very hard do, due to the knowledge I had obtained and the skills I acquired over time. Its hard to leave a job you know everything about and are completely comfortable doing to pursue other life opportunity's."
good,good place to work I really don't have anything bad to say except their lack of hours and more managers then they really need there but over all its a good place to work.
good,Overall this is a decent company to work for. I've learned a lot about running a store by myself.I have met alot of great people workintg through this company employees along with customers k see on a daily basis.
good,Putting stuff up on the shelves and ringing customer out at the same time and you just gotta kno how to multi tasks but other then that the work is easy
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work at, with a great crew to work with and awesome boss.  The major drawback was that the pay wasn't too great.  But with an w=awesome boss and fun customers it overall was alright."
good,When working in you will hurt all over due to standing on concrete for long hours. Get some comfortable shoes! Since I been back it's been a lot of changes that have been made that's for sure!
good,the job was okay until i became the only person to do everyones work as well as mine. management there was very good as long as you worked they would help you in as many ways possible. the pay for the amount of work done needs to be raised.
good,Loved my job. The store and the employees we all worked so well together. The customers were great. The teamwork was an example of how every place should. We maintained healthy working environment for everyone and had name basis customers who were like family. Our store had to close and it was unfortunate.
good,very exciting being able to interact with different people everyday helping when needed I loved it I like to talk make everyone feel comfortable because I love meet new faces
good,"they move there managers around to much and they don't  trust there employees . you never hear the good things that customers say about you. "
good,"Came into work, put back items that needed to go on the shelves, and cashiered. I learned how to run a cash register. The management was ok and they weren't as flexible with me having my foot surgery."
good,"Their were times, as in any job, where things didnt go well. people were late or management changed. I worked well with my store manager. Although I did most of her job, towards the end of her time with the company"
good,"Management was great. "
good,"Everyone that works at Dollar General is like family, due to the small amount of workers that are working. The company does not do a very good job at helping its employees and give them incentives to go by."
good,I enjoy working there and they have a great team. We work as a team. We greet the customers. I stock shelves with the supplies. Overall it's a good job.
good,I loved working for dollar general. They gave me good hours and where negotiable. But manager was hard to get ahold of at times. Loved that they kept us busy.
good,"working at Dollar General was a typical retail establishment."
good,i read all the reviews before i started with the company they don't pay well unless you know how to network talk to people they are cool if you have another job but keep in mind the only person getting paid is the manager
good,"Dollar General was a very demanding place to work. Not necessarily the actual work, but when you are completely understaffed, it makes it very difficult. As far as advancement opportunities, I advanced to assistant manager within one month, but I was there 3 years and was doing a managers job, because they didn't have one, but they refused to promote me regardless."
good,I love working retail but you can only go so far in the company. It was hard to plan a life around constantly changing hours. I could have advanced but chose not to because of pay rate as well as hours.
good,"So far I've been working here as a Sales Associate for 7 months and I've already had 3 different managers. The first manager who hired me left a week after I worked there because of the stress that came with the job. Then the next manager was pretty cool and nice, but he was too young and broke a lot of company rules and was fired. The manager I have now is really nice, but at the same time knows when to put her foot down. I personally like my co-workers although it is rare that I actually get to work with them on the same shift, its usually just me and my manager or one of the assistant managers. A typical day at work (morning shift) would be getting my cash drawer and counting it. Then I clean up a bit and start stocking some items before we open. Once we're open I tend to customers (mostly on the register) and when there aren't any customers I go back to stocking. If it is a afternoon shift (usually you work this shift until closing) then I basically do the same thing but once we're closed my manager takes my drawer to count the money. While she does that I sweep/mop, do put backs, take out the trash, and clean the bathrooms. The worst part of this job is dealing with customers because sometimes they can be very rude and overbearing. I rather not deal with customers at all."
good,it was an alright job. for the most part. they need more management and people with get attitude. I would work there again if the job was offered. my co workers were great to work with.
good,The company was great years ago but now being that the CEO and other officers have changed policies and procedures it is a lot stressful.
good,The work was fine.  They just could not give me the hours I wanted.  The people there are really amazing.  They were only allowed to give like 15 hours a week.
good,A typical work day for me at work I come in take the night deposit to the bank check the registers to make sure the registers are correct file all of the paper work from the day before check any email of our manager. Help customer any way I can the hardest part of my job is balancing it out with my family but I do enjoy my job getting to meet new people and helping others.
good,"Many different things you can do all day to keep busy. Management is great, very understanding and willing to work with each employee. Peace among Co-workers. I've learned how to deal with people in fast pace situation. Overall good energy and peaceful workplace."
good,"I learned a lot while working for Dollar General. It was a job with many responsibilities and since there are usually far less employees at a dollar store, sometimes there wasn't anyone to consult about something. As such, this was a great learning experience. I would ask questions whenever possible, but little help meant that I also had to know how to think out a situation and resolve issues on my own."
good,Dollar General was an ok place to work. You dont work with many people so if you off the bat dont get along with co workers and managment you will hate it. Very easy not alot of work can be very boring depending on the area of the store.
good,A typical day at work I would start working on the truck running register putting production out helping customers checking in vendors
good,"Help Customers, assign task to Employees, prepare Deposits, check in Deliveries."
good,I enjoy working for this company I have the best team. I only wish they would pay more
good,"A typical day at work duties include cashing out customers promptly with a courteous and friendly demeanor. Assisting customers location items of interest.Stock shelves neatly. Learn how to manage your time between the registers and keeping the store in kosher condition by front and recovering items. Learn how to appropriately price items using price-gun. Management is very friendly and has a strong knowledge of the inventory. Co-workers are very cooperative, we work in unison to achieve the duties posted.The most challenging part of this job can be multitasking when a team-member is absent to play their part of a task. The most enjoyable part of this job being Sale Associate is greeting and briefly interacting with different people of diverse locations."
good,"I enjoyed working here. I loved that my boss took a chance with me giving my age and allowed me to become a 3rd key holder. I proved that age is just a number and i could handle the management role. The hardest part of my job would be handling frustrated customers, although i resolved every issue presented."
good,I enjoyed working with this company until new district manager. There were many changes that took place at once with no time to adjust.
good,"Very easy job. Job had very clear and simple instructions. Found that co workers were in general somewhat childish and problematic with relationships with each other and therefore created a tense work environment for others. The manager was a great manager in all but had some extreme mood swings and would take anger out on employees based on personal life instead of on a professional or job related manner. The customers are mostly all regulars and very friends and fun to work with. I learned a lot of organizing skills with over night stock, cash register operating. General store maintenance."
good,When I worked there it always seemed busy and a lot of work had to be done. I got along with my co-workers well and my manager.
good,"I started working with outbound operations but moved into a position in Human Resource when it opened up. I found I had a natural gift for this. Solving problems, hiring, interviewing and training came easy."
good,"Counting tills, customer service, recovery, keeping the appearance of the store good"
good,"fun environment. Got to know a lot of my customers, learned how to use a register. a lot of rules that minimize productiveness and profit of the store."
good,"Look the ability to interact and train new people ,travling and meeting new people and helping the store grow"
good,Great day. Always something to do. Hardest part of the job is keeping good quality people to work.
good,"On a typical day of work you would receive rush hours and hours that would be slow. Working in dollar general teaches you the basics of what cashiers are suppose to do. Management was fine everything was organized. Co-workers are naturally friendly and a good group of people to socialize with while working. The hardest part of the job was being the only cashier for half of the day when you would have 6 or more customers waiting in line and if a person had to return an item or take an item off their purchase list you couldn't do that by yourself, you would have to wait for a manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was socializing with the customers for a few seconds who you would see weekly and they would treat you like you're part of their family and they would just converse with you endlessly and tell you everything about their day."
good,The co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was the hours. If you didn't have a family at home it's great but since I had family at home it didn't work out.
good,"Not an easy job, high volume company.  It was fun and a challenge to manage all aspects of the job, from inventory management to store cleanliness to customer service.  "
good,I truly enjoyed working everyday. I enjoyed meeting the customers. Made many friends that still know me after I retired 4 years ago. They tell me how much they miss me still.I learned to have great pride in doing a good job. Had wonderful d.M. 'S that taught me a lot.  The hardest part of the job was finding good employees that cared about the store and job as much as I did. I did have plenty of good help over the years. The best part of the job was when the bosses came in and bragged what a good job we were doing. Made me proud.
good,the people were nice and so was the enviornment but i eventually found a job offering higher wages
good,"working by your self,how to stock doing paper work my coworking wewe fun to be aroun when they came in"
good,"Typical day work your the only manager on duty,take the deposit and you have one cashier. Your usually working on a project; rather its setting endcaps, POGs or stock etc. Between all of that you have to do exchanges, returns, assist customers and your cashier if need. Provide change and assist with questions of the cashier.Doing all of that you still have to complete your project before 7pm if your closing. Which means your only had about 3 to 4 hours to complete. Recover the store, count safe and deposit. Learn new things upon new situations everyday, the hardest part is recoverying the store because if the manager before didn't do revcovery; that generally leaves you touching every single product. I enjoy managing, working at a fast pace, and working with customer service. My co worker love working with me, and we all respect each other. They understand that they have to complete the task given to them."
good,"in my experiences, i have learned how to set plannograms, and how to read stock tags."
good,"I love working with the customers and the other employees. I help each customers find what the are looking for. I answer the phone helping each customers with any question or problem they may have. I make sure the Sales Assicates are doing what they need to be doing. When a customer comes in or calls with a problem, I do my best to make it right without going against polices. The hardest part of my job is closing every night with two small children at home."
good,Dollar General is a great place to get your feet wet in job skills that can be applied in better businesses.
good,Working with Dollar General Coporation was an experience I will forever take with me.
good,It was always a good day. Where able to meet new people everyday so that was the best part.
good,Depending on management this is a pretty good job to work. You're able to work at a steady pace receive decent benefits.
good,"Stocking, merchandising, auditing, lots of contact with customers, checking vendors in and out, cash handling and general administrative duties. I learned about managing more people, time management techniques, and overall just had more experince in running a retail store on my own. Overall I had a very diverse team to work with. They all were qualified for their titles and were very friendly. The hardest part would be the late hours I had to keep. The most enjoyable part would be just being able to work with the public. I enjoy meeting new people."
good,Before I worked at Dollar General I never learned about how to merchandise a store by executing planograms and end caps. This was a valuable tool to learn especially coming from a convenience store setting. I was allowed to run my store with little direction from my direct supervisor which was nice. The hardest part was adjusting to the volume of inventory coming into the store but thanks to the experience of my assistant manager I was able to learn quickly.
good,• Tallied and complete deposits
good,With this job I was able gain experience with the daily operations of a well established organization. The management staff allowed employees to work independently and they were supportive.
good,"Dollar General is a good place to work for with a few exceptions, low pay grade, not the greatest benefits. but they are very family oriented, large with customer service"
good,"I liked working at dollar general it was a very good environment to work in. They treated you like family. They gave you all the hours you wanted, they never put you down."
good,Always going to have deals and coupons being used so its best to familiarize yourself with the weekly deals and understand the deals. You will also need to be able to explain the deals the store offers so you can explain the meaning of the deal to customers for they may misunderstand what those deals mean and how they benefit them.
good,"A typical day at work there I cashed customers out and stocked shelves, what i learned every day is you have to have patients with customers and when cashing customers out you have to take your time and not be in a rush. The hardest part working there was probably stocking shelves i got really confused but thr cashier i caught on to that fast. I loved talking to different customers and most favorite cashing people out"
good,I liked working there if I can work there again I will do it. I liked the people I was working with. I liked how they gave me the hours I needed. Dollar General was a good job to work at.
good,"Improvement is a main settlement here as for many workers working in a place and area prone to robberies. I would like to see improvement on security and as of best interest, social skills."
good,"Good company.... not enough hours....I had a bunch of personal issues at the time of employment.."
good,"Started out at DG all sunshine & rainbows but after repeatedly being nominated for Leadership Development Program by jury of my peers, supervision, & management but never being selected after thorough due process ...I lost hope as well as enduring an early mid life crisis... but that of course played no part in my work ethics"
good,"My store was a good, hardworking store. The store manager expected a lot from the employee's. It was extremely fast paced. The only downside to working there is the pay (it sucked) and the ability to staff enough people shift wise."
good,The staff at Dollar General is very nice the management is fantastic however the pay is not good and there's no opportunity for overtime or advancement
good,"I really liked working there  I learned a whole lot from the two managers that I worked with. I also got to meet new people. It was a new experience for me., due to the fact that things were run differently than where I worked as a cashier before."
good,At times the management sucked.. Have to watch certain things! My manager was pretty awesome tho. Was able to get more hours working at different locations which was awesome also
good,It was a slow pace job. I kept my area cleaned.I would stock new itesm.I ran the cash register.I used price machines.I would open and close.Work on my off day was great worker my managers and customers would say I was a good worker always was time.I quit because bad work environment and the store got robbed.
good,Started out as full time key holder and within 6 months advanced to Assistant Manager. Works with you and helps you take it from a job to a career. Enjoyed it here
good,"A typical day was opening procedures, Frieght, register, customer support, returns, checking in vendors, inventory control, and setting planograms. My favorite part of the job was working with my co workers and meeting new people."
good,"Great group to work for, great insurance and great working hours."
good,"A typical work day here is extremely unpredictable, some days are slow amd some days end up being a hassle since opening. The management here is awesome, very understanding to my personal needs. would recommend."
good,"I liked working at this job, they just didn't give me enough hours. I worked in all positions, and I liked the job, and working with the public, and it was a fun work environment."
good,I love retail so I really enjoyed working for Dollar General. I felt the pay was reasonable but should have a higher budget for employee retention. If the budget was enough to have at least 2 full time supervisors other than myself and 4 part time people you could manage the store nicely and be able to get everything completed well. I loved the management. I did not like being required to work 6 days a week. I feel a store manager could manage the store well working 5 -10 hour days.
good,I left dollar general due too the lack of  communication with the management and the lack of hours provided. At the time i was the soul provider too my home.
good,"Friendly coworkers, clean atmosphere, good benefits. The hardest part of the job not being able to get enough hours in the week. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving me a chance to do something with my life."
good,great company - expects no life outside of company though - i would recommend this company for a first job - but not a career retail manager - good leadership - but bad hours - expect no life outside this company   i had to miss a whole year of birthdays and school functions - sometimes i had to work 10 straight days have one day off and then another 10 more days
good,"While working at Dollar General I learned skills that I never had known before like scheduling, payroll, hiring skills customer service skills.  It was very hard work, with too many hours and not enough employees, or pay for the work being done. I often was required to work overtime without pay.  Unloading huge trucks lifting very heavy boxes was the worst part of the job I got hurt very badly and had to have back surgery which has incapacitated me to lift heavy object since 1989"
good,Working there was fun until new management came around and it made things very stressful and competitive. Other than that working for Dollar General is fun and a great way to get your way into customer service.
good,This is a good company to grow with a lot of job advancement. They like to grow within the company which is a very good thing. The only thing is they only pay you for 3 holidays Christmas which they are close thanksgiving and Easter. And never close early for any other holiday
good,If you're willing to work you'll get good hours and pay. The benefits are pretty nice. Store managers needs to be trained better especially new hires.
good,"I have a wonderful manager, he works with us on the schedule and keeps the store clean and functioning. My coworkers are nice and polite. I enjoy the small town atmosphere."
good,Nothing to see here your typical discount outlet. The store was run by people who barely trained me to do my job competently when i was employed there briefly. The store now is probably a MUCH better environment.
good,"Working conditions were ok but occasionally very short handed and cause a lot more work to be place on the employees who came to work, low pay caused high turnover"
good,Great place to learn the retail process. And how to treat costumers. As a team we worked hard to get the boxed items on the shelves. I grew with the company and loved every bit of the process.
good,"OK Place to work for awhile, don't want it to be the rest of my life. Hectic environment, fast paced work, and undesirable schedule. But good pay and good benefits."
good,i worked very hard for them really any job i go i give 150 percent and a team playerand learning new stuff i just like working very hard work and love trying new things
good,"It's a good company to work for. Store mgr is required to be there 6 long days.  If you don't have little kids depending on you , it is perfect. There is room for advancement."
good,a typical day at work is to clock in and to go to your assigned are which could be stocking and you  just put your head phones In a stock the shelves and listen to the bell to see of anyone is up front and ready to check out
good,Fast  work place. Very fun. Meeting new costumer and helping. Enjoyed the experience and environment. Easy to learn manager was good and all staff working together
good,It had its ups and downs but the job still help me meet new people and with me meeting them I learned new things that I cam take with me everywhere. which was something I loved most.
good,thew first time i worked for Dollar general it was enjoyable. this last time when i work for dollar general it was not so pleasant. My co-workers was rude and the manager was not reasonable at all.
good,I loved it! It was a shame I had to see it end so shortly over something that wasn't my fault and I had no control over. I miss my job so badly. Great company if u wish to start a career and make it last
good,Love working with people great company to work for great opportunity to grow with the company. I would recommend this job to anybody that likes to work with people
good,it was a good place to work. i am really sad that i had to leave dollar general. the hours were great. i wish my time had been longer there. i moved up the ladder really quickly.
good,I stocked I was a cashier I closed at night keep whole store up to date as in moping sweeping clean off shelves and make sure they are stocked and took out trash
good,"Mornings start off slow and picks up by lunch time until closing. You spend most time on the register or fixing the sales floor. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the store traffic, especially if you are short-handed for the day or if it's a holiday."
good,"Assistant store manager and general manager are great but other managers on duty need to be more professional. co workers are young and friendly, but sometimes need to be more serious and take better pride in working for store. only thing is schedules constantly change and could be called at any moments notice to come in for shift because others constantly call off at last moments notice."
good,"Good place to work. Fast paced, makes the day go by much faster when you're constantly moving around and doing things. My boss was very nice. Overall great experience."
good,"small and compact store yet will offer advancements base on your grasp of the company policies, concepts, work ethics, and determination. you are the convenient store of the neighborhood."
good,"Worked 60 hour weeks, learned paper/desk side of management. They expect an almost unreal amount of work from their managers. The pay was great and I am a hard worker and stay busy at all times and the workload was at times almost too much"
good,Loved being able to move up on the totem pole so quickly. With that comes lots of responsibility which I enjoyed. Must be able to handle challenging situations effectively.
good,It is a good place for advancement opportunity and to start a good career. It is very fast paced so be sure you are able to stand up for a good while by the register
good,Dollar General was fun and always ongoing with new activities. I loved it but was working away from my kids too much. I loved meeting the new people and higher management. I loved learning new things.
good,"I've worked for dollar general 5+ years and the job is fine you just working your butt off.They give you hours but they also monitoring you as well.meaning looking at your performance, an how fast you work.do you do a good good, do you finish task, they look at all of that."
good,"A typical day would include taking out trash, mopping the entire store, restocking and counting products on the floor, and checking out customers. It was an easy job, and there was always a task to complete."
good,Coaching other associates was a great learning exerience.The only downsize was working every weekend.The manager of that store would often send me to oher stores to get hours .
good,"Overall the company was good to work for, However there were some flaws. Their polices regarding returns and mark downs for items that have been the self for months are a bit ridiculous. If you plan on working in management be prepared for a storm of corporate craziness (for lack of a better word) . Corporate sent my store way to much product and then complained when we would have over stock. We even got audited for it. My district manager and store manager were excellent. they helped with stocking and they were always willing to answer questions. Hope this review helps some of you who have questions."
good,Very nice and clean place. Bosses were respectful. Sometimes they have bad days but everything was good. Hardest part of the job is when there are not many supplies or supplies are low. But still we worked through it. It was always a calm day. Never too much loudness.
good,"I would open and close the Store"
good,"Watch your toes and your mouth around you management always pay attention to your customers and your surrounding, my experience was really good but knowing who to trust was  very difficult"
good,Dollar general was a great place i went from a cashier to a manager in two months. it was good it was just the management. i enjoyed getting paid every week
good,How things have changed and how they now are treating the employees. If you work a ten hour day we use to get an extra ten minute break now that has been taken from us. Co workers are very friendly and help you out if your new and dont understand on how to pick in the department your assigned to.
good,i learned how to time manage. But my coworkers were very emotional a lot which brought down the spirit of the work place. Pay was ok. I could never really get the hours needed.
good,"I had a great manager, and there are plenty of opportunity for advancement if you want it. You get 30 minute breaks; it is an hour break if you work 8 hours. Great employees to work around."
good,the company is actually great to work for just make sure you know your rights and their policies . certain bosses may try to get you do do things you shouldn't or make up rules to get you to follow there direction which would get you in trouble.  Most manangers work 50 plus hours with one day off i dont know any happy ones so id would go past assistant.
good,"Typically cashiers would only manage to work ten to fifteen hours a week and were only paid a quarter above minimum wage. It was a fun place to work with great coworkers, just hard to make due  with the little pay you brought home."
good,"At the time the management was awesome very helpful we did our job but also enjoyed our selves, they were always there to help and i enjoyed it alot!"
good,Good job for a college student who needed to work and go to school. Schedule was very flexible and great staff of workers to work with
good,"a typical day at dollar general was putting up stock, checking in vendors, keeping the store at five or higher rating, making daily deposits, and great customer service.  I learned how to become more aware of my customers needs.  Management was at a struggle, but we got through it.  My co-workers strived everyday to work as hard as they could while on their shift.  The hardest part of my job was putting up stock.  The most enjoyable part about my job was meeting new customers."
good,"I worked for two weeks and then got offered a promotion. Excited about the promotion, not excited about the very small raise that comes with it."
good,"We always had a good day, we done our job the best we could and our money balance was always correct at the end of the workshifts. All the co-workers got along, and we worked well together. The hardest part of the job was the coupons, however we still made it ."
good,"nice environment, the job is not hard all you have to do is do your work"
good,"My typical day at Dollar General is normally busy. Dollar General is a very popular store where customers come in to find discounts. While working at Dollar General, I learned how to become a team player and serve customers with excellent customer service and respect. I enjoyed working at Dollar General when the kids came in to buy snacks with their parents."
good,My job basically a minimum wage job with long hours but awesome management.  The hardest part about this job is bending alot especially to open cases.  The most enjoyable is having to interact with people around the area.
good,Fun and productive workplace
good,"It was really fun to work there. The girls were great. Breaks whenever you wanted, more hours if you wanted, and a wonderful atmosphere to work in."
good,I enjoy my job completely but i am looking for something with better pay and great benefits. I check customers in and out everyday my job isnt hard at all.
good,I would come in count my drawer and look at what needed to done for the day.Talk to my manager on figuring out what was the best and quickest but cleanest and safest way to get things done.I learned how to control my attitude and anger dealing with impatient customers.I loved working with most of my co workers the made the job fun and time pass by.Learning how to control certain situations.Knowing at the end of the day I helped someone somehow
good,Worked there for 7 yrs. From cashier to three key to
good,"Dollar General is an okay company to work for. Their training/orientation program isn't thorough enough, especially when compared to the high standards they put forth. However they compensate with lots of leniency which puts forth the feeling that they just want the stores staffed."
good,"Greeting customers, and assisting them with whatever they need. I love the management team. The job is really easy and its so flexible they really work with your availability and schedule."
good,I loved my job at Dollar General. I worked with great people. The Grove Hill store was more like working with family. There was never really a bad day at work.
good,The most I can say is that management when I was there was horrible but before I left we got a new manager so I don’t know how he’s like. The first managers I had were all about favoritisms so we all had to be competitive. I just wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.
good,It was a great store! The managmet kept it very clean but some things were extremely unorganized. Like the clothes and candles. Some of the items had sat on a shelf for awhile.
good,"I love working at dollar general! I have an awesome management team. I don’t agree with a lot of things the higher corporate managers do. They do a lot of changes that don’t make any sense or work well with there employees on issues related to job hours, task they want you to perform and etc.. they constantly cut back hours a lot also"
good,"The managers are great, but as for the company its self the only allow assistant manager and 1 lead sales associate to have full time hours. Everyone else is left with 10-15 per week. and the schedules are not the same so makes a 2nd job difficult, and the pay isn't great either. This is not the fault of the managers. Its company policy. The company needs to change this."
good,I sometimes stock shelves. I also worked the cash register. I also cleaned the store. And i also unloading the truck. It was a good job but didn’t offer enough hours.
good,It's a great place for advancement. Managers are treated well. Regular employees not so much. There is a large work load and it is expected to be completed by the end of your shift.
good,I had a great manager and assistant manager at Dollar General.  They were very flexible and attentive to any days I needed adjusted.  They always made it a great work place!
good,It is a great place to work if u love working with people. The manager was a hassle to work with. She didn't wanna close at all and if u took a day off 2 weeks ahead and she had something come up the day before for the day u needed off she will make u work and take off. Needs better management
good,"you like to stock? this is the job for you.  If you want to express yourself feel happy with what you accomplish, this is not the job for you. Management switches daily, there is no set way to do anything and you the manager will be blamed for employees you cannot get rid of since they tie your hands and not be able to manage your employees but stock and run the register."
good,"Started off with money management, check for assignment. I learned how to deal with customers and different vendors. In management I learned to calculate inventory, receive products. It was a good workplace that allowed you to grow. There was no hard part to the job. Customer service was the best part of the job it was always enjoyable helping them."
good,"Fun and always busy. But sometimes could get hectic and frustrating. I liked that your always busy and moving. The management was good. And i learnt how to stock a big truck. Most my co workers were guys i went to high school with, easy to get along with"
good,"Good place to work, very fast pace environment ,the people is nice and very helpful, very good job with good benefits including 401k plan"
good,"It was a great place to work learned a lot of new things. Typical work day was 7am to 5pm or 6pm somethings even longer if someone called in, or didn't show up or had to leave early. Being the store manager was a very demanding job you worked 6 to 7 days a week even though you made your own schedule you never knew when you were going to get off or when you were going to have to work your days off. Its just apart of retail your schedule is always changing."
good,"Were a bunch of up beat, caring fast paced group at the dollar general. We have a ton of customers who come in pretty regular in return makes for a wonderful place to work! Why??? Because you make friends and have fun never realized you could have both in a work environment!!"
good,"Good place to get experience and get started with a job, but not something for full time. It doesn't let you move up as other jobs would. Schedules were never consistent and management was not organized."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is when I have a customer that needs my help finding or pricing an item they've seen in the sales paper.  I love to see how it brightens their day that they could find things so easily and that I could assist them in such a timely manner and they are happy to come back!
good,"I learned a lot from working here, and it gave me a lot more confidence and people skills. It made me a much better problem solver and I made a few good friends. The overall work experience is good for people who haven't really done anything yet. It's a fast paced place and something that needs to be gotten used to. The managers are understanding and they will help you when needed. It taught me a lot of ways to deal with different things, like how to react when someone gets angry at you, and helped me to become a much quicker worker."
good,"unloading truck and stocking shelves, fun place to work for being customer service, have made new friends thru my job. able to advance quickly"
good,"easy work, you get to meet a lot of people as your working with the public, store was busy and a little on the messy side could have used more workers but the team was great and did the most they could"
good,A typical day involved a myriad of managerial duties. I enjoy the fast pace and contiuous workflow. I always strived to be the best support the store manager had. A source to lean on and depend on in any situation.
good,at regular day go in get it over with come get to interact with others learned how to talk to public. management is good the hardest part was none really
good,my co-worker was good. i learned the some people will under cut you. the old store manager was all about herself.the hardest part was trying to do the managers jobs and mine. the most enjoyable was helping the customers
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people.Learning new procedures
good,Enjoyed working their but an unorganized store at the time I was working their. I needed something more for my family.
good,I really enjoyed the job more so because of the different people I got to meet. I really enjoy working with different type of people. Working here you never knew what the day was going to be like. Different day different out come.
good,"I liked this job very much. It was very busy and I go to meet a lot of interesting people. A typical day at work consisted of checking in deliveries, stocking shelves, doing paperwork, and helping customers."
good,A typical day is very hands on and physically demanding. A store manager works along side all associates. Its very easy to ensure customer service is at its best. The work load is very demanding all employees must give 100% daily. It is important to keep moral up through praise and proper direction. Ensuring the right task is given to the right associate. Constant training and development of each associate is a must. Retaining employees is a large key to success. Development of new store managers was very important due to the rapid growth of the company. This is what I found to be the most rewarding development of future leaders in the company.
good,"As soon as I clock in, I count my drawer and I start working stock. Also, I help and greet every customer. Furthermore, I clean and organize the clothing, candy, toys, and medicine.  Working at Dollar General I have seen a lot of management come and go.  However, majority of the management that I have worked with are respectful and are very understandable.  Like management, I have seen many co-workers leave as well.  Some of the co-workers are lazy, but majority of us work hard and we appreciate our jobs. The hardest part about working at Dollar General is dealing with customers that steal. The most enjoyable part about working at Dollar General is the customers.  It puts a smile on my face to know that I can make someone’s day just by helping them or by saying Hi."
good,I really enjoyed working at dollar general. i fast taught to work quickly. co-workers helped me when mistakes are made.
good,I love the job but it was poor training on my first day at work. My Co- Workers was easy to work with and they helped me with everything that I didnt know what to do. I loved helping customers out and helping them find products. I learned how to deall with angry customers too.
good,"i was hired in as set up crew / i was hard woring and shown the other peaple of dollar general i knew retail and how to stock merchandise in a set up crew ,they hired me to ba a member of the new store i was in as a ast. manager / it was fun for a while intill they company had to many issues with non working assocites work up 7 days awek for while then said we needed just work uo to 39 hours in our own stores and hired new managers to repace us after we work so hard for five months to find out the new owners was firing all the older peaple to get fresh faces.."
good,When I worked for Dollar General a typical day at work would start by clocking in and putting my personal items away. Then I would ask the previous manager on duty what the task of the day are to be done and get started on them right away. Throughout the day I would start and finish the jobs that needed to be done for the day as well as run the cash register or help other employees with customers. When it would be close to closing time I would sweep and mob and start closing the store down. When we were closed and everyone was out of the store I would then count down the registers and safe. When that's finished I shut everything down and then close the store.
good,Dolar General is a fun upbeat place to work with great mangagers/employees.
good,"I started working there after 2 days and the 3rd day they put me on a register without any training.  I had to look for a manager in training, which was just about all the time for voids, cancellations, beer sales. Then if no one was in line to check out you had freight to empty before your shift was over.  It was very hard to do when you’re the main cashier and from 5pm until 10pm it is super busy and no back up cashiers."
good,"A typical day at work can be slow or busy with something interesting always happening."
good,"Dollar general is my first job and I think it was a good idea for experience in the work force. You do anything else other stores do, like work the register and stock the shelves when needed."
good,Looking for more hours and better pay. Fast pased environment.  Great people to work with on a daily basis. I am a manager and its not enough pay for what i do.
good,"as long as give ur all then great things can become of it,  long hours , heavy lifting but rewarding customer experience ,getting to know ur employees and customers on a one and one basis"
good,I was a good job but then again it wasn't. Having to worry about if your going to make it home safe everyday was my issue. Especially when we had a low volume and your team members didn't feel like working and it took 10-12 hours to finish.
good,Typical day at work are fridays where it gets hectic with customers coming in and out. I learned a lot about cashier wise things like entering money from cash into a debit card and such. The most enjoyable part of the job is the conversations with customers.
good,"•	Direct Assistant to Store Manager "
good,Fast pace place to work every position has a productivity. You can expect to be challenge at your position every now and then. At dollar general there is plenty opportunity for growth because most employees are general warehouse workers.  The best part of the job is the friendly staff and the good pay.
good,It was a great job loved tha work.I love working there becaise it was close to home and i loved the hours
good,"I enjoyed my job, my customers, and the workers but Dollar General as a company doesn't treat their employees as they should. I worked my butt off for a 40 week and only 9.30 an hour."
good,I would run cash register. Clean and straitin up the inventory. On sundays i would unload the truck. Worked holidays but not a bad job.
good,This job is a good job. It is honest work and great with customer service. On the other hand the changes are way to much and the way they treat employees is somewhat not that good. The money is okbut could be better for all the things we have to put up with. It is very stressfull and alot of things happen that should not be happening.
good,Fast pace job. learned how  to work diligently. Manager practically maintain the store completely.  Associates were nice. Hardest part of job just not enough hours to divide between employees. Love that their was always something to do.
good,"Busy, but productive. A typical day consist of greeting customers and assisting them with their findings. Making sure each and every customer leaves with a smile."
good,"A typical day at work, standing on your feet for hours and hours walking around with nothing to do. coworkers are great, and friendly. management was awesome, hardest part was standing up all day. The most enjoyable part were the cutomers."
good,It was okay it was a job it paid.................................................the manager I had was kinda rude to her customers. Of course I had to apologize
good,"Not a bad company to work for. I have been at Dollar General for about a year and I've moved up pretty quickly. My only gripe with my employment here would be my district manager - he has never worked on store level and started at a district manager, so I often question his judgment on how he thinks things should be run in the store."
good,good productive working environment.alot of merchandise to account for tho alot to put away
good,O was there for only two months but everyone there was nice n customers  were nice also  like working there doing stocking I didn't  get alot of hours.
good,I would like to be Working with Them FOR Real again Staying Something to God bless you I like Them Would You Work with Today? Yes I Am Going to Be A Good thing I am waiting for Spellman college Morehouse Colleges So I like Working For them  so TO Florida State Thanks you doing Business with ME I like them
good,I enjoyed working with customers and co workers I worked hard lifting alot of heavy boxes stocking shelves run the cash register and clean the store from customers making a mess
good,Love talking and interreacting with costomers helping one anther knowledgeable work place love talking with the people just knowing that I can help them
good,nice place to work. store was ok. some days where great and some where bad. dollar general management team was horrible me as a manager tried to straighten the store out to make it a better place for customers to shop.
good,"Great company to work for, enjoyed working and learning while working. Stocker, load and unload, sort, "
good,"Working under my manager has been a pleasure. Everyone on staff loves her. As for District Managers, we go through a lot of them. No one is ever around long enough for me to make a decision on."
good,Manager didn’t care about his employees and had no empathy when it came to the single mother that worked there or anyone else. He also treated the customers like we didn’t matter. Basically a toxic environment
good,I called in once at Dollar General and was fired.  I did discover that I was five months pregnant.  I did work hard for this company and the fact that I was out once caused me to get fired.  The manager had wanted to give my job to another employee at this location.  I was transferred in from another store.
good,well it was good for the time period i worked for them of course there is always things that need to be changed but thats with every compnay overall expericne was fine.
good,Blood sweat and tears in exchange for a few pennies. Mess up once and they’re cutting you off. Come in whenever they ask no work life balance. But it’s work.
good,I've been told management has changed but was hired for full time and hardly ever recieved more than 20 hours per week. Store was a mess when I started but was looking better when I left
good,"Its was ok to work their, but no pay raises."
good,My bosswas not a good person. I tried to beter myself and move up to store manager so she started treating me bad wrote me up something some one else did unfair....
good,Recovery is the hardest because everything has to be done perfect. You got the food that has to look faward facing not backwards. Cans are the same way pretty much the whole store. Because if u stand at one end of the isle u have to be able to look down it and beable to see every thing looking the right way not sidways or backwards
good,Not enough hours or pay to live on and less days u get it wasn't good pay and not many people stay working at this job place. Seen alot of coworker go and come when I was working there
good,"I have nothing negative to say about the company! A part job is a part time job. Payday is weekly and you can setup direct deposit, so that is a plus! 14 hours a week was stressful, but If you’re willing to travel, they will offer you more hours at their locations!!"
good,The store was very unorganized and the manager didn’t know what she was doing. Scheduling was up and down. One week would be 25+ hours and the next would be 16. Very high turn over rate probably due to scheduling and being underpaid.
good,"I had an awesome time at Dollar General until they got used to me doing anything and everything for them. It was to the point they wouldn't really ask me to cover a shift they told me I was going to cover a shift. Customer first is awesome, long lines though, and if you don't get your work done because you're line helping you still get in trouble for not getting work done. "
good,"Bad manager"
good,"A typical day is coming in to complete caos, dayshift always left their messes for night shift to clean up. Rolltainer's and Uboats left on floor, personal coffee cups left just where ever in store. 90 % of the customer's were fantastic. Other employees were great to work with. They were fun and witty, yet still got their jobs done. b Hardest part of the job is getting the truck put out in such a short amount of time and still help customer's."
good,I oniy have no review bout the job only worked there for 2 months. the manager was very nice the company was very much so laid back overall they were very good to me.
good,Low rate of pay. Hired at one rate and then pay cut $.50 the next day because the manager did not get proper approval. The manager worked 60+ hours a week and did not offer many hours to employees.
good,"The hours are not worth it but employees there help out a lot. I"
good,It was a great learning experience to learn how to set up the shelving units and stock them. The management was accommodating with my pregnancy. The hardest part was dealing with broken mole jars.
good,The same as the warehouse. Work every Holiday and no paid time off. And the pay is horrible. The only thing good about this job is that it is good until you find something better.
good,"Upper management is unsteady in rules and regulations. Some Managers are not allowed to write up anyone no matter the reason. While most managers are told its mandatory to close two nights a week some are getting away with never closing. Some managers have been targeted by new management and are slowly losing their jobs over it. Its always a double standard and hours are never guaranteed. I'm a full time employee who hasn't seen over 25 hours in over a month because ""it isn't in the payroll."""
good,"I was the ASM at Dollar General for 2 years. The company doesn't give you enough hours to properly staff. Most the time it was just me and  other person at a time, Which is not only dangerous, but for how much they pay it isnt worth all the work you have to do."
good,"Over work the employees, You are expected to wait on customers and re-stock, clean and Whole Store by the end of your 4 hour shift. If you have a rush of customers, this can not be dome unless you work off the clock. Also deal with customers harassing you and be prepared to follow customers out if they set off the alarm and bring them back for stealing. Employees will also talk about you and say uncalled for comments about you and customers."
good,"The enjoyable part is when I""m praised by my customers for my hard work and working with colleagues and learning from them, but willing to accomplish more skills if ever the opportunity arises, however at this time we are short staffed and management is called to help on the floor which don""t allow much time for them to train."
good,I loved working there but they would not give me any hours only got to work eight hours every two weeks $52 EVERY 2 wks!!  I just couldn’t  make it on
good,They always threaten you with you job. Every day. So much to do not enough people or hour in the day to do it.  Pay was not good for what they expect you to do
good,"The job asks much of a person and there are many days you work over and many days that you are called in on your day off.  The easiest part of the job would be customer service, that is the easiest and the most fun.  The hardest part of the job is putting away the truck.  It is most difficult because you have to put up the truck while watching the register for customers.  You definitely have to multi-task on this job."
good,"My summary is self explanatory, they slowly dwindled down my hours and the manager trash talked about me to my family member that walked in. It's 50/50 chance I would recommend this job, because my experience does not define this place of work."
good,"When I first started at Dollar General my Male manager was the best and very respectful. Once he left , our new (female) manager made working there hard she was very rude always cussed at us and made us not want to come in to work"
good,It was a fun work place being around people and helping them. I'm very out going so working retail was a good fit for me. They could work more people on a shift but it was enjoyable.
good,They ask too much with low pay and do not give recognition to hard working employees. They only criticize the faults and never seem to notice those who really work hard.
good,Great place to advance but corporate is horrible and room for error is small for managers and depending on what district your store is in would determine if your district manager would be helpful or a burden
good,"Dollar General is going thru a tremendous growth plan. However, as is the case in the majority of big companies, management leaves a lot to be desired. The growth opportunities are there, but, if not in the right clique, one doesn't stand a chance to grow.Work balance is non-existent. Too much turnover, poor training."
good,no hours to work with. But they get freight every saturday night and usually there is only 3 people to work 12-15 containers of freight. very difficult to maintain stock.
good,"Barley minimum wage, no raises without a management promotion, terrible hours, keep you stocking til 2am then have you open the store, only one associate on the floor so you have to complete all work yourself including stocking while running the register and assisting customers, terrible treatment from top management, and overall terrible place to work."
good,I liked working there until my cash drawer started getting messed with because any and everyone would and could get into it. The only time I knew how much money was actually in there is at the start of my shift when I actually got to count it because at the end of your shift on day shift you did not get to count your own drawer and I think that is just very wrong and personally I have never worked for a company that does or allows that.
good,"This is a great company to work for. The management I've seen, not only as an employee but, as a customer is horrific. I know the struggles we deal with on a daily basis, but I can not begin to fathom why anyone would treat customers as if they are all thieves. I am embarrassed to work here sometimes because of how bad it is getting. Customers see our struggles and sympathize with us, but why doesn't management?"
good,good work ethics. clean. coworkers are nice. enjoyable friendly. good entry level job to start off with. good if your a college student.
good,"Nothing was organized. Management was to focused on their personal life rather than making sure the store was ran right. No one ever came in so I was always called in even if I worked that day already, don't get me wrong, I love to work, but pulling doubles 3 times a week and making sure everyone in my house got to work also was to much for me."
good,I was only getting 19 hours a week. Not enough to raise a child. The manager was not a good one. She did nothing but sit on her behind and make everyone else pick up her slack.
good,It was a good part time job to have while in school. I had troubles working out my schedule due to my mothers health and classes.
good,I knew I would not lose my job however the management was very bias toward certain employees and made my schedule very difficult to balance that with my academic and personal life. Co-workers also were very snobbish and knew they could do whatever the wanted because so much favoritism was shown.
good,"Didnt like working all weekends and nights, but I loved meeting new people every day and seeing my customers smile when they came through my line."
good,"A typical day at work for me is very busy. I am always on the register, I have my daily customers and than I have some ones that are happy and some that aren't happy. I stock products, I organize shelves, I sweep and mop and straighten up the store. I have learned that if you want something in life you have to work for it and at this job I really do work for what I want. The manager is very nice and if there is a certain you want to work he will give it to you. My co-workers are friendly except one but that is just who that person is. The hardest part if running the cash register and stocking. The most enjoyable part is when it is slow and you can get stuff done."
good,running cash register and stocking.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of stalking shelves, breaking down boxes, and running the register."
good,"I was ususally a cashier. I was pulled off to stock or to do a plan-o-gram. I worked long hours and very hard at this job for minimum wage while I out worked other employees who made more money than me. When I asked management for different positions I was told they were filled and he didn't see any reason to replace those employees. The hardest part of the job was getting there at 5 in the morning, two days a week to put out stock then have to get on a cash register to finish your day, which I never got off on time due to the lack of workers. The most enjoyable part was the customers. I loved interacting with the people who came in and out of the store."
good,"I love having great customer service. I love to work. I'm always on time, and always there. I enjoyed moving up in the business. I relocated and need better money than dollar general offers"
good,"Productive, busy, and the boss was hard. I was expected to manage the register, maintain the stock by resupplying, and keeping it in order. I spent most of the time behind the register."
good,I don't have much to say just want a better position. I really don't like working there. U really don't have much to say. I don't have much to say the customers are great.
good,"Being the manager you are expected to work when needed, however I was working 7 days a week 8-14 hours a day.  My husband would get off the road and come in and help me stock shelves because we couldn't get anyone who wanted to work.  Hence, the rate of pay for new hires was ridiculous.  You have to be 18 to work there because of the beer and cigarette sales however, you can't survive on 8.75 (minimum wage).  I would always try to get more when they were hired on, but still and additional .50.."
good,"I loved the job, had no problem catching on and getting used to the process. It was just that the store I got hired at. They ended up firing the store manager 2 weeks after I was hired without even saying anything to me about it as if nothing had happened. It was just a really weird situation for me."
good,"management was horrible and didn’t accommodate my doctors note about my pregnancy, so therefore i had to quit, & as a single mom that really put a strain on my income."
good,"Fast paced...definitely not the safest place to work... Friendly work environment, and staff. Workers should definitely be paid more for the work they do."
good,"Can't I get some credit when credit is deserved? I hope that the TAT Ant Poison that was on the boxes did not poison me. I did this job after enduring head trauma. Transferring from one store to another can be quite traumatic. At the first store I was trusted more. Even though I have a way of increasing customers, supervisors still criticize me for not being ""fast enough."""
good,It's an easy job but you only get paid 7.75 an hour so it's not really worth it. The manager was super great before she left and then it all just went bad
good,Liked my job but co workers were treated better or special privileges but I liked working for the company itself and would’ve stayed if I would’ve been done fair
good,"You never know what your hours are until the day before your new week starts. As long as everyone works together as a team it's a great thing, but everyone must know their role & do their part. Communication is key!"
good,I reccomenend this job for people first entering the work field It was very short hours anywhere from 10 to 20hrs a week in the morning 6 to 11 unloading and stocking trucks
good,"Provided you have a solid team with little turnover, it can be a fantastic place to grow and advance skills. Staffing problems or the inability to recruit will kill and work life balance you hope to have."
good,The company is good to work for. The problem is they need to keep up with company and the stores. They have a problem getting and keeping people because they don’t have employee loyalty. They work you like a dog and give no recognition
good,Need more pay for the workload. Depending on the demographic this job can be stressful. Shrink in my area is extremely high and we are in dire need of loss prevention
good,It would be a whole lot better if the manager knew how to talk and treat her employees. The manger is very rude to customers and employees. Dollar General would be a great place to work if they had respectful managers.
good,"I worked for dollar general from December of 2017 to June of 2018. I quit because of poor management, the district manager wasnt doing her job correctly, our store manager walked out on us so we ran the store with no manager for about a month n a half I never got a pay raise like they said I would get I stayed at making 8.15 an hour working every day barely had days off then they cut my hours down for no reason at all."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Dollar General and always would wonder if I can go back ,  that’s why I learn my customer service where I was taught how to handle money and how to do returns and how to be an overall great employee to customers that’s all I care about his customers and their happy faces , What I didn’t like is I have tried to work the hours but with my life and what’s going on and it is very hard, the boss was not working with me on having one set day off she was not working with me with me she Don’t care and other things worsen so I’ve left"
good,"I loved my job and the customers most of all, but i really do regret transferring from the store I got hired at than the one closer to my house. I felt like they showed favoritism to the workers with bigger roles than just sales associate. If I could go back to work for the company, I would definitely go back just not the particular store that was closer to my home. The pay was not enough for the things they were wanting you to do. I was doing more than what was expected of me and no one noticed."
good,"I worked there for a long time.  Before the KKR acquisition, DG was a great place to work and grow.  After the KKR acquisition the leadership changed.  Then the culture changed."
good,A typical day at work was keeping everything stocked and making sure everything was clean and safe. I had to assist customers and make sure they always left satisfied with their purchases.
good,Upper management expects too much from store management. With an 8 member team and not enough hours its hard to meet strict deadlines. Only pro for promotion is more consistent hours. Pay is not competitive.
good,Depending on the people you work with depends on how much you will enjoy working here. Most of the time it is fast paced and unless you are working with people that are willing to do the work you will find yourself extremely stretched thin. If the employees you are working with slack off on their specific jobs the whole store falls behind. Most of the time you will feel like you are running around like a chicken with your head cut off if you are not working with people will put in the same effort you do.
good,Stocking merchandise or checking out customers is a typical day. The hardest part of the job would be a long shift standing. The Enjoyable part is interacting with customers.
good,was excited to work there at the time. but things got worse. love housekeeping more. they want alot out of you. when the hours or time isnt there. hire more people when they dont even have more to give full time people hour that the deserve.
good,Dollar General good place to work  if you go to work at Dollar General we definitely want to be sure to read the handbook word to word and follow it to the T
good,Fun and busy work days depending on who you work with. The day goes super fast if working with the right people. Manager was hard to work with and made me feel uncomfortable.
good,"Very laid back and very productive. Great work environment, everyone helped everyone and no one was left with a bigger job than the other. Had all my duties wrote down so I knew what to do and what was expected."
good,This job was by far my hardest job the work ethics was wrong people stole money out of registers it was a pretty crooked atmosphere i would have a hard time telling anyone to work for this company if they have a selected choice and is not in a last result type of situation
good,"Since I was the manager, the district manager was my boss. Although I provided all that was asked of me his disrespect for my job and continued unfilled promises of sending me to management training. Worked a lot of unpaid hours (since overtime wasn't allowed) to maintain the store."
good,Meh I hated working there but at the same time i loved it. Of management was better on the upper management I would still be there. No room to move up No job security.
good,"first task to do is count your till. make sure your managers numbers are correct and then start checking out customers. "
good,I loved it there but the pay was to little for everything we did. I loved my manager but the he's didn't pay my bills. The days were long because it would be hrs in between working or seeing some one you work with. You have to keep running back to the register to see if anyone is there cause we have to put stuff up all the way in the back and then have a customer sit there till someone sees them. We need something to tell us they are there. We do everything a manager dose except the paperwork at the end of the day and we do t get paid enough for it. Plus we can't get over time to get the money we need. If you want to work here you cant rely on it to do the job to pay bills you need another job on top of it.
good,"Starting from corporate down to management was very hard to deal with. Everything was off balanced and alot of negativity in the air. However, i worked with some great employees. Dollar general it self is a good bargon store. I loved to shop there."
good,"Dollar general is a nice company, they are not the best as far as pay or hours and hire a lot of part time employees over full time but if u can get full time you can make a descent living as long as the management you have is good."
good,"I worked as a cashier.  That was not the only job I performed. I cleaned, counted drawers, stocked shelves, and had to sell things at the cash register.  I as offered a promotion, and declined.  It was not worth the extra .25 an hour to have even more expected of me. Also I had trouble with harassment, that was never taken care of due to the accused working there longer than myself."
good,a typical day at dollar general wass alright it was long but it didnt feel that long with the other coworkers tyhey would actually help one another...
good,My job was to maintain the look of the store. Make sure my cashiers were train and cleaning their end of the store. On freight days I would work that until it was slow enough.
good,"I really enjoyed this career and It is very upsetting that it ended the way it did. However, management is not helpful. No training what so ever. I was opening and closing the store by myself in the first 3 days without supervision. Very overwhelming."
good,"I worked alot of hours everyday with maybe, maybe one day off a week. None of which was ever good enough. Calls constantly if you were not at the store. Expected to maintain a perfect fully stocked sales floor with limited payroll which YOUR salary was included in that payroll budget. So what little employees you COULD hire would only recieved 12-25 hours a week unless they were FT. Only 2 people per shift most of the time. On the upside alot of friendly customers you get to see on a daily basis. I mean there were a very few that would cause a problem and if that was an issue, they were from out of town. Vendors were great and they all worked great for ME. I loved going to work EVERYDAY I did but in the end policy violations were inforced to CERTAIN people and others were allowed to break daily.  Overall my customers and some of my employees kept me there and would have continued to keep me there if it weren't for a wrongful termination departure.  Management training on there part should have been more helpful in some ways.  Exedra Exedra exedra."
good,Dollar General stores are very busy stores. The convenience that they offer with items that can also be found in bigger stores makes it a easy stop for most people to get things that they need without traveling far. Working for Dollar General requires you to be quick on your feet as well as learning about product placement and quick sales tips. The hardest thing I dealt with while working there was the shortage of work hours. This caused many times only having two employees working at a given time with the store being very busy with lines of customers. I enjoyed the constant interaction of returning patrons who always loved coming in to catch a great sales ad!
good,"you didnt get any hours and people there were not friendly, didn't pay good. all i did was clean and sit at a cash register."
good,"Best part of job, working with all the customers. Stocked shelves when had time, swept floor in the evenings. Worst part of job, worked all evenings and weekends. Management would not allow any day shifts or weekends off, unless I begged. Co-workers were enjoyable to work with, and got along very well with them."
good,"Stocking  shelves ,Rotating Dairy and stocking and putting things in place.that people come in to the store and talk to you being friendly helps sales.  to being nice helps ,helping the manager if needed always offer your help .trying to get stock put up in the hours you have to work..greeting people that you know that shops on a regular bases.."
good,The workers and customers always made me look forward to going to work. It was good to resolve conflicts and make the customer happy for the most part. I wish I'd had more time with my daughter and some of the holidays.
good,typical day at work would be like every other day cashier and customer service. helping others and making sure the store looks great for the next day. the hardest part of working there would be trying your best to make the store look at its best for the manager but he doesnt see it and still expects too much and working with alot of girls is dealing with their drama.
good,"My experience with Dollar General was fun. My co-workers and I got alone very well. My customers all loved me and gave me a nickname they thought fit me perfectly,Pretty. I loved it ! I had certain customers whom i shared outside work friendships with as well because peoople love me."
good,Job was very easy and well putt.. The challange I had was not enough workers working with me on the busy weekends....
good,Interesting situations with some cutomers. I enjoyed working there but didn't know the job was temporary are part-time when hired.
good,"I worked at this company for almost 6 months and from the time I started until I was let go there were 3 people quit because of the manager. The manager was very unfair and put her employees down constantly. I had only had 1 write up against me. I was let go because my cousin passed away and I needed to be with my family. I called the district manager and he went the next day to the store and made the manager offer me my job back, but I declined it because I want to work where my work is appreciated."
good,Had a wonderful father figure but he left. Had constant conflicts with successor until she was removed for doctoring the time sheets. Advancement was based on personal preferences made by upper management. Overhaul of entire company brought needed changes.
good,Very fast paced cashier job with lots of people coming in and out. Related to customers. Enjoyed customer service. End of the day stocking. Had teams potlucks on rotating lunches.
good,"High intensity work environment with more stocking than time allowed for hourly employees. Total store payroll is based too heavily on truck shipped and resets, with little to no allowance for cleaning or fluctuations in customer traffic. This leaves too much that the store manager is expected to maintain."
good,"A typical day would be to come in ring up customers items, and if there was not any customers, then next would be to stock the shelves, clean store and keep everything stocked."
good,"I believe this could of been a good job if the management and key holders communicated better with their sales associates. Also if I did not have such a stressful, unexpected pregnancy."
good,Good when it comes to self promotion within but with that said the only reason for this is because of high turnover and the negative work culture the company provides.  It gave me great experience and resume build up but came with a high cost.
good,you have to be able to know how to stock and work the cashier
good,"Typical work day would consist of opening the store and taking all the sidewalk merchandise outside, then opening your registers, following checking in vendors, and then spending the remainder of your shift checking people out, answering questions about products, and then finally closing the store and balancing the till at the end of the day."
good,after six months never received  raise at the dollar general in Magee Mississippi hours were low anything from 17 to 23 and the management was terrible but a job is a job
good,"On any day at work was a fast paced day. The management was not a good person for the job she was not a customer person she always had a attitude with workers as well as the customers. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the manager happy, the best part of the job was the customers and the vendors"
good,"this was a really easy, work at your own pace type job. while here i wasnt a fan of the management but the past of the work as decent and laid back. mostly stocking and checking people out at the register."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers and a few of the coworkers, I liked that I was able to get to know some of my customers on a somewhat personal level."
good,"This is by no means a Career position, at best this is a place to work if you need extra money or a fill-in Job while looking for another one which is what I used it for"
good,"My work day consisted of stocking shelves and accepting money in exchange for merchandise. I learned to be more patient and to work quickly and efficiently.  In the beginning, management was great. When I moved to a different location everything was completely different. I had a rookie manager. The hardest part about my job was the area where I worked. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with and being able to keep myself busy."
good,"This job was a nice first job in high school. Offers minimum wage, and only 25 cent increase each year you are there. I worked there for awhile, had a great manager but overall the company does not treat their employees well and offer no full time and no benefits."
good,"I love working at Dollar General even the managers are always so good at their jobs I take pride in working for this company. Working at Dollar General helps you as far as customer service skills, and being able to multi tasking  also helps as far as overseeing that the store is running as smoothly as possible."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Dollar General. They pay overtime, time and a half on holidays, and sick pay. It is a great company to work for. "
good,"the store is an easy job to work at. I pretty much ran the cash register, stocked the shelves, and did customer service. The hardest part is probably getting the customers through quickly. The electronics are slow working."
good,"I started out as a cashier, the store manager was very nice and cool at first.  We worked very well together for a long time. She taught me so much and I was promoted within 2 months to the 3rd key holder. I opened and clothed the store with 1 employee under me. Done paperwork starting and ending the shift, stocked, received the truck and vendors and redone planograms and set up new ones. My store manager became sick and I was expected immediately to take her spot running the store, no pay raise, no benefits but a good bit more responsibility, none of which I minded. It was after her return that she became very rude and disrespectful trying to force me into her store manager hours for minimum wage pay without any benefits."
good,The management is very poor along with lack of communication between the whole team.. and you get told one thing and something else completely different happens..
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with and the customer's were the best,what I find is that the company like's to work you like a Dog but pay you like a slave and for what is expected of you it's ridiculous. There is a lot of double work, now don't get me wrong there are"
good,I loved the job and working for the company because i enjoyed the retail environment but I hardly got 18 hours a week. Sometimes i only got 8. The employees we're okay but my manager was very wishy washy.
good,"i enjoyed working at dollar general .i wish i had not given up that job, that's one fine place to work there's good people and good prodcuts to choose from."
good,"The people make it great. "
good,"As a store manager you are expected to give up any outside life and devote all your time to them. Low wages, no raises, 100% turn over. Dollar general does not care about it's associates or managers."
good,I liked working there because I am great with the public. I enjoyed stocking or working the register. I like being on the floor cause I get to move around a lot and I like to keep the place very tidy
good,"The management was very poor and hours were getting cut, didn't train very well, had to learn most on my own. Did have a discount while on the clock or 30 minutes after."
good,I worked there a few years back and I liked the job itself but my manager at the time cut my hours down to 5 hours a week and in working there a year I never got an opportunity to show I could handle more responsibility. It was disheartening. I wanted to make a career out of it and have my own store but I had to quite because it cost me more in gas to go to work then what I was making. I know my old manager isn't there anymore so maybe the new one is better.
good,If you like to stock shelves and run register and put stickers on shelves it's good work. Great for college students looking for extra money to pay their way through college... Not a lifelong career job... can advance up the ranks but watch out for the cutthroat older lifer loser employees who think that being in the store game is thrilling... just not a lifer for me...
good,"Really slow job, didn't really get to work with a diverse group of people in that area. Was good to see and chat a little with regulars but hours dragged and the management at that store location pushed for it to later be closed down."
good,"i worked as a key holder. i opened the store that included(disarming the alarm system, counting all the money in the safe, making the correct amount was in each draw before unlocking the doors, handling the customers needs both on the phone and in person."
good,A typical day at work is customers coming up to the register and buying one to fifty items.  On occasion they would be very mean and verbally abusive.  I learned that people are like that and not to take it to heart.  Management is pretty good but could use some improvements.  My co-workers are very nice and helpful.  The hardest part of the job is trying to juggle receiving truck and helping customers at the same time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is lunch and when I can have a couple of laughs with my co-workers.
good,"Typical work day includes, assisting customers with questions, locating products in the store, assisting with stocking shelves, cleaning store, cashiering, etc."
good,Working at this company can be very stressful. The production standard is a little high. The policy for when there is a conflict with two employee should be changed. The employee that provokes the disagreement should be the to get punish.
good,"The typical day at this job was keeping yourself busy and there wa salways something to do. What i'ved learned at this job is, how to stock and to put things in order, the mangement was great and she kknew how to keep the store organized.   The hardest part of this job was keeping the customers satisfied. The most enjoyable was working with new people."
good,"Quick advancement which is always good, however if you get on the wrong side of anyone then you will be replaced without even being told. False paperwork & poor management in some stores. The Store Managers don't follow policy & neither do the employees. You aren't paid enough money for the tasks you have to perform. I would not recommend working for this company."
good,"As Assistant Manager, I counted all of the cash drawers and was accountable for all of the money. I made sure the people working for me on a particular shift were doing what they were supposed to be. I was in charge of checking in vendors and making sure they put their own products away. I was responsible for making sure the store looked presentable every time I was in it."
good,"Helping customers, checking out purchases, register.  The management was okay.  The co-workers were nice and helpful.  Cleaning the store.  Meeting new people."
good,I loved working for Dollar General but the Store Manager and District Manager were not nice or pleasant to work for. The Store Manager constantly put down employees and never had anything nice to say.
good,Dollar General is a fast paste retail store. That will keep you on your toes with changes everyday. The hardest part of the job is finding the right team. Without the right team to help each one out it becomes very dififcult for others. The most enjoyable part is being in the public and meeting new people. To show your personality.
good,"I believe this job to be tedious and unfulfilling. I was hired to be a key-carrier / supervisor. Unfortunately, due to company politics, I was overlooked by the District manager, twice. I provided excellent customer service on a daily basis, while stocking and maintaining store maintenance. I arrived on time for each of my shifts and worked throughout without customer complaint. This position made it very clear that moving forward in the company would be almost impossible. There were enjoyable parts of my position. I have always enjoyed helping customers find what they want and making sure they have everything needed for their projects."
good,Working for the dollar General isn't an easy job but it is worth it to see all my wonderful customers!!! I love working with the public and counteracting with wonderful people!!!
good,"A typical day at work was customer service, stocking, cleaning, and recovery. I learned payroll, cash management, ordering. The hardest part of the job was maintaining low loss preventions. Enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,good overall job for highschoolers and people who only need lower paying jobs.
good,"This job is very demanding. You start by counting your cash till and then dive right into work. Responsibilities include: transactions, stocking, janitorial, and customer service. Management and Co-workers vary by location, but I have had a fairly good time with dealing with them. The hardest thing about the job is unloading the truck and stocking. Items can be heavy and awkward to carry and sometimes spill hazardous materials. The most enjoyable thing about the job is that the hours of business are not too extreme, 8am to 9pm at most."
good,I like this job even though it was physically demanding as well as mentally demanding. Mngr was the worst person I ever worked for
good,A typical work day include complete standing and lifting for hours at a time. Management and co-workers were always eager to help. The hardest part of the job was standing for a long period of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the chance to meet new people.
good,loading and unloading the shipping truck also stocking product on the shelves to be sold working aorund other people
good,"Running cash register, assisting customers, handling money."
good,"While working, we would stock shelves and manage the cash register. We helped people locate the items they were looking for and explained some of the promotions and coupons the store was offering that week. The management system did what they needed to do in making sure their employees and customers were satisfied. The work environment was very friendly."
good,"restocking of the store,reciveing invendor inputting shippemt,couting down safe at the end of the day making bank deposit."
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar General very much was not anything I did not like about working there.Till i moved. I worked well with co-workers. gave two week notice when I had a ratified contract in Aug. had to stay till they gave me my release in Oct. and still did not get my transfer to store in NC. And no one will tell me why.
good,When it comes to the Flexibility and life they are hard to keep seperate when working for the company.
good,"it was a great place to work the down fall was the management, I loved my daily if not daily customers every other day as well as my co workers we all got along great and worked great together."
good,Dollar General is a great place to work. The staff are great and it’s a great place to build necessary skills that can take you elsewhere. However; this isn’t a job you want to work for too long if you don’t plan on being a manager.
good,Could use a higher pay scale for both management and associates. There isn't enough people to run the freight as fast as it comes in. All district manager are not as involved with the store managers as they should be.
good,All i did there was stocked the shelves and kept the store cleaned.The only thing i didnt like was the management.The manager was always away from the store.
good,"My time and experience at Dollar General was good, except for one issue! The work was fairly easy and smooth. I did a lot of stocking and also I was a cashier! If I could go back, I would. I give this job an 8 out of 10!"
good,Its a great place to work its just poor security for customers an employees they stay stock for every holiday they have great murchindise an they are very happy an outgoing
good,"I like working at dollar general, my store is always well maintained and my manager does his job very well. I just do not like how he always tells everyone what they are not good and and how they are not good enough."
good,Not a bad company to work for but very long hours and very little training and if you do not hit your production standards they seem to start throwing you under the bus.
good,I have worked three different DG's the reason for that is because I got transferred every time I moved to be sure I'll be able to make it to work also because I loved working there. I love greeting the customers and interacting with them also relating too. The employes and manager was nice polite and understanding.
good,Only offer part time unless in management. It's hard to move up in this company. It is hard to keep order in this environment. Not bad for temporary work or first job.
good,It was a small store that didn't require too much each day. Each week has the same routine unless a shipment is late. The delegation between upper and lower management was very well handled and the cashiers listened and worked well with the members of managment.
good,Great place to work but I wish they would give more hours and higher pay an hour for us sales associates. I also wish some managers would be alil bit nicer to their employees
good,"a typical work day started out as enjoyable and I was promoted within three months, but by the end of my tenior I was training 2 managers, 1 assistant manager (who didn't particularly like me) sales associates/staff who didn't want to work, customers who thought I should have become manager and didn't respect my new bosses, I tried to quit but was begged to stay and train my new bosses and fellow associates and was deceived by an associate and terminated for training an associate they wanted to promote to a lead. T"
good,"Enjoyed talking to the customers and doing my daily routine ."
good,Ive worked at multiple store and they are all different. Depending on the store you work for means your experience might not be so great. The store I last worked for I didnt enjoy being there like the one before
good,"The deductions weekly are too much you work a lot making overtime to get $1,000 and you get paid $700. company dont provide anything to employee......"
good,The staff didn’t wanna work always left work . Bathrooms were always broken. Manager wasn’t really there we had to talk to her on the phone. She didn’t show up for multiple family issues and if she did she had an attitude.
good,"Sometimes it was a fun workplace depending on who you worked with, cool/outgoing coworkers, pretty good environment, bad pay, no benefits, back when I worked there management was horrible."
good,"Quick paced & very competitive! Fussy customers, but the challenges made me stronger! Being so young & being held accountable for so much made me a better employee. I can’t wait to get back to work!"
good,Provided cash handling experience and customer service skills. Steady paced work environment part time job. The hardest part of the job was the lack of opportunity to grow. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and learning and stocking new products.
good,"ok but a tuff job, was really sore my first couple of weeks but you get the hang of it pretty quick. I was only temporary there for several months and wanted to get a full-time position there but they never asked me to and when my assignments were up that was it. I wanted to go back so bad."
good,"Very productive place to work, my days were always predicted and I could be prepared for what I was going to do that day. I just did not like the pay. I wish  it paid more. The management was very reasonable and a pleasure to work with."
good,The company pays weekly and that to me was the best part of working for them. The workload is impossible to keep up with and in order to get things done customers were ignored. Ignoring customers is the worst thing a company can do....
good,"I enjoyed working for them, they listened to any problems you had and would fix what needed to be fixed. It was a growing company for young people just not for me."
good,"Would be a good place to work if the company could figure out better work outs and and slight pay increases for each hourly employee. In my experience with working at different stores with different managers, hourly employees are not paid enough with what they are instructed to do. Also the amount of hours that are given to all hourly employees is not enough. More work is put onto hourly employees than what the pay is worth."
good,"Dollar General in my experience is a great place to work for, for the moment or for a first time job. The career advancement opportunities are astounding but the pay rate with the promotions and amount of disrespect and degradation the employees endured are not worth the long run."
good,"as title says, was ok , but low pay and no hours. i don't know what else to put. the job itself was easy for me to learn and do. then they brought in another manager."
good,Its a job lots of improvement can be made hours are flexible no set schedule management team is all over the place I enjoy customer they give me life but i think a better environment.
good,"Workplace overall was quick pace. Early morning shifts were provided to those who worked fast pace due to delivers. Shift options were fixed so only two were available, morning to afternoon and afternoon to night. Minimum wage so it was okay."
good,it was an alright job until the team got lazy from having 4 r 5 different store managers. trucks seemed overload cause sales was down .people kept quitting. I leave because I found out I was pregnant and had prior high-risk pregnancy so I left
good,"My duties were cashier, stocker, janitorial, security however only paid for cashier. You do a lot of work without the pay to reflect it. It is also not managed well in order to get the work completed as shown by going into the store and seeing stock still on the floor etc. I enjoyed meeting the clientele but unless desperate I would not work there again."
good,No future here.  It is a temporary position.  The payscale is not what I need to make it.  I would like to move from retail and get back into the corporate world.
good,Working at Dollar general was a task. Management was young and unprofessional. I believe with proper training my employment there would have been successful.
good,It was a nice place to work. The pay could be better though. You can get days off but no pay. Also you don't get to work full time to get insurance. other then that it all good!
good,"Not enough money for the time you work. the schedule is not very good either. For a first job, it's not too bad but it is not a long-term place of work unless you move up."
good,My position for this company is no more but they are amazing ppl & with time they will be amazing . I started off as a sales associate & within weeks I became a manager . I took my job serious & it paid off for me in the end
good,A typical day was pretty challenging. I learned how to multitask. The management was good on communication and understanding. The hardest part was trying to do re-shops while also having to work the register.
good,"At the first dollar general I worked at in my small town, the manager was amazing. He worked around schedules, was concerned about his employees safety, health, etc and knew how to manage a store. The second dollar general I worked at towards a bigger city was not great. I give everyone a chance, but she did not know how to run the store and other things were going on that I did not feel comfortable being around. Overall, it is not a bad place to work. The actual job is easy."
good,"Good team members, but bad hours. Long work week but short hours. Cashiers are made to do more than what the training and handbook asks of them. Over all had a great time there, but would not recommend it unless you want 12hrs or less."
good,Best thing I learned at the dollar general in Michigan is you gotta make friends and suck up or they'll figure out a way to get rid of you.  I actually really enjoyed working for dollar general until I transferred to Michigan.
good,I worked as a shift lead manager and I was making 11 an hour. Not the best pay for a manager position. The good thing about dollar general is I was promoted within 3 months of working with the company.
good,The Dollar General I worked at was always busy. I would try to go out on the floor to pull stock but would have to run back to the register. I would often joke with the manager about needing a revolving door. It was a job I really enjoyed.
good,Flexible work schedule. Advancement pretty quickly of open position. My GM didn't need to be in that position. She barely knows what she is doing. Constantly took credit for things I did.
good,"a typical day at work was one would walk in, clock in, and get on the register. I didn't learn much there, management wasn't helpful, there was no culture, there wasn't much that was hard. the relaxed environment"
good,I tended to get too involved with too many fires at this company and did not have enough time for my family and friends. I did not have the support of the upper management and there was no upward movement unless you were part of the good ole boys club
good,Dollar General was a good place to work with the exception of hours. They ran on as few hours as possible and if there was a call in by anyone and you couldn't get someone to come in the manager had to cover the shift.  There were many weeks I had to work 75 hours or more.
good,"this place is a good place for a first job or a job that you don't want to really advance in. The pay isn't enough for the amount of work your required to complete.  If you are a manager (keyholder) then there are lots of times that you are at the store alone, there are several times during the day/week that there are not enough staff available to serve customers due to the way corporate assigns hours to the store."
good,a typical day for me would start at 8:30am run last nights deposits to bank. do a change order for that days business. open computers and registars check tills do price changes and scedule employees for floor coverage and stock including breaks. at the end of my shift count down safe and close out my registar
good,The overall experience was just fine. It was a job and helped pay the bills. Also got me back in the work force after several years of not working so it was fine
good,"Usually they were always short handed, so I got lots of hours but then they just stopped scheduling me for a couple of weeks, so I was forced to go find other work.  I enjoyed doing the remodels on the stores which is what I had to do to get 40 hours a week."
good,"It's a nice place to work if you're a people person. You deal with the public.  It isn't full time work, but you work hard and don't get paid what your worth."
good,"Regardless of what they tell you, this is still a retail environment with a smaller payroll than the big boxes.  Expect to work with minimal staffing and long lists of duties."
good,It was a fun environment until I moved to a different town and ended up with a really bad manager. Made the work environment unpleasant and complicated.
good,I enjoyed working here but the management was depreciating and the employees were not informed or put in the right place to make advancements or show their skills.
good,A typical day of work at dollar general is not that bad I just want to move on and experience something different outside of retail. I've learned how to supervise others and make the work environment better. The hardest part of the job would probably be making the customers happy but i try my best to keep them wanting to come back. Honestly my coworkers are the ones who help me enjoy my job because we have grown a bond.
good,I started aa a cashier and advanced to a floating assistant manager position. I would travel from store to store upon the temporary absence of both managers.
good,When working at this company there were many positives as well as negatives. For example the store employees and in store managers were fun and easy to get along with. Well for the most part. Just at the same time you would be running the register you would also be stocking the shelves. In my position I was also required to be to work at 4 a.m. to receive the truck when there was a delivery. On the positive side I really enjoyed the hands on customer interaction and getting to know the regulars.
good,i was always at work barely home and was driving back and forth from work from an hour away. i only stopped working there because the drive was taking a toll on me.
good,the night shift worked a lot harder than morning. you got to meet new people each day and see old friends. you not get anything but a paycheck. it is very unfair. they play favorites.
good,This is a fast paced job. Sometimes very stressful. Doesnt pay very well. Continuous work. Not a very good job to have if you are trying to support a family.
good,Our main problem was management. We were a good group just miss guided. We depended on each other because some of us got proper training and others didn't.
good,there was two other men and myself come in for truck day at 5am and we would be fine until our manger gets overwhelmed with everything he is very mean at some points. i learned how to do cashier and it wasnt that hard i thought it would.  i do think the store needs more help to get the store organize and clean up..
good,the manager was really rude to me every time I came into work. the keyholders were really rude to me. if you had an emergency they made you fill like you would lose your job.
good,Decent store when it is ran by the right management. Does not allow pregnancy leave unless you are management. I was fired while on medical leave dealing with a pregnancy loss
good,"Dirty store, Never a set manger. Always switching mangers, The backroom was dirty and took over 4 months to get it fully cleaned. But the only good thing is flexible hours. Also getting paid every week"
good,If you love people this is the place to be. Your experience will vary from store to store but if you have fun and are reliable you will be perfectly fine.
good,"I worked around great people, but the management could've been a lot better. Very messy and not cleaned that well. Floors needed buffing and cleaning thoroughy"
good,Dollar general from what I've found working here is not a reliable place to work. You will never have a set shift so it make a balaceing your life a bit tricky. They do not pay enof for the work they will have you do. The cashiers are walked all over and get all the blame.
good,I loved it but the money was horrible for everything that we did we had to stand all day for 8 hours put of heavy stock in so much time change shelves and help customer and they wanted to pay so little
good,I worked seasonal so my whole day was spent as a cashier and time did fly by. management was very helpful and I enjoyed the customers
good,"I don't mind working for this company at all, I actually like it. It's an upbeat pace of work, and I love being around the public. All of the drama that fills the store I work in is not fun for me, I'm wanting a new job to where I won't have to worry about all the drama."
good,"A typical day just involves ringing up customers, fronting store items, managing store cleanliness, and stocking merchandise."
good,Love My Job . But Working Nights Is Affecting My Family & Home Life ! Getting Home So Late Is Hard On My Baby Girl And She Isn't Getting The Sleep She Needs.
good,"I loved my co-workers and customers. I just had a better opportunity elsewhere that let me get farther in my career. A typical day at work consisted of running the register, cleaning the front end, putting items back to their rightful place, and resolving customers' concerns and attending to their needs. The hardest part of the job was the rude customers, which anyone can get at any location. My co-workers were great and were very friendly. they were there for me when I came across certain situations. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers that I had. I was able to bond with a lot of them."
good,"Customers weren't bad, however, the management was. Lots to do especially when the store is understaffed. Getting paid weekly was great though."
good,"I get along with co-workers,their is nothing hard about the job at all,I do the night deposit.wait on customers@put stock away."
good,Manager did not have any knowledge how to manage a store nor employees. As for the Managers actions it created a lot of chaos.
good,"very understaffed most but I did love working there ,almost always felt very positive about work..coustomers very friendly and were repeat costomers so gen cared about well being."
good,this company isn't the family type of company that they try to say they are. wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. though it pays nice that is the only plus going for it.
good,This job is good for a first job. Okay pay for part-time workers. Higher ups above store level do not care about anyone but themselves.
good,"i would suggest this job to someone in high school, Comes with a lot patience , meeting  wonderful people and great customer service"
good,Good place to work if you are not wanting a lot of hours. People come and go a big turn over rate. Will train you for your job. The people that you work with are good people have big hearts.
good,"Good Company; however, security, and corporate rules don't apply to everyone. Every manager considered himself your boss, no matter what your assigned boss had told you.  Enough said."
good,"the customers were the only reason i stayed at the job. i loved being able to see the usual customers and being able to connect with them. but the managers and coworkers always had an 'im better than you"" attitude."
good,"Worked from 9 to 10 hours a day if not longer."
good,"my typical day at work consist of me ringing up customers, getting a rolltainer and putting up stock, changing plannograms"
good,"was hired as a cashier ended up as the guy who do anything. started when the store first opened everything was still in boxes and totes shelves empty, learned sku codes to place product in designated area. ran a register and learned to read body language to aid in loss prevention."
good,friendly and helpful co workers that you enjoy.Also enjoyed the customers because they were very friendly.
good,"Dollar General is a great place to wof you find the right store to work at. I worked one in Bush and they didnt take to outsiders to well at first, well then i befreiended that manager and the JOB was awesome, i loved going to work and doing my job, i loved meeting new people, up until my mother fell ill, she had fell out at work and i had to leave to go get her, well we sat at the hospital for hours and we thought she wasnt going to make it, i called into work and they fired me. Talk about heartbreaking!"
good,"love going to work,  just to see my manager thats how cool he was. also had some great people to work with, only thing i didnt like was that they had me working mostly late nights."
good,"as assistant manager I maintained records, done daily reports, balanced cash drawers, maintained store appearance"
good,"Typical day: stocking shelves, rotating products, working register, assisting customers, answering phone calls, and basic cleaning duties."
good,"I prefer the morning shifts becaue it's the only time I can have a 30 minute lunch and that I am also a day person. I'm ok with working nights but working the last 5 store hours and having eaten nothing since 3 or 4 pm makes the nite seem long and I'm ready to go to bed by the time I go home. I don't look forwards to the night shifts because I started feeling ill after they became routine and has me not looking forward to the next day morning shifts, and generally disliking the closing shifts altogether. Management is ok, the weren't honest about the part-timers picking up hours after a few weeks. They only picked up until after a few people had quit. I generally don't like working here mostly because I had high hopes with recently getting my B.A degree."
good,"I learned alot of people skills there, You learn all types of people and there personalities."
good,"The hardest part of my job is pleasing everyone . I love to know my customers personally, know their kids names . People will continue to come to my store and shop when they feel at home . Everyone wants to feel like they’re special. I treat everyone the same . I don’t care if your in a 3 piece suit or old worn out clothes everyone is equal to me . I’ve been commended on my ability to treat everyone equal."
good,The store always had customers that would move products to the wrong part of the store instead of returning the item to the front at check out or simply putting it back.
good,It was a good job but when I got injured off the job they gave my position up without notifying me an I wasnt even out from under drs care... that was the only problem besides working excessive hrs I wasnt paid for.
good,"Good working environment but bad management, signed for part time but worked full time and only was credited for part time, terminated for unfair reasons."
good,They dont give much of a raise for work that is put into job. You consistently busy all over store mostly by yourself. Have to be a multitasker to do job.
good,The job had a nice atmosphere but benefits where terrible. I was able to work on communication skills with customers and my coworkers. Patience is definitely essential working in the line of customer service
good,The pay was exceptional if you didn't have kids or responsibility. The employees were very messy sonit was best if you stayed to yourself. Although a job is a job
good,"Working for DG was hard work, sometimes not very organized or out together. Working with co workers was an ok experience. Wish it was well managed better."
good,"At the time of my tenure with Dollar General, there was terrible management within the facility. The store manager at the time was into so despicable things that I cannot disclose that made many of her employees at the time leave abruptly."
good,Its a base retail minimum wage job. Dont expect much. It keeps saying im not typing enough. But thats all there is to say. Thats it. Stock shelves. Cashier. Unload trucks. The basics.
good,"A typical day is counting drawers, stocking, greeting customers, helping customers find products and answering questions, cleaning, taking inventory.."
good,"Easy. Flexible hours. Not too bad money. "
good,I quit because the newer employees were getting the holidays and week ends off and I was having to work them I felt my 12+ yrs of service deserved a small consideration since it took me 13 yrs to achieve 10$ per hour pay rate
good,"Depending on the location work could be either slow or fast paced. However, the work is easy. It is a decent place to work part time. the pay however, isn't very competitive."
good,"Co workers were great!! Boss had NO CLUE! The CUSTOMERS ARE WHAT MADE THIS JOB GREAT!!  EXTREMELY HARD WORK but wasnt paid near enough. Key holders only make 9.00 to start. Its UNBELIEVABLE  that a HUGE COMPANY like DG pays theres workers so poorly but allows them to handle the amount of cash that goes through their stores & trusts the KH to make their deposits. This is EXACTLY WHY the company has such a HUGE TURNOVER ALL THE TIME. "
good,Enjoy my job. Things are not always easy. I am doing fine. Wish the pay would increase. 8 hr 30 hrs week doesn't pay my 500. Rent. Have too have two jobs to Survive.
good,It is good love talking to the people encouraging people the friends you make.The pay is low and not enough as a sales associate you might only get 25 to 30 hours unless your a key holder or manager which is ridiculous
good,The work place was okay. The store had certain times where the store would be busy. Customers would always donate to fundraisers they had going on. They store was always clean.
good,I personally have a neutral opinion towards dollar general. It was very hard at time when I was the only cashier or register open. They would constantly leave me as only register with little training. It was good for a little but I am ready for a better experience.
good,Dollar General is one of the best jobs that I ever worked at and honestly I plan on continuing to work there for the most part. Dollar General turn out to actually be a great store better than what I expected before I started working there the store always clean the customers are always nice the employees are just outgoing everyone has their own personality and everyone has something to look forward to during their shift at the store. That doesn't mean Dollar General is going to hold me back from my other great adventures that I plan on taking for the future for myself.
good,"The Dollar General Corporation itself seems to be alright for the way they hire towards their employees and do try to provide a decent wage.The Dollar General near Harrison was at the time I worked there, covering for the recent closing of a k-mart across the way. It was always being stolen from, and was understaffed at most times. The stocking was falling behind as often there was only one person working in the whole store."
good,"loved getting to know customers and helping them."
good,"working at dollar general can be fun, but it sucks when youre working 12-10 and then the next day open at 6 am. only holiday off is christmas. on thanksgiving you open an hour early and close at 10 pm."
good,The manager needs to retrained but organization was the worst. It needs real work and a pay raise for all the qualifications they require for management
good,It's not a bad company to work for. The pay wasn't that bad. But it also depends where u work as to what your pay will be and if your a sales associate or higher. You also have the opportunity to work in other store in the district. Which is great if your needing the extra hours. You are also given travel pay if you do. They pay you per mile. You are expected to juggle a lot though. This job can be very demanding. But I liked it for the most part. You definitely stay busy.
good,I liked my job at dollar general I was able to build relationships with our customers.  And everyday usually was the same. I was able to learn my job and just become better.
good,"this place can underpay you but with the right management you and the crew can go very far. unfortunately the pay is quite low and it can be difficult getting hours, no matter how hard you work."
good,"Great place to work, good experience for learning "
good,"When I worked there the managers were amazing. They took pride in their store, employee, and customers. The managers were very kind and serious about making sure you got the help/break you needed. They worked with my school schedule and what times I preferred to work. Working at DG was really fun and relaxing. Though just like any other day in retail, you do occasionally get rude customers and shoplifters. I do not remember if I got paid time and a half for working holidays. If I had a chance to work at the same store, I would probably be very hesitant to work there due to the new management. All my managers relocated. But over all, I believe that DG company is a great company to work for."
good,Dollar General is a corporation that accepts just about anybody that can and will work. Working here was a blessing. Everyone I worked with was understanding as I tried my best to figure things out when I first started.
good,We stayed busy from the time the DG opened till it closed. Always stocking shelves or running the register.  Our biggest concern are thieves. Thieves would come in get $1 bag of candy and pay $6OO iin SNAP benetis.i
good,the job was ok it was a lot of hours some days I was there from open to close. I was expected to work 6 days a week every week. I was also expected to close the store 2 nights a week as well. I work 60 to 80 hours a week some times more when I had staffing issues.There was not alot of time for me to have a home life. when I was home or on vacation I would recive calls from the store with all kinds of issues.
good,"The work place had friendly people to interact with, but was under staffed which resorted to fewer days off. More work was pressed on the workers and the management needed improvement. But, I was able to learn the cash register and how to work in teams. The hardest part was the endless running from different places within the store to try to do multiple people jobs to keep the store in shape. But, I enjoyed it because I knew many of the customers and the other employees were friendly."
good,"I liked working there when I was with my coworkers but when my manager was around she accused us of stuff that we didn't do. She had made me cry right in front of my costumers , they were not happy with her. She's very rude."
good,Was a nice job for after high school until I left for college. When I left for college the management was very understanding and flexible with working hours before I left.
good,They expect you to over work you self for little pay and expect you to work on days you requsted off because the manger don't pay attention to schedule .
good,I loved the company but have had some poorly hired managers. The company has so much more than i even knew to offer. i regret not being offered them sooner.
good,Run the full store but get paid for only one job. The pay was horrible and you take risks daily and clean and keep the store in good shape for little pay.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of helping customers find product, stocking products and placement of product had to be straight and nice and tidy, clean work space."
good,"Good environment but not a lot of people stay, not very flexible with work hours, typical day at work is ok not to much going on but have to be careful when handling money"
good,"I loved working for Dollar General, but the pay that you receive is not enough for all the work that you are required to do. It’s a small store so you get familiar with the customers and they can become like family. Stocking was always fun for me, because I take pride in a job well done."
good,New district manager is horrible. Fast paced. No tims for standing around.  Manager and team are great but new DM is rude and obnoxious.  Enjoyed working with customers
good,"Management was no good when I worked there. But the person that trained me was great, he was helpful and nice. The money wasn't good enough to even live paycheck to paycheck though."
good,"Generally, a good place to work. However, there are some team members who have the ability to slack off and cause other team members to do their work for them."
good,I was taken advantage of I was hired for part time and working full time hours with little pay would work double shifts at two different stores also helped wth inventory went beyond to help out
good,"She made the employees go across the street to get her lunch from the restaurant as takeout, yelled at and belittled us in front of customers, blamed me for something i didn't do and when i dared to correct or contradict her she pulled me into the office and told me I was acting like a child. I quit immediately.  You cannot pay me enough money to deal with a woman who uses her job as an excuse to treat people like garbage."
good,"Good place to get started on a career in retail. always lots to do if you are the busy bee type. however, don't expect to move up quickly as you think unless you're hired on to that position because the DM plays favorites."
good,Day to day activities were similar.  Decent training.  Customers were nice.  Did not like having to be on-call.  Hours were steady.  Management was patient.
good,At the dollar store I was a key holder pretty much a shift leader. My job was too make sure stock was put away where it was supposed to go and I also made sure our costumers was happy!
good,"Fun place to work, but not meant to be the only source of income for cashiers and keys. Must have thick skin, as customers can get very rude. Fast paced environment with plenty of work to keep one busy."
good,"When I was employed at DG I loved it! Loved the atmosphere and my customers, the pay wasnt good for what was expected and we never were allowed many hours for associates to help but they expected for the shelves to be stocked and the back room to be empty. I honestly would still probably be there if I hadnt been robbed at gun point numerous times and DG not showing any sympathy nor taken any measures to better enhance security."
good,"you always have your likes and dislikes, but what ive learned is to get alone with your workers and learn a lot that has been around. try to do your best. greeting customers is one of the biggest thing when working in retail sales..there is not really a disappointment in this job, we all are family and we help out others."
good,It was a relaxed work environment and the manager was very nice.The work wasn't hard and the day went by fast. I loved meeting the customers and being able to make someone's day just by being friendly and having excellent customer service skills.
good,"This was my first place of employment where I was given the chance to manage all on my own. I enjoyed working there, but the upper management, at the time, was not up to par. A lot was left on the shoulders of the cashiers."
good,"This was a great career, until I was injured on the job.  I have issues keeping pace with the demands of the new DM, and little support from him."
good,Good place to get promoted within. But if you don’t have a good Store Manager it will take you to long to get promoted. You have to put up with a lot of complains.
good,They are okay to work for just does give you enough hour to make ends meet. no overtime not even forty hours a week and no benefit are lesson you are management. we couldn't afford it anyway.
good,The only real good thing about the job was that you were able to gain a connection with the daily or more frequent customers. Other then that the hours were  bad and the pay verses how much work you had to do by yourself. I don't think the pay was efficient.
good,"I,liked working here but there were not enough hours to work. I wanted eight plus hours of work! I didnt get close to that! But staff are very friendly!"
good,"One person was able to do what she liked. Not enough hours in one store, sent to different store to get enough hours.Good manager in one store. To much"
good,"I worked here for about 6 months until I got married, then my husband and I decided to try to start up my nail technician business and relocated. I did not care for my manager at the time because she chose favorites and since I did not like to cause drama in the workplace I think it caused her to sort of dislike me, but I still respected her because I needed to help provide for my husband and I. It could have been worse."
good,"Working for the dollar was a very stressful job for managers they do not allow you to staff the stores to be able to be successful, as manager and being salary paid I was working 60 plus hours a week and every weekend, don't mind the hard work bit had no family time ."
good,Had 3 different managers in the two years I was there. Expectations were extreme compared to the time allowed to complete assignments. Management had to forgo breaks and lunches.
good,"it was a great environment aside from the management staff they had, it was an every man for themselves workplace and any chance they got they would sell you out to their boss to make themselves look good,  the customers were great and convenient location, makes it super convenient to shop but the prices could be better. when having a scheduling issue the general manger tried to be fair about it the assistant manager wasn't fair about most anything. the hardest part of the job was the management and lack of help/communication in the store."
good,"restocking, environmental, cashier, checks and balances, unloading trucks, training, inventory, orgazination, lead keyholder, conflict resolution, manage"
good,"good if you need a first job, but need to be 21 to work there. work as a stocker or a casher. and you will make whatever minimal wage is at the time with a small bump after a year"
good,Fast pace u have to be friendly with the public the end of ur shift u have to recover the shelves by pulling the food forward and put product away that customers didn't want. Once a week the truck comes in and have to help put it away which is about 3 days. There are totes to be put away also that is done over the weekend
good,"Very challenging in areas of labor, recruiting and staffing. They really tie the hands of Managers with respect to the hiring process. Also, the compensation is relatively low when compared to other retailers."
good,"Not a lot of hours. Not high pay. Only allowed to keep certain number of employees on the clock, so if the store gets swamped, the two employees on duty can easily get swamped."
good,The people were rude and one of my coworkers were the only ones to speak and talk to me about how the job was and willing to tech me things because it was my first job.
good,When in started there they weree talking about building a freestanding new store around the corner so we hired extra employees for the move. I was in charge of training them.
good,"A typical day at work includes serving customer, cashiering, answering questions and locating personal interests. "
good,Dollar general has no ability for health care or benefits unless you are a manager. The dollar store is a decent starter job or short term job. But not for long term in my opinion.
good,Managment sucked and completely unorganized. I happened to be pregnant while working there they cut my hours down to 3 to 4 hours a week had a kidney infection ended up in hospital and they put me down as no call no show when i called and was on the phone with another cashier for 15 mins never once was able to talk to the manager
good,District managers and other higher management ask too much of employees in a typical work day. There isn't enough time  or schedule hours to do everything that they want you to do. Basically life revolved around work. I was working everyday because employees would call in.
good,"Great job, especially if you're looking for part time work, I can't speak for other dollar generals but my manager made me feel like I was still in high school, I don't think she ever left. The way she talked behind not only mine but every other employees back made me well aware she wasn't the one for the job. Good co-workers made it tolerable but I'll never go back."
good,theres only two peolpe working at a time. theres always a sale depending on where you work the coustomes are rude. depending on where you work the store might not be up to date and they got the cashier doing everything whilke the key holder does who knows what
good,"dollar general would be the best place to start at for a first job , you can advance to other levels and you can take that with you where ever you go outside of the work place."
good,"In the time i was employed at dollar general i noticed that only one person was ever doing work, the cashier is the main worker all other associates stood around gossiping."
good,a typical day at work is very hectic. you have to deal with too many thing at one time. too much responsibility for the pay. they need to up they pay if they want to keep they're good workers.
good,setting daily planners. Interviewing and hiring new employees. Daily and monthly reports reducing shrink and shrink awareness. traveled  to multiple stores register and cash handling inventory training and implementing policy scheduling.
good,"Overall good company to work for. Take care of employees and atmosphere is good. "
good,good place to work but is very hard work. the job is demanding with the fact that you are basically a over paid stock boy. you meet new people everyday which keeps things interesting.
good,The best part about working here is the customers. I love seeing and speaking with them everyday. The only downfall is the management. Other than that its pretty great.
good,"I worked for dollar general for 4 years, and had started as a sales associate, and made my way to the top in 2 years. I enjoyed managing but had no time home with my family."
good,"Working for Dollar General's typical day a work was hard and long hrs."
good,"A great place to work, but being in an unsafe environment will have its ups and downs, overall great company to work for in the future if your trying to get a little retail experience under your belt."
good,"I worked Dollar General part-time and enjoyed seeing new customers and returning customers, my co-workers were helpful and valuable. Working retail is a experience I feel everyone should do at least once in their lives it makes you a better shopper and a better person."
good,Dollar General Corporation expects extremely way too much work for the amount of compensation. The gratitude is very few and way far in-between.
good,I worked here while attending college so I was part time while classes were in session and full time when they were not. The manager was level headed and a joy to work with as were the rest of the co-workers. I enjoyed stocking shelves and working the floor more than the cashier part.
good,good place to work but ended on bad terms it was fun to wake up and go to work i enjoyed speaking with the customers and organizing everything
good,"fast paced , great place for a first job and you want to gain experience . also manager cythnia was a great mentor and taught me how to give great customer service also how tot up sell to customers ."
good,"Limited chance for advancement , but they truly believe in having you help out the other Store's that are struggling but don't want to pay you for your knowledge or motivation to a store running smoothly."
good,Customers are great and brought great smiles to my face. The employess were fun to work with. Always something new to learn. Every year new planograms. Plenty of work to keep you busy. Management needed to learn how to manage the hours given with in each week and utilize that time better.
good,"I was hired for part time but constantly worked full time hours. Some co workers were not reliable, so I was the one getting called in to help and I wouldn't leave my boss stressing. I enjoyed seeing my customers and knowing their were just as happy to see me as I cashed them out. I kept getting denied vacation time since it was down on paper I was part time even after over a year. The hardest thing was balancing work, school, and my nieces."
good,This company was okay to work for.  When I was there we all worked as a team which made the work day easier.  The store staff was responsible for everything so it was important we worked as a team to complete the day to day expectations.
good,Working with awesome people. I was part time and enjoyed the weekly pay. The mgmt when I start was bad but when I left the company the mgmt got better.
good,"A typical day at work was long."
good,"A normal day at work was very fast pace. Never a dull moment. Working at Dollar General I learned that how to better interact with people. Management is tough and always a challenge. Not always easy to please. Always in company of good co-workers very friendly work place. The hardest part of a job was not being able to please all customers. I best enjoyed the customers as well. Getting to know them each and everyday and to have a customer come in and that is eager to see you, will make your day."
good,I loved meeting new customers that came in & talking with the repeat customers everyday.  I learned how to be a team player & how to run a store by myself when the manager would take lunch breaks.
good,"Open or close store ,balance register, go to bank,do recovery,deal with customer and  associate issues,put up frieght make sure policy being followed.I enjoyed my job til manager was fired for no good reason.New manager has no clue how to do her job makes up rules as she goes .Wants to fire everyone to hire her own crew The company has lost and will loose very good people because of her and the way she does things.The hardest part of job was the rolltainers delivered were way to heavy for people to safeley move without eventual injury.Ireally enjoyed all the associates i worked with and dealing with customers every day.After all the time and energy i put in this job and times i changed my plans to go to work when i was needed.I was sure it would be recognized and i would have moved up in this company."
good,"Great First Job ..really enjoyed helping customers."
good,"always busy, not usually enough help, management was extremely poor and unstable all the time, seemed to fill store manager position with criminals and was suprised when losses were high,"
good,"I was a average part time employee, did just about everything from cashier to stocker. I would not recommend this job if you have bills since the amount of hours available are tied to the total sales of the store. So one week you could get 30 plus hours then the next it could be cut in half to 15 (this for all employees who aren't managers). The advancement is not worth it, you might get a extra dollar or two but what comes with that is way more work then what you get for a pay raise.And if you think they compensate for hard work then forget about it, you'll get your 25 cent raise every year and that's only because they have to.  So all in all, if you just need a part time job for some extra cach then this is the place, otherwise you'll start to hate DG very quickly."
good,"Hard work was rarely required and therefore rarely rewarded. There is little room for employee advancement unless you start off working in management. An average day can be hectic depending on the number of customers, but it usually is filled with the same daily chores. It was an easy job to do and I would recommend it if you are looking for part-time or full-time work. Just don't expect to be promoted without having worked there for a decade."
good,"Enjoyed working at Dollar General, Cashier and stock, management was well."
good,"I loved working at Dollar General and it pained me to put my two weeks in. My typical work day included coming in and preparing for my shift by reading the list left by my manager.  I always did my best to complete the tasks that were requested of me, some days I could and others we were just too busy to get anything done! On days like this, I would leave a note for my manager letting her know why the goals were not completed and always offered my services to come in before my shift to help complete the tasks that were neglected the night before. Cashier positions are all mostly the same so not much new information was learned while working here. Management was always helpful in addressing my needs as an employee. My co-workers and I were an amazing team, we almost always accomplished the goals set by our manager and still succeeded in providing excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job was truck days! It was a challenge to put stock away and help customers at the same time, but it had to be done and done with style and excellent customer service was a must no matter how busy you were, you always had to take the extra time to assist the customers in finding what they needed. Hands down, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with customers and to see the smiles on their faces when I could help them find what they were looking for. I love to see the look of relief come over my customers when their worries have been lifted!"
good,"A typical day at work is working as a team to keep shelves stocked, fronted and faced. Keeping up with the cleaning tasks and providing excellent customer service. I've learned how to read POG and spreadsheets. The hardest part of the job is when we as a team don't work together or communicate with each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing excellent customer service."
good,"Love the kids, management was not organized, underpaid. Have good hours of operation."
good,"run the register"
good,Good job with good benefits and advancement opportunities.
good,"Enjoyable but under paid. I would stock shelves, check customers out at the register, and anything I was asked to do by management. The hardest part was probably unloading the truck but it didn't bother me because I work out anyway and I can lift heavy equipment! The most enjoyable part of my job there was greeting customers and speaking to them, I am a very social person and love people!"
good,"I loved working with and helping the customers. I didn't much care for stocking the shelves but I loved to recover the shelves. The hardest part of the day was closing when I had to sweep and mop the store. (the dollar general i worked in was a really big store and i swept and mopped alone). my manager was a good manager, she is hard worker and cares about her employees, she can be a tough one but if you follow the rules and do good and she is awesome. i can say that she is very understanding to a point. Just don't call in last minute, no matter the emergency, i learned my lesson. My co-workers were great, i got a long well with them and they welcomed me to the store nicely. For me, the most enjoyable part was seeing a happy customer after I had helped them. I even had a few customers tell my manager how helpful i was and how satisfied they were with me. This made me feel incredible."
good,"I have been working at a Dollar General as a sales associate for almost two years. I started out at minimum wage and every year on my hiring date, i get a $.25 raise. I began working here a year after I started college and they are so good with scheduling me around the times that I tell them. I try to be available as much as possible and I'm so grateful that they will accommodate to my schedule. I really enjoy my coworkers. As a sales associate, I run the register, I stock, and face the store (make it look nice). The shifts for sales associates range from about 5-6 hours which is the usual, but I have worked a few 7-8 hour shifts. I enjoy my customers but I do work with a positive attitude."
good,Enjoyed working with the customers. Counting drawers. Keeping the store stocked. Cleaning as I worked. Keeping co-workers enthusiastic with their jobs and making sure all customers are satisfied.
good,Working at dollar general for me was fun because its like a small family and I really enjoyed the customers. The work as key holder wasn't hard at all. The only problem I had was that I wasn't trained correctly so I didn't get the full understanding of everything. The store also depends on the management. Also the closing cashier has to sweep and mop the whole store and clean the bathrooms!
good,"At first I loved the job, I advanced very quickly, but the management and the way my store was ran was horrid. I would come into work and it would look as though no one had done anything, management didn't know how to disclose personal information from other employees."
good,"I worked ehre while I was in college.  It was my part-time job while I was a student in school so as I was studying, it wasn't that heavy of a load on me to have to work and go to school worrying about classes."
good,"Customer Service, cashier, stock, maintained bathrooms cleaned and shelves organized."
good,It was fun to work at. It had great hours and worked with me when I needed maternity leave
good,not enough pay for the amount of work you have to do. But over all it wasn't that bad
good,"I worked for Dollar General for nearly 3 years, during which time I earned my college degree and was ready for success. While I worked hard and completed projects assigned to me, I felt that I was not given appreciation and the environment was absolutely horrible. I was not receiving satisfaction from management or the customers themselves. Basically, it's a hard job when there are little rewards. Pay is terrible, too."
good,"The hardest part of the job was the manager, she manager was rude she would yell and cuss at you in front of the customers. I loved the customers and my co workers. I loved being a cashier, being a cashier was the most enjoyable part of my job. The co-workers were very helpful and friendly. A typical day at work would be stocking cleaning and"
good,loved who i worked with loved my customers I stocked shelves checked out customers it was a fun place to work
good,"Dollar General overall isn't really a bad company to work for, it was just the store in which I was employed that was the issue. They do eventually recognize when you are trying to go above and beyond, but for the longest time everything I did to improve our store was being credited to everyone who did half as much work but had been there longer. Other than that, I did enjoy how fast paced it could be at times, and the physical aspects of the job. I also enjoyed having the freedom to arrange products in ways that I thought would look most appealing to customers."
good,A typical Day Sometimes Exciting And Sometimes Hard Work Moving At A Fast Pace From Cash Register To Stocking.
good,Productive and growing workplace with many different departments of job titles.Advancements are few but possible for some.
good,"Very flexible hours, the job is easy & great itself but it depends on the people you work with."
good,"I worked on the cash register checking out customers. When there weren't any customers, I worked in the store putting up stock."
good,Great company but they don't know the meaning of full time. I was full time according to payroll but I only got 20 hrs a week if that
good,I like working for dollar general but moving from store to store put in in a bad situation but I would go back as a key holder or cashier
good,"Corporate only allows each store to share 150 hours between all employees every week. No biggy, right? Well, when they keep hiring and hiring and we now have 10 employees, what does that mean? Yep."
good,Good place to work if you have the right management. Customers are Nice. I learned Management duties being a Key Holder. the work culture is great and the hardest part if the job is stop customers from stealing. most Enjoyable part of my job was making good friends.
good,"I would stock all shelves while keeping an eye on the register to see if customers were coming in, at the end of the day i would sweep,mop and make sure the store was in good shape."
good,It was a decent first job to have. You must be able to work well with others. It is a fast pace. It is heavy lifting. Well spoken. Work well with others.
good,"Only work here if you have to. If you can get a job anywhere else, do it. There is to much that's messed up and mismanaged here that it'll drive you insane. Not only that but communication between yourself and other workers including the manager is most of the time misunderstood or overlooked."
good,I really enjoy working there . I love the people interacting. my only complaint that the hours are not consistant.  If scheduling was better it would be a perfect job.
good,I mainly run the register and my store is Tue busiest in town. Some of the people are just rude and they can't put anything back where they found it. That part is terrible. They just lay stuff anywhere. But I love the people I work with.
good,enjoyed working there but did not get enough hours to survive on sorry I had to leave I enjoyed the fast pace of being on the front register.  The customers were friendly and courteous . I just couldn't survive on 10 to 15 hours a week
good,Coworkers and customers were fantastic. Communication with management and decisions by management were poor. I enjoyed most of my time there but only when corporate wasn’t involved.
good,I truly loved working @ the Hastings Nebraska store. There wasn’t anything that I didn’t enjoy @DG. I would go in @11.  Truck day we were breaking down The skids and stocked the shelves. It was just a fun place to work at.
good,The normal work day starts at 8 am the hardest part of working is trying to stock shelves and answering constant questions from customers I've learned how to be patient from these times as sometimes the customers are very ambitious the most injoyable part of the job are the repeat customers that you see everyday
good,"The store is great, some coworkers are lazy and get paid even when not putting 80% of effort  in. Manager  picks favorites and she only gives you extra if she dontvwant to work . She lets people talk to thiervco workers like dogs"
good,"Work/life balance is hard "
good,"This was by far one of the most difficult jobs I’ve worked because of how physically demanding it was. Only two employees could work at a time unless there were enough hours and the tasks that were asked of us were too much based off of efficiency. Customers, store tasks, register, rolltainers, truck .. all handled by two people? We see how well that worked out"
good,I was promoted quickly and I embraced it. My only true complaint is that they didn't pay as much as competitors. As a shift manager making $8.50 per hour to just being a worker at Family Dollar making $9.00 per hour. Typical work was expected such as stocking shelves and cashiering.
good,For three 3 yrs I busted my tail with no appreciation . Even went out of town a few times to get the hours I couldn't get at my home store.I learned the store in just a short two months next thing I know I'm doing frieght few months pass I take a part time key few months after that I move up to assistant manager just got to a point where a manager was spreading ugly rumors . I can take my work somewhere else .
good,"A typical day at Dollar General was putting away new shipment that came in through out the week during hours of operation, ring out customers on register and assisting customers as needed."
good,"While I'm thankful for the job I do have with this company there are at times that the short hours and the low pay gets to you. I will say the people I work with are awesome for the most part, but just like everyone is there own person emotions do run high, but at the end of the day I have enjoyed working for this company."
good,At the Dollar General Distribution Center you have to be a fast paced worker. You can’t take any breaks while on the clock because you’re being timed and it’ll mess up your percentage. If your percentage isn’t met for the week you’ll get a write up.
good,No work life balance. You work six days a week eight to twelve hours ( sometimes more). If you do not have staff you fill in those gaps with your time. Upper management usually has little concern as long as the store is open
good,"Working here is a great entry level job for just about anyone. It isn't hard but it can be rather quick paced (especially on restocking days). The job responsibilities were not bad at all, I loved working with the customers; but the management (specifically one manager) was not good. The schedule would get changed but we would not be notified, the manager would call in and ask for other people to cover because ""they did not feel like working anymore"", just a very unprofessional and inconsistent."
good,Job could never be a career only way you could make money is if you are a store manager job is more of a job that would help bread winner you really never be bread winner unless you are a store manager they dont give you a full 40 hour work week for full time your lucky to get 35 that hurts especially if you really need 40 only time you can get over time is if then really have to not real job be
good,Working as a cashier at Dollar General was a new experience for me coming from working in fast food. I enjoyed having more face to face time with customers as well as time to myself when organizing and restocking shelves
good,Dollar General is a good choice for a first job. The workers are helpful and the job isn’t too stressful or complicated. You get the feel of working without becoming overwhelmed.
good,Dollar general is a cool job to work for if you want quick money weekly the work is not easy you move around alot and you have to milti task but all in all it's a good job
good,The job was great I had a lot family stuff goin on n they just let me go with out compassion of my life my mom was in a bad accident my kids needed me to thought I was going to be thier for the long haul great crew tho
good,I just think scheduling should be by the manager than a computer graphics. It was fun but the manager I feel should have left her home life at home. It was fast paced at times. I enjoyed seeing the regulars. I felt a lot of negativity atmosphere was somber but I ask had fun working there
good,"I was a good place for customer service. You meet alot of new people everyday, and that was the best part for me. I like to meet different people. Makes the job better."
good,It’s very flexible place of employment because the schedule is constantly change but you all work as a family.  It’s a great place to have your first job. It’s very easy to into the rhythm
good,Overall it is a great company. I enjoy the regular customers that come in and building friendships with a select few. I like organizing the store and keeping everything in order so it looks neat and is organized. The only downfall of working here is that I was told I would be replacing someone else's position. They refuse to speak with her to give me the hours she has currently.
good,"I really did like the job, unfortunately a dangerous situation happened, causing me to fear my life and resign. I did learn a lot about working there."
good,all i did was throw frieght count money and close the store. i did a couple of resets and i learned how to set up an ad. i helped customers with general questions and did returns/voids.
good,Lots of things to do on a daily basis. Freight to be put on shelves Helping train new employees. POGS to be done.Shelf resets. The hardest part of the job without a doubt is trying to run the store with the very limited hours to distribute among the employees.
good,"I.e. starter for management, starter for cashier's, etc. "
good,"Most days were on repeat, open store, carry items out to side walk, recover any spots that weren't done the night before. Greet customers when they came in, helped out when they needed it. Kept the front end clean and all buggies and baskets in the store/place. The hardest thing to deal with working there is that no matter how hard you do work you never feel or get appreciated for the work you do."
good,Your days were either quick and short or drawn out. You usually have to find things to keep you busy unless you are having to help put away the stocking truck.
good,A strong team and good DM make all the difference. I experienced this first hand when changing stores. Expect this salired job to require a lot of physical labor.
good,Some people were nice when I was working there.. the manager was uptight and played favorites .. switch my hours in short notice... Would put me to do stuff they were supposed to do themselves.. always left me w a line.. was not alot of diversity either.. manager constantly played country music.. which was annoying aff
good,"Although the Manager I had at the store I worked at was having some in store issues with some of the girls that worked there, in all it was an amazing job, would LOVE TO Work at a Dollar General again some time. Ty."
good,they are okay usual customer service. Normal money counting and stocking of the store. losing and opening of store are early. customers will give hard time but easy to deal with.
good,This job was fairly easy and relaxed. The people were fun to work with and the pay was pretty good for a small job. The management was good and were understanding.
good,"Physical work is expected of everyone no matter what department or job title.  Good company to work for as far as pay, but measured labor standards make for hectic shifts."
good,"Always busy. Multitasking is a must. Running register, stocking shelves, assisting customers, and cleaning and recovering the store nightly. Working truck process."
good,"Dollar general, is a really great company to work for when you have the right boss. But when you don’t its horrible, or when they hiring bad people. I enjoy working here, I really do. Just the pay and hours aren’t what I want. I need more."
good,good place to start learning about customer service. great coworkers and a fun place to work.   Good thing is that they can work around your  schedule
good,"It was a pretty easy job. Very fast paced. Alwaya busy doing something weather it be stocking shelves, cleaning or running the register. There is always something to be done."
good,It was OK. Didn't last long before things went south. I don't recommend working there unless you want to be worked like a dog and paid poorly. The only benefits were being paid weekly and hath insurance. The hours were crazy. Getting  days off was hard.
good,"Low pay and you have a lot of responsibilities. You always work alone but my manager was mostly in the office or outside smoking so I was alone. I had to run greet customers, run the registers, break Dow shipment and stock shelves from the totes in the front as well. I think it is a good job for college students or maybe just as a second job but nothing permanent."
good,"Meeting new customers and making friends with regular ones."
good,While I was working at dollar general the management became very dependent on me too pick up everyone else shifts/slack and I found myself there six days a week and no promotion opportunities.
good,"The job itself was tough, fast paced and challenging, but this was no issue. You stayed busy and made sure the products were good for your consumers. It was a good place to work."
good,"It may have just been the store I worked at that wasn't the best due to a manager that had been transferred from another store, but before the new manager got there, it was very nice working there. My coworkers were always friendly and helpful, and they always made time to answer any questions I had for any of them."
good,"The hardest part about the job is having your coworkesr call in all the time or having to constantly do a double. It gets really frustratening if your boss refuses to help the ""team""!!"
good,Good as a part-time job in college or to earn a little extra money on the side. Wouldn't suggest as a career path although they do give opportunities to advance to management.
good,Working for Dollar General was one of my first warehouse experiences and i learned a lot from all the staff there. I recommend alot of friends and family to apply because it's truly a developing work environment.
good,I did not appreciate working in the role.  I felt the work was too boring and needed more challenge.  I felt that the staff were nice and appreciated their efforts in training me.
good,"If you’re lookinng for a first job or just a small easy job then this is the place for you. I’ll admit this is a great job but the only problems I have is the management. Personally my manager doesn’t seem to care about their employees unless it effected them. They are petty when it comes to hours; sure if you request days off they will do their best to give it to you but other than that the schedule can make no sense at times. If you can look past the most of the business parts of it, this is a fun job but some stores need a lot of work, mainly with the employees."
good,I worked at the Webb city Dollar general and the general manager was horrible the assistant at the time was not much better. They would start drama between employees when they should have been discouraging that behavior
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General.  It was fun helping customers, stocking shelves and unloading truck.  I would work there again if they re-opened the Dollar General in my town."
good,"A typical day consisted of running the cash register, clearing 7 or more roll-tainers to stock empty shelves. Also, sweeping and mopping the entire store, cleaning the bathrooms, cleaning the managers office, filing paperwork, and handling money for register."
good,"Sometimes fast paced, sometimes slow. You always have to be attentive. At the end of the day its awesome because you meet new people and cultures. It's a great job for beginners."
good,I loved working with the public the management was very understanding of of time off she was a great leader very competitive prices clean environment and always staying busy
good,I mostly enjoyed the job except for the manager and how stressful it can become during the peak of the day. My teammates were helpful and the customers were (mostly) patient.
good,I feel they need to pay a little because all the work you have to do. Definitely the managers assistant managers and third key. Its slot of work to run a store. Not hard to do but I feel it definitely need to pay more .
good,I loved the job just wasn't getting enough hours to make enough money to take care of my 3 year old little boy. If they gave more hours then I would love to work there again.
good,the manager puts in work and tries his best to make the store the best it possibly can.  Not many people are currently employed there and it sometimes can be very busy but he makes it happen.
good,"It was fun to work there. I enjoyed the tasks. The manager was ok. But he was not very understanding. i enjoyed helping people, and meeting new people."
good,"When i went in i didnt expect to get the job. My girlfriend at the time actually applied for sales lead and since she got offered the job on a thursday and the drug testing only had 48 hours available but was closed on the weekends, she automatically got kicked out the system. Bad for her but good for me. I applied and got offered the same position she wouldve had if she had been able to take the drug test (urine). I started as a sales lead with a terrible general manager and and awesome assistant manager. The general manager randomly disappeared one day and the assistant manager had to go on maternity leave soon after. I ended up being promoted to assistant manager. We didn't even have a general manager for a while. Then a few months later, we finally got one and she was great. The only reason I left is because I moved back home to California."
good,I loved working at Dollar General. I just needed something different for my family. Id recommended this company to any of my friends or family members
good,I liked my job working at dollar general. The things i like the most was meeting an greeting the new customers that came in on a daily basis. I also like to recover as well.
good,As a former Dollar General associate I would say that I definitely enjoyed working there. I learned that it is a lot easier to get better customer service in a smaller environment.
good,Management was very poor. Could never keep a consistent schedule in advance. Very understanding as far as family needs. Had a strong team the manager eventually pushed all the good employees away.
good,the hours made it so only two people could wok at a time it was hard to get stuff done when you were at the register all the time but other than that it was very flexible with my schedule
good,"Dollar General as a company and a job was fine. I didn't have any problems with their policies and procedures, but the people were less than acceptable. I couldn't get past the fact that my boss's boss was ready to fire anyone on the spot. He did it frequently and no one trusted him. Other than the people, it was ok."
good,A typical day at work would consist of clocking in to little to no work done with little training and high expectations slow pace and lots of cleaning
good,"*Typical day at DG is a long day at DG.  Up early looking at reports.  Communication every morning to team about sales, customer service, labor, etc.  Hitting 2 - 3 stores a day working close with store teams.  Finally debriefing in the evening from the day and planning the agenda for tomorrow."
good,Constant work. Meeting new people and helping them. Had to undoffer truck load aND stock store. Inventory was a mad house. Over all it was a great job we were just slow on employers.
good,Managing a brand new store wa a little difficult but it came along really well. I would manage a team recieve our weekly truck delivery open and close the store without supervision..I also made bank desopsit.
good,"I learned about teamwork, management was good, a typical day at work would more than likely involve stocking shelves and just trying to clean up the store."
good,"A typical day at this store was loading and unloading the store, face fronting. I come in the store  and count all tills ato ensure 100.00 in each one, Then made sure all deposit money was there that should have been. I ran up customers through out the day. Managemene worked from her phone and as a result was never available to effictively assist, that was the hardest part of the job. I learned to never give up even you do not have the support needed to succeeded."
good,Ok job really haven't been giving out good hours to those who work hard and those who have been there longer . They show favoritism to some workers and that's not fair
good,a normal day was pretty busy. you were always doing something. the company made sure there was plenty to do. a truck came weekly so soon after you got out the truck another was about to come.
good,great place not enough compensation for hours required .work load steady fast pace .good customer service place rated on survey results .driven to meet or exceed plan sales. great place to grow sales .hard to get good employees store in small town .
good,When I first started it was fun not that stressful job. I'd come in do my work and go home for the day. After becoming a manager is when things got bad. I was told I would be getting a promotion but gave it someone newer than me. Only raise I got is when I first became a manager nothing after that. Everyone gossiped about each other. It quickly became childish and unprofessional to work there. The only benefit itself was the insurance the company provided.
good,Enjoyed my time at DG.  Plenty of opportunity to learn and grow within your position.  Job culture was a little stiff and there was little opportunity to work remotely if you were unable to make it in
good,"Good atmospere due to customers, most days were crazy due to not enough employees, covering crazy shifts due to employees not showing up for work.management was over worked"
good,"If you're not a manager you will either be stocking or ringing up customers. Day in, day out. It all depends on your store and your management group. It really sucks when the line gets backed up, and there are 30 customers lined up to the back of the store."
good,Someday would be slow and easy. As long as we do what we were suppose to everything would run smoothly. We greet customers and help them find what they need.
good,"managable routine which was easy to schedule around"
good,"I loved working for torey he is a great boss and does what he can to help u out , im going to miss working for him, but i had to leave due to family but it has since been fixed."
good,Working by yourself a lot in am expected not to void any items it is frowned upon even if it accidently ring up wrong thing. expected to get all work done and give great customer service
good,Helping customers find their products while stocking the shelves and maintaining a clean work environment. Teaches you how to deal with adverse customers as well!
good,Dollar General is a fun place to work. Most employees are relaxed an approachable. But the pay here is what made me and others leave. Had been there for a year an a half an was still making the 7.25 a hour. Had not been raised like I’d been told it would. An do go in hoping for full-time
good,Good place to stay busy as manager. usually 6 days week 10 hour days. Supposed to have one mandatory weekend off per month. My regional supervisor never told me so i didn't get it. I do believe it was intentional on t heir part
good,"It was an acceptable place to work, but I felt like whenever I had a decision to make, I got double questioned every time, no matter what decision it is that I made."
good,"This store is actually closed now, but I did like it there. Sometimes it was hectic when other people wouldn't do their part, but over all, I really enjoyed my job at Dollar General."
good,My review is Dollar General is a good job for maybe teens and people looking for extra money. Not for a living unless you are looking for an assistant manager or store manager job.
good,"Fast paced, busy from opening to close little labor given to run store operations multiple vendors coming in and out throughout the day. Its a good company but the issue is your not given enough labor to get all things accomplished. Hardest part of the job is not falling behind on projects, keeping store fully recovered with little labor given."
good,I worked here for almost three years and I Loved the people that I worked with. The manager was very understanding when I needed certain hours or days off.
good,"You really dont do too much in any position at Dollar General. I dont think they are as organized as they could be, management wise. But the job is pretty easy. You're either on register or stocking, and they work with you on the scheduling."
good,The district manager would come into the store complain about things and then leave. She would expect us to fix everything before her next visit which is within a month but would not stay back in Maybe help fix the problems.   Also our employees would be called from our store to go help other stores .
good,I was disappointed at dollar general. The manager promised things and didnt deliver. Employees were never on the same page. There was no communication between management and employees.
good,While working at Dollar General I learned a lot about stocking and customer service.  I really enjoyed stocking and working with people. Sometimes it was difficult lifting the heavy boxes.
good,Everything was good when I worked at Dollar General. I loved dealing with the customers and getting to know what they wanted. Loved working with the other employees
good,"Provide customer service, cash register operations, stocking shelves and inventory.  Worked full time at Dollar General while caring for father with alzheimers. Manager was very helpful on working with my work schedule around my father's schedule.  I didn't receive my 1 week vacation pay when I left. I gave Dollar General 2 weeks notice that I was leaving, I didn't get my vacation pay because I didn't give a 30 advance request for my vacation."
good,stocked shelves ran register sweeped floors learned how to stack boxes on a cart management was okay culture was okay nothing hard about the job most enjoyable part of the job was unloading the truck
good,Overall a relaxed fun place to work. Threat was a big problem with people running out of the door with product. Chance for advancement was great. The pay is awful.
good,Barely any paid holidays. Benefits are ok. Some opportunities to advance in position but you must have open availability. Ok place to work good for a first job
good,"Dollar General"
good,"Helping customers out with their purchases, making someone's day, and running cash register, opening and closing the store.  I learned how to run register and better customer service.  My boss was amazing!"
good,"Very clean and safe working environment. There is potential to advance in the company...even transfer to another location. The hours are uncertain so you can not plan your schedule. Some days were 4 hours, some days were 12 hours....you never know."
good,"The company says, “customers first”.  That’s a given, but the employee should be treated just as good. The stores aren’t given enough hours to work with so they can allow their employees sufficient amount of hours to support their families. The handbook doesn’t explain everything. For example:  if you’d like to know how many hours you work to be full time, it’s not in there. So when you call Human Resources, you’re on the phone for 2 hours before you get to actually talk to a person to get your question answered. It’s a company you’d work for part time if you were a kid in college living at home with little to no bills to pay."
good,I was assistant manager some years ago and started out with 8/hr.  I was never given a raise and that is why I decided to leave.  I actually liked working for the company but the amount of work I was doing did not match up to the pay.
good,"It was a great first real cash handling job, I got to work with awesome people and got to really get to know the people who lived in the area that i was working in."
good,Working for Dollar general could have been better. The management team was lacking and did not focus on the need for the business.  The was lots of favoritism which created a hostile work environment.
good,"I just felt like new dm"
good,To be successful at DG a store manager would need to put in more than 60 hours a week.  That is due to the lack of labor hours and dollars allowed.  My store labor hours were 6-7% of Sales dollars and would still be cut.  The company wants all new hires to be brought in at minimum wage and part-time hours.  Hard to find a decent employee for that.
good,"In all honesty, it is just a place to make a little side money. It isn't the hardest job in the world so your paycheck definitely reflects that. Great store manager though."
good,"typical day of work would be fast paced because there are customers waiting with questions and ready to make purchase. I have learned to keep controll of inventory and about all the product they sale. Management is always in turnover mode. I have been there almost 4 years and I have had 7 managers! the culture of the workplace is busy. hardest part of the job would be adjusting to attitudes daily. I enjoy helping others, customer service would be the best part of the job for me."
good,I had a wonderful time working at Dollar general the customers treated us like family and the employees worked great together as a team to get everything done in an appropriate timely manor
good,"Took time but developed a devoted team, store was doing 28 a week whem started no bonus within 2 year doing 38 - 40 week received quarterly n yearly bonuses"
good,Its was a good experience and I enjoy working with my managers the customers were awesome it was an overall great experience as far as learning new management communication customers Needs & Wants
good,"Fast pasted, fun place to work, made the best of every thing but a very high turn over rate getting everything done was hard because we never had enough people at night most enjoyable was having a great crew"
good,"I overall loved my job at Dollar General, although employee are underpaid for the work they do. Dollar general is a good place to work for someone who is in school/ college."
good,"Even though the two head managers are very knowledgable about their jobs, there are a lot of inconsistancies that happen aound the store. Friendly enviroment."
good,Working at Dollar General was a fast work flow environment. you worked very closely with the public. keeping your customers happy was a very important role in your job description. this would be a great job for anyone that loves the public and their customers.
good,"My opinion my be heavily biased but the reason I'm so negative towards them is because the woman that fired me wasn't even the GM she was the assistant manager who acted without the word of the GM. Secondly the assistant manager had been a problem for previous stores by causing drama and encouraging workplace stress, someone with a record like this should have never been allowed to work around us, let alone her be given a position of power. Yes while she may not work there now that still doesn't remove the responsibility taken by the GM and her higher ups for not catching her sooner."
good,"I wouldn't say its the best place to work, but I've worked for far worse companies. All in all, it's easy and pay is fair for key holders, unfair for cashiers."
good,"Don't have enough people to cover on days needed. Usually only two people in store at night and the keyholerest  doesn't really get to take a lunch because they are always having to help cashier with key turns or help back up on register. They say your not suppose to work off the clock but most of the time you have no choice, you have to take care of the customers. Don't get to do things that need to be done because you work freight everyday, all day. No time to learn things you need to know for advancement. Work at least one weekend day if not both. Every weekend. No holidays off except Christmas day. No family time and can't make plans for your family time."
good,stay busy its keeps everyone happy. managers are over worked they can be very stressed someday usually only gets one day off a week. they give you way more task then you can finish in one day.
good,Different attitudes keep me happy.i like to make the people that feel bad happy. Make the ones that come to do bad do good and feel as if they were wrong to do it and get my work done for the day.
good,"Cashiering by taking and exchanging money. Stocking shelves by putting new product on the shelves. Answer phone and answer question about what is in the store, over the phone."
good,"•	Began to understand challenge and opportunities with CPGs in a $20 billion retailer "
good,It is a great place to work the first week of training might be a little hard but as soon as you get used to workflow and your coworkers you should be ok you learn organization and time management the workplace culture is what you want it to be. The most enjoyable part of my job was exchanging information with my customers on how to save an extra cent on items.
good,"The typical day at work entailed, hoping no one is stealing merchandise and trying to build baskets [sell more so the $ amount of the transaction is higher]."
good,This was a hard job for me due to not having transportation and the management that I had over me.  A typical day would consist of coming in and clocking in then either putting up stock or waiting on the customers by telling them where items was or checking them out
good,"Usually I would run freight, but lately they had me working register. I learned Dollar General has its values, but it is hard to maintain those values when the store gets backed up with products. Overall the store I worked at was managed decently, which helped everyone be able to work together in a pretty well mannered amount of time. The hardest part of the job was dealing with overstocked product that wasn't selling as fast as most products do and then having to come in to work at different times of the day to get freight ran when it still couldn't be taken care of because it was still overstock. The only enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with."
good,"stocked, cleaned, customer service, and checked vendors in and out. I learned how to talk to an angry customer, and co-workers. it was a good experience ."
good,"Learned many different skills in customer service. Did all the stocking plus cashiered. Multi-tasking was very enjoyable for me. They kept me very busy, not much down time."
good,"As a closing shift sales associate you have a lot of work to do and a short time to get it done. After the store closed, I had to mop and sweep the front area of the store, clean both bathrooms, recover (put things back),etc. It's a lot of work for a minimum wage salary. And they kept promoting other people over me who had been on the job a shorter time than me. They were always calling me in to work when others went out all night and called in the next day, and I had just worked all night. I had too many issues with this job. I fault management. And they didn't want you to get ANY voids. How is it your fault if a customer decides that they don't want to buy an item after you ring it up?"
good,If you do not have a good manager you may not like it. Some staff members may not do there job. The store always gets messy. But over all it is a good working experience to test your limits
good,i learned a lot working with dollar general but i liked it better working for the one in Tampa. the one i worked for here in Ocala needs to get more in-line and have things planned out. managers kept leaving and some of the co workers were just after one another.
good,There was no typical day. It depended on cust volume & was always changing.  It was a laid back atmosphere & my favorite part was working with customers.
good,It wasn't a bad place to work. They are very strict. You do not get a discount working there. You do advance to management pretty quickly as long as you work hard.
good,"Most days or evenings were very productive. Had small rushes, as with most retail. Very few surprises. High turnover on employees. High turnover on managment also. But overall a good company. Just needs a better healthcare and benefit package."
good,"Working at dollar general was a great experience, but when other employee attempt to get you fired got really old really fast. Other than that it was a great place of employment."
good,"Fast pace environment but when promoted you didn't get your raise. Stocking , not enough employees and not enough help. Stocking, cleaning, restocking, sign in trucks."
good,working for Dollar General i liked it they up beat stay on your feet type of work that makes 8 hrs feel like 4. i would get to work and know what would need to be done by the end of my shift. yes the duties you have are very predictable but your day to day work life will always change. a place where from the head manager to the cashier everyone is respectful and or cordial and even the people over our head manager was there for us to help with any solution  we need to assist in having a good work day
good,"a typical day is usually slow and steady."
good,"Typical days involved maintaining neat displays, handling customer questions and providing the customer with a helpful and satisfying shopping experience."
good,Most of the day is spent working on the cash register. I learned that I enjoy dealing with people. Management is firm due to constant changes of employees. The hardest part of the job is mulitasking between customers and keeping the store clean. The best part of the job is to be able to make people smile after they leave your line.
good,"Very fast paced, must know your job and care!!!! about people and the company.  was rewarding, liked it. but personal issues such as passing of parent and just overwhelming issues of security, which was NONE.  quit due to that after being robbed."
good,Bad pay to work ratio. Managers are not responsive with employee needs. Impossible work to hours ratio for whole store in general. Stores are under budgeted hours for work load
good,"Working for this company has many challenges that make the job much more difficult than it needs to be. Constant management changes, and budget cuts leave very little time to adequately train, retain value able employees. When you do get a good running store here comes some new way of doing things that takes more time to fix the bugs than the time it was worth. The positives of this company are very limited. Stressful, and glad I moved on a long time ago."
good,"Opportunity for promotions"
good,Dollar general was a great stepping stone in the right direction for me. They taught me invaluable information on the ends and outs of retail and how to truely take care of customers that i say on a day to day basis.
good,As long as you like doing different things and can handle lifting some heavy stuff as well as bending and standing on your feet for 8 hours then you would like this job
good,i didnt hate it but I didnt love it. No set schedules unless your assistant manager or above. constantly given impossible tasks.
good,"I worked for dollar general in a stoee that had just opened up.  It was one of my favorite jobs, just didnt offer many hours. "
good,Decent employer just feel that people are who they are and you just have to be able to adapt to the culture of the environment.
good,"was a very interesting experience. Job would be more suitable if it had more security, would feel like a more secure place to work. The overall atmosphere of working for dollar general was a fun and productive experience"
good,Depending on management the job could be  decent place to work. Be curious and ask questions. Talk to people who work their and get their honest opinion on that certain location.
good,"the job itself was okay. you got paid every week and hey started out $8/hr and you got a .25 cent raise every six months. however one of the managers would have me doing their job, while they sit on boxes in the back of the store on the phone. I have caught the manager myself and customers have as well."
good,"I like the people that I work with, but a majority of them don't do their job the way it is supposed to be done. I love my job due to the fact that I get to meet new people."
good,"This is a retail chain where you work and service the public and their retail needs. There is a large amount of scheduling, stocking and customer related interactions."
good,This company you work very hard but have a lot of fun. I have been fortunate to work with great people. There are good opportunities to learn allot. I don't really want to say anymore
good,Not a bad job for anyone in need. first job or as a secondary job just to tack on a couple more dollars to your monthly paycheck. typical minimum wage job.
good,"I change the sales price do clearance tags. I also recover the store, do totes, bathroom, sweep, trash and customer service. I have learned about how to use cash register and cash pick-ups. The management is okay but it needs improvement. My co-workers are fun and outgoing. The hardest part of the job is the drama of management and some co-workers that just doesn't want to do their job which I have to redo their work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers are like family and there are some good days."
good,"Working at the Dollar General had its ups and downs just like all jobs. It's a great job if you don't get into management. Gives you gas station hours to make a schedule, and expects it to be run like a grocery store."
good,Hard work pushed to your max lots to be done great employees enjoy working with them breaks are nice to enjoy with family or friends
good,"pretty laid back, other than getting the truck loads all out on shelf. learned how to count money and change fast without mistake. I faced and stocked the front section of store which was 12 isles, while running back and forth to register."
good,"Great company, could use more pay for the amount work required.I had great work experience and expanded my customers service skills."
good,"never a dull moment, always, something new to do, working with the public. co-workers where awesome and so was the management staff."
good,I was a cashier and I loved working with the costumers.  They all made my day. The manager was hard to work with because he didn't like women.
good,"Dollar General is a great company to start out in. However, it doesn't always mean you will move up in the company to a manager's position and run your own store. This is what I thought would happen and in over a year I am still the Assistant. "
good,I would have to say that there wasn't that many people that worked there.  Plus there was a lot of people that st old from there that is because they didn't have security camera.
good,"The managers didn't really do their jobs, they forced the other people too do their jobs for them. Work day went pretty badly, pay sucked."
good,There is a lot of work for only having two people working for once. It can also get boring if you have everything done. There isn't a hard part of this job. I believe that is one of the reasons why I don't like working here.
good,"It was fun, but I always felt like one of the few trying to constantly improve the store. The customers could occasionally be mean, but I found that treating them nicely and trying your hardest to help them really improved their attitude towards you during the next visit, even if they were still a bit rude to other cashiers."
good,"A typical day of work was coming in after school at about 5:30pm. I learned on the job how to stock that particular store. My manager was so sweet, understanding, and always had a positive attitude. My co- workers were very nice and helpful. The hardest part of my job was learning there computer program but once that was done, I knew exactly what I was doing. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to be around the costumers."
good,Manager was willing to work with me on health complications but cash counts were inaccurate. Excellent work environment. Very clean and organized. Hard working employees.
good,"A typical day for a Store Manager was doing everything and running around from point A to point B in the store without much time to relax. Being on a salary based pay meant working 70-80 (if not more) hours a week just to keep store doors open and customer satisfaction high. With this company having a high turnover rate most other stores did not have enough employees to lend for help when needed. This means you see your home only when you want to sleep and you live off snacks in the store. Hardest part of the job was being thrown into the position (with no prior experience) with so many unanswered questions and having to make things up as you go to run the store with little help from upper management. They did provide training, but this training only covered the paperwork part of the job and didn't help with day to day processes. So every day you could walk in with a plan to do one thing, and have everything set up, but would get told by higher up management to do something else so your whole plan gets turned upside down. This was regular and it caused a lot of stores to be turned upside down repeatedly. There is no slack for mistakes either, you do it right the first time even if you don't know how. The most enjoyable part of the job was the exciting coworker environment! Everyone was able to make fun out of the day and smile with each other!"
good,"Clock in get a draw;"
good,"There are pros and cons working for Dollar General. You get a flexible schedule, time off when needed, however, the pay doesn't equal the amount of work your expected to complete on a daily basis."
good,I would cashier daily load and unload trucks during the week help out customers with customer service stock said items from truck to shelf
good,"A typical day at work was helping customers."
good,"I liked the job but there was poor store management, and no pay raises. However the job was fun, working with people I liked, and getting to work with customers. The work was easy."
good,"A typical day at work would be showing up and assisting customers with the check-put process.If that was being covered I would travel through the store and ensure customer satisfaction as well as maintain a highly aesthetic appeal to our isles. Co-workers were like family and were easily the most enjoyable  part of my job. Management was ok, with the most difficult part being mopping the store."
good,"A typical day at work for me, working night shifts mostly, was a bit overwhelming at times but my co-workers and I had each others backs and really pushed through to show one another the true meaning of 'teamwork'. It was fun, stressful, rewarding, and motivating as an all together experience. I learned a strong amount of patience, stronger communication skills, time management, all aspects that the tasks at our store required, as well as enhanced people skills. There were quite a few rough patches with management when I was hired, but after a course of time I saw a great change and noticed a more positive work environment for almost all my fellow employees. A fun work place was a major benefit but we all knew how to keep it professional and structured at the same time. No shenanigans that would take away from each others deadline work time, making sure customers were never neglected, and always putting out a lending hand. "
good,"continuous work. Family atmosphere, weekly pay. Would recommend for employment. No flexibility. Management on an executive level is very unorganized and does not support their employees well."
good,"does not care about employees. working in a hot store, bathroom does not work.Customers are great I love working with the public"
good,"I came in. counted a drawer. Then I counted cigarettes and the change fund. I would then start recovery, coming to the front to help the cashier when needed. Halfway through the shift I gave the cashier their break then took mine. I would continue recovery until 9pm when I would start with the end of day duties. "
good,this is a good working environment! its employees are very questionable. but overall a good working environment. gfgfgfgfgfgfgfgfgfgfgfggfgfgfgfggfgffgfg
good,Decent place to work but if you are a store manager you have absolutely no work life balance. You are given not enough hours to schedule workers and are expected to make up for it yourself.
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General. Management was efficient, the store was clean and well stocked. I enjoyed the teamwork and our workdays were productive."
good,"The cash register is easy to use and learn, friendly customers, fast paced environment. There is always something to do like cleaning, stocking, recovery, ect. You are on your feet a lot and there really is no down time besides on your break."
good,"ringing up the customers and enjoying conversation"
good,"If you are a married person or have a family to take care of, I do not recommend as the company is demanding of the managers and a lot of physical as well as mental stress. They do not support the managers very well and they do not allow enough labor dollars to a lot for other associates to work at a decent rate of pay, especially in the new entry level. It is difficult to reward your staff for a job well done."
good,"Hours are cut to about 5-10 a week per person with no chance of advancement. Some of the people are great to work with and for. Job duties are a bit much for one person to tackle alone. From cleaning the store to windows to bathrooms, to waiting on customers, to recovering the store, and filling sodas alone, its hard to manage it all."
good,"No money(7.25 hr), no raises (once a year @ .25), no benefits (employee discounts etc), fluctuating hours (open and close alternating days),  no hours( 23 hours a week @6 days a week).  The people that I work with are great (the only plus besides the customers)."
good,I get along with my employee and customer. I catch on to the job fast. I'm always ready to work.
good,I really enjoyed working there wish I still lived there I dont think if I didnt move I would ever leave.
good,"*A typical day consisted of helping customers, rotating inventory and cleaning."
good,Typical day at work was coming setting up the pizza and salad bar cleaning tables answering the phone to take orders. I learned how to make pizza. My co workers were very helpful and polite.
good,"Very friendly environment. Daily tasks included: counting register drawer before and after shift, recovery (pulling items to front of shelf), keeping a clean organized station, cleaning floors and restrooms, assisting customers with specified items, stocking/organizing shelves. I thoroughly enjoyed customer interaction, it made long shifts better. My co-workers were very considerate and incredibly easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the unstable schedule I was placed with weekly."
good,"A typical work day at Dollar General is usually fun, the customers are friendly. Management is excellent gives direct orders so you know exactly what they want done. Management also works beside you. My Coworkers are fun to work with but they get there job done. There really isn't a hard task at the Dollar Store, I enjoy going to work everyday day."
good,it was ok job didnt stay long cause i was looking for a better job then i found one some the ppl there were ok
good,"I wish I could say I enjoyed this job more, but the store was located within a poorly maintained building. The floor was unfinished everywhere, and had tiles peeling up. The backroom door was beaten half out of existence, and there were only four cameras in the store. It was almost impossible to reduce shrink in this environment."
good,i counted and dispursed money to the customers and did freight. learned how to do planograms. management and coworkers were nice. sometimes getting enough freight done was hard do to customers needing to be cashed out. working with my coworkers and helping the customers
good,"It's hard work, you need to get your hands dirty. The most difficult part was trying to complete the many daily tasks with limited payroll."
good,"I worked closely with store manager to review new policies, operational changes and training initiatives. Assigned employees to specific duties to best meet the need of the store. Completed daily books, counted cash and made bank deposits. Received, checked and shelved all merchandise inventory. Completed daily registering and store open/close functions. Assisted the store manager in daily operations of the store. The management was fair. The co-workers were all responsible and eager to work. The hardest part of the job was taking responsibility in closing the store. The most enjoyable part was being able to be responsible for running the store as a manager."
good,"I enjoyed working with some of my co-workers that werent afraid to do their job. There was a lot of discrimination going on in the store that I worked in that made working there quite difficult. Although, I tried to stay out of the drama of it all, and do my job to the best of my ability."
good,This company never gave any hours to anyone unless you held a very high title. Pay was bad too.
good,"My customers were amazing, but the management could definitely be more organized."
good,I worked part - time which was great at the time. I learned that people won't stay at a minumum wagw job and do any kind of work.My manager was o.k. Co-workers not reliable Hardest part of the job nothing stands out.Most enjoyable part of job was I made new friends.
good,"everyday was the same but different, dealing with the customers hands on was a perk"
good,"Dollar General is a great work experience the customers are so nice and friendly. I greeted customers, helped if they needed it. Handled money, gave receipts, made sure the store was stocked, kept my area clean and organized."
good,"i had to stock shelves and do the register and i learned some small math skills,co workers kept to them selves,the hardes part was unloading the truck"
good,"It was o.k., how to unload a truck, manager o.k., co-workers o.k., having about 15 people in my line and no one comes to help and open up, but I enjoyed getting the customers in and out."
good,Worked with great people. Stock was not so bad. My manager was a wonderful lady. Watching people steal was hard to deal with.
good,Lots of one on one customer service assistance. Up to date software for inventory management. Friendly co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer satification
good,I originally was a cashier that was fun then I worked my way up to store manager where I learned a lot.  I've been with Dollar General for 7 years while completing my college degree.  I want a change of pace and to find some thing different to do.
good,"For the most the customers was great. I enjoyed helped setting up the store for new business grand opening. But there wasn't any benefits, nor was I working enough hours."
good,"I started as a sales associate, and was promoted to assistant manger. My daily duties were the following but not limited to; Opening the store, giving sale associates their tills, and logging in cash loan amount. Writing on the daily sales board about the day before sales, credit, and loss merchandise. Giving customers quality service, running extra register, giving refunds, answering inbound calls, sign in vendors, count cash, checks, and clean the store, then close."
good,"Working for Dollar General has honestly been a learning experience, it was my first major job and the longest one I've held to date.  I've had mostly good experiences.  The company does seem to have the best at heart for it's employees but at times can have a poor way of showing it.  However, it's a big corporation so obviously some of it's employees and managers will fall through the cracks."
good,"My day started off with getting right on my task, checking out customers, stocking shelves, cleaning the store at closing time. I learned to be patient with customers that were impatient. I enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General consists of running cash register, assisting customers and stocking merchandise.  I've learned to be very self-motivated to get assigned tasks completed.  The management and co-workers are the best part of this position.  The hardest part of the job is to get all stock put away with constant flow of customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with co-workers"
good,Very faced paced small box retailer. Training provided was through and efficient. 
good,"I worked at a DG in a SMALL town. I had fun with all my co-workers, management and health benefits were pretty poor though. A lot of things were unorganized. I feel that both shifts weren't treated fairly. One shift had to do more than another; as well as one person always did the same thing each night which wasn't fair. The job itself was pretty easier; Cashier & stocking with light cleaning. The hardest thing I came to meet was the RUDE customers who blamed every little thing on the employees; for instant our floors not being cleaned after they did a phase change."
good,"The people were friendly. The work was steady but fair."
good,usually i would go in and start ringing customers up if i was not busy i would check in vendors also put stock away. at the end of shift i would count down cashiers drawers. 
good,"This company is like the other corporations, just looking to save as much money for themselves. Never enough pay roll to make the store look really nice and clean. Guess they don't care? I really don't know."
good,A typical day at work for me was coming in to work and doing my job. I didnt learn anything that i didnt already know there. The co-workers there were nice and joyful.
good,"A typical day at work would involve me waiting on customers, cleaning the store and pushing freight. My learning experience is based on setting planograms, they change weekly. My co-workers and manager are very easy to get along and work with. The hardest part of the job is trying to get the freight put up while waiting on customers. The most enjoyable part is being with my co-workers."
good,The hardest part of this job is dealing with rude customers but eventually your skin is thick enough that it does not matter as long as we strive our best to ensure the happiness of the customer
good,My typical day at work is running the cash register and stocking the shelves daily. My managers are ok people to work with. My co-workers are friendly. There was no hardest part of the job . The enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with what they needed.
good,very few hours. While the standards are good and pleasant environment you do not get enough hours as a full time job.
good,"I recover my area of the store( front the shelves), check out customers(there ARE some not very friendly ones), i have a great manager that works with you if you have problems, and the people i work with are awesome. thats the number one best thing about this job, there is no drama between co-workers. the hardest part of his job would probably be ignorant customers, but other than that nothing."
good,A very demanding job. An extremely large facility with over 400 employees per shift.
good,You work hard and you do not get positive feedback. Manager is always negative and not happy.  You can work hard and still get told your not working. They add more things then one person can do alone.
good,"Manager was hard to approach at times. However, the coworkers were very helpful and easy to talk to. Flexibility was sometimes limited depending on the timing"
good,Great area to build costumer service skills. You're able to be productive on your feet as well. You learn how to organize supplies and do it in a timely manner.
good,Dollar General was an interesting starter job for me in highschool. Dealing with people was always fun and engaging and helping the customers was a joy in itself because it was a way to give back to the community.
good,A day as an LSA (lead sales associate) starts out coming in and creating drawers for each cashier of the day. After that you must assign tasks for cashier and yourself for the work day. It’s fairly easy and stress free
good,Without enough team members its stressful not enough time to be out of the store and with your families not enough pay for the amount of hours expected to be put in after 40
good,"I loved working with the customers, particularly regulars. The manager that was there when I worked there was not very understanding of my mental health issues, making me uncomfortable working with that particular manager. Overall however I liked my co-workers and managers when all was well. The work was generally fairly fast-paced and I was kept busy so time went by fast most of the time."
good,"A usual shift at Dollar general for me is operating the register, stocking floor in between customers, and counting the deposit at the end of the night and closing the store. It gave me more experience with customer service and stocking efficiently. The work environment is extremely welcoming and inclusive."
good,DollerGeneral is a great company to work at. They alaways are there for the customers. Theres alot of dills and coupins to us there. I would recommend people to shope there
good,Persons without family can be successful in this company. Instead of the company looking out for the employees they solely look out for the customers. Instead of giving more hours so things can be completed they decide to build more stores.
good,It’s all about ur mindset that job is okay and cool but  it’s just a stepping ston for the next be job so all ways continue to look for mor bigger and better jobs
good,It's not easy working in the public as a cashier. I had to learn that not everyone have respect. Overall I enjoyed working there because of the different people.
good,I loved this job and would defiantly go back in a heart beat! It’s very laid back and easy. Defiantly have to have a personality and a judging one too for this job.
good,"Dollar general is a good company to work for, however it all depends on the manager you work for. The store was located in a area that was high on crimes and the biggest crime the store experienced was theft. The store didn't have security so it was difficult trying to manage with customer needs when the police was always in and out of the store."
good,Stayed busy with freight. Good hours with good management. It’s been five years since I’ve been there. I am confident in retail and I do enjoy how busy it gets throughout the day.
good,I would come to work unbox and stock store items. Help customers if needed and clean isles. I enjoy helping others so this job fit well with my personality
good,Was a pretty great job I enjoyed how I came encounter with and helped daily. No it was not always perfect but we worked as a family. You knew why you chose to work there and customers helped you come back.
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Great customer base, and employees. Can be difficult to find good help or receive help from other managers in the company. We all work very long hours throughout the week."
good,"It was a great experience gave me more skills for what I need."
good,At Dollar general I was more like family than a business for me. I enjoyed my customers and my coworkers. Needed more hours but overall this was a great job I would go back if had the chance.
good,Is a great company but management I had was very poor! I would work for another one if management was better in that store. Overall I loved working for the company!
good,This is my first and only job I've worked here for almost four years. Lots of multitasking and customer service. I like working here but the pay is not great and there is no set schedule.
good,It was a good enough job. Kind of demanding. But decent. Dealing with customers could get tricky. The best part was when i was able to stock shelves. I worked closing shift and the hours worked for my family and myself.
good,I worked cash register mostly and i stocked the shelves. On Thursday i would do the truck orders and take all the orders to store in the back until the products needed to be stocked.
good,Dollar general turnover rate is high so getting a job there is easy its keeping the job long term that's hard. Environment is a sometimes good sometimes bad place to work in it all depends on ones character.
good,Typical day at work was pretty easy. You would run the register or put up stock. I learned how to run register and properly handle customers also learned a better understanding of how to put up stock. Management was pretty great. Hardest part of the job was putting up stock in the required time. The part that I enjoyed the most was interacting with customers.
good,"Our mission is to serve others. And, we think our customers are best served when we keep it real and keep it simple. Dollar General stands for convenience, quality brands and low prices"
good,"you stay busy"
good,In my opinion Dollar General is a good and fair company to work for. The benefits offered are great and affordable. My only issue would be the manager I had.
good,"When I first starting working at Dollar General, I had a very nice boss.  Then she got sick and someone else took over. It was ok for awhile, then  managers changed several times.   I liked my job, but I decided I wanted to make more money, so I got another job."
good,Was promised 40 hours a week and never got it. Was also promised a pay raise that never came. Employees would lie and gossip about each other to keep drama and tension in the work place. They had high turnover because of too many employees no one got any hours. when I explained to my boss that I needed More hours because I have a baby on the way she actually gave me less hours.
good,"A typical work day is long and busy. You have to be able to multi task. For cashiers you have to stock, maintain front end, return all merchandise back to its proper home, help customers with their needs and concerns, and you have to be observant and watch for theft. My manager was awesome when we would travel for work she would pay for our lunches and was easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job really is stopping theft."
good,I worked there for 4 months and gained a lot of work experience. It was very rewarding to learn new things and talk to customers as well as getting to know regulars.
good,"nice place to work clean, nice people. good hours an you can start from the bottom an have a chance to move up to a manager or 3rd key. an was is a small town so you new just about every one"
good,I loved it just wish they paid more then I would love to make a career out of the job but due to the fact I must pay my Bill's and support my family I can't stay.😔
good,"Not a bad retail job, management was pretty relaxed and they were flexible with scheduling so the work/life balance was good. I didn't want to make a career out of it, it just paid the bills at the time."
good,Not really a bad company to work for just stressful at times. For me I can’t stand repetition and there’s a lot of it working here. Same Annoying customers lol but management is very chill. Fairly easy job but needs better pay great job to have if your just needing a side job or first time job.
good,"It was an ok place to work, didn't have a store manager when i first got there. The store was a mess and you can tell how the employees acted that they had no sense of leadership or how to do simple things around the store."
good,Yep don’t do it a lot of stuff going on and they are always getting rid of people but if you are lucky there is opportunity to get lots of hours since people don’t last long
good,"I liked working for them. They were great at treating their employees with respect and like they were appreciated! Manager was an amazing boss, easy to work with and very open to ideas and opinions."
good,Working at dollar general can be stressful and fun at times. When I first was hired in I was just a sales associate. Two weeks into working the job I was given the opportunity to be a Lead sales associate. I held that position for a while and was given several opportunities to advance from that position but decided to stay where I was.
good,"The management has gotten better with the new manager but still needs some work. I currently work at dollar general the one on Mathis road in San Antonio, Texas. I have been working their for about 2 months now and it has been a learning experience."
good,At Dollar General you stock the shelves and Cashier. Also on saturday’s you put out the next weeks sale stickers. Very little hours and no raises. Overall a good job but not enough money to support a family
good,"Working with customers helping customers find things that they are looking for.Doing returns for customers.Making every customers happy everytime,with a smile"
good,"I worked there a couple times, perfect for part time but don't expect anything full time.  Management was decent. Customers were nice, some days were crazy busy especially when festivals were going on."
good,I enjoyed working with dollar general. If you have a good manager they will help work around your busy schedule if your a parent. Dollar general is a good company to work for.
good,The stores I worked in were well managed and we had a good time doing our jobs as a team. Managers are respectful in my opinion and work right with you on the job!
good,"Dollar general does not pay enough for the amount of work that must be completed. Trying to take care of guests while keeping the store and bathrooms clean, also stocking items on shelves and requiring all of it to be done by a certain time which is very hard to complete when your a very busy store."
good,The pay isnt great and the hours arent guaranteed. The work can be stressful but it's easy overall. You can expect a yearly raise of 15 to 25 cents if you are lucky. I wouldn't recommend staying with them for the long term.
good,I was unknowingly transferred from my store I loved to another I hated. Everyone knew but me. I enjoyed being a floater which is where I helped at multiple stores that needed it.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at the store close to my home. I liked almost every person employed there and enjoyed the interaction with the customers and vendors. I would have preferred to work regular 8 hour shifts vs 4 hour shifts."
good,"A typical work day is between 5-8 hours. "
good,"While working for Dollar General I was under a not so great manager and an even worse district manager. In my time there I was; scheduled to work for durning my classes, not allowed to attend my brothers funeral, and accused of doing something that someone else had done. the most enjoyable part was when I got to clock out."
good,"I loved the people and the store that I worked at. More rural, so it was a lot of regulars. I was part time so no benefits but we were often understaffed to I worked a full time schedule without the benefits."
good,"If you love fast paced then Dollar General is the company for you. There was never a moment of peace between receiving truck, trying to stock the shelves, and helping customers."
good,Hard to keep employees because it is all part time...long hours and only 1 Day off s week very early mornings for truck deliveries. Competitive wages good benefits
good,"Worked there for a period of time around a decade ago."
good,"Fast paced work environment must be able to multitask and complete several different types of tasks a day. I feel like the pay rates should be higher for all employees, not just management."
good,Management was not as expected. Some days things would be in order and majority of the days they were not. I picked up how to do inventory and work the cash register. Gain the knowledge how to deal with customers in any situation good or bad.
good,It was a decent place to work the people were nice and managment was pretty good id work there again if there is another one hiring they work with your hrs so if you need time off they will usually give it too you
good,"I loved my job and boss and taking care of the customers, but corporate doesn't care about payroll and paying the employees correctly for their roles or years worked."
good,"Dollar General wasn't my first choice for work, but I needed SOME kind of a paycheck to put gas in the car and food in the fridge.  What I don't like is that I only work 1-2 days a week for a grand total of 8 hours at $7.25 an hour.  I do like my managers and they do make the job enjoyable, as do the people who come into the store, I just wish I had better hours."
good,"Dollar General is a fast pace, always busy, friendly, and always available and willing to help. Associates work together in a timely manner and safe environment."
good,"When I was hired as a store Manager I was told I would be making "
good,Good company to work for but pay isn’t great. The company has great benefits and teaches you many skills that you wouldn’t normally be taught. It’s a good business but not a great income.
good,They were very fair with time however very poor pay the staff was very friendly management was very fair and helpful in the learning process  my experience there was overall well
good,A typical day at work is very fun but its also very quick passed. You learn a lot of things like if you do not know how to count money you will learn quickly. You also will learn the prices of every item as you spend your time there. The hardest part of the job will probably be when the customers have coupons.
good,"I loved my job, location, and co-workers, but the managements sucked. I learned alot about the community and where i now lived, but the management was ""sufficient"""
good,For my position which was assistant store manger they only paid me 9.00 per hour. i had so many responsibilities for little money.whenever i asked for a raise i was told i need driver license first.
good,"it was pretty easy learning the every day tasks and everyone there was helpful and made the hiring experience an easy and comfortable process for me, but altogether, nothing especially spectacular about it."
good,"I worked warehouse as a picker in D89/90. Fast-paced none stop work every assignment is timed for completion then timed against the shift. Weekly wright ups if your under 85% for a week. A single assignment might be 145 60lb bags of dog food and your given 6mins and 17sec's to complete. Then next assignment might be 300 single picks across 32 aisles and your given 8mins and 33 sec's to complete. Not a team centric environment. Problems come up from people abusing a system that lets you ""add"" time to your clock, can and has Resulted in in-fighting. My normal shift was 15hrs tue-sat. First 12 where actual picking, last three where house keeping. Smoker friendly break rooms."
good,"I  learned everything you need to know about running a store"
good,It’s a fun and comfortable place to work. The pay wasn’t that well but it did help me get by. I liked when we have off days we can be put on the schedule to make more money.
good,Small retail store one to two members daily . Manual work on your feet all day. management of budget for the staff leaves much to be desired. Inflexible working hours for staff.
good,"A cashier at Dollar General provides customer service and operates the cash register. Customer service duties include greeting guests, directing guests to products, and providing product knowledge. When running the cash register, a Dollar General cashier scans items, processes payments, provides change, and bags items."
good,I enjoyed it here but no work life balance and no praise from higher ups when your killing yourself to get things done. Great for single people with no family
good,I really enjoyed working at Dollar General but the manager could have had a better attitude. I put in a two weeks notice and she didn't honor it. I tried to work here again and was able to be rehired.
good,"i liked working here"
good,"The people you work with are really caring people. Most of them go out their way to help you when you need it, but corporate management doesn't too much care for their employees or their personal life."
good,"Very fast pace, always a customer to help, learning something new daily. Never a slack in time always have things to do. Entergetic atmosphere help with the fast pace. Every store is diferent in the same way.... The managers, customers, and location, makes the company a diverse learning experience."
good,Good company  to work for and to get started with the careers. The store managers in 60%of locations are worthless.the company offers great benefits  and weekly pay.
good,"The work is very fast paced, you have to stock shelves and watch the cash register at all time, no bells or buzzers to let a customer tell you they were there. If you didn't get to them quickly you would get in trouble since the customers would complain."
good,"all you do Is work take your breaks and go home, all  you do is load trailers with rolltainer all day. theres nothing wrong with the work if u like to work there is some fast peste job but nothing to hard to do all easy."
good,ok job if your young didn't advance worked hard to wanted and worked hard to make a career ok only if you want part time just heavy lifting and standing in one spot is to much love the customers especially my favorites but very hard to make ends meet if its not a better career
good,"They always have their stock carts on the floor, so the items can e placed on the shelves.  The aisle's are already to narrow, adding a stock cart doesn't help the issue"
good,Everyday was never the same. Always get people asking if the store is open as they are walking through the door. The hardest part of job was working during the busy holiday.
good,i liked working at Dollar General but my manager was what pushed me to my breaking point.. he expected me to be perfect at everything... but he always contradicted himself he would tell me to be there in the mornings and i couldn't even get in the store to clock in.  i would wait 2 hours or longer most of the time just sitting in my car... he would expect me to clean and run the register and help people all at one time and then complain that i wasn't doing it fast enough. to be real most of the associates had a nasty attitude towards me.. the pay wasn't bad nor the hours but the environment just wasn't good... the manager promised to make me a key-holder but he straight lied to me
good,"The assistant manager and manager gossiped, sabotaged, and were rude to all of the employees including myself. It was unfortunate because the company is amazing."
good,"you have to work fast"
good,We worked 10 hrs a day and every weekend. You would miss out on family activities. You stock and clean the floors. Could work management every other weekend.
good,The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and learning things I didn’t know before. I laughed with the customers and made new friends! I Want to switch because I feel that I want to move on with my career!
good,My old manager was very good. The store was ran really good and the store was clean and in order the stock was put out. Now the store is a  mess you can never find things on the shelf when you go in there. things are not marked like they should and sometimes the store is not open on time. Poor mangement!
good,"Good place to work if money is needed its a decent place good people as well as steady paced working environment. The online CBL'S are pretty simple testing for new comers, and the stores are layed out simple for the people stocking shelves"
good,"Worked here for 6 months and I hated the manager more than anything. He favored one employee and let her wear jeans and told me to buy black pants when I didn’t have the money and all I had was jeans. And he wasn’t friendly by any means. And at the time, the pay rate was $8.25 per hour."
good,"Typical day at work I go in and start on the cash register, if no one needs checked out I go to the u boat and unstock merchandise and recover the merchandise. I enjoy people and being social."
good,"I loved working at the street,md location. I loved all the customers that I became friends with and most of the employees were good friends as well. I didn't care for the manager and the way he choose to do things."
good,"Always busy and hard at work"
good,"high stress, good people, not enough hours for employees to meet dead lines sometimes, all in all a nice place to work for people who like high stress and high volume work places"
good,A typical day is putting stock away and helping customers. The store manager at the time was always behind on her work and passing it down for the rest of us to do. The hardest part of it all was when we got deliveries. The assistant manager was very helpful in making the days run smoothly
good,dollar general is based on they sales I like that but I also like helping people such as customer service. I learned that respect goes a long way also.The workplace is alight it ain't that bad
good,"I ussualy worked 2-4 days a week. Was a part time job while I finished up highschool, made just enough to pay for gas and go to the movies on the weekend. Not a bad job"
good,"Dollar general was a great place to work learned a lot of things with truck orders, stocking, scheduling, working at a fast pace, making sure store recovery was finished at the end of each day, assuring store cleanliness and customer service."
good,"There is a high turnover in management. If your managers are good, it can be a great place to work. If not, it is unfulfilling and draining. Corporate policies are used as leverage for termination, but you can also be terminated if you follow a corporate policy and it upsets a customer."
good,I worked at nights and it is not a kick back and relax kinda job must be able to pull your weight. Fast paced and hard work. no time for slacking off.
good,"no shifts u work days and night and its not an option unless u work like 2 days a week... bosses arent bad for the most part, you get discounts at a lot of other places but not dollar general"
good,"It is hard work, hot and demanding. I was much younger when I was at Dollar General Warehouse so I was able to handle the long hours and hard work. It was a pretty good place to work"
good,"fast paced, competitive, learned alot, how to stock, check in vendors.The GM was unfair, always pressured employees. Nothing you ever did was good enough for the company, well at least for the GM"
good,"Very fast paced environment. Must be able to work along in the store for long periods of time. Idea work place for part-time work, but the pay needs improvement."
good,I liked everyone at DG- good people and they made the horrible night shift hours almost bearable. Well organized and kind management. I would like to work there again but the newbies all go directly to night shift once trained.
good,"You always had something to do even if there was nothing else left to do, you could always find shelves to stock, rolltainers, cleaning, helping customers, etc. Management was decent most of the time although it was hard to work with."
good,"I over all enjoyed the work. There was always some way to keep busy. The work day flew by. Not many coworkers so drama could be frequent, but often if you made connections it became like a very connected family. Fairly decent place to work. The truck was fun to unpack, and the only job that could be tedious was recovering product, but overall the job wasn't very hard. I learned how to present myself to customers, how to handle customer complaints, and how to keep the store presentable on a daily basis."
good,"Good job to get your feet wet in the working world gives you people skills, communication is the key to working in this sometimes fast paced environment."
good,"Overall great company to work for. "
good,"There's really nothing to it. You stock, ring up customers, and provide customer service. Not very busy and the pay is minimum wage. I'm constantly having to fight for more hours."
good,It's a good job . Sometimes it'll be too much work for one person and it gets busy so it kinda hard to get everything you were assigned done. And it's little pay for everything that we actually do there .
good,"A typical work day at Dollar General (as a full-time manager) included: ensuring customer satisfaction, stocking shelves, providing store maintenance, answered questions about store products, services, and policies; handled money, and received our trucks and vendors. "
good,"easy work, management can be a little demanding but the staff is great at making sure everything is done and done correctly. Overall if you just need a job this a place to work."
good,the store and employees was great. the corporate part sucked a little and would not fix the issues of the employees. the customers were great as well as the atmosphere
good,It doesnt matter if you are management you will still make next to minimum wage. The experience is great though! i learned so much from this job that help me with future job findings. This is a great first job or just starting out.
good,constantly busy between upkeep of store and checking out customers having to restock store and do plan o grams and end caps along with price changes are hard to accomplish while cashing out customers
good,"Dollar General had great  room for advancementat in a short amount of time. but they was not willing to work with anyone on the schedule because the managers with accommodate themselves and no one else. the company itself is not bad to work for, depending on who the store manager is"
good,Schedule was flexible which is nice when having a child. All employees were great to work with. All holidays off which is always a plus. Pay just isn't great.
good,"a typical day at Dollar general. very stressful, you work by yourself, no lunch breaks. the most enjoyable part of my job are the customers. the hardest part of the job is trying to work on freight while your on the register"
good,"I would run the cash register, stock shelves and keep the store clean, as well as help customers find things and check them out when ready. My managers and co-workers were pleasant to work with and I   enjoyed my work experience when I worked there."
good,"It's a good job if you're new to the work environment, also a great place to get experience. It is possible to go up in job positions so there is always that plus if trying to get manager experience."
good,Easy place to work . Not enough hours. Really bad pay. Friendly staff.id recommend this job for a second job if u need a little extra cash cus of such little hours and low pay
good,"I loved working for dollar general in the beginning, but they promised me a promotion for 8 months that i didn't ever get. The manager i had was great but the hours varying so often made it difficult to make plans."
good,I really wouldn't mind going back. We could have better access to higher authority and somewhat of a set schedule but other than that I Loved Working For this Company.
good,"It can become a busy store, so being quick paced is a must, but remembering to treat the customers good is something you can't forget. Their is room for improvement in any business. Overall, it's a fair place to work."
good,DG is a great place to work as long as you have a good manager!   I enjoyed learning all about retail.  It can be stressful but it's fun.  Just remember to always smile.
good,Dollar general was a pretty good place to work. Some times the hours were a little crazy. I would get called in on my days off and sometimes it was inconvenient. If i was struggling or didn't know how to do something at work I was happily helped.
good,Dollar General itself is a great place to work with great opportunists of advancement if properly managed.Dollar general also offer great benefits to their employees.
good,"I loved working at this location, great manager, relaxed environment. The pay is low and not many hours, not benefits unless you are the store manager."
good,This is a good place to work. It can be hard to move up in the company. You can be asked to go to different stores to work. You meet a lot of different types of people.
good,No show employees therefore had to jump through hoops to fill in absentees. Tremendous opportunity for multi-tasking daily. Stores need lots more housekeeping on all shifts. Hardest part was unexpected long hours.
good,Its a good workplace its just they hire the worse people to work for them and are understaffed. And the people who do work there are ineligible to do a lot of things.
good,Learn new things found good friends management wasn't so bad all my co-workers I got along with I learn how to unload and load trucks and how to be a manager
good,"A typical day of work consisted of either opening or closing depending on the shift I was given that day. I ran the cash register,, stocked shelves, maintained store cleanliness, and answered customer questions to the best of my ability."
good,My manager was the nicest very caring also. Most customers (at my location) are very nice you get to know people its a small town.Never had any problems working there besides getting some cashiers to do their jobs.
good,Dollar General is a good place to work when you have the right teem working with you or ther right amount of people. The most stressful part is when we get truck each person has their own part to do and if they don't do it it falls back on the next person it doesn't help that we are limited on  employees. I'm a very organized person and like things to go has planed as easy as possible but if everyone doesn't put their part in it's kinda hard.
good,work days are long. I have become a stronger supervisor. Management team are fair. hourly employee driven. long hour without supervisor compensation. the interaction with the employees
good,this job is fun but it also can be stressing due to them not having enough employees. the hardest is stocking and trying to do  the cashier job at the same time
good,"If you're looking for a job the will take you to many parts of the country, this is it.  I've visited many cities and states working as a remodel merchandiser."
good,This is an okay place to work. It's easy work. but I wish that they get some security in there stores so the employees can feel more safe when they are at work. And they should pay a little more as well.
good,Working there is okay for people that are starting out and need the money. But is not recommended to live off for a while. That's the way that i look at it.
good,"Good place to work just couldn't balance home and job schedules. The manager is wonderful, the company is good to the employees, but working all night shifts wasn't for me"
good,Not as much help. Loved stocking it was pretty much easy loved socializing with customers hated when I didn't have as mush help. Had plenty of down time which I hated honestly I loved to stay moving.
good,"Dollar General was a good place to work at with a good work environment. Job was a cashier, and had to put up stock and cleaned store. Most customers were friendly."
good,it was was a good environment to work in. wish it could've been a better team that what it was. but it was over all a positive friendly working place of business.
good,"The store needed a lot of work in general and management was not trying to recognize we needed help getting it together. Its not a bad company to work for what so ever, I just happened to have a bad a experience with the management of the store I worked in. I enjoyed getting to work with the customers though. That is always the best part. Getting to conversate and make peoples days just by ringing them up or helping them find something they need."
good,"Pick/pack items for shipment to send to retail store. Cycle count products in the warehouse on daily basis. Stock pick lines slots for packers."
good,Friendly employees and management. Could benefit from enforcing the rules more to create incentive in employees work ethic. Overall a great place to work.
good,At this job I had to watch over the cashier's and the stockers. Also had to make schedule's sometimes and make sure certain people had to get their different times off of work.
good,I loved working here my  boss was the best I had time off to be able to spend time with my children she always corrected problems when they came about she always made sure we were safe
good,"learned the importance of customer service how a smile and a helping hand can go along way. Working at Dollar general help me to use my skills learned in school which includes money management, deposits as well as scheduling.working with so many different kinds of smart individuals also help me gain the wisdom to be able to handle any situation that is thrown my way."
good,"Stocking product on shelves, unloading delivery truck, check out customers at cash register. Keep area clean and clutter free. Having short or no breaks as they didn't have enough employees to cover the work load most of the time."
good,Unless you are some type of management your hours can range from 4 to 12 hours a week. If you have good managers you will most definitely enjoy working there.
good,"As Assistant Manager, you have to open the store, check that you have enough money to make it through the day.  Set the registers for the Cashiers.  Make sure the store is clean.  Check the computer for your tasks that day from Headquarters.  Complete those tasks."
good,It was fine but the pay is low.  The work is fine and the management is ok but not great.  It would be nice if they showed a little appreciation for the employees
good,"Honestly , I loved working there ! it wasn't a hard job yes the pay could of been better but it wasn't bad , I liked getting too meet some new/different everyday!! My manager was the problem!"
good,"I love the people I work for and with, but I never get a weekend off. Customers are the best! I'm missing all the family functions.  All I want is a week day job."
good,Dollar general is a great place to work. the management could be a little better with employees. the manager should not have a 80 hour week when you have employees wanting more hours that is not even on the schedule for 20.
good,Was A Very Good Company To Work For When I was there Now i don't know How it is to work for them you don't know unless you try it for yourself
good,If you're looking for a super part time job then apply here. The people were nice but hours kept getting cut. Hours were short but it was fun unloading trucks and helping customers.
good,The company does alot with racing and other things it is a fast pace place. You jave to be able to multi task and deal with many personalities.
good,"A typical work day as a sales associate, would be tending as a cashier for the majority of your shift. Then you would be given other tasks to finish before your shift is over to complete between customers. The management is pretty up beat and everyone there is nice to work with."
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General for the majority. I just found it overwhelming from time to time, being responsible for running main cash register, unloading truck and stocking shelves, recovering the store, and still managing to have the energy to scrub the toilets and mop the entire floor after closing. Especially for minimum wage."
good,Work like balance is not good. The company is a low cost operator resulting in minimal resources/employees to succeed. Company is growing and has a lot of opportunities.
good,Enjoyed working for dollar general. Was blessed to have an amazing boss. I learned so much in six months. But unfortunately I need to move to another job with better hours and a better pay.
good,"As long as you can get along with the store manager you'll be fine.  The job was enjoyable, but she would take roughly 2 hours of a smoke break in a 6 hour shift, and then you'd need to do her work, because she didn't have it done. The other shift supervisors were fine when I worked there though."
good,Good place pretty organized just wasnt worth the drive for me customers were great employees were ok other than they dont like to help do much when ur pregnant they have a fit when u ask for help not all but a couple and not very understanding when u drive 45 minutes to work and gotta drop kids off of y it takes so long to get in and shifts change all the time not a very steady schedual
good,It gets a bit difficult to try and maintain a work and life balance. They expect you there everyday to make sure things get done. Even with an assistant manager that is trained to handle the store in your absence.
good,"Working at Dollar General was my first real job, I liked it a lot it kept me busy.  You work the cash register you stock shelves you clean you do have to multitask but most jobs you have to. I couldn't ask for a better job."
good,Dollar General is a steady growing company that provides jobs for many people. This is my second time working for this company and it has it's pros and cons.
good,"Lots of NEGETIVITY with employees unfair schedules n work between co workers load."
good,"Fast paced environment, working stock, running register, balancing tills, banking, managing employees, hiring, training, coaching, keeping store stocked and stock ordered. Hardest part of job was keeping a staff because DG doesn't want to pay hourly employees much. I enjoyed my regular customers and made great relationships during my work days."
good,"A typical day consisted of me coming in, doing end of day reports, counting registers and change fund. Making sure all the money adds up and our correct. Take deposit to the bank, get change if need be. Depending on the day there are different task. I learned to face tge store, as well as do planograms and Gsections. I help work the truck and run register as well."
good,"I loved my co-workers and generally enjoyed my job. At the store I worked at, there were always too many boxes coming in one shipment which made the store very hard to maneuver thru. Overall it was very enjoyable."
good,they didn't follow all of the rules. the people were nice but some of the managers didn't require computer based learning even though it was required by the company.
good,As long as you work 90-100 hrs a week as a manager they are happy. They did have good benefits such as bonuses for inventory.They did not have a good work life balance at all.
good,"When working with Dollar General I was part time but rarely worked less than the thirty hours they considered part time. That said I enjoyed my time working there, it all just depends on the Store Manager, and the management team as a whole."
good,A typical day at work was when I had to run the store by myself. It was on a truck day and I had to check-in the vender and run the store. I learned as a key holder you have to be able to control your venders and keep yours customer happy. My management was good. My co-workers was excellent. The hardest part of the job was knowing when to change the stock numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing the end of the day deposit because I love doing math.
good,The management was good and the work load was not too much. The people  I worked with were very nice and understanding. I learned how to give better customer service.
good,"To me it was always just a temporary job while I completed by Bachelor's degree. I made money, but the co-workers were kind of hard to work with sometimes. This was more due to the management's lack of encouragement to get people to work."
good,"The reason I work at Dollar General is mainly, I can walk to work and make myself spending money. I do not mind the work and can make the point of being professional and having a good time. My co-workers are the best part of the job, being friendly and making the work go by quickly enough to be enjoyable... There is a lot of down time and while this would be good for most, the point of contention is that there is enough customers to work with while not enough time to walk the store and clean and provide the store's needs. This is the main reason I will not continue to work here. Not enough hours, people or reasons to continue. The best part of my job is to express myself, hat backwards and making money!"
good,I would come in with a welcome greeting. The customers always asked about me if I wasn't working. they would travel just to come to see me. I could sell anything to anyone. I would make bets that I could sell certain items and I did. the hardest part was when I would hear gossip but I wouldn't partake.
good,Typical Day is waiting on Various Customers from Start to End of Shift and Offering them Excellent Customer Service. Also In-Between Customers Stocking Front End Merchandise to be Purchased. The Management of the Store can be Friendly and at times unfriendly and very strict. Majority of the Co-Workers in the Building are Very Helpful and are willing to Work as a Team and then are some that like to show the snob appeal. The Hardest Part would say is when Customers get upset over the simplest errors that can easily be taken care of but normally are always in a hurry and won't wait for the issue to be taken care of to fix the error. My Most Enjoyable part of my position is actually my co-workers cause of the majority of them being so friendly and willing to help each other out when in need of help in the Store.
good,"A typical day at work would be to arrive unlock the doors to the store, pull the cash drawers out of the safe and place into the registers.  Monitor and maintain in-stock and cleanliness of store."
good,The staff is scared of the customers who come in the store they appear to be criminal if not mentally ill and dangerous. How do I know this? I used to come in once  or twice a week til I heard the same fears repeated by different employees. There is a special need here for customer service and people wrangling. This is a shame because this is a brand new store.
good,"My typical day at Dollar General would be one day a week. I worked every Saturday morning helping with warehouse. During my tenure there I did learn a few things, management was always super nice. The management at the store is the type of management everyone hopes to have. My co-workers were great. The only hard part about the job was waking up at four o'clock in the morning to go to work."
good,"I work as the cashier, stock person, making customers happy, sometimes answering the phone whatever else needs to be done."
good,"Dollar General has an environment where you have to be on your P's and Q's at all times in order to get the job done and do it well. There are times, where the environment is very calm on non-busy days but all in all you have to be GREAT at multi-tasking."
good,I had a great manger. He looked out for me when I needed extra hours. Plus starting pay is great . Flexible shifts if you go to college.
good,"People easy to work with and non-hostile."
good,"To have a job is great but not working half of the time is not I like to stay busy but at the same time feel valued for the work I do, however I do have a job the coworkers are great, the customers at most are really nice & even though it gets busy which I like, I believe I am great at multitasking because working in any business you have to be."
good,"Very enjoyable, will have to work hard but it's enjoyable depending on the co-workers in on that day."
good,Everyone is friendly. co-workers are mostly friendly. I learned different management duties. The hardest part is dealing with all the company red-tape. The customers are the best part getting to meet and learn about them and their families.
good,would clock in then start my draw and then check people out and in-between customers stocked from truck. Love my coworkers I had.
good,"stocking and cleaning up. I learned how to do manager duties and open and close the store. the management was a lot of help, but lacked some communication skills. the hardest part of the job was trying to find someone to come in and help when someone else called in. the most enjoyable part was stocking."
good,Dollar General is a great place to work if you are a single woman or man with no children. It is a great place to work but you get little to no home time. I am a store manager at dollar general and I work 6 days a week but the store is busy and so much has to be done with not enough payroll. So I have to work extra hours and longer days to get things done.
good,"Poor training,no accountability friendly environment, but very challenging, no security at night ( I'm a woman) wouldnt let me transfer to a different store."
good,Fast paced job. Given the opportunity to learn the books. Hardest part of job is filling shelves with product while watching for customers coming up to registers for check out.
good,Overall it was a great place to work. I actually wanted to apply for a lead associate position. To further my job security.
good,I enjoyed working here. I had helpful employees and nice customers. The only down side to my job was the pay. For the hours that I put in and the work I did the pay just wasn't very good. The only reason that I left was I had an offer for a better paying job.
good,Honesty should have stayed at this job but one again tired of part time if i had he chance at a high postion with my experince i would probably take it
good,"Job was fun and workers got along ,there were hard days but I like staying busy .work shifts were a mix nights and days , Benefits, were few ,Store Manager was Awesome to work for"
good,"came in counted down teal then got on a register or came in and got ready to stock shelves."
good,I enjoyed helping customers and working with my team. We all were like family and tried to make our work environment as pleasant as possible.
good,this is a great job if you are a student in need of extra cash. Management was understanding of schedule. Co-workers were nice and the management didn't manage well.
good,"I've worked at four different stores and how the store is really all depends on the manager and the area. Also, you're expected to help with any store remodels that they ask you to do."
good,"A typical day for me is keeping busy at all times. There is always something that needs to be done and I make sure it gets done before I leave my scheduled shift. I have always learned that you could not please everyone you just have to have the right attitude to overlook certain situations. Some of my coworkers are hard workers as myself and some not. Working with others suppose to be team effort but when those that doesn't work as a team make it harder for the ones that does do the work. The hardest thing I could say is when people are scheduled and don't show up for their shift are always having a reason for not coming. The most enjoyable part for me are the customers, every individual have something unique about them and that's where my customer based bound come from with each of the customers."
good,"Sometimes stressful if only cashier on the register and alot of customers came in to purchase items. Management would understand if I needed off for something going on for the family. Some  of the people I worked with were very hard working, some not so much."
good,"A typical day would include stocking, unloading truck, and running the register. I would pull out stuff to place in front of the store to sell. Also, I would go through the different areas and straighten them up."
good,"I didn't get a chance to learn too much about the company as I was only hired for temporary help. We unloaded truck, set up shelves and stocked merchandise."
good,It was good for my first job like I stated above. It was alright but I didn't like when my managers would just left me all alone in the front working and they would be in the break room all together.
good,I was a cashier associate where I had to ring up customer and to answer any questions they had and I did refunds and returns on items. I helped the customers to find items that they where looking for and answered inbound calls. I enjoyed working there but I had to find another job due to a lot of break ins
good,"very easy to get along with workers, nice people in and out everyday, decent break time limits"
good,"Co Workers were the best, hardest part of job was making sure that all employees did as asked, pulling in the stock from the truck to be unloaded, most enjoyable part of the job was giving customer service, becoming a part of management was nice, learned how to interact with the vendors, developed good manners with vendors"
good,"A typical day at work consist of operating a cash register while providing customer satisfaction. Working for this company I have learned that with time and patience, hard work pays off. On a day to day schedule, it one sales associate and one member of the management team operating the store. Which makes the job even harder because it takes more than two persons to operate the store. Even though I have to multitask 3-4 task at a time, the joy of seeing the customer satisfy make it all worth wild."
good,"Everyone works hard on their jobs to get what needs to get done, done. Everyone is always very nice and notice when your working hard although bonuses aren't given its still a good and fun place to work"
good,Always willing to learn something new. Team work is always a plus. The hardest part of the job is when the company doesn't reach the goal of that day. Always wanting to be on top and keeping the store within its goal. Its always enjoyable when we satisfy the customers and keep them coming back. Its like gaining a friend with the company by showing them you care.
good,A typical day at work involves stocking shelves and setting planograms. I always thought it was fun to recreate a store. The coworkers were really nice and we always got along well and still do. The hardest part of the job was having to cut hours so the managers had to work by themselves for 12 hours at a time with no one at all.
good,"Opening and Closing store, various hours, busy store, sometimes a little over busy and trying to get work done. This can be a good place to work."
good,"Work in a high stress environment, and do everything from cashier from stock, no matter what your hire-on position is. They are very family friendly and you become close to those you work with, which is good, but can escalate to high stress in drama situations."
good,"The main reason why I stayed there was due to the customers. It didn't matter how bad of a day I was having, if one of ""My"" customers showed up I would instantly brighten up and then the rest of my shift would be wonderful."
good,Great first job or secondary employment. Hours you can work a week will prevent you from making a livable wage. Management was in disarray when I worked here. A normal day at work would consist of helping customers and trying to prevent theft. On truck days you are expected to put out at least one roll-container an hour which is nearly impossible depending upon what you're stocking and how many customers you have to assist. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and fellow coworkers.
good,I like the environment. Any person can grow with this company up the ladder.
good,"fun place to work at, just cannot call off or the manager threatens to fire you"
good,A typical day at Dollar General would be either running the Cashier or stocking the shelves with new product. You work together as a team as there are only two people on at a time. Even though they would like you to get your project done before you leave sometimes it is hard to do because the customers come first. Management there is good they do not hover over you they give you a project and expect it to be done but will check it over all before finished. Co-Workers are decent and hard working. The hardest thing is the hours you do not receive very many. But the people there and the customer you get to know is what makes the job good.
good,"I have learned manager qualities such as dealing with troubled customers, counting the end of day deposit, and closing the store. The hardest part of the job was trying to stop theft. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the regular customers."
good,i loved my job at dollar dollar general. The only down fall is i have two children and i worked 60 hours a week and was never home and I also had a DM who was not that understanding.
good,Good place to work but with limited weekly hours. the employee turn over was high. Merchandize shrikage was also very high.
good,"I would come to work at any given time between 5:00 a.m-11:00 p.m. I learned most of my retail and stocking skills here. Management was horrible, when i worked there the store had about 6 different general managers. The co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was the random hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers that i worked with."
good,Favorite job. Great co-workers/customers/hours. Pay was low but the hours and benefits made up for that.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is working with customers and assisting them if they need assistance. Checking out there items they bought as well as making the customers satisfied. I learned that making customers happy, will always make them want to return to shop. Management was always changing. My co-workers were great people to work with. The hardest part about my job is having to do returns without a recipes. I enjoyed most of my job was being able to interact with new customers, and making them satisfied with there time shopping at Dollar General"
good,"I love the customers, and meeting new people, always happy to make a customer smile ,if they are not having a good day."
good,Work days with this company are completely inundating and you frequently find yourself presented with opportunities to test yourself.
good,"I did alot of work for this company and enjoyed my time with them, but it was temp work and the time expired."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of setting planograms, cashier, greeting/helping customers find what they're looking for, stocking the stock on truck day/coolers during night shift, cleaning, recovering all areas. I've learned great time management skills and how to juggle work and school because when I first started Dollar General I was a full-time student. It has also helped with my public relation skills more-so with the customers and my co-workers. I've learned that team work is the key in the retail, it's a very important aspect. The hardest part of my job would be trying to keep all of the customers satisfied. The most enjoyable part is knowing that I put a smile on a co-worker or customer face each and everyday I go to work by simply greeting them or helping answer any questions they have to ask during my shift or their visit."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the welcoming management and customers
good,IM Good At My Job. I Have Learned How To Do A Lot Of Things. I Have Become Quick To Be Called The Dirty Worker Because I Do The Jobs People Would Leave Aside. I Enjoy People And Helping But I Enjoy Being Able To Build A Store Up From Start Before They open. I Enjoy Reset. The People I Work With Are Good People. I Am Always Willing To Learn Something As Long As They Teach Me Management Was Not Best When Asked To Move Up So I Felt It Was Not Best For Me To Move Up At The Time. I Am Looking To Move Up Or Some Thing new.
good,"Every time I walk into a ""DG"" , it seems a new person is working there as an employee except the Manager."
good,i would have never left if the company was more organized!! the schedual was constantly changed unbe knowings to me or other employees. However when you were scheduakled for work and actually got to work there was never a dull moment 
good,"I was dependable enough to be called in on my days off, when no one else was willing to. But when it came time for me to want to request time off, I was unable to get it."
good,"I generally worked as the night cashier closing the store. This involved zoning (fixing product on shelves), Sweeping/Mopping, Running the register, Stocking and counting cigarette stock at the end of the night. I learned a positive patient attitude goes a long way in solving most issues a customer may have. I got along with all of my fellow co-workers over the past year though most did not stay very long. Hardest part of the job was traveling to other stores to do full resets it was really tedious but not horrible. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know people in my town."
good,A typical day after you count your drawer down is pretty much trying to stock and wait on customers. Alot of running back and forth.
good,"Dollar General offers a a wonderful place to work (depending on locale). There is constantly something to keep you busy so the time you you spend there flies by. You have the ability to learn something new everyday. That I beleieve, is the greatest part of the Dollar General experience. The skills you learn will not only apply to Dollar General but also to many other careers as well."
good,"A typical day would consist of overseeing the associates and recovering the store. When closing came I was in charge of closing procedures. I learned safe operations and how to count down drawers and complete the prep for bank deposits, setting the alarm at night. Over all, Dollar General provided me with even more management skills than I originally had."
good,Ranked no.3 in the region of 800 stores
good,I work 60 hr work week. I have learner how to do more with less. The hardest part of the job is not having enough payroll and having to take the load all myself. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the employees.
good,"Over all this was one of my best work experience I love customer service. A typical day at work was putting out stock, providing excellent customer service, and keeping store clean. My management team was wonderful I could call on them for just about anything. My co workers/team there consist of a few immature characters but with a little team push we made it through.The hardest part of the job was making sure a whle truck goes out and the most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know new people everyday."
good,"Working at Dollar General allowed me to make a little money while having a moderate demand on physical activity, which was good since I was just coming back to work after having surgery."
good,Working for this company has taught me that there all sorts of people out there and they all like getting cheeper prices on merchandise. The managment is really freindly and willing to work out any problems with you!
good,it was fun working there i learn differt things that i didnt know.an liked all my coworkers.
good,A good side job with benfits. Great with the hours.M am a very dependable person who takes initiative in any situation. I consider myself as a leader and take full responsibility for any action involving myself and work that I have completed. I am a very creative person who is honest and very people friendly. I love to make people laugh and am often referred to as a motivator.
good,a typical day consisted of working cash register and stocking
good,"- Typical day is cashiering and helping customers find things in the store. Also, you are expected to re-stock shelves and make sure the store is clean."
good,Unloading shelves & merchandise for displaying on shelves.Placing price labels on shelves.
good,driven to extreems
good,"Everyday is a new day, there will never be the same day. I learned that you cannot tell everyone something, some how it will get twisted and cause confusion. Management did handle their job, but sometimes the assistant manager can take their duties to the border line of the manager's position. I was able to get along with everyone, I am a like-able person. The most hardest part was having to closing hours, and the first shift left everything for you to put up, and the last shift was the busiest out of the whole day, and you had to be done by a certain time. However, I did love working with my co-workers and being able to hold conversations with them as well as the customers."
good,overall a laid back job
good,"The day begins with the manager by themselves for 5 hours, in order to save back payroll to process the weekly truck later in the week."
good,basic operation of the store
good,stock and upkeep goods
good,needs more team help so the disorganization could be better and wouldnt be such a headache due to lack of pople and ithewr than that i liked working for dollar general
good,"I found that in my time with Dollar General the culture and management varies greatly from region to region. One location my be amazing whereas, another location may be difficult to work in."
good,The store will always be busy and have lots of work to do. This helps to grow a set of skills needed to go up in the retail business as well as everyday life. If you work hard you will be recognized for your performance and/or disciplined if not. Respect is the number one thing in the workplace.
good,It is a good place to work. I enjoyed the people I worked with and my customers. It was not hard and they worked with my schedule and my children. I enjoyed it
good,It’s was fun there meet great people and the schedule was good because it work around my schedule and the pay was good at the time cause I did not have a lot off bills but know I trying to make more money for my family
good,"I would recommend not working here if you have a family to support. This is a perfect job for those who are just starting to work, like an 18 yr old or a small part time thing to pass time for extra money."
good,"It was an alright first job, what you'd typically expect at a chain retail sales store. Changing displays, prices, working with customers, and handling sales returns. Was a nice first experience."
good,Enjoyed working for this company but they were always understaffed.The work was physically exhausting but not impossible. The best part was the customers who became friends.
good,"Stock shelves, fun working environment, separate cardboard from garbage, use of safety equipment, use of carts, customer service, management willingness to help"
good,"Dollar General is fast paced. Make sure you can move fast, and stay on your feet all day. If this is your first time in retail, make sure you learn quickly as well."
good,Love it so much! It’s great....... great coworkers great customers fair pay great support absolutely love this store. I’m blessed to have my position at this store. I look forward to a long progress with them
good,"A typical day art work consisted of money handling, stocking, cleaning, managing staff, and customer interaction."
good,I really enjoyed my time at the DG in Knox City. I would open the store alone and sometimes work alone for a few hours. I definitely learned how to delegate well in this job and use time management to manage multiple things at a time. The best part of the job for me though was customer service. I really took pride in making sure that customers left happy and satisfied with their time at the store.
good,This is a good place to work if you're seeking a management position. I started working here as a cashier and worked hard and to my surprise just about a month later i was offered the position as a key holder and i received a raise.
good,I had mixed feelings with this job due to the management and pay but I was willing to do as much as i could to help the company. As long as i worked there I was just a sales associate though i expected to be higer in the ranks later towards the end of my term with them.
good,"I got along with everyone that worked their never had any problems they treated me  like family always ."
good,I enjoyed my job. But they put  to much on the manager and staff.  The customers are great. The amount of money for the amount of time you spend doesn't balance out.  You spend a lot of time away from family. Six days a week and sometimes weeks with no break. You work on your lunch. It's great for a starter job. But having kids you have to sacrifice slot.
good,"It was a good job, I got all the help I needed from my assistant Manager .i helped customers with anything they needed help with and communicating with customers"
good,Very relaxed and easy going management is very corporative. Love the customers and staff everyone goes out of the way to be extra nice and helpful very glad to have experienced with them
good,I enjoyed the people & customer's I worked with. The environment was welcoming.  My manager was awesome.  I would definitely work there again if given the opportunity
good,"I worked for the company in the past and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The location, my fellow employees and management were all helpful in achieving my goals."
good,"You get 2 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute break , you'll will either work in a group or alone depending on which will result in how long u work on the same freight"
good,Great job for someone wanting a part-time position just starting out.  Opportunities for advancement if your career path is in retail.  Benefits unknown because it was part-time.
good,"It’s not a bad place to start off at, but i wouldn’t make it a career. Some managers don’t give you credit. It’s also hard to get prompted in my opinion."
good,"I had a wonderfull time with this company."
good,While working here as the keyholder there were a couple of management issues that began to rise which involved in money going missing and management bringing it back the following day!
good,Its a nice store to work at for the most part. You do get to work with the people and help out a smile on your their face. There is alot to know and learn.
good,"I loved this job. I just had a conflict of interest with the particular store manager. The hours, the job itself, the customers they all made my day. I would work there again in a heartbeat."
good,I recently left for a better paying job with less hours. I really loved it at dollar general. The managers were willing to work with you. It was an awesome experience
good,"I knew customers faces and names, built  relationships with most. Many times i was complimented on my work ethic and manners. My reason for leaving was my mother was having medical problems at the time. Would definitely go back if I could!"
good,Was a great place to work but management was bad. The peop.e were great and pay was ok but sometimes their wasn't enough hours. other then that it was a great job
good,At this job my day usually ranged from being a cashier on the weekdays and stocking more/new products on the weekend. Stocking the store on the weekends really helped me improve my time management and organization.
good,"Dollar General have provide me an opportunity to learn, and I appreciate it  very much. The different tasks assigned provide an overall experience: from the cash register, to the stock room, and even the cleaning."
good,"Basic job,  certain people think rules dont apply to them and only do want they want but that's in alot of today's jobs. Worked register and stocked shelves"
good,"It was an average work environment, and kept you busy with the customers and work duties which made the shifts go by fast. If I am unable to find work in my field of education I would re-apply for the company."
good,the managers knew less then the sales associates. the customers were friendly and the store had always limited of items needed always under stocked ..
good,Great place to work. It has a friendly environment. I liked the way I stayed busy while working there. If I had the opportunity to work there again I would. By working at Dollar General I learned alot and fell like it would be a great place for someone just starting.
good,"I want a job with benefits and security. Other than that cant say nothing bad at all good environment, great co workers and management assistance enjoyed working here"
good,I loved working there and being in charge of everything.  I didnt like my my check after the long hard hours I put in. I felt like I earned more then what they have me.
good,"Right on man"
good,Just wasn't what i wanted to do needed something a little more challenging and. More in depth its ok if you are just starring a job or need something part time while going to school just not as a full time career
good,"I came to this company to continue and expand as a DM, requiring store manager in company I understand but DM says I have to work 70+ hrs and store needs to be perfect before consideration as DM."
good,Dollar general was a really nice place to work for but money wasnt all good for what they asked for out of a manager or even a cashier. They even sometimes asked you to go to other stores but did not pay your way or your way back.
good,"Dollar General is a Great place to grow with the company , just personal reasons on leaving . Other then that great opportunity & enjoyed my time with dollar General ."
good,"I was a lead. I counted the money at the end of shift and did the books for that part of the day. I did the cleaning and maintenance when on shift, I also did closing."
good,"While I was there, I had one other associate with me in the mornings to help work freight. We busted butt to get all the freight out in a timely manner. When working the register, most customers were pleasant, though you got a few irate customers that hurt your mood. All in all, good place to work, not for a career for me."
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar General, I was always busy and had something to do. It made the work day go by so much faster. I also enjoyed talking with the customers that came in."
good,It was fun working at dollar general but sometime is very slow. I can do my own things like stocking and cleaning. Its a good job but the pay rate is so low.
good,"Dollar General is a fast paced work environment. They provide me the hours that I need. You do have to be flexible with hours. Overall, great place and good people."
good,I would like to be paid more I love the people and the work is not hard but sometimes it can be more then you realize. And as a single parent of three the pay is not enough
good,Left due to the poor management. Hours were being shaved. Busy work is a must during different times of the day. Depending on your location you may never get a break which is not bad
good,The general manager is awesome. She helps any way she can as long as you are giving your all. It is mostly fast pace between customers and your side work.
good,"Pretty good. I wouldn’t consider this a bad job but I wouldn’t live off of this sole job. The pay was good, I had decent hours. One thing, make sure you check in with the manager about what times you work, otherwise you will have gone there for nothing"
good,"I was hired as a cashier and within a month was moved up to key holder.  Within a month of that to assistant, and store manager within 5 months of being hired.  Cod not keep up with the hours with family"
good,"Working at dollar general was my first job. It was a great experience and j learned alot from working there. The manager helped me and so did my coworkers. "
good,The work is not hard at all some days can be stressful because of the customers. The DM sets the tone of the store. The atmosphere really depends on them it all trickles down from them. The good thing is they do get switched up a good bit.
good,"No. I do not want to write a real review for this. The manager is doing her best, and it is the only one in town. However the communication does need to be better between staff, that is a must to keep things functioning.."
good,The other employees were very nice and easy to work with. The manager was not a very friendly person. It was very hard to keep employees at this location and I am nit sure why.
good,Dollar general is a family oriented place to work. Very friendly environment! Employees make sure that’s every customer has a successful visit so they will happily return.
good,"I just wanna go to work, work and leave. People wanna get too involved. There are so many lawsuits for no breaks and there supposed to pay you for an hour for every 10 min break you dont takevamd they dont wanna pay that"
good,Nice inviting store. Has great people working there. A typical day working there has its slow and fast parts of the day. Music really helps with day day so it's not too quiet when you are there alone.
good,Dollar General was very fast paced I was always running back and forth to help my cashier and the guests but it was easy work. The store manager was amazing and treated me fairly the only downfall was the pay I feel like I did to much for little pay.
good,I love the job it was a good experience only if we had better management and more wages for the work other than thatI would personally stay longer it was close to where I live
good,Where's a good place to work. It's just that retail workers not my thing. The paperwork with for good and honest people. Where's a good place to work.
good,Alot of room for advancement if you work hard enough and apply yourself. Overall love the company not to fond of some staff at different stores. District manager is great. A pretty decent place to work as long as you have a good boss.
good,Really enjoyed working there. Everyone was friendly and I advamced quickly after employed. Would recommend them for friends and family for sure. awesome place!
good,"They over work you and under pay you, you will be doing your job and someone else job to, if u can’t keep up then more than likely you will be let go. The DM only care bout the store manager"
good,I loved the people i worked with. They were fun to be around and helpful when you needed it. The only major thing that sucked was having to do the majority of cleaning/unloading and stocking because a few employees weren't great ones and would do little things here and there to make it seem like they did something and leave the rest to the other workers. Only reason i left was because someone came in to buy cigarettes and was apparently underage even tho she looked much older than her 20's and i got fired for selling to a minor. After that the place went downhill.
good,They don't like to have more than one person working besides the manager. This leaves only one cashier who is supposed to do multiple tasks. Which is fine until there is a line of customers and they are getting aggravated because your the only cashier.
good,Management cares about its employees. Easy to request days off but not so easy to be scheduled more hours if needed. Job itself is easy. Just ring up customers purchases or sometimes thrown in back to stock freight.
good,Working for the Dollar general was a great time in my life. I learned many new things. I started off as a cashier and in a little over 2 months I was promoted to a key holder. I am very dedicated to my work.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced as an assistant manager. I had a lot of responsibilities such as stacking boxes, working with customers and handling money. The hardest part of my job was getting people to come to work."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. The staff was nice and easy to work with.  I just want more , so that is why I am searching for something different."
good,"I strongly believe I would still be working at Dollar General Market if (my boss) had been alright with me putting my daughter before my job - unlike he did."
good,"I liked working here, was my first job. Ive worked at several dollar general stores in different locations. I like how they adjusted my work hours n and out with my life."
good,"For my third real job since graduating high school, this was a good job to of had. It was close to where I used to live, the co workers were nice and the pay was decent. Would recommend to others."
good,All and all it was a decent job and helped me with communication and customer service for later/potential jobs . Team work was a must to make things run smoother and they helped with that
good,This company doesn’t care about their employees like they should. I worked there for 4 years and worked very hard. The company would not let me have the manager position even though I passed the assessment test and was basically doing the manager duties while we were without the manager.
good,The Dollar General location i worked at was always steady. You didn't get to sit down very often and always had something to do. Life long friendships were made with customers and coworkers.
good,The managers there do not have the experience that they need  and most of the workers are not trained like they need to be trained they are just thrown on the floor.  I have been a manager in several places before. I had to step down because of my health but the workers and the managers are not trained  like they should be. And the pay rate is definitely not what it should be for what you have to do . have to do
good,"Hard work i thought i was inshape before starting , but after 4 months u learn to catch on put me in best shape ive ben aince high school was forced to resign for 6 months plan on trying to come back"
good,"The atmosphere is friendly, the customers knew our names and were usually very nice. As a team we all worked very well together. The back room was small but we got things done"
good,Enjoyed the company. I liked the business. Learned something new everyday. I was always on time. Tried my best to get all my work done before closing.
good,Good pay. Relaxing clothes. Most girls wear yoga pants and a short sleeve shirt with good running shoes. Most men wear shorts and running shoes. Other then the drama it’s a good place to work. But it is extremely fast paced but you get use to it and it gets competitive which can be fun. They give bonuses which is a huge plus and incentive pay but you have to understand how it works to get it.
good,They were a good company but they did not care about your home life. They came first and they would milk that. I literally would work everyday bc peopl would never come to work and my manager would never complete his tasks and I’d have to try and finish his and my work
good,"Loved working for dollar general and most of my coworkers. I wasn't to find of my manager she was rude, ghetto, disrespectful, but got work gone and didn't play. Other than that it's an easy flowing job. Beside not get certain holidays off"
good,Great company to work for. Although you dont get paid enough for all the work and responsibilities. Sometimes you are left in the store alone for hours. You do get the chance to interact with new people on a daily basis. And if you have good customer service you never know what oppertunities may become available
good,"It was a really good experience for the first year and a half. Once I got told I would be promoted to key-holder (manager), new management came in and my hours began decreasing and I was slightly belittled."
good,its place is awesome to work. they have great hours and the people work there are the nicest people. the only downfall I would admit is that they dnt have great shifts avail.
good,Great managers and reasonable time frames for certain tasks. The only thing I did not like about working here was the inconsistent hours each day and week.
good,I liked working there because it was easy be the customer tend to be over dramatic cussing and stuff and I didn’t like that and it would be over something  1 or 2 dollars sometimes
good,"Pay is not very competitive, but it is a.joy working with the public. You have an opportunity to get to know a love and watch families mature with birthdays, anniversaries and life in general."
good,"There is too much telling what to do, instead of letting managers do their job.  They should allow the managers do the job in which they were hired.  So much time is wasted with verbalizing what needs to be done, instead of letting them do the job."
good,"Dollars general is a good job, they just need to go up on the pay. Some people aren't gonna work for 7.25 an hour because it's hard when you have a family to take care of."
good,I kinda liked working there but I had to quit because of an injury. I didn't like the manager. I wouldnt mind work there again but it's not a bad place in general
good,Great place to start working if your looking for part time I’d say this is also a great starting point. I worked here while I was in school for the summer just to make a few ends meet
good,"Dollar General is a good starting level job for anybody without extensive experience. A sales oriented mindset and the ability to put customers first is a MUST for being successful at Dollar General. Must be able to be on your feet at all times, and work quickly and efficiently."
good,Working for Dollar General is a very physical job. I recommend having good quality tennis shoes and be able to work at a fast pace. It is helpful if you can multi-task and almost always handle doing several things at one time. The district managers are very personable and will take the time to educate you about your expectations and ability to do your job. I found that the health insurance (for me personally) was costly and you had to meet a rather large deductible before it would start covering anything.
good,"Decent job, need to raise pay to at least $10.00 an hr. Got to be flexible always on your feet, good memory a lot to remember as far a cashier, stocking merchandise"
good,It was a good job to start out at. Hours were highly flexible and I was within walking distance of where I was living at the time. It just wasn't paying enough to cover the cost of living.
good,It’s a great company to work for and move up In the company if that’s something ur interested in you get paid weekly. And great people to work with you won’t just be doing one thing you learn everything to run a store
good,Good people to work for management wasn’t loved my staff worked there for over a year two different managers staff changes daily manger inexperienced .
good,The Dollar Store has good benefits for the managers & weekly pay. I love my customer service skills & the knowledge of sales & products. I love being knowledgeable when my help is required by a customer.
good,"Good place to start out and go up the ladder from there. General manager over the store i was in, was not very nice the very first time i met him. Would not listen when wanting to talk about possible improvements."
good,You have to be very fast paced and patient to work here. You have to stock a certain amount of boxes per shift and if you don’t then you are put down and picked on by everybody. Not recommended to work here unless you are a fast worker.
good,Work was steady. Somewhat good benefits. Compensation was low compared to what they expect you to do. Management started cutting hours for full-time employees. No help with stocking the store.
good,It’s a really nice place to work. See familiar faces which makes it easier! Nice environment customer are nice and easy to work with. Can get real busy especially on the weekend or after school is out.
good,I loved the job and especially the customers.  But I went to work full time at MediCab. I got pretty close to some of my usual customers. I really enjoyed the variety of jobs that I did there.
good,"Job itself was great. But being an older worker, (over 60) the district manager decided within my first five minutes of working that I was too old for the job. I was allowed two days before I was taken off the schedule without reason."
good,"Customers were friendly, got the opportunity to go to other stores and help others out, meet so many people. There was nothing wrong with asking so many questions!"
good,I love working there but I don’t get paid enough and not enough hours. I’m a single mom this job is more for a teenager or someone that doesn’t have a family or kids.
good,"Dollar General is a wonderful place to work with advancement opportunities. However, I was attacked during a shift. Considering if I needed a second part time job I would actually reconsider this company so long as the store was in a safer location."
good,"It is a very fast paced and hands on job. Multi-tasking was a must needed skill. It had a well thought out guideline for daily work flow to help with productivity. The managers would try their best to work around schedules to make it possible for students, parents, or other situations to work."
good,"They have come a long way from the dirty store franchise that they used to be."
good,"the store I was at, if you weren't a manager, you worked maybe 6-10 hours in a week.  If you were a manager, you were working pretty much every day and had no days off and no room to get sick or take time off.  Payroll kept getting cut back so people kept getting less and less hours."
good,"This job taught me lots of skills. The management team was always attentive to their employees, and customers. I worked the register so I was always around these types of situations. The hardest part of the job was attending to all of the customers needs, when I did not have much experience in the needed areas. However, I mostly enjoyed working at Dollar General."
good,"Working at Dollar General is okay but the store is often a mess and there may not be enough staff. The lask of of having more than one scanner reduces the efficiency of stocking and organization. For new workers there, It will take time to learn the store over time and without efficient equipment the store may never catch up with the products being refilled."
good,Easy going and slow paced. It's perfect for someone's first job. This job taught me basic register functions and how to multitask. Greeting people when they walk in the door helps develop people skills and customer service
good,"It was an amazing place to work but they wouldnt allow overtime and the hours were low, leaving my paycheck very very low and i was un-able to keep the job because i couldnt pay all my bills because they didnt allow full time unless you were a key holder."
good,During the time I was working for the company it was a fun place work. Everyone worked hard to get everything thing done with the tools we had which wasn't much. Once management changed everything along with it changed.  The manager didn't hire more employees to replace the ones that quit.
good,It's a good place to work if you have a great team working with you. As long as you work together things will go as smoothly as they can. As long as everything is working everything goes well.
good,Basically the store in which i worked was relatively clean.But the pay was no where near enough to live off of.Even with the little hours i was getting.
good,overall it was a great experience and i learned so much from my coworkers an managers.i also meet more people overtime.I have never had a bad day at dollar general
good,"I enjoyed working at the DG store, but we changed managers too often.  I would like to continue to work at that company, however, I would like a set schedule.  My work ethics, stability, and skills was above and beyond some of the managers on duty."
good,"Fast paced environment, I learned how to be a shift lead, my manager was very supportive and encouraging. We always had a lot of fun and still got the work done. "
good,"Fun place to work would recommend more hours"
good,"Dollar general is a good place to work besides the salary, which is low if you are not a supervisor. The manager was really nice and great about training me on my job duties."
good,"Dollar general is a good job Ive learned a good bit by working there, though i believe there is always something new to learn from every job Ive worked any job i work in the future. I have learned what its like to handle money especially large sums do to the procedures dollar general has put in place to protect themselves from profit loss. Also i obtained more experience dealing with customers such as customer questions and angry or upset customers, etc. Though the job is good and i have learned a thing or two from it. The job is sorely lacking in benefits and the pay is not cutting it for my cost of living. The job is also scheduled in a swing shift layout and hours are limited but available. I am hoping i can get a job with better benefits or at the very least  more pay."
good,The customers are nice at the bethune dollar general. the only thing that I didn't like was them firing me because I was pregnant with a doctors note.
good,Stocking and good customer service..................... being on time and knowing your store like where stuff is.  Always be on time always be respectful.
good,you came in and logged in to clock in and out for the day and breaks. you greeted each customer that came in and rang out ones at or near your register. paged for a manger if you had to do a return and during your down time you cleaned or straightened up the aisles.
good,"The duties are the same every week, when truck comes it restarts. Work truck until it is done, while working register, then recover merchandise. Nice to see regular customers."
good,Had lots of fun working there. The customers were very nice at the store I worked at. The scheduling wasn't good though I think my store had too many employees. On the bright side pay was every Friday which was nice if you had good hours every week. *don't be a cashier and stocker at the same time LOL :)
good,Not a bad place to work while in college. Easy training. Didnt flex to my schedule with college classes. Coworkers and management were good. Not bad hours.
good,"all in all not a bad place to work. you stay busy waiting on customers, stocking shelves etc. The worst part is the schedule and the hours you work are all over the place not really a set schedule."
good,It is okay working here.   I really do not get many hours.  I am happy to have this job until I find something better.  I do have a Bachelor Degree.  I did graduate from high school.
good,"Count drawer, tag everything that needs to be tagged, stock the shelves, maintain the restrooms, clean up work area and keep store cleaned up, count down drawer"
good,"Dollar General is a good place to work while getting through college. My manager was good with leniency of hours, because of my classes. The management is not great in the higher ups, but my store manager is a great person. She is caring and wants to see her employees succeed. The workplace culture is friendly and mostly everyone gets along and works together."
good,"Typical day at Dollar General. Checking out customers, Stocking shelves and recovering inventory. The store manger is fair and gives good direction what needs to be accomplished during a shift."
good,The warehouse was a great place to earn good money. The work atmosphere was most of the time pleasant and they are always eager to make sure their works are fed.
good,"Taught me how to locate and stock shelves"
good,My experience working at the Dollar General was not so great. Due to the fact that everything was always unorganized. If you find yourself working here have a backup plan. Because in my personal opinion it wasn’t a good work place.
good,My duties were mostly cashier and light stocking.  Sometimes I was asked to help unload the truck or do some light cleaning.  The atmosphere was mostly relaxed.  The store stayed pretty busy on Saturdays.
good,"I worked there years ago, it was a great job and my co-workers were a blast. Everyone helped out, it was real team, from unloading the truck to setting up displays, It was just all around great."
good,Traning for the cashier and depending on the hours worked lunch breaks. Easy stocking and recovery if the store is keep up with. Constant policy changes and safety measures
good,Dollar general is a good place to work. Since I have been employed there everything was good most of the time.  Most of the employee were team players
good,Advancement is available. Customers are mostly pleasant. Often short handed which creates a larger work load. Time managmement skills and Team building skills are a plus.
good,I like my job. The people are wonderful and it is run by one of the best managers I have ever worked for. However there is no room for advancement or hours at this store and I'm looking for a  career.
good,"i always enjoyed my job, love customer service,  my job was hard on days but i always worked threw it.  i was full time, i spent a lot of hours there.  im the one they always call at home with questions.  i loved everything about the job."
good,"Working at Dollar General is a really fast passed job. Keeping up with stocking the shelves, helping customers, cashing out customers at the register, and answering the phone was hard to master at first."
good,"I learned a lot working at Dollar General. A typical day was taking care of customers and employee needs, cleaning and organizing the store, checking in vendors and working out freight.  It was a friendly and productive atmosphere.  The hardest part of the job was coordinating with vendors to make sure we had product for upcoming sales ad and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know customers and employees."
good,Its a great place to work fast paced at times and other times gave you time to keep the place maintained. Just wished it paid better though. the health benefits were nice but too expensive.
good,"good customers , friendly coworkers, fast paced work allowed time to past pretty quickly, enjoyed working with coworkers, favorite part as a keyholder is being able to stock  items while their is a cashier got a lot done"
good,"Cashier and stocking; I learned how to use a cash register and the system for stocking the shelves, my manager was pretty good at teaching me what I need to know to do my job effectively. the workplace culture is okay, the employees are very kind to one another and are generally team players."
good,A plce to grow and if you have the skills they will help you to become a good candidate for others positions in the company which will help you to obtain others jobs in different companies.
good,"When i started work at Dollar General, I was a very nervous, nearly reclusive individual. The staff was very understanding and helped me break out of my shell. The patience they exhibit is legendary and if you ever want to work with kind people from the start. There's your place to go."
good,"Staff was nice. Worker around 25-30 hours per week, although I had another job at the time, so someone without another job may be able to get more hours. Worked mostly nights."
good,During the rush hours I always was busy and very productive. I enjoyed seeing customers smiling faces and I always made sure they were getting the things they were needing.
good,"Cashier - handle cash, scan items, put up displays, organize, basic cleaning, apply discounts and coupons, know basic math, be courteous, kind, respectful."
good,I liked working here for the customers you get to know them and honestly they make the job more fun. The job is easy though you just have to keep the store clean and unload totes
good,I was written up for my drawer being short a few times and was fired. The key holder who counted my drawer at night had developed an unknown issue with me. I only had a problem when she was working and missing money was found after my dismissal.
good,"It is a Easy Job to start off at if first time at a job."
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone because of great management. When I use to work at DG my supervisor at the time, but she doesn't work there anymore, she let me come in an hour late. I called her and said I wouldn't be able to make it in because I had a smashing migraine. She said I really need you to come in and work. Could you come in an hour late? I said yes, and when I went in to work I felt better. Thanks to my supervisor."
good,"Work at your own pace, be alert, and ask for help when necessary. Talk with your manager about any problems, and even though you aren’t there to make friends make nice."
good,Dollar General was a great place at the time that I was working.It  open opportunities for me to advance while I was htere.It took no time for me to become a Lead Associate.This happened because I gave DG my all when I did work as a sales associate.
good,"I had a great manager when I worked here. He was very focused with helping employees improve and move on to better things. He made the job great. As for the DM, they weren’t all that great. Pay wasn’t too good."
good,I wouldn't reccomend working here. It's hard to move up and the pay is not good. Certain management in certain locations are not good. It would be a good starter job though.
good,"I really enjoyed it starting off with, but it got to the point where my hours were getting cut short during the week when they hired several others and it felt like I was getting pushed to the back burner after all I done and helped out not only for the customers that came to the store but for the store in general like making sure everything looked good and organized before and after closing hours and stuff like that."
good,"No fixed schedules, and a little unfair job duties. Felt like I was doing my superiors job. Always had to work the days everyone else didnt want to work."
good,Dollar General is a friendly work environment. They are very understanding in my experience. They have good benefits for a dollar store. One of the things I liked best about Dollar General was that my manager absolutely did not want me to handle rude customers. She told me to call her up to handle them.
good,The management actually supported the staff and tried to be flexible with them within reason. I wish I hadn't left. Have not been around are more dedicated team.
good,I loved my job at DG but I had no job security. Loved my job would have like to have overtime. Wish dg had more benefits for employees or at least pto time. Workers work very hard there and don’t get much in return from the company.
good,Had a fun time. Learned alot from my management and team members. Helped to smooth out my customer service skills and improve myself in many ways with this company.
good,"Being a key holder of the store i loved the position but not the pay. i mean being held for responsibilities while our manager was out and making sure I've picked up all the slack that was left for me to be have done i did it, but i feel as if I did not get paid enough for all the work i did."
good,I like working at Dollar General and find it fun to interact with the customers that come in to purchase items. The staff was very helpful in training me and I enjoyed the time I was there.
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers. Helping them find items in the store. A typical day at Dollar General was helping the customers find different items in the stores. Getting the customers in and out the store as quick as possible. Making sure your drawer balanced each day you work, keeping the store tidy and clean each day."
good,Awesome environmental. A friendly smile and a good positive attitude will get you far. Everybody goes through rough times so always stay positive and help them(customers) as best as you can.
good,"It was an alright part time position, because at the time I was in school, but some weeks I needed more hours and couldn't get them, and I didn't like that because I was a working single parent."
good,The management there was a little poor. A lot of the people there just stood around and watched and chatted. Some never did their instructed jobs. They do have a relaxed atmosphere.
good,"Good management, Friendly co-workers, Occasional flexible hours, Struggled occasionally with assistance during busy hours, Enjoyed the work environment"
good,Good coworkers it was an overall good environment but I wanted to progress and get paid more. Good company but I wanted to get paid more and get more hours.
good,"I enjoy working at Dollar General. I’m always very busy assisting customers or working our freight, setting new Plan O Grams. Very fast paced. Live the interaction with the public."
good,not enough workers to work with to keep up with what is expected of the store. so employees are over worked and under appericated if they come in early or on days off. also under paided for the aount of work they do.
good,"A good working experience, but work hours are scarce.  I would recommend working for Dollar General as a first part-time job experience.  It is a friendly environment."
good,"This is an awesome place to work if you like to stay busy, and deal with the day to day struggles of customers who might or might not be having a good day"
good,Workplace can be very fast paced mainly on Saturdays . Employees treat you just like family and the manager  is very understanding when it comes to personal problems etc...
good,"The work environment were at times very stressfull if you were the only one on the floor and at the register for the majority of the day."
good,"Learned how to keep my temper in check, customers are so RUDE, because they can't read or understand a sale sign, or because their SNAP , Credit Card, or Debit card is declined they want to blame the cashier ... pitiful"
good,The job itself was good and I enjoyed working there. The people I worked along side were excellent. I got along with both the employees and customers.
good,The pay is average but work atmosphere is ok and can be stressful but so far so good. Love the coworkers n can advance but that’s bout it. Every job has ups n dwns
good,"I absolutely love my job and the people I work with. No matter where you go to work there will always be quirks.  But there is allot the dm's & Gm's  could do to help with the shrink problem and have more focus on the employees. I've seen quite a few people come and go that were great workers, but, they went along with no gratitude or benefits. They're trying to fix this problem, but it definitely won't be fixed over night."
good,Good place to work.   Flexible work hours.  Very secure building created a safe work environment.  Friendly co workers.  Lots of diversity.  Very stable company.
good,"Laid back environment, very little pressure, always something to do to ensure continued productivity. Friendly management and coworkers, enjoyable and recognizable customers."
good,"If you don't make a decision on what you want your job commitment to look like there and formulate a balanced life/time management formula based on your own needs, company management will feed off of the indecisiveness and abuse it by making you feel guilty or inadequate."
good,It is a great place to work.  The workers all get along and have a good relationship with management.  I have learned more about diversity and communicating with many different people.
good,"I loved my job at dollar general, but when i was having gallbladder problems (setting up appointments for tests and surgery) my manager decided to schedule me, not tell me, and then have someone else cover my shift."
good,"A typical day at work is assessing the tasks for the day/week and delegating as needed. I have learned a great deal regarding people, patience and the retail culture in general. Management changes so often that it is difficult to judge from year to year. The most difficult part of my job is dealing with the issues of the minimum wage employees and their needs and demands within the confines of what the company allows and watching other locations fall apart without being able to help in any significant way. Applying for positions that would allow me to do so and never receiving any communications about that job. I enjoy having near complete control of my day with little to no interference from anyone and the satisfaction of knowing that the work is complete and done well by my staff and I."
good,when i first worked at Dollar General it was a bit crazy alot of the time with the key holders and other management. i found that if i kept quiet and just did my job it would all work itself out.
good,"Working at dollar general was ok , until everyone really got to know one another.. It was a fun environment to work in I just wish my team would have communicated better than they did ."
good,Dollar General was has a strong employee team that work together with each other's shifts & even cover for one another. The only thing I don't  like about this employer is too low pay for the work service I provided.
good,The corporation refuses to give the stores enough hours to properly staff and run daily. The money compensation for the amount of work you do is very poor.
good,"I liked working at the dollar store, I left due to family complications. the customers were awesome to talk to and i enjoyed how busy the store kept us."
good,"The DG that I worked for had an awesome manager. She was very easy to work with and for. I wasn't crazy about the pay. But, I did enjoy working there."
good,Worked for dg for a year and only received a .10 raise however the manager at the time was very nice and sweet do it made the job and atmosphere a better place to work..
good,It’s a good starting job to get you on your feet and get you a taste of what it would be like in the retail field for a career. Can be stressful at times
good,I loved working here with the co workers that I had. The stocking and cleaning was manageable. I just felt uncomfortable around the manager. Other than that it was a nice place to work
good,not hard work.  usually will not give employees enough hours to live on and pay is low..  most stores will not have enough employees working to do all the stocking and taking care of customers at the same time.
good,You honestly do a lot for 7.50/hr. And in my experience me and the manager i worked with (just the 2 of us all the time) always got blamed when the work of 3-4 people wasnt done in a 7 hour shift. So its definitely unfair at time but I did enjoy my time working there for the most part and weekly pay is a great thing as long as you get them hours in.
good,I truly enjoyed working for Dollar General. Unfortunately I could not make a living on what I was making therefore I relocated to VA. I would highly recommend Dollar General if one is seeking part time employment. In fact I recommended my daughter who worked there for a period of time while in collage.
good,you are going to stay busy at this location and not have time to become bored. management is a pleasure to work for and to work with. Im looking forward to visiting the store in the future
good,Very busy and fast paced. Must be able to multi-task. Must be friendly and love to interact with customers and coworkers. A great smile and dressed to impressed is important.
good,"On a typical day at work, I was the cashier in the morning meaning it was slow in the morning and midway to afternoon it became busy. I was a slow cashier until I became used to the flow of the store. At the time, I was in school and the manager was able to make my schedule flexible for me to maintain school work and work. The culture of this being my first official job it was family cultured meaning everyone knew who was who and it became a daily thing for them to be around. I would say the hardest thing to do is waking up early and having people waiting on the Saturday sales."
good,"Typical day at work for me starts 6am to maybe 5 Bank Deposit,scheduling,til in register open at 8am I learn that it takes a team poor Management and the hardest part 2,000 truck with not enough hours to work"
good,Dollar Generals motto is serving others. There are some things they could do better but they are invested in helping their employees and the communities around them. They recently started an excellent paid maternity leave program. They also offer disaster relief and keep stores open for the communities during disasters.
good,"Dollar General is a great place to work, that is, if you have no bills to pay. The people i work with i really like, but i have another kid on the way and its just not cutting it anymore."
good,I liked this job a lot it was very easy going work and it was fun to work with the co workers I had. but the manager at the time was lazy and very pushy. she was a micromanger with a horrible attitude
good,"I enjoyed it as a part time position, must be able to work weekends and nights for this position. Limited flexibility and hours.Overall great position if your looking to make a little extra money on the side."
good,My experience at dollar general was good overall. I had good employees and we got along most of the time. Everyone pulled their own weight so things ran smoothly.
good,Working at Dollar General was fair; it just wasn’t enough money for the amount of work to be done. Dollar General was very good with working around doctors appointments and schooling.
good,it is not a hard job. Can be difficult to balance if you are not use to the work.  focus on each task but aware of surroundings at all times.  Can be flexible with schedule if needed.
good,Management was awful and unprofessional ! Doesn't  work with people with disabilities!  The manager I worked for didn't give me a fair chance ! Heartbroken
good,I normally took care of  cashier duties but I also took care of stocking and cleaning the building. The people there were decent and the hours were ok. Management was pretty good. It was a bit clicky but it was cool there
good,on a normal day it stays fairly slow until around closing or lunch time or when most people are heading home. It is a easy job as long as you know how to handle cash and card transactions
good,"It’s not a bad place to work at all, but is definitely more of an after school type job unless you get up into higher management, which in my opinion doesn’t pay enough."
good,"For the store I worked in, the work was steady if somewhat slow. Co-workers were nice. Once manager changed, the rules became more strict and less friendly. Workforce was small but easy to work with."
good,"Retail has been my job for about 2 yrs now, it was fun & hard working. The store though is in need of some organization. The only thing the store needs is a spring cleaning."
good,"As a lead sales associate you are in charge of helping out in the tasks of closing when the assistant manager is unable to close. You will manage employees, do counts, organize the store, deal with customer complaints. and sometimes close the store."
good,"On a typical day, I would clock-in at my scheduled time and check the daily sheet for my tasks. As a night-shift key holder, I was in charge of counting register tills and the change till as well. I also ensured the nightly deposit was counted and placed in the safe, ran the End of Day reports, and performed all closing duties. I managed all breaks and lunches were taken in a timely manner, and ensured daily tasks were completed."
good,"typical day at work would have been very steady,also learned to have grown patience throughout working for this company,workplace culture was pleasing"
good,"My typical day at the DG was I would help open the store, then I would start my day by setting shelves and cashing out people. You constantly stay busy and there is never a moment that you are bored."
good,"Dollar general was actually my first job and It was actually not as bad as people say it is working for customer service, You just need to put your heart out there and seek what your trying to do for others and also your self. Me working at dollar general I got to learn how to stock the merchandise and learned how to check in vendors when they brought in the merchandise for us to stock. Cashier duties such as learning how to handle checks, cash and debit and credit cards."
good,"Generally a typical work day at any convenience store."
good,"It was a tough but enjoyable job. The workplace was fairly safe, and the work environment was always nice. I got help and was taught was I was needed to be a great employee."
good,"Enjoyed working here as it was usually busy with lots of friendly customers.  Unfortunately while I was here my manager passed away and they brought in another lady who was ok for a while even promoted me, but as time went on the assistant manager and myself noticed our managers behavior change which resulted in my leaving the company."
good,"Had to be confident running a huge store...  Always smile... Always make your customers happy & patients is important! Working doubles, better paycheck.. Off days are not guaranteed."
good,I loved my job and especially my employee's. I built that team and if I was the to leave the company my store would run as if i'm still in charge. Most jobs are hard work. If you have the right people in position then your job will be as easy as 123
good,Typically you'd do every job that was available in the store so you never really sat around. Learned to stock shelves. Management was kind of tough considering they only allowed two workers at once.
good,enjoy working in an enviroment that keeps me moving. Been through 2 different managers so far and they are as different as day and night. Hardest part of the job is that not everyone takes pride in their job.
good,During my time as manager it became stressful due to the fact people would call in and I would have to cover shifts due to being salaried. Most days I would open store and check in vendors and do resets or work freight. I would run the register as needed when other employees would take lunch breaks.The most enjoyable days would be conversing with customers and getting feedback on what was needed to make the store a better place to shop. I learned that although salary was good it was hard balancing work life and home life due to very long hours at my job and trying to manage people that wanted a job but didn't want to do the job that was required of them.
good,Check the tills and get registers started. Check the mag book to see what needs to be set for the week. Check out customers and check in vendors. Clean the store and recover the store.
good,it was a pretty cool job. laid back for the most part. manager was cool and understanding. so were the co workers. I would go back to work there again if I really had to.
good,"Typical day , fast pace , plan your day projects and duties of the employees. what I learned is that you have to have patience, good listens skills ,along with understanding, maintain product knowledge. Management is a very important part of operations, knowledge of products and services, know your business makes it easier to train your employees. culture fast ,friendly, well stocked. the hardest part was terminating an employee. the most enjoyable part was see customers leave happy and satisfied and to see how every employee worked as a team and met all Sales goals."
good,"The pay was good for Dollar General, but the hours were horrible, I would usaually work one day out the week, I would be lucky enough if some one called out and they would call me. But overall, the job was easy and okay."
good,"it was a fun place to work, learned a lot, learned how to do everything required for my position in less than a week, it helped me be more responsible."
good,"Working with dollar general, it was fun and productive. It was quick paced. The manager is respectful. The job place it’s self was clean and well managed."
good,its a great place if you enjoy working with the public and helping people. sometime odd hours and had to work a lot of holidays but if your in management we all tried to divide the time
good,"It was fun working there, the customers were honestly what made my job the best. When there are good employees the store looks great and even the customers are happy. Management was an issue at times especially when there was rules that were being broken and when asked to have a meeting about it, it became a bigger issue. Altogether I loved working at Dollar General but there were issues that needed fixed."
good,"you were required to clean, stock shelves, and run register due to my calling off because of family emergencies at home i was only getting 8 hours a week so i did quit."
good,It really depends on who works with you. It is a fast paced place with a heavy work load but nothing is impossible. The coworkers and customers made it decent.
good,Dollar General was a good place to work. You just had to work hard and got paid minimal and I hated having to work four nights out of six days worked. The work was hard and deserved better pay. Hated being away from my small children four nights out of the six days I worked.
good,"Dollar General needs to pay attention to the workload compared to the man power they provide labor for. Overall, I had a great time working there. Loved my customers."
good,Dollar General is a good minimum wage begginer job. If you're looking to squire basic working skills. You can move up to management quickly if you work hard.
good,I am very glad for the years I put in with dollar general. It is a fast paced company to work for. You will be a jack of all trades. The employees literally do it all.
good,"The hire ups, did not want to help advance the knowledge to better an employee. they would rather see you fail then help."
good,It's a great place to get started in retail. It can be alot to handle but if you get a great team who works together It gets easier. It gives you a good idea to alot of aspects of retail
good,Working for Dollar General was a great experience but a little rocky at times. the only thing I didn't like was the fact that customers were coming in and stealing things and there was no security or no there to arrest the persons involved and some of the customers would come in and just walk out with things they didn't pay for and I felt that I couldn't stay anymore so I said to myself there has to be something out there better for me so I put my two weeks notice in and went to finish school and didn't look back.
good,This company provides reasonable work hours and a good workplace. The employees and customers are friendly and respectful. The work that is needed is exceptional and good.
good,I enjoyed learning how a business works from the operations stand point. I enjoyed my coworkers and the business and variety of the required job tasks.
good,I provided customer service while stocking the front area around the register. I rang people up at the cash register. I bagged up their items and made transactions with money or debit/ebt cards.
good,It is very interesting in that you are constantly learning new tasks and trying to do them all in time required by the company.  You are busy all the time.
good,worked with general public. Operated cash register assisted customers. Not anything overall that was dreadful doing with working there. Boss was good at understanding.
good,"Good people, easy work, strict on policies. They will work with your schedule but you have the responsibility of finding someone if you decide to call in/no show."
good,Good place to work as a part-time position. I worked as a cashier and  also restocked merchandise. It is a position where you have to multi-task as there are normally only 2 people working.
good,Dollar General is a friendly place and customer service is well there. The store was arranged well. The labor hours divided amongst the worker could be more evenly distributed.
good,"Greet and take care of customers needs.  Stock shelves, deliver company truck and receive venders, handle money and deposit, take deposit to bank."
good,"Great people to work with, easy going, stress free, and fun environment. You was always kept busy the customers are easy to work with. Kept clean and very organized."
good,"Stock shelves, handle money and assist customers. Also, open and close store to ensure all money is safe and secure at closing and store is locked up at night."
good,"Fun place to work. Alot of inter actions with customers. The job itself was fairly easy. Stocking ,cleaning, checking people out. There were also some real cute things i could buy."
good,Working at Dollar General was fast paced and you got to meet all kinds of customers most of them are locals and you would get to interact with them on a regular basis.
good,"Started part time and went to full time within three weeks.  Received a weekly truck delivery of inventory that arrived at 6:00 am.  There was always work to be done, regular breaks were scheduled."
good,Was working part-time there and they started cutting back our hours. Hardly made any money. The employeed were very friendly and helpful though. Good working environment if had better hours.
good,"Dollar General is a very fast pace work environment. You must know how to count cash, have great customer service, and be able to lift heavy items. Being a manager on duty you must be able to count drawers, check in trucks, and most of all help with loss prevention on a daily basis."
good,"The general aspects of being a part-time worker there are positive. You can go one level higher than a regular cashier, but reaching assistant to manager level requires a full-time adjustment. Hours part-time and work environment vary up to 30 per week and depend on the location respectively."
good,"This was my first job ever. I was in a basic work environment with the kind of people you would imagine work at a Dollar General. The management could be a bit much sometimes in how they handle situations, but overall a nice place to work. Nnever ran out of things to do."
good,A typical day there is busy and stocking shelves and helping customers. At the end of the day making sure the store is swept and mopped. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the smile on their face.
good,I enjoyed working here. It was fast paced. You have to multi-task. I enjoyed meeting and helping customers. I enjoyed making the store clean and neat for customers to have an enjoyable shopping experience. There is a chance of advancement here.
good,"the work environment and customers were friendly. its a bit fast paced if only one person is on the floor at a time. I would run back and forth between cashing people out and stocking items on the shelf. the management was friendly, reliable, and understanding. The hardest part was probably lifting the heavy items. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the regular customers and building relationships with them and my fellow coworkers."
good,This was a pretty nice place to work really. It keeps you busy and there’s always something to do. They only pay minimum wage though and it’s a bit difficult to move up here.
good,Working for the company of Dollar General greatly increased my customer service skills. I learned new advancements on the register and stocking. Every work shift was a new opportunity to learn more about the company as a whole.
good,I would come to work and start on recovery and I would work on the cash register. I learned a lot from the managers.The hardest thing was swiping and moping the floors. I like shop in the stripe mall.
good,"some days i am just a cashier/stocker and other days i am the MOD and are responsible for opening and closing the store, 100 percent accurate cash handling and customer service skills"
good,They are a good company to work for but the one I worked at was high risk for theft. The store manager is awesome and tries to work with you for scheduling needs.
good,"I worked the register or stocked the inventory and recovered the store, I was always busy. Management was easy going and understanding of my circumstances. Getting adequate hours was always a good thing."
good,"The overall workplace culture was good.  Management seemed to do every thing they could to work with training and advancement. A typical workday involved lots of customer service and maintaining the overall setup of the store, in which I enjoyed very much. Although scheduling changed daily and sometimes involved rearranging to go to another location, it was beneficial to advancement, skills and new ways of doing my job."
good,It was a good place over all. Customers were easy going. Their was a manager that was mean to people and couldn't keep a lot of people to work for her. Even one employee that's been there for 17 years quit cause the main manger talking about her and making fun of her to a customer who ended up telling her about it.
good,It is a good work place to work if you are in college. This job is a great place for flexible hour for those who work an full time job. I would recommend this job for those who are in school or got an full time job.
good,"I loved this job. hired as a cashier moved up in position to asst. mgr and inventories of stores and set-up of new stores. retail manager. Did zoning cleaning, inventory shelving, ordering, payroll budgetting, hire/fire employees, stocking, cashier, bookkeeping, deposits to bank and cashier registers banking,."
good,The Management wasn't as helpful during the time I was employed. They didn't know how to properly to talk to you or ask you to do something in the right way.
good,"My typical day at work was running the cashier, stocking the shelves, sweeping the floors, and cleaning the bathrooms. I was earning $7.65 hour. the hardest part of my job was knowing my schedule for the week that I worked they kept changing it so the schedule was not consistent."
good,"A lot of hours put in as a manager, especially when employees call off.  Good benefits, bonuses.  Management was great, but changed a lot.  Tons of turn-over."
good,"A typical day at work included cashier duties and stocking duties."
good,"good place to work just don't feel like i can make enough. There are good hours, good people and very money managed. Great opportunity to gain experience in retail."
good,It was a local little market so the customers were the same and everything was by the book. I enjoyed who I worked with and the customers. Maintaining the store was easy.
good,"I loved being a store manager.But as the hours are cut for cashier's, it makes it harder on the manager, therefore having to work 60+ hours per week. Not enough labor hours scheduled. It's nice when you have DM that understands the daily challenges. A bit concerning when that DM doesn't make inquiries of both parties before she decides to make a decision. But all in all, I enjoyed being a store manager for them."
good,"They was a good company to work for, the employees was nice. Had to sweep , mop and stock shelves. As well as stock the freight when it came in. Greeted customers and helped them if they needed help"
good,"Working at Dollar general, the employees was fun to be around with, The managers was great at communicating with others, and had flexible hours if need. very understandable has me having to make time for a part time worker and a full time student."
good,You must be 18+ to work here. Good company and there is room for advancement. My manager was great with me being pregnant but it all depends on location.
good,I enjoyed my job at dollar general and it was fast paced and very customer oriented my only complaints were the hours and the pay it was random scheduling.
good,Long hours crazy fast work.Need Two people to a truck a little more help would make it easier.early mornings for people who travel out of town stop putting people doing to lanes
good,Working at Dollar General taught me a lot as far as dealing with customers. A typical work day was often busy. We often had 2-3 employees on duty every shift. The hardest part about the job was having to work on one register due to the other register malfunctioning. The most enjoyable part was assisting the customers and be appreciated by them.
good,"The job wasn't hard at all. You deal with all kinds of people. I worked stock, cash register, and floor. Management position so I was also in charge of inventory"
good,this was probably the easiest job i have ever had not very fulfilling but little to no stress. the hardest part is dealing with racist or ignorant customers
good,The dollar general is a good place to work especially if you like meeting new people. Great place to have a part time job. Great environment. Lovely people
good,"My typical day at work was very fast paced, you didn't know where you'd be working or with who.  I learned to handle stress effectively.  Management was fair, workplace culture was mostly friendly, hardest part of the job was the rate you had to meet, and most enjoyable was feeling accomplished as a team at the end of the day."
good,". You can get all the overtime you want and need "
good,when i walked in  dollar general the worker were very polite had and postive attitude and the store was clean and well mantained i would love to work at place with nice friendly co works and a clean enviorment
good,"Working at dollar general was nice because the other employees were nice and I had an awesome manager. The worst part was working nights, only because I personally do not like working night shift."
good,Days went by fast and you spent most of the time on your feet. You had to clean up the isles and make sure the stores were presentable to customers. Its a well organized place to work.
good,Overall experience at company was good. I had a good boss and wonderful co-workers. We all worked well together. Most of us respected each other and the time that we spent at work.
good,Loved helping out the customers.  Got to know a lot of the customers one on one. Was able to work a number of different stores in the district. Also help open one store and moved another store.
good,"Although I quit because I was wrongly accused, I loved working with the team that I had. My manager was fun and was always willing to work with you. Customers were fantastic, especially the regulars."
good,"Typical retail job, busy all the time but it is not overwhelming like bigger companies. The management is okay. The higher it goes, the worse it gets. The worst part is cleaning the massive store after a long day of work."
good,"A lot is expected from you and sometimes you have to work with someone you don't like or deal with unhappy customers, but that's any retail job. Overall I love working there and if I could get a full time position I would stay."
good,"Dollar general is fun and relaxing, but when its time to get to work everything is finished and seeing customers happy makes us satisfied. Learned a lot from other employee's and even customers."
good,It wasn't a hard job by any means. You got a decent break and the hours were good. There just aren't hardly any advancement opportunities and it was hard to get time off.
good,I liked working here it was fast-paced but for the amount of work you are required the pay isn't what it should be. When you are a key holder your making a little over minimum wage.
good,"The good part about the job was coming in to the great customers. You stay busy at the register and stocking at the same time, so time go by fast. The hardest part was so many turnovers at the job that you be under a different mgr rule"
good,Dollar General is a low paying position.  The position as a Sales Clerk starts at $8.00/hr.  You must keep busy stocking and running cashier at all times and when it is busy the customers would have to come find you in an aisle to have them check out.  Greeting customers was the highlight of this position.
good,Enjoyable place to work. Loved my customers. As long as you work hard and constant. But always keeping your eyes open at all times so you can control your inventory etc.
good,although there were many inconsistencies it was a good team to work with. enjoyed learning the many different levels of retail.Enjoyed getting to know the many regulars at that would frequent the store.
good,Dollar General was a fairly decent place to work. The manager and co-workers were great for the most part to work with. My biggest challenge was not being paid sufficiently.
good,"Job required a lot of multi tasking as there is a lot of stocking while handling customers check outs. Floor plans changes was always common. Although it was a lot of one person, it was not impossible to achieve"
good,my experience at dollar general was for the most part was a good one. there was a high turn over rate for managers but i think that's because of the extreme amount of pressure they are put under
good,"It's a pretty laid back place to work.The hours are flexible and the work is easy. Though my specific store is unorganized, other stores are neat. It's an okay place to work."
good,"overall the company was an excellent place to work, the workload exceeded the hours given, and the District manager needed better communications/relationships with store managers,for better understanding for what each store needed from them."
good,in the beginning it was great because i was trained on assist manager but due to personal issues i had to step down from that position . but over all it was a wonderful place to work because of the staff and customers.
good,Demanding and fast paced. Excepted to do a lot and multitasking with all aspects of job. More hours for running stores would be helpful for store manager.
good,"A typical day involved cashiering, stocking and helping customers I learned a lot about management and customer support as well as team work and getting things done."
good,Working at dollar general is a fun and relaxed workplace...stays steady so you can always stay busy...fun coworkers friendly customers and plenty of work that cam always be done
good,the drivers where cool guys but the amount of wrk you need to do by yourself is stressful. overall if you want to be on the road all the time and make money then go apply
good,I enjoyed working at the Dollar General. It was a busy day keeping up with stocking and cashier work. We learned where all the products belonged and how to keep the store looking neat and clean.
good,"Dollar General has been my home for 5 years now. I have always enjoyed it. Typical day at work includes recovering aisles and stocking shelves/sky shelves. I've had 3 different GM's in my time at DG, and Management is very kind, willing to listen to employees. Smiling and Customer Service is a must, if you can do that, then you will enjoy this job."
good,"Good place to work, very stressful at times because of the short staff. A/C was always broken, which made it very hard to work. Other than that I enjoyed everything about the job"
good,It wasn't a bad place to work....the store didn't have there stuff together so it was a mess and getting new management was rough. Other than that it wasn't that bad. A job is a job.
good,I love the fact I got paid every week. The cash registers are out of date need some major upgrades. Need more help in the store everything is on one person.
good,customers were great got to know a lot of them by name after seeing them so much...lol. id have to say though I hated how they terminated me when I couldn't come to work due to doctors orders for a high risk pregnancy
good,Stocking shelves and working out over stock from back room. Doing side work as needed. Waiting on customers and greeting customers when coming and leaving the store.
good,"Constantly cleaning, stocking and helping customers. You also have to run the register while you are doing all of that. When the truck comes in it can be choas."
good,This company was founded on Family & Serving others. In todays times it is more about numbers which is not a bad thing but when you loose site of the people who make all of this possible by putting in long hours and day's away from family without the recognition they deserve.  Then we have lost site. In today's times stability is gone. Store teams want stability going thru 6 to 10 management personal a year is not a good thing. The hardest part of this job is not having the employee base to serve the customers as they deserve. Then missing out on family functions.  The most enjoyable part of this job is the employees & customers because without them where would we all be.
good,"A typical day at this job was moderate, everyday you had the same task pretty much like stocking, organized, ticket scanning, and cashiering. Not a lot of people went to that store because it's one of the oldest in the area."
good,"I loved dollar general work there for five plus years as an assistant manager. loved my co workers, my job, my customers, and my location. disliked the fact that hours of operation where extended. i also had health issues that caused me to not be able to perform certain duties at full compassity. the pay was just ok. left for less work more pay."
good,Dollar General is lovely. Great work opportunity. Flexible hours. The Dungan Road location is a great work environment for anyone with a great work ethic.
good,"Order filling was the summery of this job which entails: scanning, counting, pulling, sorting, and stocking products on a rolltainter to send to the shipping docks."
good,Being an assisstant manager for the first time was a great experience. I've been in customer service for ten years and I love every bit of it. This job was one of the reason why I love being a customer service rep.
good,Reviewed operational recorda and reports to project sales and determine profitability. Assisted general manager with general store procedures. Revolved customer complants regarding sales and services.
good,"Always short staffed but like working there. Would have stayed if had better store manager, or better pay. Not a bad job for someone just starting the work force."
good,"A typical day at dollar general, getting to work, make sure your area and the store is clean . I learned how to interact w others more. There's really no hard part as long as you do you job . i enjoyed working on the cash register."
good,"Its not a bad place to work but the ammount of people the company goes through is unreal.  In the ahort time I was there we went through almost 10 people.  And once someone quits get ready, because they will darn near force you to pick up the slack even if you have kids."
good,I love my boss and the people I work with.  I have worked at other locations to pick up hours and they all are ran differently. Some follow corporates guidelines and some don't.
good,"Will be great for part-time work but some of the people are awful.Management needs to get it together,and we are under paid.Work understaff,store can sometime be messes they expect to much out of the employees.Sometime the best thing to do is keep your mouth close and keep it moving"
good,"Enjoyed working with all of management, peers, employees, associates, etc.. Learned a lot about marketing, merchandising, store layout, advertising, and more in the retail industry."
good,"Advancement opportunities. Positive culture. Supervisors need more supervision themselves though, they tend to get on power trips when left to their own devices. "
good,At Dollar General I stocked the shelves with merchandise. I also worked on the cash register. I helped out with working the truck and I gave great customer service.
good,I liked to work there it was close to home and I also liked the people I worked with. I don't have all to say about the dollor store.  I would just rather work at a factory
good,I really did like the job. My life was just way to busy for the availability my old manager had needed me for. If I had a chance to work there again as a part-time job I probably will.
good,Fast paced. Productive and great place of work. Well managed. Great work environment to keep you on your feet. Excellent way to meet new faces and become more social.
good,"a typical day at work, i was the low man on the totem pole and i was made to do pretty much everything the store needed, the temporary managers sat and watched."
good,"Good company, Dollar General is a very customer service based company, they believe that the customer is always right we do what it takes to make the customer happy."
good,"A typical day involves running a register, stocking, and a generous amount of customer service. I have learned to hone my training and customer service skills to a higher level."
good,I only worked here part time as a second job but my manager was nice and tried to understand that I worked odd hours at my first job and tried to work with me on scheduling.
good,Working for  Dollar General we a new experience with how the company tends to look at the employees.  The management would tell you that all eyes were on you and basically call you a thief to your face... I was management there and did not like how I had to pressure an employee about how things ran and they would have fingers pointed at them.. not my style
good,Dollar General is filled with many different customers that come in with different personalities. I have learned to be patient with people. The work place is calm but you do encounter rude people.
good,Never had a problem here. Great company to work for. I enjoyed everything about my job and being promoted was amazing. I really loved working for Dollar General and seeing regular customers.
good,I really enjoyed working here BUT not all managers are as laid back and nice as mine . The pay isn't great but there is room for promotion at dollar general. It really depends on what location you are at .
good,"My time here was enjoyable. The company does not promote within the store. I was doing the work of the store manager, as ours had quit, but  only getting shift manager pay for several months."
good,"Upon arriving at work, i clock in, count my till if i am on the register that day. I assist customers. I stock shelves and make sure no items that are perishable are out of date. The only difficult part of my job is being able to maintain calm in the face of rude and or unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smile on a customers face when they know that i actually care if they have a good experience in my store."
good,My time at Dollar General although short was very pleasant. I felt like a vital part of them and like my work mattered. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I definitely would have stayed longer had i not become pregnant and couldn't handle the lifting anymore.
good,I was happy to work here. Everyone was friendly. I was grateful with my shift hours and pleased with my co-workers. I also liked how clean my work environment was.
good,"customer service was always my first priority "
good,"overall, dollar general was a good place to work. It had its ups and downs just like your average job would. I liked getting to know the customers and interacting with them."
good,"A typical day of work is coming in counting down a drawer for the previous cashier and counting it up for myself or another cashier, get my task for the night from the store manager and get to work. Most likely we will be working on totes (mini floor stocking), recovering (making sure the product is in the right spot and has the right amount of facings its supposed to have). Give my cashier her break and then myself one. If im working the night shift i have to count the drawers and make sure the deposit is right whiile the cahsier sweep/mops the store. The work atmosphere is not too bad. Work is how you make it meaning if you make it boring it will be boring. Get to know yor coworkers so you wont have a boring shift BUT its your responsibility to make sure your task get done as well."
good,Work their 1.3 years and was mostly an enjoyable experience. Learning where everything is is the hard part. Manager and other employees are nice and helpful.
good,My overall growth with Dollar General corporation would reflect on my ability to serve each customer in a timey manner while still managing to complete all task and projects by deadline.
good,"Overall, I have had a very positive experience working at Dollar General.  Compensation and bonus are below average.  Management is pretty good about personal time.  The office has some very nice amenities.   The work is fast paced and rewarding."
good,"Open store, set up registers, perform daily tasks set by district manager, ETC. Learned to handle very different personalities and customer complaints. "
good,"Stocking is an integral part of the job even if you're a cashier. This is one of those jobs left to teens desperate for work. It could probably be a stepping stone to a better internal position, but it would take time and effort."
good,The workers walk around and dont know what to do. They start using their phones and always doing something that shouldnt be done. Manger is very rude and talks under breath alot.
good,Fast paced environment with opportunities to grow. Wonderful benefits and inexpensive as well. The company helps out the community and helps teach people to read
good,It was a great experience working at this store. Every employee have the greatest attitude and always with a smile on there face. The customers always happy when they came in and always have on their way out.
good,"i was a lead cashier , had a set of keys so i could open and close , the pay was fine , i worked reasonable hours , was always home by 11pm if closed, i enjoyed meeting the customers it was a good clean work place"
good,"I worked for Dollar General twice in my life, and I have already reviewed what working for this company is like.  The people are great and the job is fulfilling."
good,"Depending on where you are, service is great. "
good,Was an awesome place to work. Management was amazing and fun to work with co workers were also . great to socialize with customers to develope customer service experience. Did not like the fact they did not offer base employees any perks
good,"It's more something to do, it's not a job for someone trying to raise a family and uphold an household. I can barely maintain off what I am paid. It would not be a career option for me."
good,"There was not a ""typical"" day at Dollar General.  With so much growth going on it was anything but slow and typical.  In the years I was at Dollar General, I learned a lot about maintenance, construction, rent, taxes, common area maintenance, vendor changes, and accounts receivable.  It was never a dull moment.  I enjoyed the variety and challenges of the job.  I just had gotten to a place where I did not feel like I would advance anymore, and really wanted to move up in the company."
good,A small town store. A days work included running cash register and stocking shelves. Fun place to work. Family friendly. Everyone worked together to get the job done
good,They worked with my schedule. Made me feel my work was valued. The regional manager took notice of my advancement and let me know my effort was appreciated.
good,"I open/close store"
good,"I enjoyed this job and the tasks, but did not enjoy the area in which it was located. It was not a safe area, and there were often many problems surrounding it."
good,"The overallJob itself is great, but the management is horrible. It seems as if they were just thrown out there without any proper training. As far as the mix of different races not so much there is about a 70 to 30 with 70 being the percentage of blacks, so when something does happen to a caucasian employee they would automatically pull out the race card. I  have worked here for a year and have gotten 1.50 pay increase, while someone who worked there for 2 days gets that same pay, and that same job title, but I had to do their work"
good,I thought it was great working at this company. I learned almost everything i needed to learn to be a manager of Dollar General. I got to learn how to be a best customer service representative.
good,Job and workers were very friendly. They made sure you were understanding the jobs you were constantly asked to do. Made sure you weren't overwhelmed with anything all the time. Simple job and duties asked to do were easy.
good,"Working at Dollar General was great and fun. Customers, employees and atmosphere were great too but the security wasn't all that great because there were blind spots and if officers did show, sometimes nothing would be done."
good,Great place to work. Wish it would have been a little busier but it was in a very small town. Too slow paced for me unfortunately and not enough hours to split between amount of employees.
good,Depending on your location dollar general can be a nice place to work. The moneyv isn't the best but while working you tend to bond with new people and build new friends and family.
good,It was decent. Literally.................. They made you feel welcome but once you were in the experience changed and it became dog eat dog. It was sort of stressful.
good,"I genuinely enjoyed working for this company but the management was a bit chaotic. It seemed like no matter how hard we tried we were always behind on shipment, product, and appropriate hours for each employee. However we did get free lunch on Wednesdays and they give each employee uninterrupted breaks. Its a great first time job."
good,Working for this company is easy and fairly enjoyable. The pay is decent and the employees are friendly. The work load is manageable and the tasks are easily completed.
good,Schedule was supposed to be posted for 2 week intervals. Never knew when you would work next. Management very poor. Liked to over work employees due to lack of employees.
good,"You will do everything from receiving stock and vendors to running the cash register to cleaning everything yourself "
good,"Have some great co workers and out boss is awesome. There for us when we need her the most. Great person and teacher. Lots of hard work unloading truck, stocking, steady work always something to do or acccmplish. Seeing customers leave happy is a plus. Only wish they didnt close so late at nite. We are open from 6am to 11pm."
good,I never thought I'd like working fast food but taco bell was great only because of its awesome team members. The company has some good products and usually hires the right people.
good,"Dollar general was a pretty cool job to work for, it was very easy work, grate customers, grate staff and management staff. The only problem with working at dollar general was mainly trying to stock the shelves and run the cash register because sometimes you can't see the register from where you have to stock the items."
good,They company needs to improve on work life balence as well as payroll for busier stores. Store managers are forced to work 60 hrs a week. DMs give unrealistc time lines and lie to Regional directors to make themselves look good and throw store managers under the bus.
good,"you clock in go talk to the manager and see what needs to be done for the day you then meet and greet customers as soon as they come in, work on your truck"
good,I opened and closed store.  Responsible for safe and deposits.  Created displays in accordance with corporate handbook.  Made schedules for employees.
good,"My workplace is a good place to work if you're a person that is energetic, organized, a rather quick learner, and trustworthy. The management is great and the atmosphere is calm. Everyone that you would work with they're understanding and helpful."
good,"Customers were usually polite and easy going. The registers are easy to use. Hours are a roller coaster sometimes, especially around holidays. Very few full-time positions, but great part-time job."
good,The dollar general is an OK job. I hadn't for any reason found something about it I didn't like yet. I actually enjoy coming to work everyday now. If I made more money I epups definitely make this a career job.
good,"working here has been a refreshment. communicating, fast paced, and never a dull moment. Everyone comes in happy to see you , and its nice to see familiar faces."
good,Recent changes to leadership have affected overall morale of company.  Was able to promote from store manager to district manager in a couple years.  Many demands on time and tasks to complete.
good,"I provide good customer service skills by listening to what the customers need, resoving inquiries about prices or products, practice good housekeeping techniques, and utilizing proper data entry methods. I also learned about suggestive selling to customers to improve store profit."
good,"Here, I just started this place, but it seems fun. depending on the day you come in, depends on what kind of work you are doing."
good,"At dollar general, you are constantly on the go, between customers and pulling freight. The shifts vary between hours, weekly. It was a very good learning experience to be involved in."
good,"very friendly environment, managers are willing to work around schedules and are always willing to help and answer any questions you have. The only bad thing is that you do the same thing everyday and get asked to do the things the person that worked the shift before already did because there's nothing else to do."
good,"I will not work for a boss who favors their employees. Boss first, friend second. Be respectful and polite to others. Work together not against each other it will make for a happier work place."
good,"Was a great job had a good work day everyday"
good,I liked it because I need a after school job an I needed nights and they closed at 9:00 they worked with me about my hours and if I wanted to come in on a sunday they would let me
good,Good company to work for. Co-workers were friendly and compassionate towards customers. Great way to pick up customer service experience. Fast paced work environment.
good,open store each day of week there was something to do for that day which gave you a timeline of how to spend your day if you got all your work done quickly you could spend it with your customers helping them shop
good,Pays every week. Leaves no time for home life. I good job for ppl with no kids or with older kids. Wish it was more of a balance in the work place and more team work.
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General, my biggest issue is the home and life balance just wasn't there for me. Nor was the staff to get the work done. I did the majority of the work that needed to be done. Both as a Sales Associate, Assistant Manager and as Manager. Staffing in my store always seemed to be an issue in my location. Whenever a specific task had a deadline, I worked extremely hard to meet that deadline. So working under pressure is a strong asset that I have."
good,"a typical day at work for me was cool. i wasnt to much to do and we wasnt really busy much. i learned how to work the cash register, how to make transactions."
good,Great place to work at times. I've seen a lot of managers come and go. Pay could be better. But overall if you had a good manager or key holder in charge your work day would be a lot smoother. Didn't always treat employees equal. Seen a lot of favoritism within this company. Could not keep general managers as well.
good,"I worked for Dollar General as an Assistant Store Manager (ASM) for a little over a year. The company itself was great to work for. They offered good benefits, very organized procedures, and very professional. The only downsides I found was the inability to advance and lack of training. However, this is what I found in my store, may be different depending on the Manager and the District."
good,"Decent place to work. Nights, weekends and holidays are mandatory. Long days at some points. Big turnover rate with employees."
good,"Non-stop busy, between cashiering, stocking and customers, there is always something to do. Never enough time to get the daily list of what to do done, especially in a high traffic store."
good,"Enjoyed working here, the flexibility of the hours were a plus! One of the things I love about Dollar General is that it employs all race and ethnicity's making it a a great diverse company to be a part of!"
good,I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot and was given the chance to become a closing manager. I loved working with customers in a small store environment
good,"Typical day included waiting on customers, cleaning and organizing products on store shelves, receiving inventory shipments. Sometimes overwhelming."
good,"A typical day would be running a register and taking care of the customers needs. I was an assistant manager and learned about keeping product in stock, scheduling, making deposits and running the store when the manager was not there. A management position can be stressful but is easier when organized.the hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done within the allotted time given. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of the customer and their needs."
good,I loved working at dollar general because all the other workers were really nice to me and so was the boss. I've learned a lot from working there. I really enjoyed working there.
good,The Home Depot was a great place the customers and staff really made the store feel like a home environment. It was a great experience working with people that made me better as a worker.
good,"The store stays fairly busy. There was always something to be done.  There could have been more training on the management side. After working for Dollar General, and looking what I do now, I can see where improvements in organization and training would have helped tremendously in store moral."
good,The store manager give you way to much responsibility for to little money. She ask us to do things that really only she is aloud to do. The look of the store is bad as well. Have pride and fix it up.
good,"good people to work with, well spoken employees, good management that is understanding of any issues you may have with scheduling among other things, very easy going work place, hardest part of the job was dealing with the register if it froze up, the most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the shelves in the morning before the store opened."
good,"Dollar General's office environment was a pleasant, and fun place to work.  I learned to utilize my time according to my work load.  I developed my office skills and interpersonal skills."
good,I am a part time cashier. I will be employed with this company two years this coming April and I'm still making the same amount of money they started me out with... This is a great place to work from my experience I love my co-workers the work is fun and easy however they don't give part-time employees raises and it's a lot to do in a little store for the amount of money they pay...
good,"Dollar General expected the managers to go above and beyond for the store, but was not willing to do the same for the managers or employees."
good,My manager and co-workers were great. I like the customers. The job was easy; I can run a cash register with the best of them!
good,"In general it was a decent job, with room for growth. It gave me experience working with deposits, as well as working with the public. I enjoyed my experience for the most part."
good,Manager was very nice but ended up moving out of state.  Had a great time working although very slow paced environment.   Was very predictable work schedule.
good,I love to work i work well with people i communicate well too etc but also i dont get mad easy and plus i follow every rule etc..
good,I enjoyed my time working there. they have everything you could possibility think of and they usually have it in stock and cheaper than wal mart or anywhere like that.
good,the people was amazing to work with they taught me a lot of new different stuff. I never had a problem with anyone there. I don't work there was because I had to take care of my sick mother.
good,It a pretty normal place to work at the pay is horrible but sometimes you can get good hours there really busy on weekend's and they normally have really good sales every week there also very cheap on everyday items
good,"The time we opened the doors til the time we closed, it was a positive work place and the customers kept us busy and laughing. There was definitely a fast pace, team work, easy flow work place."
good,I loved my job and loved that it was close to home that's what im looking for now is something close to home working at this company was great I liked my manager and my co workers was great to work with
good,I enjoyed working with a friendly staff and learned how to use the cash register and completed inventory with management.  Great management team and there was lots of support from staff members
good,"Great work place, fast paced, friendly staff and co workers. Decent pay and benefits. Was able to learn a lot while there. It's been a good experience"
good,A typical day would be counting my drawer. Stocking and bringing all items to the front of the shelves. I make displays and tell customers about what was on sell. I cleaned the shelves and floors when needed. I would throw out what was expired. I would do inventory. I used u-boats and rolltainers and ladders. I learned that retail is hard work and ensuring sells ensures a successful day. The hardest part was stocking and taking care if lines of customers. The best part was the regulars and the constant motion of staying busy.
good,Did truck and cashiered. I learned how to properly stock items. The management was good..i would rate it a 7/10 . The coworkers at the job focused more on other things rather than doing their job. The hardest part of the job was when truck came every Friday. The most enjoyable part of the job was my break.
good,"As the store manager we have tasks we do everyday, dealing with money and paperwork. We deal with our customers with their every need. I manage my crew to what the store needs require."
good,I really enjoy working with the public  I just don't get enough hours. My co workers are awesome people an very fun to work with
good,The job was very rewarding but too short although it was seasonal. I enjoyed working with the ladies that was at my location. We shared a lot of laughs and smiles.
good,"The overall job was good but did not like how the company was ran. There were only two employees at a time working each shift. There were no extra hours for stocking before the store opened, leaving stocking to be done during the day. Since stocking was done during the day it left the store messy and the key holders were not able to effectively stop shoplifting."
good,"Working under pressure with long lines on Saturdays and unhappy customers, slower days are nice so we can clean better and help customers to their satisfaction better.  Management is standard, could use improvements but is by no means faulting. Co-workers are good people who usually pitch in to help and get along with each other very well. Hardest part of the job is cashiering for me, I love helping people and seeing myself get things accomplished such as the cleaning or a person leaving happy and wanting to come back."
good,"Fair management, seemed company rules only worked when they wanted them to work though. Ended up leaving them after almost a year, great job but pay wasn't enough to really afford anything you need let alone wanted"
good,It's an OK place to work at.  But the general manager doesn't have very good customer service skills.. But the assistant manager is awesome and amazing.  She will listen to you as an employee and has awesome customer service skills...
good,I really liked my boss and the people I worked with. We all got along and we willing to help each other when it was needed.  I left the job because I moved here to VA.
good,"i was a part time sales associate, had a great manager; she taught me all i know about customer service and dealing with different high stress situations and different people. a couple days a week i worked freight and other days i worked the cash register (which ill admit was somewhat outdated and tended to crash frequently.) i enjoyed this job some what but after transferring out to a different store, it was clear not all DG stores are ran by decent superiors and well kept up."
good,So far so good. There is always something to do. Very busy and productive.Ots a learning experience. The managers have been god with working with my schedule.
good,I enjoyed waking up and going to work every day. My co-workers was very pleasant to work with. I learned a lot during the time I was there. The management team was pleasant to work with. I didn't have a problem with no co-workers. My enjoyable part of my jobs was the customers and co-workers. It was a good environment.
good,"Very good place to start cashier experience. Exceeded in all skills and job duties. Leaned it very fast and had fun with co-workers."
good,They worked with me very well since I was in college at the time. Only had to work once when very sick they were very understanding. Never had any problems with any of the other employees or management and everyone was ready to help other employees out outside of the workplace. Very good work environment.
good,"Great place to work at, enjoy working with and meeting new people inside and outside of the company. Management and workers are all very nice to be around."
good,Typical day would be to stock shelves and organize store. I improved my customer service skills and learned management skills. Management was okay. Hardest part was dealing with shop lifters. Most enjoyable was organizing the store.
good,When I go to work I got one thing on my mind and that's the task I have to complete. I've learned how to manage a retail store. I help my coworker the best I can. The best part of the day is quiting time.
good,"Customers service, Money handling/deposits,"
good,The store is fast paced environment. I learned how to work the cash register and tills. Management is nice and very informative of duties and regulation. My co-workers are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is getting enough people in to cover breaks The good part is I'm providing a good service to the community.
good,"I learned that working in retail can definitely have its good and bad days. Some days you have to deal with some customers that you just don't want to deal with but if you take care of situations the proper way, it'll make that job a lot easier."
good,"This has been a great addition to my work experience but with the hours and not being able to have a set routine, its extremely difficult. The benefits are great and pay isnt horrible but could be better for all that is required of you. I love working with the people and being out and about the store able to socialize as I work is a big plus. I have learned alot with this company."
good,"It was a decent job, it had flexible hours which was really great while still being in school. It wasn't a hard job, stocking the store on busy days or during holidays got hectic and stressful but never got out of hand where you couldn't complete the job. All in all I really liked working at the Dollar General."
good,"The store was nearly kept very organize and shop friendly, it wasn't hard to find things as a customer. It was a great place to get customer service experience."
good,"Management duties consisted of. Cashiering, stocking, setting plan-a-grams, hiring, banking, transposing sales, etc. to customer office. Customer service and cleaning. Interviewing, unloading trucks, inventory  control. etc... I thought very highly of my co-workers, couldn't have done it without them. The hardest part of my job was working to many shifts and hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was setting plan-a-grams and customers."
good,being a waitress was an okay job. I wouldn't really call it waitressing I stood behind a bar and the customers would tell me what they wanted on their plate but it was still a good job.
good,"I really enjoyed working there, the job was just the right tempo for me. Sometimes it got busy, but that just made the day go by so much faster. The job only required stocking the store and assisting the customer."
good,"A good company to work for. Management is approachable and easy to communicate with, coworkers are great people, willing to work with individual schedules, opportunities to advance available."
good,stocking and handling great customers. i learned that i can accomplish anything. the management was amazing. my co workers where amazing. The hardest part was upset customers. i enjoyed everything about my job.
good,"Great business, though I didn't agree with the hourly cut back, I still enjoyed working for dollar general, and would not mind returning to work for them."
good,"Typical day at wok: Always on the go whenever you get there you will always be doing something, stocking, cash register, cleaning, recovering "
good,"to be honest, it was unbearable, the only thing that really made it worth it was my co-workers. Pretty average over all. I wonder how many more words I need? Is this enough?"
good,Getting to know those in our community and assist them is the best part of this position. There are some aspects of management I would address if I were able to.
good,Enjoy meeting and helping customers with their needs. Some customers I have made a great relationship with. The store is always neat and clean.
good,The job was challenging and very fun. The store team was wonderful and hardworking to be with. I always felt accomplished while at work at Dollar General and knowing that customers had a good experience while shopping with us.
good,"Everyone is friendly. "
good,My direct District Managers were very thorough with coaching and development. It was also a very team oriented environment which made associates feel like family.
good,"This was a workplace in which it taught self discipline, communication skills, and honesty.  There were many days you would deal with a great number of customers with bad attitudes and have to learn to deal with it."
good,"Wouldn't recommend anyone looking for a career job to work her, high turnover rate, peoples call in all the time, didn't learn much, most enjoyable part was the customers"
good,I am a college student and it is working out for me so far. I get the hours I need and a reasonable amount of free time. Plus we get paid weekly and I have benefits.
good,A typical day at work for me is coming in and doing u-boats all day. the hardest part of my job is the angry customers. but it would be better if we could get more hours.
good,"Ran the register"
good,"A great place to work, and grow into a career, payroll restrictions are the most challenging part of the job, customers are friendly and appreciate you"
good,i Learned to run a cash register and how to keep up with money. The hardest part was making sure every penny was accounted for. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people. My co workers were very friendly and made my job a lot easier
good,The store manager made it possible for me to have off when I needed off for school. She even worked some times so I could have off.
good,"Management was easy going.  Taught us things easily."
good,While working at dollar general there were some good days and some bad days. I had co-workers that did not want to pull their own weight and a district manager that was very rude
good,"I enjoyed this job. Would definately work for this company again. It was an easy job, fast paced with some down time to finish stocking shelves."
good,Busy. Being patient with customers. Former manager was easy to work with and worked around my school schedule. We worked as a team to get freight put up on the shelves. Trying to get 200 piece truck put up in two days. The co-workers.
good,I liked working here because I love working with people and that is the main thing I did but I would also come in on certain days just to unload the truck or stock shelves.
good,"The environment in which I work is ever-changing. No work day is exactly the same. For better or for worse, there is always something new to be learn, experience to gain, and a skill to master."
good,great job i moved up the later in less then 2 years from an associate to nd assistant manager and i did donations and i learned how to  be more out spoken when need to be.
good,"A typical day would include recovery, cashiering, helping customers find items. I didn't learn anything new because I have cashiered before."
good,"Dollar General, is an amazing company and I believe anyone that works for them will be satisfied. However, some employees do not resemble that of a professional worker. With that being said, if you ever have the opportunity to be apart of their team, you will learn about money handling, time management,  and store retrieval."
good,"The company could stand to treat their employees better. We all worked very hard and worked long hours, but were treated poorly by the heads of the company."
good,Great place to work family work environment but management has questionable methods of management. Full disclosure of responibilities is not present nor documented and expectations are set a bit high
good,"Great place to work as it is fast-paced and productive, mostly due to my co-workers who not only supported my learning progress in retail but also made the work atmosphere light."
good,"Enjoyed working here, however manager/employee relations is terrible. Expect you to drop everything and come to work no matter your personal life. The job duties are fairly simple, a lot of repeating and they expect you to get a million things done while giving you NO payroll."
good,"I have learned a lot of things working for Dollar General. My experience in Customer service is great asset to any career I choose.  I believe the things I've learned will benefit me forever. I have really enjoyed meeting all the different people such as Vendors, co-workers, higher level management, and especially the customers.  I also enjoyed faster pace and ability to multitask. I feel that I have learned a lot about responsibility and problem solving skills. These skills will benefit me for the rest of my life."
good,"Working here was a slower paced work environment, but the people I worked with I enjoyed being around and had a lot of fun working there."
good,"This job is for high school, college students or ones who make it to upper management. For some one with a family to support, its very hard the pay is not enough and the scheduling is all over the place."
good,"I learned a lot about management and leadership. In my experience it does not matter how long you've been employed somewhere, but how good a leader/teacher/instructor you had. My ability to experience, learn, grow and apply any information I have been given, is less time than some, and more than others. The gift of expeirience I was given here is invaluable. I am glad I got the chance."
good,"I only worked for Dollar General a short time. However, I was part of a wonderful team. The only thing I didn't like were the corporations ideas of what they expected. Some expectation were very difficult to achieve. Especially in the small store where I worked. The manager and assistant manager were very hard working and very easy to get along with. I learned a great deal about customer service working for dollar general. The hardest part of this job was making sure that each week our truck was put onto the shelves even if we didn't have the space for it."
good,"the times I worked would always change"
good,This job is not too difficult. You have to love working with the public. The schedule was very flexible which is a pro and a con. On the one hand they really work with you if you need off but you also never know your schedule until a few days before.
good,"At Dollar General, there is always something to do. Whether you are working on the register keeping a flow of customers going, in the back stocking merchandise, or recovering the store so it looks organized and neat. Working here, I learned how to multi-task and my organizational skills improved. The manager that I had was friendly and appreciative of what I could do, but I felt that all of my hard work was poorly rewarded. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with truck. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with customers and co-workers."
good,"My co-workers helped me a lot learning about retail and how to manage a store. Checking in vendors. I like stocking products on the shelf as well as customer service, getting to interact with the customers. It was never a hard job to accomplish. My management was always wonderful stayed on task and did everything in the book of retail."
good,My first job was with Dollar General and well the management helped me a lot because I was young and it was my first job. I grew very quickly with the company and it is very easy to grow with them.
good,"assisting customers"
good,As a manager a typical work day was full of unexpected obstacles.  I learned that I truly enjoy being in the retail environment.
good,"I learned how to handle extremely large sums of money. Handle disgruntled customers. I learned how to be a boss and have employees listen and come to me with problems."
good,"Had good co-workers to work with. "
good,"You don't get enough hours during the week, and its not worth it to move up in management. Sometimes you are left to run the store by yourself."
good,Working for Dollar General was a very productive and educational experience for me. It helped me gain experience in a retail environment in a management position. It was a high pace environment but my co workers were very supportive and helpful in my learning processes. I also had great opportunities for advancement.
good,My typical day would include cashiering and/or stocking merchandise. Management worked very hard to maintain product and customer service in a location that has a limited workforce pool. I learned to cashier with emphasis on the importance of customer service and friendliness in a community of retirees. It was enjoyable learning about all the vast kinds of merchandise available. There was fortunately no hard parts of the job and the enjoyable part was working with the employees and the public.
good,"Customer service is what you make of it . Most days are fast pace, interacting with many customers.The hardest part of retail is typically dealing the customers.  Some days you will feel like nothing is going in your favor . You must always go thru the motions without emotions. Never show anger in anyway regardless of circumstances. Always deliver excellent customer service ."
good,"as a manger we have to count all the money in all the draws we also have to stock the stuff that comes in on the truck,,,,,we have to check in the truck and any other companys that bring things in, we also have to make sure that the store stays clean.."
good,Very customer satisfying! Very supportive co-workers. Ive honestly learned a lot and have grew a lot with both company's but i am  ready to expand! I have a family to support and would love to be able to provide more.
good,Its a great place for teenagers to work this job.They will say anything to keep there. but they won't come thought with it. and I need a better paying job.
good,Was a nice place to work but this job is more for people that don't have young children at home. The enjoyable part was was meeting and greeting the customers. During the holiday the employees really did a lot of stocking  and overstocking .
good,This position allowed me to be able to learn the basics in customer service. I gained plenty of knowledge that i believe will be able to assist me in any further positions i could attain.
good,I really enjoyed my time with the company. Overall everyone was very friendly and inviting. It was a very relaxed and fun atmosphere
good,"Being a manager in a larger corporation was not always easy. However, Dollar General did their best to provide the proper training to all its management and hourly employees. While I can't speak for the company now, at the time it was a unique experience to work for such a large company that was managed by one person. It is an experience that I will always remember."
good,Fun workplace and great co workers. Very supportive management. Overall great experience working for this company. Have really enjoyed my time with this company.
good,Good job Good company to work for not much time for family though Great people to work with. Management was strong. Every one helped each other
good,The lack of concern for the well being of the employees specially the store mnagers they expect them to kill themselves so they can cut hours more and more.  then they dont want to pay so you cant seem to get any reliable help that is worth anything
good,"Dollar General was a hands on job! I liked this job because I was a working manager not a delegating manager! I worked right beside with my employees! I liked teaching my employees everything I  could about their job. I always found that to help make mine easier, with less turnover! And once again team players are important!"
good,"A typical work day had its busy part of the day. "
good,"We have new leadership, our CEO has been in the role less than one year."
good,"Everyday was enjoyable. I got along with all of my colleagues and they all treated me very nice especially on my first day. I learned a lot working at the Dollar General and with how generous everyone was, I learned most of my job on my first day."
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar General.  If I were not a full time student pursuing a degree in Counseling/Psychology I may have continued my career with them in hope of advancement.
good,This is a nice place to work if you are starting out and looking to gain some work experience. There is a range of job duties that can be performed.
good,"Dollar General was a slow pace job would work the cashier while working the carts and putting items up in store. The best part working there would be getting there early before Store open to put items up and unload truck , nothing was hard about job just was too slow pace"
good,"great place to work, understanding staff, needs more balance between work and life, competitive pay, fun co workers more like family"
good,"i liked working here. I was always busy. the first month i worked i got a promotion, the customers loved me and so did the employees"
good,"Too bad they were too understaffed, they had to get people from other stores to help me out. I felt bad when I was sick or couldn't go to work. It was definitely an experience. I would love to something like stocking again."
good,"Handled large amounts of money. Helped keep the store stocked up. Inventory and stocking items on shelves."
good,"Every day was very busy. I ran the registers. I help customers when they ask for my help. I also reached out to customers even if they didn't need help. I would clean around the registers, in the bathrooms, and out around the story. I would also help unload the truck. I would do anything else my manager told me to do."
good,Running cash register along with stocking and front facing the merchandise. Also had to assist the costumers with their needs.
good,Since I've been with Dollar General I have learned a great deal about the retail industry and customer service. I try my best to greet every customer that enters the store. My location has a good work team and we work well toghether. There really isn't anything hard about working at Dollar General. The most enjoyable part is the customers that you have grown to know and respect.
good,this was okay company. i did not get a chance to get to know to many things about the place due to my assignment was to short.
good,The job itself wasn't bad if you have a good district manager willing to help out if you needed. But if the people hiring up wont help then the job is a headache
good,"Fun workplace but hard support management"
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere while working for Dollar General. It took me 2 years to be allowed to be a Keyholder, I will admit a stronger work ethic may have made it happen sooner however, advancement in Walgreens seems poor. "
good,"I just stock and work the register some shifts. fun people to work with, never too much work going on, just a great place to work."
good,"I have worked at 4 stores, and a total of 8 managers. Every different one has their own way of doing thing. Depending on the store is how busy you are going to be. I love working in the busier stores. But everyday is going to be busy either. We have busy seasons, times of the day and certain days of the week which all vary. On a typical day, either opening or closing, I get myself and my cashier ready for the shift. Counting drawers, safe fund, logging reports, checking in venders. Any number of 'strange"" requests from customers asking for certain items. Display set ups and tear down. Recovery, cleaning, filling, The daily hustle and bustle of the job is what I like best. "
good,Fun work place with reasonable management. Always room to grow and learn. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the public.
good,"I like working here, sometime there is a lack of management but other than that its a great job. they work with my schedule and I work with some great people."
good,This was a good job. You do not get paid a high price for all the work that is required however. The management is very supportive and help you along the way. Typically do not have enough employees to work so you are overworked and stressed.
good,"Nice new building. Daily fast pace to get orders filled. Learned to use a scanner, and work with different types of equipment. Supervisors stood by employees doing a good job. Coworkers for the most part where good people. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet their production percentages. Most enjoyable part of job was costume dress day, and free meals provided on holidays worked."
good,I liked working here I loved my co workers I liked that I always had something to do. I was productive in my work space. They were caring there and I liked being  the head cashier and getting regular customers I could always go to my manager if I needed anything and my shift manager mark was very helpful and awesome.
good,"Very Productive company. Although I worked more than 40 hours a week as a opening/closing manager, I barely had time for a life outside of the workplace because my store was short staffed. I learned alot and loved working there."
good,"Nice place to work. Coworkers were very nice. Typical day at work included waiting on customers, stocking shelves, balncing daily cashier drawer."
good,Greet the customers as they leave and enter the store. Always make sure you provide excellent customer service. Count down your till at the beginning of your shift to make sure your starting bank is accurate. My manager is very understanding and helpful. Co-workers are very friendly and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job I would say is making sure you give your customer the right cash amount because sometimes you could be over or under the amount of cash in your till and you could get wrote up. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and your co-workers.
good,"This company was pretty good to work for. We had a blast at what we did. My day would start about 7 am and within the day we would stock shelves, handle different amounts of money... I learned how to right out deposit slip on the days bank slips. My co workers were willing to teach me when I had a question."
good,"I enjoy working with and assisting customers on a regular basis. The job consist of bending, standing, handling cash, etc. I enjoy helping others."
good,"Fun Work place.  Wonderful Customers to meet, and good teamwork with all the employees.  Stayed busy, always work to do, which was good.  Caring and wonderful boss/management."
good,It was a good place to work until recent management changes.. they were bad about leaving  key holders alone in store for several hours  .  were not allowed to leave store on our lunch breaks.
good,"Overall my expierence at Dollar General was decent. There were certain individuals that didn't like doing their jobs, so we were in charge of picking up the slack. At one time, I had 8 people sitting at my register getting very angry because the key holder I had been working with was sitting in the back eating off break. That was the only person I ever had problems with there. But I didn't let them ruin my bubbly, happy mood,"
good,Key Holder experience was interesting. Overseeing daily store functions. Making sure cashiers get change and what they need to get customers transactions go smoothly.
good,Although hectic on most days the customer interaction and being part of a great management team makes this a very enjoyable place to work.
good,It was a good establishment but I was not able to get the hours I needed. And the sercurity guards left before the second started.
good,Customers are fun to deal with on a day to day basis. You know the ones that comes in regularly. Mgmt sre great to deal with.
good,"On a regular work day I would be back and forth between stocking merchandise on the shelves, helping customers and also running the registers."
good,Liked my manager so I loved my job. Other stores do not help each other and create drama for each other so that is why its only 4 not 5.
good,"This was one of the best jobs I ever held. They have rules that they abide by without favoritism. Although its a rather large company, I never felt like just a number...The people in charge do well with balancing positive feedback and constructive criticism. The sky is the limit with this company!"
good,"Supportive management. Jobs are completed to the best of ability, done by the person best suited for the job. Training is simple and easy. Easily comprehended,"
good,"DG is a fast growing company, it is a small box retailer who depends on the Store Manager to do most of the work to include all clerical/office/reports, claims/damages, maintenance, recieving, stocking, cashiering, POG sets, check in vendors, and much more. Has a small staff with equally small budget to have employees help run the store and service customers."
good,Co-workers were elderly and slow working but kind often leading me to work more to pick up the pace but the customers were often kind but impatient so my skills with angry customers were improved.
good,"Fast pace, seems as if things are always changing. Great prices, this makes it very convenient for customers to come in and get what they are looking for."
good,"mainly stocking shelves and helping with customer service, helping the vendors set up their displays, and unloading the trucks with the products sold in the stores"
good,This is a great company to work for. They care about their people and have wonderful programs for employees. I enjoy the working environment.
good,meet new people i also learn have to talk with people more i always stayed to myself n didnt talk to me one so working at dollar general has really helped me to open up...
good,The typical work day is generally busy and full of excitement when it comes to the customers. On the daily routine i would run the cash register and stock the shelves. Management there though is a bit out of whack. The hardest part of my job there was trying to run all the freight by myself and keep up with the customers.
good,"i would clock in and go to my register, check people out and in between transactions i would clean uo the store and stock. i learned many things like what the safety codes and regulations were and what labels meant on boxes. management was awesome. i felt as if we were a family.the hardest part of the job was closing. and the most enjoyable time was peak hour."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of just about everything. I would run the cash register, stock, and help customers with their needs. I learned a lot about how supply chain works. I have had the experience of checking in the truck, checking inventory, and letting know what we need more of. I was the lead sales assistant. I learned how to manage the store from top to bottom. I would open and close the store. This included making sure the money was correct and everything was balanced out. My co-workers were very good people who were great team players. The hardest part of the job would probably be time. I worked super hard but always found that if I had more time I could really get this store spotless. However, I would always run out of day and have to continue my hard work the next day. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the customers and the experience. I loved learning new things. Also, learning how to run this company from top to bottom really made me realize how much I love working. I just overall, enjoy life to its fullest no matter what I am doing."
good,Hours and pay are not for someone who is the sole breadwinner. This would be great for a supplemental income to the home. Store management has been outstanding.
good,The particular store that I was working at had a very high turn over rate. With the 11 months that I worked there I went through 3 store managers and countless coworkers. It was an okay company to work for.
good,Multiple work hours I have to work. Some of the employees are rude to work with and communicate. I have learned a lot at my job.
good,Load up inventory and stock shelves.Retail is very competative. Management was very nice.Co-workers was nice. The hardest part was trying to stop Loss Prevention. I enjoyed assisting the customers.
good,Its a great place to work. All I had to do was run a cash register and stock shelves. The managers that I worked with were really great to work with. They would help me if I ever needed help.
good,I am willing to go back to work there. The people I worked with were easy to get along with. The job was easy to do instructions for task were well explained.
good,I believe if the districts and managers of each store were more organized and had the proper resources from a higher command this business would be a much more organized and reasonable environment to work in.
good,"A great and fun place to work. Great people to work with and enjoy what I did for this company. Typical day would be supervising multiple departments loading and unloading trucks, and billing and customer service."
good,"Working for this company was enjoyable, but the hours can be extremely grueling for a manager. Having a life outside of working nearly 70 hours a week is nearly impossible, but I did love the work I was doing and the people I was serving."
good,"Being a store manager at Dollar General made me a better leader. Doing the day to day operations, completing paper work, cash handling, hiring potential assistants and/or store managers gave me a boost in my management experience."
good,I was always busy doing something. There was hardly any time to be bored. Time passed very fast. Management was good. Coworkers were friendly. The hardest part of working here was the hours and pay. I liked a lot of the customers that came in.
good,"A typical day consisted of me restocking the shelves and ensuring the merchandise was all facing the correct way. "
good,"I like working there and the assistant managers was good to work for. Just some other staff hard get them to work. So you had do double the work load . I cashiered , stocked, counting down my drawer before and after shift, cleaned , answered phones."
good,"do roll containers help customers and run cashier clean up the store after the store been closed for the day, if your part time usually get 10-12 hrs weekends only"
good,Dollar General is not a career choice. It is extremely difficult to advance or make advancements. I advise you keep on the search for a career while being employed.
good,Very different experience compared to other jobs. Customers were always nice and usually from my community. Although usually under staffed work was always completed on time.
good,"It was a good experience to work in this store, and dialing with different situations. But some of the co-workers were hard to deal with at some times, other times was great."
good,Goodyear was an amazing place to work for. There was always something to do while working and never got bored. I loved my job there but ended up moving or i would still be working there
good,"A typical day at work consists of a few different things so being able to multitask is great. Wearing a smile can draw in people, being friendly is key to keeping customers and clients happy and satisfied. Management is good they work with you and help you out when needed, along with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was learning and knowing where everything went. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General warehouse was clocking in at 7am finding a pallet jack, checking it out making sure everything worked out it correctly. Then you would go down see your zone manager he would tell you what the pick was like that day, then he would give you your first assignment for the day then you would  and start your picking after you were done picking that assignment you would take the pick to the dock door drop it off and go get another one till your day was done. The hardest part of the job is keeping your pick up to a 90%. Management was great and so were my co-workers they would help as much as possible."
good,"Hard working, fun, and fast paced work place. Friendly and hard working co workers with a lot of team work. We all worked together to stock shelves, run registers, and help customers in any way we could. Management was great."
good,Typical work day always moving and staying busy. The hardest part of the job inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers.
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General. My managers were amazing and my co- workers helped me and taught me a lot. If I had not gotten married and moved, I would still be working there!"
good,This was a very good store to work at. The job was very easy and you just had to connect with customers. I really liked and enjoyed working here because I like to meet new people and converse with my customers.
good,Fast paced workplace with oppurtunties to grow and learn new things while working in a team effort to get the job done in a timely manner.  Being productive is most important because my job is to satisfy the customer.  Every order that is properly filled helps Dollar General to maintain its status among other Distribution Centers that also distribute to vendors around the U.S.
good,"A typical day is, being at the register most of the shift. at the end of the day you have to recover the store, sweep and mop the front end."
good,working freight and setting up planograms. the hardest part of my job is the challenge that comes with the neighborhood. The customers in the neighborhood are real difficult and don't have no respect for another human being.
good,The expecations they have for the store managers are too high.A typical work day you have a manager and a cashier but you have the work of 3 people.It impossible to get everything done in a days time with this company. you would have to work open to close 7 days a week.
good,"Overall, the position of a retail assistant store manager is a good one. Decent pay and the hours are not too outrageous. The only complaint I have about the company is that, truly, some of the expectations from the higher-ups in the management field were unrealistic. A big workload never bothers me and that is not the issue here. The issue is being expected to do a job that in a realistic view would take 3-4 people to do in the time-frame they want it done."
good,fast paced how to stock do deposits I was part of the management team so as long as everyone was trained right everything went smooth
good,It was nice getting to know the customers as regulars because of the size of the store. It was never to hard to help any one customer.
good,"I have always enjoyed working at Dollar General. I learned a lot like how to maintain the right attitude towards customers, and some management, I am happy to say I got along with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when co-workers did not stay on top of their work like they were suppose to. It would always fall on the person that relieved them from their shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and seeing to it that they were happy and satisfied with my work, and the compliments from the district managers and managers."
good,"Helped customers select products that best fit their personal needs. Educated customers on product and service offerings. Kept the showroom clean and maintained neat, orderly product displays."
good,"productive"
good,"At Dollar General, you are always on the go. Not only do you run a register and help customers find what they are looking for, you will also be required to put up merchandise. In this job, I have learned to set up displays and work on sets. I've worked with the replenishment team in restocking the shelves with product. Not to mention run a register. At the end of the day you are required to clean up the store and make it look presentable for the morning opening. This job has taught me a lot about myself and how i like to work, as well as many other aspects."
good,It is a great place to work and get a great start into the world of retail
good,"stocking shelves and unloading totes"
good,I was in charge of supplying Non Con with goods to be picked. I stayed busy the whole shift.
good,"it was an ok place to work, my supervisor was really nice to me. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customers have a better day if they were not feeling good"
good,Most customers cause it was a small town you get to know on a personal level. And the girls I worked with all believed in team work and pulling their own. It was a rough job for me cause I threw my back out twice. So I had to let the job go cause of that.
good,I have opened and closed the store. The most enjoyable part getting to know lots of new people on a daily base.  I enjoyed learning new this.  The hardest part was leaning every about a cash register.
good,"Dollar general was a good place to work, they helped me anytime i needed it and the manager was not hard to work for at all. I learned to run a cash register and how to properly stock shelves, enjoyed my co-workers as well."

good,I have enjoyed working for Dollar General and have learned a lot but I want to grow more weather that be with the company or not. I have worked there 3 years almost 4 and I haven't gone up. I am still young and learning what I want to do with my life. I want to do something that is more personnal hand-on with making a real difference with people in need
good,Love working with customers and helping them find what they need. Also loved working as a team to accomplish daily goals.
good,"Ringing customers out, cleaning up the store, and getting the truck out.  Learn how to handle all types of situations with help from the managers who work well with schedule changes, emergencies, and call-outs; to co-workers who has your back with customers truck and cleaning the store. The hardest and easiest part is the customers they are what determines the progress of the store."
good,When I went to work at Dollar General I went to a job where I met all kinds of people. I had an amazing crew that I worked with and it was the perfect first job.
good,"Management was great, but if one person bullied their way to the top corporate would let them go with it."

good,"Everyday was great, I became a certified forklift operator, and used   RF  scanner, management was great, co-worker were good everyone worked at stayed on task. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything is stacked neatly and don't fall. The most enjoyable part of the job was easy work."
good,I would assist customers and maintain a balanced till. The most enjoyable part of the job was my seeing the regular customers enter the store and call me by my name.
good,The store was 24hrs. I started out as a cashier working in the daytime and was promoted to the overnight stocking manager. My team worked well together and i gained good experience in problem solving and learning how to prioritize multiple duties in the workplace. I enjoyed setting up the store for holidays the most though. I was able to show off my creative side.
good,I really enjoyed my time in the service. Shooting weapons was just part of the job. I really enjoyed the communications role in the unit. I was there only communications representative for the entire company.
good,The co-workers are very team work oriented. The management is the best.
good,A typical day at work was making sure customers got taken care of and making sure stock got put away on the shelves. I loved working with my co-workers. We all became very close.
good,"unloading trucks, stocking shelves,and keeping store clean. It was a place where everything had to be in order for shoppers."
good,I think Dollar General is a fun place to work. And you are never bored there is always something to do. It also has excellent benefits.
good,"Decent benefits, low pay but that's expected in retail.  Overall not a bad company to work for, if not for uncovered travel issues I would've stayed."
good,I like it because it always a different variety of people on a day to day basis. Also I like the feeling of being able to help and assist others.
good,"Lots of things to keep you busy, stocking, checking out customers, helping them and training new hires,Opening and closing the store was always interesting."
good,Wonderful company to be employed by. Great opportunities and room for growth.
good,The company was wonderful but management was horrible. Their ego overcame them.
good,"I worked behind the register, which means I became very efficient with handling small and large amounts of money, counting in my head, giving correct change back to customers, and in general treating everyone with kindness and good manners. I also stocked shelves and was taught how to read the bar code number and match it with the item so that I could put everything in its appropriate place. The janitorial work I accomplished was cleaning bathrooms, tidying up my work area & whatever else asked of me in the cleaning department."
good,"Great Workplace, I really enjoyed working here. Met a lot of new people and even made some friends."
good,"I love my staff I work with, however I do not like having to clock out and wait up to an hour for my coworker to get done with her job."
good,Working at dollar general was enjoyable because of our customers and my co-workers. You learned how to deal with disagreeable customers and find ways to get them what they need/want. The hardest part of the job was to complete all task and work with the public
good,I would have loved to stay but I had a bad manager. She is gone now but I put in a notice too so I may not be able to get my job back. That is ok.....this company is not bad to work for if you come in and do your job!!
good,"I really enjoyed this position, just needed more money. I really enjoyed help people and working with my employees."
good,With in the first year of me working there I moved up twice. The company is awesome.
good,"A typical day at work I counted my till, run the register, and stocked wen i could get away from the register. There was 6 stores in the town i lived in so they sent me wherever I was needed. Management always stayed in the office unless I needed something. The hardest part of the job was on Thursday night when we did overnight stocking.  I stocked with three coworkers and we all worked together to get as much of the store stocked as we could."
good,"ran register and stocked shelves."
good,Working for dollar general was a great experience overall. They were very flexible with my schedule and the management was great!
good,The team I worked with was worked together wonderfully and really flowed.

good,Dollar General is a new store within my community where I get to meet and serve my fellow neighbors.
good,"Pleasant place to work, enjoyed helping people and coworkers"
good,"The company itself is great.  They give you everything you need to know how do your job correctly, and even have online courses and tests to make sure you understand the importance of what you are learning.  The work environment was fast-paced but also fun.  You get to meet a lot of people and help them with their purchases.  To me, the hardest part of the job was being able to finish stocking all the inventory I had to do that day, as well as ring up customers and help them find items in the store.  Sometimes customers talk more than your time will allow and it is hard to get away back to work.  The manager I had at the time was a great man, very patient, professional, and a lot of fun to work for.  Unfortunately he left the company right before I did.  My co-workers were good people, always ready to help anyone who needed it."
good,"A day at Dollar General was pretty exciting the management was really friendly so it made me even more enthusiastic about work also meeting new customers, asking about their day making them feel welcomed and at home also the co-workers was pretty friendly we were all a team. This job introduced me to customer service so being able to learn how to really give our customers a wow experience was pretty enjoyable"
good,It wasn't so bad working there. You don't have to stand at the register the entire shift. You are able to do other things within your shift there. Management was very understanding and helpful where it came to personal and work related issues.Can't thnk of any con
good,A typical Day consisted of a lot of communication with the same customers a large percent of the time. I learned how to balance drawers and do exchanges and returns as well as drop off deposits and file correct records of money transactions. My co-workers rooted for me and was proud of my accomplishment of key holder after 3 brief months! The hardest part was risking my life after bloody robbery. The most enjoyable part was making customers happy with low prices and savings!
good,"Good company, but software is out of date to meet current needs of the company."
good,I love my job and the people that I work with. Only considering a career change due to personal reasons. It is a steady work pace environment. I learned a lot when I became an assistant manager and take pride in that. There is not really any hard part of the job. What I enjoy the most is the people that I work with and the people that walk through the doors. At the end of the day most days I am happy with the way that the day went. If I helped only one person that day and made their life a little easier than my job for the day was done.
good,Better management and communication skills within employees and supervisors would have been nice.
good,"Productive days ,with learning new ways to give perfect customer service ."
good,"Overall it was an ok place to work. I enjoyed the people I worked with but did not like that I didn't get that many hours. It was not a place to work if you needed to support a family. The hours were low. I did however like the people that came through the store. It made it a funner place to work,"
good,"Loved all the customers I met, and loved my former coworkers."
good,"A typical day for me would be very busy! I didn't learn too much at this job other than typical common sense things but it was still a great place to work. Our manager was a great guy he understood lifes changes and helped you whenever possible. Two or my coworkers were friends of mines so they were very cool with me being there, the others were just as happy. The hardest part of working there was closing and having to make sure everything was presentable and almost perfect for morning shift. The most enjoyable part about working here was the employees everyone was basically on the same page and in any work environment that is definitely a plus!"
good,"I started at Dollar General when they needed so many people to set up the store on 431 in Phenix City. Only so many people would be kept to run the store. I was one of those selected and was promptly given Lead Clerk.  I worked well over forty hours, the benefits were good and I enjoyed working with my co-workers. There wasn't anything extremely tough about the job in general, once everything was learned regarding opening/closing procedures.  Most enjoyable part of the job... working with the customers and having a good time with my co-workers."
good,"I very much enjoyed  the work that I did at Dollar General, however, at this particular location management should be more concerned with employee safety and company standards."
good,"DG is a good place to get experience in running register, counting money and doing deposits. The planograms are easy to set and with a good Store Manager it's a good overall experience."

good,"I have only been with this company for a short time, I am glade to have had the experience. my true passion is healthcare and that is my over career goal."
good,Typical day at work was very hectic. Learned more patience. Management wasn't very management material. Co-workers were very helpful. Enjoyable part of the day was to interact with the customers.
good,"Typical day was doing cash or sales floor audits. Teaching, training and developing in all areas.  Reviewing the store reports with the SM.  Going over reports, weekly, monthly as well. Conference calls and delegating expectations with a follow up on all.  Calling all of the managers daily to get their game plan.    Customer Service above reproach.. has to be a major priority. Recruiting, hiring and setting up for classes/training."
good,"Long hours , when you can get them. But most of all not a bad place to work."
good,good job and hard working postion. Putting products on sales floors and unloading food and others things off truck
good,some days were good and others were not but with that said I liked the overall job. There is one exception with this job and that is working weekends.
good,"I usually counted my drawer every mornin & then put items on sidewalk for sale & opened the store for our customers. I also stocked shelves did planograms & helped my manager with anything else she needed done. I also helped customer find things in our store & helped get the to their cars if the were elderly & unable to lift items & ive swept,mopped & cleaned the whole store helped with inventory !!!"
good,Good store to work in.  Bad thing is that the store itself is in bad disrepair and that hinders the workflow.
good,The job was tedious but the key to enjoying your day is to make it enjoyable by loving what you do. I learned how to read planograms something I never knew existed. I enjoyed stocking merchandise however unloading the merchandise from delivery trucks was a bit harsh.
good,a tpical day of work is never the same some days are better than others but nothing compares to getting to serve the preople who appreciate your work
good,"As a regular employee you are in charge of many things including stocking, running register, conditioning products, and helping customers."
good,Working at Dollar General Store enabled me to hone my communication skills with all types of people. I was able to learn very much about retail/grocery while employed at Dollar General.
good,A typical day at dollar general is working hard and absolutely nothing rewarding coming of it.the management hires are not usually that good and even if they were the district managers and corporate certainly do not care about the cleanliness issues dollar general stores experience. not to mention the distrust in the employees and the lack of action against the extreme loss from theft. this job wasn't hard. this job didn't really have any perks. it payed money.
good,"Cashier, multiple customers,theft prevention.providing a pleasant work enviroment."
good,good starter job i regret not sticking with my company i could have been a great manager
good,"dollar general was a decent place to work . my typical day was kind of slow. i have learned that the higher rank management needs to learn their job better because they did alot of ""passing the buck"" on certain things."
good,"Fun Work environment, Customers where Phenomenal, Fellow employees Brought too much of their home lives to work"
good,Typical day for me would be arriving five minutes early and clocking in on time. Jumping on to my assigned tasks and alternating putting out stock and running the register. I learned to develop a lot more patience when dealing with the public. The hardest part of the job for me was trying not to get caught up in the other employees personal situations. I focused on the task at hand and delivered great customer satisfaction.
good,Serviced  many customers and assisted with needs also guided and directed them to whatever the need was.
good,"No work life balance, required to work 6 days a week, I've worked as many as 90 hours in a week."

good,"While working for Dollar General, my main tasks were to run the cash register, restock shelves, and clean the store. These three things are very basic but I was good at them. My favorite part of the job was knowing the sales before they happened so I could know to shop accordingly. The hardest part was having a schedule that changed day to day so you constantly had to call or walk-in and check it."
good,"i worked alot with the registar, money and customer service"
good,I was a Cashier and a stocker the work was easy but at times challenging. I wanted to advance but was unable to because of the limited advancement opportunities; it wasn't good for career benefits.

good,A very face paced working environment with constant change in both upper management and day to day activities.  I enjoyed the customer service part of my job especially during the holidays. The hardest part of my job was when I had to terminate an employee when they were not meeting company expectations.  For the most part I had great employees and still have several friends that I keep in contact with from there.
good,I enjoy my job but I'm looking of r a career. I need a career with more reasonable work hours. I enjoy most of my customers. They are the reason I look forward to going to work.
good,"Provided customer service, Stocked the shelves, Balanced cash drawer before and after shift, assisted other employees with inventory, and helped train new employees on cash register system."
good,"My typical day was helping customers and stocking shelves. Part of the job was also opening and closing, counting drawers at the end of the shift, and running the end of day reports.

good,Dollar General is definetly a company that is growing. They for the most part are supportive and acknowledge you for a job well done.
good,"My day was standard, same thing every day of the week, Don't worry I've learned a whole lot. just with in 3 years. My co-workers loved me. But to one manager, She love to hate me because I always get my work done. She wanted to keep me a standard part time employee, even though I wanted to be come some one bigger in the company. So the hardest thing I had to do is get another job or work at another dollar general. But to late, in her mind if she can't have me nobody can so she had to let me go. Until this day everybody misses me!"
good,"It was a job when I needed one. My first real experience working as a Assistant Manager, didn't really care for it, things could have been better."
good,"Open/Close Store. Daily Bank Deposits, cash management, customer service, inventory, stocking, supervised ."
good,I feel that dollar general can give more hours. but other then that i feel that is was a good company to work for. This company would be a great start off for some people that are just starting off in the work field.

good,"The co-workers here were also fun to be around, the hardest part of the job is carrying heavy boxes, and the most enjoyable part was talking with the customers."
good,I mostly ran the cash register and did stocking when the truck came in. I got along great with my co-workers.
good,they taught me a lot that I was able to take to my next job and made that job easier
good,"A typical day included stocking the store, some times running the register, and working with customers daily. I learned better customer service skills, the co-workers were enjoyable to be around, along with management, the hardest part was having to reorganize some shelving for items, and the most enjoyable was working with people."
good,It was not a bad place to work I just didn't have very good luck with some of the people who worked there.
good,"A typical day at work begins on the cash register, typically a lot of customers during shift change hours, then eventually slows and you can begin to recover and stock between customers. I have gotten even more experience running a register."
good,"I though the casher job would be fun, It was fun untill there was a line of customers at my register I felt lke I had to rush and that was making uncomfortable and nervous."
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar General. I had great co-workers who made the place pleasant. The customers are nice and visited frequently and I was able to know some of them on a first name basis.
good,Enjoyed coming to work and making every customer happy with their purchase.
good,"Typical day here is heavy, excessive lifting, moving merchandise on shelves,  continuously moving items from top to left and left to right; which is plannograming , I did enjoy the management and the customers here and the co workers were great and very understandable.  The hardest part or this job was the moving merchandise all the time. I did enjoy going to work on a daily basis and being able to help someone that needed guidance in the field of becoming a manager at this company one day.  Most of my days were enjoyable being able to do customer service and  the ability I had of being an honest employee  when these customers left thing behind and had to come back to the store to find it was where they left items."
good,"I am currently employed at the Dollar General as a key holder. I count down the drawers at night, I do the deposits when I close, make sure the whole store is neat clean and organized. Sometimes I open the store which I have to write the reports down from the night before make sure my cashier is doing what was assigned to them. Go to the bank."
good,"Great Management"
good,It was a lot of work making sure the store was clean and that nothing was being stolen or damaged making sure all the money was being accounted for but I really enjoyed it all the responsibility made the work day go by fast. The only downfall with Dollar General is the pay. I was in management and could never get 40 hours and I was only making just a little over minimum wage.
good,"I worked my way from just a sales associate to head cashier then to asst manager"
good,"I show up to work usually 15 minutes early. Figure out what I am doing for the day. I clock on and verify a drawer. I'm usually on the register. In-between customers I recover areas, tidy up areas, stock, help customers find items. When I'm not on the register, I'm usually doing a reset, stocking, recovering, cleaning up the back room, filing invoices, checking venders in, helping customers. I sometimes close or open the store, I handle the deposit, count tills. I help train new employees. I have learned a great amount of customer service and how to have great management skills. The hardest part of the job is a tie between receiving and working out the truck and also making sure our customers are happy and content. All together though the job is pretty enjoyable. My co-workers make my day, and so do the regular customers."
good,"The team member i worked with were very helpful, the job was very easy it was something i have alot of experience in, the managers were great, there was nothing hard about this job. Had alot of worries with customers coming in and stealing"
good,This company was a good company to work for.  They are making a name for their selves in the retail industry and off many benefits for working in small enviroments.
good,"It depends what day it was if you were going to be running around like a crazy person. I've learned great customer service, patience, cash handling, inventory skills. It also depended in what store you worked at on how good the management was. The hardest part of the job is managing the front while you cashier is on break and it only you two there that day/night. I think if the company would give the stores more payroll then half there stores wouldn't look like a cluttered mess. I started from a cashier than gradually worked up to and assistant and to be honest the pay wasn't worth what you were to get done everyday. The upkeep on a store is crucial and giving little payroll means less people working, breaks not being able to be taken, its complete stress. However I did love my employees they were awesome and always tried there hardest and I cant forget some of the customers I have met over the period I worked for Dollar General."
good,"Typical day at work is helping anyone that needed help, I learned how to close up a store up the right way, I loved working with all the co-workers and the hardest part of the job is making sure everything is good for the next day."
good,I improved my people skills here as well as improving my cashier skills. found the job to be easy and fun.
good,The typical day on the job was just me putting items on shelves very neatly. There was really nothing else that I had or was told to do. I learned what it meant to be a hard worker. The management team were a great group of people and great leaders. My co-workers were great because they helped me along every step of the way. If I needed help they came to help me. The hardest part of the job was moving heavy boxes. The funnest part of the job was working on the cash register.
good,I enjoyed working for Mosaic because my patients were a blast. I worked the overnight shift and I had to do the cleaning and cooking for the morning. It was one employee per shift because it was only four patients living in a house.
good,I work as a cashier for Dollar General. I keep the front end cleaned and stock the store shelves. I greet the customers when they come in our store.
good,Learned how to operate casher register for the first time and stocking as well.
good,"its a nice place to work if you only want part-time but is very hard to go up in the company,"
good,The company has a strong retail base of customers and is currently growing very well.
good,Good company and enhanced by skills as a commercial truck driver.
good,A typical day for me is to clock in 5-10 minutes early to give me enough of time to go put my things away an give last shift time to clock out I clock in immediately start ringing up customers in between doing recovery making sure all material on shifts is pulled to end of shelf around closing time start mopping sweeping taking out trash cleaning bathrooms until its time to clock out 
good,"A typical day of work at dollar general consisted of stocking and cashiering along with a little janitorial work as well. There would usually only be one staff member working at a time along with one manager. "

good,if you have a properly trained manager everything is great.
good,We enjoy helping customers find what they need at an affordable price.
good,"Just your basic retail job, random work schedule, and lots of repetition."
good,"A decent job for those right out of highschool. You won't be promoted quickly or climb through the ranks. It's  not terrible, but it's  not amazing or a career job."
good,"Friendly work environment, customers friendly, staff friendly. Ok hours, ok pay. Overall a good job."
good,This was my very first job and my main task was being the cashier. From time to time i would help stock the shelves and clean the restrooms.

good,Retail with 6 females and one male = DRAMA!  The retail experience was a lot of fun though.
good,A Dollar General Sales Associate has to work the register while helping customers and stocking the store. We have to make sure the store is organized and clean. 
good,"•	Provided customer service by greeting and assisting customers, and responding to customer inquiries and complaints"
good,i loves dolaar general we was a very clean store and the managers focus was getting stock out and good customer service
good,"Typical day of work is running on cash register, solve any customer problems, keep up organization."
good,Stayed busy at work whether it was from stocking to cashing people out. The management was great. Co-workers were great. The hardest part was keeping the store presentable but was maintained. I just enjoyed meeting people and making their day if I could.
good,"I think this an ok place to work at, but the hours are really long and the pay is not as great as it should be. "
good,running register customer service job very easy co-workers were easy to get along with and polite..could have had a better manager that would stay her whole shift instead of robbing the company of their time...most enjoyable part of the job was the interacting with customers which in all became repeat customers

good,"Typical day at work was fast pace and busy. Learned alot, something new everyday. Management was good. Co-workers some were good some were lazy. "
good,Starting working under more understanding Store Manager but once the store was switched over to different Store Manager the store became more strict and less understanding.
good,I worked very hard at this job. I spent alot of my day organizing and multi tasking. It was very rewarding to feel a sense of accomplishment each day
good,My coworkers are outstanding to work with. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable part: weekly merchandising change. It is always an enjoyable challenge to keep up-to-date. A typical day entails coming into work and proceeding with the previous managers' projects until the tasks are completed.
good,A typical day at work would start with my picking/packing and as the night went on there would be items put on hold and I would take it upon myself to stay late if need be to get these done. If something needed replenished I would look it up in the computer system and communicate to my material handlers what it was I needed an where I needed it and the perform a cycle count to adjust inventory. I learned more about being a team and how important communication is. Management at this place was not very good. Coworkers were mostly lazy so that is what made me want to take it upon myself to make sure the job is done and done right. Hardest part of the job was the constant lifting of heavy objects. Most enjoyable was the satisfaction I got of doing a job well done when I was the last person in the building at night.
good,"Working for Dollar General taught me to push myself beyond my known limits on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job wasn't the paperwork, banking, or the manual unloading a two thousand peice truck, but rather trying to explain to the people working for me why I couldn't offer them better wages, benefits, or hours for their hard work."
good,It is a very great place to work and I enjoy working with the customer with their every need.
good,"Great company! I would return if opportunity present itself. The most challenging thing on a day to day basis is dealing with the customers. I work really well with others, so I never have issues with co-workers."
good,My typical day is loading trucks that deliver all the products to Dollar General stores.
good,Learned a lot about working in retail and working as a team while at Dollar General. I also learned time management and how to do resets for different seasons and holidays.

good,Fast paced environment. Customer service driven. Friendly environment with opportunity for advancement.
good,"I worked here for a year, and met some good people. The company was successful in the area where I worked."
good,"A typical day at work was re-fronting the entire store, making change for the cashiers, performing voids and over rides for the cashiers, and performing returns for customers. I also had to make daily deposits and log them into the record books. We maintained a clean store by making sure the restrooms, parking lot, and the floors were cleaned at all times. I learned that no matter how much inventory is in the store, as long as it looks nice, is clean, and you have good cusomer service, the customers will be hapy and will return. I was a part of management team that had to be on their toes. We were very short staffed and did the best of our ability to keep everyone happy. Long hours and few days off. Honestly, I did not find anything about this job to be hard. I enjoyed going to work everday and staying busy. It made the work day go by much faster when there was always something to do."
good,"The store needed a lot of work, it was very unorganized. The co-workers were great to work with and even tho the store itself needed a lot of work the other employees made coming to work a blast"
good,"Work between 10-12 hours a day. My job is stocking the shelves with new arrival of merchandise. This includes foods, health and beauty, paper products, etc. I work well with my colleagues in the store. I am aware of my job and work at it conscienciously. The hardest part of job is the unloading of truck. Sweeping the floor and mopping as needed is done at the end of the work."
good,it was a steady work place.
good,"I worked different times and different days. I learned that patience takes you a long way in the work place. Employment was equally made up of males and females. The hardest thing about my job was closing the store and counting the money to make sure the registers weren't short on cash. The most enjoyable thing about my job was being able to excel in the work place quickly, from cashier to 3rd key, and meeting new people."
good,run register and check out customers is a typical day at work i havent really learned more then i already knew my coworkers are great but there are two sets of rules at my store on for my store manager who does what they want and another for the associates
good,I only worked there for about a month and my experience was okay. Nothing extraordinary!
good,This was a job that I thoroughly enjoyed. I was in charge of all store operations and I tried my best to create the best working enviornment that I possibly could .
good,I enjoy the face to face interaction with the public. I learned how to manage and use a cash register and how to stock. The co-workers were easy to work with and made the job more enjoyable. The hardest part was learning time management and how to balance all of my duties such as closing and stocking the entire front half of the store while running the cash register. The most enjoyable part of the job was the regulars that I formed a relationship and I knew I could bring a smile to their face even on the worst days.
good,A very nice place to work. The managers and workers were all very friendly. It was also in a great location.
good,"Not a bad place to work, not a career though. I enjoy working with people and I got along with the employees too."
good,"This was a small store that was well managed. Great for first time cashiers. Holiday season it got really busy. The hours were great for a part time job. Store needed to have more workers on staff. Usually there would be only one manager and one sales associate working during a shift, which got alittle during the holiday season."
good,I enjoyed working for this Co. and only left because they wanted to transfer me to south St. Pete 30mi from my home where I lived 2 blocks from my store I was working.
good,I was in charge or running a cash register and stocking the entire store. I had to unload the freight truck when it came to the store. I had to learn to get along with difficult managers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was to unload an entire freight truck by myself. I became very knowledgeable about everything in the store and was often asked questions by the new manager how to do tasks.
good,"I would run cashier, restock, sweep and mop."
good,"My overall experience with Dollar General was exciting, new and lot's of learning."
good,"I open and or close the store, count deposit etc... over all the job was easy and I realy enjoy this line of work."
good,"A typical day at work is productive, fun, with very little supervison"
good,"Oversee cashiers, balance cashiers' drawers, face and recover the store, greet customers, cash out customers, prepare the deposit at the end of the night, do end of night paperwork, stock shelves, assist customers with finding products, open and close the store. I've learned a lot at this job. I've learned everything that it takes to be in charge and everything that comes with it. My co-workers are very friendly and really fun to work with. They make it a very enjoyable place to work. The hardest part of the job is to get everything done that needs to be done."
good,"My job consists of keeping track of inventory, whats being bought, what comes in by vendors and company trucks. I also do my best to keep the customers happy. That may deal with product location, prices and adjustments, and overall customer service. I help my cashiers with sales, inquiries, and general customer questions. By the time I leave I have to file vendor invoices, make sure the next shift is on and ready for their daily duties, and have a summary of what was completed on my shift."
good,Open Store
good,Learned how to work at a fast pace.
good,"This job was a typically easy job. I got along with my co-workers and managers easily. They maintaned a comfortable, fun and energetic workplace."
good,"This store is a good place to work. It's a hometown kind of store, so you deal with many of the same people on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day at Dollar general was always an experience because i would learn something different every day.I learned how to run a register, I also learned how to read sku numbers,and i learned how to deal with all kinds of customers.Managment was good overall.The co-workers were great even though a couple of them had one task to do every week.The hardest part about the job was keeping track of all the money and making sure you don't give to much or not enough back.The most enjoyable part about the job was just dealing with the customers and making their day."
good,customer service is the biggest part of my job and of course making the store look clean
good,Great place to grow your career. Tough work environment though.
good,Very fun place to work. Laid back environment! Perfect job for a college student looking to earn some extra cash!!!
good,"Endless days of taking down/putting up displays, re-mapping store floor, etc."
good,"In order to get the things done with the labor budget I was given ,I worked about 65-75 hrs a week"
good,"A typical day consist of direct contact with customers, rotating and facing shelves so the products are shoppable for our customers and stocking shelves. What I've learned from my time there is that a store like this is ever changing, meaning there are changes made everyday that those who work within the store have no control over...you just have to learn to go with the flow of the day. The hardest part of the job is trying to get your daily tasks done or getting stock up and trying to keep your third eye on the rest of the store. The best part of the job is the customers. You can help one person and make them smile...which in turn keeps that customer and others coming back to the store."
good,great place to work no long shifts fun place to meet people managers are very friendly
good,"I have clerical duties I am responsible for such as checking emails,store net info,print new labels upon computer notification,set planograms often, cash handling, check-in vendors, complete/print invoices,work freight, assist customers,& all other duties as needed or instructed by store manger. I have learned basically all the things I have listed. I am a hardworker. I work very well with my team. I enjoy my job & work hard to manage a good store image."
good,Working at this company was very inadaquate because while i was there the manager did very poor at her duties. the people there was alot of fun. Fast pase experience is an indeed there.
good,pretty easy job gives you good cutomer service experience (if you need that). there is an oppertunity to move up higher in the company if desired! no benifits though.
good,My typical day at Dollar General was fun motivating and definitely full of the unexpected. Overall my customers made me feel like family as did my fellow employees.
good,This place is fun to work at. The work was physically demanding and often I didn't finish all the work there was.
good,They are hardworking people. The managers go out of their way to try to help out all their employees.
good,I liked working at Dollar General. The hours was really good for me. It worked well around the schedule of my children.
good,"I havae learned patience,adaptability,versatility. There really was nothing hard about this job. I enjoyed interacting with the customers on a daily bases."
good,I learned to always put your best foot forward and to be a leader
good,I really liked working here because my boss was awsome and I was only there for 2 weeks before I became assistant manager.
good,This was a very fast paced position which I enjoyed although the pay was not good.
good,I didnt care for the standing there for hours at the register. I like to be moving around more. I didnt mind the overall experiance. Work wasnt a chore to me when i worked there.
good,Wonderful customers and I loved working with everybody. Pretty set schedule. I loved how they worked with my schedule while I was in college.
good,A typical day at Dollar General is helping customers & putting out stock.
good,Worked as a cashier with the same coworkers everyday. Cleaned and replenished stock about everyday.
good,"Managed a reatil store. The hardest part of the job was doing what you were taught, but the District and Reginal Manager would come in and tell you that was not the way to do it. Overall, Ilove working reatil."
good,"Before this job I have never done this kind of work. The manger is a wonderful person. The employees at this Dollar Store, work as a team. I am a firm believer the employees makes a job better place to work. I have to say there is nothing hard about the job."
good,A typical day at was providing good customer service and making sure the customers were happy. I learned in this you can't make everyone happy but it don't hurt to try. The manager is a very down to earth person. That made coming to work easy . The hardest part of the job is dealing with different personalities
good,"I waited on people and assisted them to meet their needs,unloaded truck on truck days,stocked items on shelves,kept store clean and appropriate."
good,A typical day at work would be busy and enjoyable to know that you can help customers and put a smile on their face. While employed there I learned that team work is very important in order to succeed in any type of busisness. My co-workers loved the fact that I was a caring person and was willing to work with anyone who showed that they were putting in as much effort as me. The hardest part of the job in the beginning was trying to juggle more than one task at a time but as time went by it beecame a breeze. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and being able to satisfy them and meet their everyday needs.
good,i enjoyed my coworkers and the daily customers that always brought us smiles.
good,You was always doing something. The customers was nice. Co-worker are great as well.
good,great co-workers
good,I enjoy working here. I love the fact that them manager has been flexible with my needs.
good,"working for dollar general was a fun experience for me.the fact that i have a excellent skills in communication helped with communicating with customers when there is a problem or just need info.as far as management and my co-workers are concern i got along with them all,i was always willing to help out my co-workers when needed and my managers was pleased with my work.the most fun i had at work is knowing that i was able to help someone out when needed and my managers and customers was happy at the end of the day."
good,Our days were very busy. Constantly receiving new products and rearangeing existing ones. I learned how to get along with all personalities as a manager for I had to spend much of my time with both employees and the public.
good,Enjoy working with all my co-workers and being able to help customers with their needs. I've learned how to use a register. This job has built my confidence up and have improved my skill with people.
good,I was a cashier at this store. It was always neat and clean. The co-workers are great. I was only here a month.
good,Working at Dollar General there is always many things throughout the store to occupy your time while working.
good,"I worked part-time at a Dollar General Store. My co-workers were fun and friendly. However, I felt a definite lack of work hours."
good,"Count the register, change fund and make deposits, check in vendors, receive trucks and put stock out on the floor, set planograms, run registers and complete refunds and voids while keeping a log of them.  Checking out customers and assist customers in their needs."
good,Working there was good. There was certain times i needed help and couldnt find another worker to assist me. When you dont have full access to the drawers you need a higher up to stay close just incase they are needed
good,Just in on a regular day at work I would run the register by myself & stock at the same time which with that being said I learned how to multi task . It wasn’t always easy when it would be only me.
good,"It’s a alright company, just have to watch out when people call out or quit. Working for the company wasn’t hard. You’d just have to be motivated to do what is needed."
good,"Most are good mines still catching up but not much gain just cleaner. But still cleaning up to do,friendly customers,work is not hard just have to do it."
good,The store I worked at was clean and everything organized. Seemed like every store I went to was dinghy and not bright. They were cluttered or floors were dirty. My store the coworkers were good to work with not a bad place to work.
good,This job is a great job but you don't seem to get the hours that was told you would get when hired. I love my job but can't seem to get enough hours or support from management.
good,"They don’t pay you enough they have favoritism and I wasn’t getting enough hours. Besides all of that it was good very, nice people, when I first got there I was lost but I started getting the hang of it."
good,Very wiling to work around schedule and understanding of everyday life outside of work and wants you to succeed while at work. Always going above and beyond to help the employees
good,"Working here was decent. I enjoyed the team I worked with however the company expectations are much higher then what is actually manageable. The only way to complete all the work they insisted on getting done is if the Store Manager (salaried) stays and works more than 60 hours a week. Otherwise, it was fun and most customers are regulars therefore you gain a good relationship with them."
good,I enjoyed my time at Dollar General. I liked the people I worked with and I really enjoyed helping our customers to find everything they needed. I would recommend this job.
good,"Cashier "
good,I loved working for dollar general. The employees and the management there made my shifts go by fast and without incident. I would work for them again if given the chance.
good,"Work load was often times troublesome, not enough staff on duty, lots of sketchy people coming in and out of the store. Overall though, it was not too bad, manager was super helpful and friendly, co-workers were great. etc."
good,Providing customer service was fairly decent. Customer were respectful when treated nicely. Management worked with you on your schedule. Time management was key to the shift.
good,"A typical work day consists of being patient, yet fast service is necessary for operations. Often feels overwhelming at first, and it is a good starting point, to move on to something greater."
good,"It's the average job to have ,the best part I liked was my customers, the worst thing I didn't like was customers having to wait in line so long ,due to one cashier."
good,Very good places to work staff is friendly and the bosses show understanding hours are flexible competitive wages and always room for growth. A all around great experience
good,"My typical day at work would be to clock in work the register, stock, and make sure that the floor is at it's neatest. I also helped customers whenever they need assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my customers satisfied after their done shopping."
good,"I've worked for this company for a little over two years. I started out as a cashier and worked my way up. Its taught me a lot, and I've learned many skills."
good,"It’s very fast paced. You are required to put up stock every week, run register and give excellent customer service. Company is opened all holidays all day except Christmas.The benefits are good and you get paid weekly."
good,With good management it’s a fun and Great job! DG is very fluid! Meaning high turnover which I not Like! You get a good crew then they are Gone! But overall good Company!
good,"Low staff most of the time. Definitely a great weekly pay, and if you have good managers then you will love working here but if you don't then you quickly realize that this company cares more about money being made then we'll bring it their employees but overall I loved it and loved being manager!!"
good,"Dollar General is a good place to work. You can advance. They offer benefits, but they aren't cheap. They are good about giving you hours, you just can't get overtime."
good,A very good company to work for. Do your job and you will have advancement opportunities come your way. Benefits are better than I expected. Management has high expectations.
good,"First they always need help. So getting hired is no problem."
good,"If you were not the general or lead manager you will not be receiving any hours, but you will be responsible for all the work that doesn’t get done. Isn’t fair"
good,Fun place to work if you have a desent crew to work with. Its face pace and can get over whelming. Not much work to family life balance. Long hours pay rates  and employees make it worth. Lots of room for growth with in the company.
good,This Was My First Actually Job Where I Was Doing Customer Service All Day Everyday Worked With Alot Of Money Talked To Alot Of People I Loved The Job Alot
good,Its an ok job have a good chance of advancing work is tough but manageable. Great customer service helps a lot schedule is subject to change at anytime
good,Job was good just had problem with manager and her friend allowing her friends to do things she fired others for and wanting us to accommodate her friends needs and wants
good,"Management at this store is top-tier, fair and reasonable. "
good,Once in a while there was a few times where my manager was not very professional at all. She liked to bring her personal life in to work. Would make bad decisions on her management part.
good,I worked part time at this company and I wasn’t receiving the minimum amount of part time hours so I wouldn’t get enough in a paycheck and I would only make about $70-$100 each week.
good,"Job was decent for entry level pay.  Not much training, and not a great system for associates to resolve customer issues quickly without management.  Only part time for first several months."
good,"Good place to work, just hard on the body as a whole. You have to lift heavy stuff all day, after you start to wear down you lose time on your red prairie system."
good,"I really loved working at Dollar General. The management system was excellent, and working with different customers was a really great experience. It's a great company to work for."
good,"Nice atmosphere with a good work environment. Good manager and great customers. Flexible with schedules. Wish they would give more hours than 12 a week. Hard to make ends meet, even with being paid a dollar over minimum wage."
good,"My coworkers are a delight to work with most days, we don't always see eye to eye. Most of the customers are wonderful, although there are some that are a nightmare. We get compliments from the customers about how our store is one of the nicest and cleanest stores that they have been in. There isn't really a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part about the job to me is helping the customers if they need something or to get something down or if they can't find what they are looking for. I learned that this job isn't really difficult but sometimes you do have to hold your tongue because you will have some customers that know how to push your buttons."
good,Learned allot of things on how to run a store. Learned how to deal with thieves and handle situations with irritated customers and medical emergencies. Down side was mostly management was apathetic. Couldnt keep workers so ended up working lots of double shifts.
good,"It is an enjoyable but tedious job. Not too stressful but not too relaxed either. I liked my job but the customers could be very rude at times. Understaffed at times so would get a lot of hours, better pay check."
good,"My only problem was the store manager during that time asked me if wanted an assistant manager position, I said yes then about 2 days later she brought in someone else for the job. after that I put in my 2 weeks notice because my hours got dropped drastically."
good,Dollar General is a pretty steady running job. There is always something that can be done. Giving the best customer service you can makes yours and the customers experience run smoothly.
good,"Dollar General was a good place to work, but over time I began having conflicts. This included Pay, Work, Schedules, and other on the job experiences."
good,"We have a great team in place. Hardworking and friendly employees. Come and get a warm welcome, if you need help ask anyone of us we can show you or bring it to you."
good,I had a couple of questions about the assistant managers treatment of myself as a newbie but I brought it to the district managers attention and it was discussed and then remedied.
good,Everything was always on task and getting the job done as team worked together we never left the store without getting our job done because we wanted to keep good work and no complaints
good,Dollar general is a great job for starters. It is very easy to move up as long as you put in the effort to prove yourself! I was in the middle of training for store manager when some personal issues came up. I am currently having to find another position that is available for my schedule.
good,"Checking out my customers, greeting them with a smile. Having them tell me how sweet I am and friendly. Helping customers is one of my best things I enjoy."
good,I loved my job but the pay was not worth the work load. I watched them hire Male managers with no experience at all with a way hire pay rate then applicants who had 6 years or more experience in managment.
good,They’re we’re downfalls and good things to say about working there. Good thing is you were never sitting still because there was always something to do and you met new people everyday. Downfall was standing a lot sometimes in one place
good,"The manager is really nice and easy to get along with, and my hours are okay. This job is basically for high school/college students and older people."
good,The pay leaves something to be desired but overall loved working there.work life balance was amazing. I loved having the freedom to work around my schedule.
good,Assist manager didn't just sit in office and let everyone else do all the work.  She was organized and would explain what was expected and needed to be done.  Very understanding.  The manager called and left a message on my day off cause I wouldn't come in telling me that if I didn't turn my keys in that day she was calling the law.  It wasn't even my day to work.  But it's all good cause I had to take care of my grandkids anyways.
good,Don’t get me wrong I love working at my location for Dollar General but there are some downfalls about working here that I’ve noticed over the course of 2 years.
good,I had a horrible manager she favored certain employees over others and was hostile to other employees. Not management material at all very unprofessional.
good,"Great company to work for but Manager has no idea what she is doing. She moves incredibly slow, store loses customers when she’s on register, schedule never done right or on time."
good,The only issue with Dollar General is the amount of pay you receive for the amount of work you do...  I enjoyed working there. But they don't want to pay overtime. Not enough pay for the work you do.....
good,It's a place to start out. There not enough hours in a week. Hours has to be flexible in order to get time in. It'e good for a young person in school and just getting out.
good,"Pretty pleasant working environment, always something to do, can be mentally and physically straining, in-store training, sufficient management, high turnover rate, sometimes understaffed, possibility for advancement."
good,Low paying job per hour. Got lots of hours as far as scheduling. And the manager was nice. Likeable place to work but pay scale is low as far as hourly but a plus is weekly check.
good,"I very much enjoyed my experience working for Dollar General. The management was great, and i also enjoyed my face to face customer interactions daily. The only downfall of this job was the shortage of hours as a full time associate/ key holder."
good,I enjoyed working here and the company is very good to work for. Wish the pay was more but you can work your way up fast with good work ethic. Wish I wouldn't have had to leave so soon when I did! Was a comfortable job.to have.
good,This place will teach you all about retail if you havent had a chance to work in that field. Stocking is consistent but if you fall behind you can cause the store to function poorly. Wasnt a hard job at all
good,It was a some what fast past job and had to pull rolltainers around the seals area and stalk the shelfs and cleaning up messes on the floor too and ha do clean bathrooms.
good,Pretty good job wish they had better benefits and work with you loved my job just need to work more than just two employees but pretty good other than that
good,"It’s a ok job, you going to work for the money but if u put your mind into it you can do it. The hardest thing bout the job is you have to pick all night because your in production and you can get fired if your production is not what they requir, which is 100 percent."
good,"It was difficult at first without training but I learned quickly. Hours were indecisive for all co-workers which made things complicated. All in all, it was an alright job and I enjoyed working there besides the confusing management system."
good,they were asking for me every day I went in to buy something for me to work for them. I'm a very hard worker and dedicated to what the job requires. I am a hard and fast learner show me once and its done and they were informed of my work ethic by a employee that works there that worked with me.
good,Its a great first job for young people or for someone who is single but I wouldn't suggest this job for someone with a family. Its a pretty fast paced work place and organization is key.
good,"Love working for DG just hard to find good help that's available and shows up to work on time.  The pay is good for store managers, assistants, and lead sales associates. Really enjoy my job, as long as everyone shows up and does their part. It's hard work and you will earn your pay."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General would depend on if its the first of month, very busy. Typical day we had vendors come in, we had to check them and make sure everything was correct. Counting registers daily and making deposits, check emails, timely manner to put up sales stickers or signs, receive truck, unload truck and put up stock, take care of complaints or any returns.We had a conference call every week that we had to attend. The hardest part was trying to get stock out on floor and make room for other inventory. Rewarding part was I learned a lot from a managers position."
good,"Great company has lots of advancement opportunity for those who wants to grow and excel in life, dollar general is a great place and they provide their employees the essentials."
good,"Asks employees to work some off the clock., but training and interviewing was easy. Management before needed to work on customer service manager now has excellent customer service"
good,"Small town, slow store. Nothing too exciting ever happens. Management is great and usually supportive. Pay is very low compared to other employers. Wouldn’t go back."
good,"Dollar General has great management and friendly employees, they tend to customers as fast as possible and they greet you with a smile ""hi"" and a ""how are you?"""
good,"I loved working there, it was totally different than anything I had done in recent years,  After retiring I wanted to do something more physical.   I enjoyed meeting the customers, It was really hard work very labor intensive.  but I enjoyed it."
good,I liked this job because it was challenging and there was always something to do . The locations of the Dollar Generals ensures that there will always be a steady flow of customers. There's never a dull moment.
good,"This is a good job, easy work days. You organize, clean up and get to talk to people all day. If that is what you enjoy, you will like working at DG.."
good,Its really about what you make it. At my particular store we were understaffed so my situation may be different from yours but its a very mellow and chill job as a cashier or as a stocker.
good,Dollar General can be a good place to work at i just feel that it takes a long time to move up there and what u have to do is over the top for a mother with kids.
good,"Dollar general was a very chill workplace. The only time of the day that it usually got busy was after work hours when people usually get off. Other than that, it was stocking or running a register."
good,It was a great job but it is stressful I was happy working there but now I’m just wanting a deferent job to we’re I can get weekends off and spend time with my family.
good,I enjoyed working there while I did. Things were a little weird because of the constant switch up in the managerial department. Retail is way different from fast food so that took some adjusting to.
good,"Opened or closed store according to policy, supervised employees, maintain drawers/safe, recover/stock merchandise.Hardest part of job measuring up to management."
good,It’s a ok job to have to keep some kind of money in your pocket but not a lot . Do a lot of stocking and cleaning and have to learn quickly and remember keys and buttons
good,Overall good company to work for only down fall is if you get hurt they act differently toward you. Good people as long as you do you job and are there everyday.  You just don't want to get hurt because then they try to male it look like its your fault even if its not. Other than that its a good place to be.
good,The hardest part of my job at Dollar General was the pace. You had to go from checking someone out straight to straightening up the shelves and aisles. Along with restocking also if you were slow you got in trouble for not doing your job. Also the lack of works there were only two and one worked in the back and the other up front with the register. So one had to cover half of the store.
good,The work to life balance just isn't there. Do not sign a contract unless you know what you have agreed to with your District Manager is in writing and make sure that you have a copy.
good,The job was good for the place I lived. You work long hours and have many responsibilities.  The customers are the best part of the job.  I made many friends through this job.
good,"I wish I could have been given the opportunity to be more of use by utilizing my qualities.  Most days I'm cheerful and happy, even when I'm not people could hardly tell.  I like organization, my store needed improvements.  I don't like when money could be prevented from being lost.  There are a couple of issues at my store causing the loss of money."
good,"Stress free work environment, all breaks and lunches were given on time. Hours worked per week were very limited, Usually consisted of four or five- four hour shifts per week."
good,As I was pregnant I got demoted due to the fact I couldn't keep up. Was told my pay would stay the same it was just for the fact I was going to be out on leave. Well turn out it dropped and I had yo come back from leave early because I was bot paid on time for maternity leave. Honestly up until being pregnant I loved my job and would have done anything for it.
good,I lurned to stock shelves. The hardest part is lifting heavy stuff they had a great manager. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people. I needed more hours so I left
good,"Dollar General is a good business that teaches you valuable work experiences, especially if it is your first job. However, it isn't the best for a permanent career. If one is looking to move up at a later time and to make great salaries, then Dollar General is not the job for you."
good,Store  is always nice to shop in for mostly whatever you looking for. And prices are almost always welcomed to spend on. The store is becoming a favorite spot.
good,"Work days go by pretty quick, good employees with great personalities i get a good break mid shift and enjoy helping customers. Tight shelves make it tricky to stock but i manage just fine."
good,I had an amazing time working at dollar general i knew all the staff that worked there and got along great with all of them. There was always something to do.
good,"This is a good job if you need the work experience however, it doesn't allow much growth or advancement making it perfect for an older employee without the need to move up in the company."
good,"I really enjoyed working at dollar general. However, it was just a good part-time job. They didn't offer much in promotions or raises and don't pay you a living wage."
good,What I've Learn was handling a team and the handling the most angriest of client. The hardest part was the terminals since I feel that their our of date and looks like its running on windows one since the reboot takes minutes to reload and always freezing with result in longer wait time for customers. Enjoyable part was the management and the people you work with since there all kind and polite.
good,"This fast-paced working environment has the options of possible career advancement and an easy to learn computer system, that helps to ensure quality customer service."
good,"Must be a hard worker on your feet all day Dealing with customers all "
good,"I really enjoy working there, the only complaint I have is that Sales Associate's only receive very few hours. I love to keep busy and there are always things to do."
good,Great company to work for but they over work their staff and they are under paid. I grew within the company very quickly over a years time. I enjoyed working with customers and in the retail and dollar general gave me that chance.
good,"As a store manager you make good money. As a cashier or lesd cashier they start your pay in way too low for the smount of work youre required to do.  They should really bump up their pay. I was promoted quickly up to a store manager and lo ed it for awhile. When it came time to give employees writeups for not doing their job, i was told i wasnt a loud to. Regional manager was not nice at all. Constantly changing policies. As a store manager you were on call 24/7. And other store would call my personal cell for help as well. The job itself snd the customers were great, the company was ehhh and so were the employees. Turn over rate is super high. It was hard to keep employees because of their pay. Somedays youre alone and have to stock shelves, that made it hard to focus on the customers.  Lots of walking all of the time and stocking so be prepared for leg or back pain of some sort. I had the expensive insurance and when i went to the doctor or dentist it still didnt pay for most of it"
good,Most days were very busy. I did not like when i had to close ll the the time which meant i spent most of days at work. Great environment for the most part.
good,There are plenty of opportunities to advance. I received multiple raises and promotions within the short time I worked there. Breaks are guaranteed on long shifts.
good,"I liked working at Dollar General, however found it difficult when new management came in to replace old management. Would apply and working again in another Dollar General with decent management."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say, helping customers with their needs and working with the employees. They have a 401k plan, health benefits, etc.. Depending on the management, you could get someone that cares about their job and makes it a better work place or get a manager that doesn't care and don't do what they are suppose to and so that would make it a stressful work environment."
good,Company is ok to work for but there raises aren't that great and there insurance is not that great I can barely afford to use it I have no issues in the 12 years I worked there
good,This was a grate job it had its ups and downs but all together I give Georgia a thumbs up she is a hard a** but she is fair. The job is not hard ether. I would recommend this job to people who don't mind working at a slow and fast pace all at the same time.
good,"I like working here .just want a better job.a typical day consist of me greeting customer, assisting them finding products and checking them out and providing good customer service"
good,all in all its a good place to work not for a career unless you are a manager its better as a starter job for high school kids. no benefits no discounts weird hours no vacation or paid leave unless you are a manager
good,"A typical word day starts off with paperwork and making sure all task from the previous day were done. I make sure all money is counted and correct. Great customer service is provided on a daily basis. We work by the 7 day workflow so it depends on the day of the week what we are to complete that day. A healthy partnership with our daily vendors are also very important. It does not matter if I am working freight, running the register or fixing endcaps, I do it to the best of my ability. The day always ends with communication to the next shift that's coming in to complete their daily task."
good,Great manager and coworkers. Flexible scheduling. Room for advancement. Not enough hours to divvy amongst employees in comparison to the amount of work that needs to be done
good,"Cashier"
good,came in greeting everyone counted my money drawer and begin the day. learned how to deal with customers. management was ok no remarks one way or the other. all the employes were really nice.the hardest part of the job was the saturday sales rush. most enjoyable parts was meeting new people.
good,"Not all great but no all bad either "
good,"It leaves a little to be desired, but not a bad place to work. They just need better communication with area managers and store managers. and really the hours need improvement."
good,Friendly lots of work and plenty of customers. Need more hrs tho. Not enough hrs to spread across the board. Working on getting full time hrs. I pick up hrs where I can
good,"I was hired in sales associate available all week but only scheduled friday,saturday,sundays.  My hours were cut as another employee with less experience took over as they got the assistant manager out  by harrassing her unnessesarily. They kept cutting my hours after this assistant manager got fired and began pushing me out also and eventually the general manager."
good,"I liked working at Dollar General. The place was so much fun, at times. They change management positions too much.I would love to go back and work for Dollar General, but at a different location."
good,"I would have loved to have stayed with this company, but I did make a rush decision when I left due to uncontrollable issues with the district manager I was reporting to, and if I had now the this person would have parted ways with dollar general I would have tried harder to stay. I truly wish I had another chance with dg and would suggest working there to family and friends."
good,Everything about this company is great management sucks year by year it gets worst. Dollar General just isn’t what they say they are anymore and plenty can agree.
good,Needs to keep store organized .It was a ok job at the time hours were decent. I just had transportation issue at that point of time. But overall it was a good job.
good,"made sure that everything was stocked well, and the floors were cleaned. We also helped customers at the register in between stocking goods. Two people often worked."
good,"Great assistant manager. Store manager lazy. Over all fun place to work. 8 hour a week minimum. I could of used more work hours l, and an earlier opportunity for advancement"
good,Dollar General is a great work envvironment. The emplyees are great. They are very flexiable with their hours. Its a slow steady work place. The pay is okay its minimum wage which differs in every state.
good,A typical day at the Dollar General is serving customers with respect and giving your assistance when needed. I find working at the DG comfortable and fun. I am a people person and I enjoy helping others and meeting new friends.
good,"I enjoyed my time with this company. The compensation is great for the area. As long as you do your job effectively and come to work, you will advance with in Dollar General."
good,"The work I did was through Facility Solutions, we were contracted by Dollar General, I didn't work directly for Dollar General. The company provided cleaning services to Dollar General and the work was present and the environment was wonderful"
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is fast paced but relaxed, there is not much to stress about, customers come first and management is typically pretty good."
good,I moved around store to store and some managers were good. my home store management was the best. Shawn and our DM brad always went above and beyond to meet ANY employees needs.
good,Dollar General was an easy first job. It is great for customer interaction and a job that keeps you busy throughout your work day. Management is great also and there are plenty of opportunities to move forward within the company.
good,It's a good place to work the benefits of good paid vacations and management his place of work is not for people who don't want to work fast paced or don't like to be productive
good,I love working at dollar general. The costumers are great. My coworkers are wounderful to work with. The job is fun and different and very fast pace there’s always lots to do. Your never sitting still.
good,"I love working for dollar general, it's very easy going, and most of the customers are amazing. Easy to learn and I advanced pretty quickly in my store."
good,"If you are not a self starter or like hard work, this is not the company for you. You need a high work ethic to work for this company to advance. A lot is asked of you. Management only gets one day off a week."
good,The typical work day was a little hectic at times. I learned a lot about the company and how things ran. The management was great but keeping enough staff for a shift was the harder part. The work culture was very divers. The hardest part of the job was unloading and lifting heavy boxes and trying to keep customers happy while waiting in a very long line. The most enjoyable part was working with great coworkers and growing with the company.
good,I enjoyed working at the Dollar General but I just could not pay the bills making minimum wage.  I would recommend this job for someone in high school or college.
good,"Typical day would open the store and stock merchandise between checking out customers"
good,Over all I enjoyed my ecperiance there.  My manager worked with and trained me to do new things. I would also help out in other stores so i was able to get different experience at different paced stores.
good,My Store Manager was excellent and was always willing to help and train you in the best way she could so that you can do your job the best way that you can. I loved being a 3rd key manager and making sure that my customers were happy when they left and want to come back.
good,You had low pay for the amount of work you were doing people were arrested out all the time it seemed like for the work they were putting in. An no appreciation for what you have done
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, my customers are what made my job worth while. There were many regulars that came in and many new faces, it was a great place to meet new people."
good,"I enjoyed my stay at Dollar General. I would still be employed at the location but it was struck down by a tornado which caused me to be unemployed. They offered to move me to a different location, but I had no means of transportation."
good,"I learned how to supervise and manage my employees. I also learned about making schedule."
good,"The management was easy to work for and I enjoyed helping customers and what I did. Pretty laid back but steady paced. I was not giving enough hours to work, needed more to provide for my family, then I relocated."
good,"It was interesting to work there at Dollar General, but the cashier and stocking job definitely needs 'extreme improvement' for darn sure. What do I mean by improvement? i mean, they need to balance out the amount of stores if some stores have less budget to work with than their past years, easy and simple solution, close the newer stores down and fire those within those store and spread the money around to the stores that need the money, and have separate positions in all stores, 1. Cashier. 2. Stocker/Facer. 3. Lead Cashier. 4. Assistant Manager. 5. Store Manager."
good,I enjoyed my time that I worked there. It was a very relaxed work place and my co-workers were great to work with. I worked nights to unload the trucks and days to stock the store.
good,"If you have co-workers that like to joke around and still get everything done, it makes work more enjoyable for sure. One of the perks of having a team that clicks."
good,The team I work with is great and the job itself is easy. It is very fast paced and can be quite stressful sometimes. As a key holder you have to work at the store by yourself and it gets nerve racking when there is a rush because you are the only one there.
good,As an assistant manager days were stressful at times dealing with the staff that really didn't want to work and were unhappy with the hours and the pay. I enjoyed the company and working with the customers.
good,"store appropriated hours are always changing so schedule is often different week to week. work load is far greater than hours allotted and are always asking to cut hours impacting stores, especially during holidays."
good,"The days are long, only 1 day a week off, and managers are given little to no recognition for the job they do. You stay behind because there is little to no hours for all the duties that need to be done."
good,"enjoyed my time working  at dollar general , great co workers, fast pace and keeping up with the daily job of restocking and helping when needed. Always ready to help customers ."
good,"Run the register, stock shelves, help customers, do paperwork and close the store. Learned how to manage a store and trained new employees. Management wanted me to work alot of extra hours. Very friendly environment. Hardest part of the job was being short staffed. The most enjoyable part was the employees that i got to work with."
good,"Overall, working at Dollar General was enjoyable. The management listened to your requests and tried to accommodate you the best they could. Sometimes it was stressful but face paced. The pay was only minimum wage and didn't really exceed what we did. We did customer service, cleaning, stocking and overall store upkeep."
good,A typical day at Dollar General is 6- 8 hours a day and it is fast paced. I really like my job but they are really strict when it comes to smoke breaks.
good,It's very important that you do ur job and correctly if u don't then whoever is on next shift is responsible to fix it along with all there duties too. Needs better team work .
good,working as a manger was a learning for me in I love working with people in getting the job done good learning for for me with dealing with the world in general
good,Must have great customer service . Be able to handle stressful situations. Work schedule can be flexible at times but you will work a lot of hours! Must be willing to learn new things daily.
good,A good place to work but you can deal with extremely arrogant people on a daily basis. I enjoy my job at dollar general but they also expect a lot out of you and it can be difficult at times.
good,"Overall a good place to work.  The job itself is not hard, but it's not for someone who just wants to clock in and collect a paycheck.  Stores are open 7 days a week and only closed on Christmas Day.  This makes it difficult for employees to spend holidays with their families.  Work/life balance is constantly pushed by upper management, but store managers do not receive the same consideration, as they are expected to make up approximately 60%-70% of the weekly labor budget by working 55+ hours per week.  This might be ok for someone who doesn't have children or even a life outside of work.  My personal experience with my DM has been good overall.  I feel very comfortable talking to him about anything and he is very supportive, within the confines of his position."
good,"Fast paced, rapid change, growth and challenging.  Long days and weeks at times but rewarding.  Get to help other succeed in role and drive positive customer and employee experience."
good,Fast-paced good pay Long hours paid holidays frequent catered holidays/functions such as Mother’s Day Father’s Day major holidays Quarterly bonuses corporate meetings to inform employees of changes chances to advance cross train is a definite multi job functions is definitely available
good,Love my store n all my customers. You will stay busy working for them there's always room to grow and if you are assertive and do your job well you do get recognized
good,"Cleaned how to handle money"
good,"workplace culture was like a second family, the customers made the day go by fast and they make the day enjoyable. The work policy enforcement could be more consistent"
good,Getting to know the regular customers was a plus. Management was easy to contact and open to suggestions. Crew was great and eager to make the store performance successful. Hardest part of the job was making the schedule acceptable to all the employees.
good,"No breaks given for 8 hr shift, only 2 people per shift hard to stock and be effective helping customers in a timely manner. Schedule not given in time."
good,"There is always work to be done around the store. If you have a good reliable team then it's nothing. You want a dedicated team you gel with. When that happens then work becomes much easier to do because you'll actually work together to get work done. "
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but the pay was low and the job itself was boring. "
good,"The company offers fair compensation for your time and abilities. The manager I worked for was professional, polite and worked well with her staff. Training is provided and there is always room to advance."
good,the job was stressful every day. The stockroom was a mess and Corporate didn't care we were doing good in sales and could use help getting the product out on the floors. Our staff along with our manager struggled every day to get stuff done only to fall behind when another delivery came.
good,Quit due to ridiculous micromanagement by District Manager. Unsafe ...got held up and robbed. Blamed employees for high shrink in store when customers would just walk right out the door with cartfuls of merchandise and fill up huge tote bags with items
good,The manager made it worth staying because he was just a good manager despite everything else. I was able to go around my school schedule and able to make 40 hours a week. Higher management just seem unfocused on the good and search for the absolute worse in every employee.
good,This job was fun and kept you busy. I enjoyed working with the customers and stocking shelves. There was opportunities for advancement. And the hours were flexible.
good,Dollar General has provided me with many things that have overall improved me as a employee as well as a person. i was able to meet many of great people and create lifelong friendships
good,"A typical day at work for dollar general would be like this, me waking up at 11 am in the morning almost everyday. Getting up out of bed putting on work clothes and shoes. Walking out the door and jumping into the car where my mom mostly has been the one to take me into work some days."
good,"I was a cashier. When there wasn't customer, I would organize chip bags or anything that around me. I have to keep an eyes on customers and must be friendly with customers. I learned how to managed customer mood and behavior. It wasn't easy. Before the store close, I have to clean the window, and mop the floor."
good,"I loved greeting the customers, working with my manager in order to get our job done.  The setting was great and I enjoyed everything about it.  I got to manage and handle money, count deposits, and learned how to properly shut down the store.  I learned how to solve problems on my own and provide great customer service."
good,I love Dollar General. There are things that the company should do better far as employees go. I love my manager and employees with an except of like one. My manager listened and compromise and gives people chances and opportunity.
good,"I Liked my job and loved my customers, but there was extremely high turnover and I grew frustrated with fellow workers who did not share the same high level of work ethic as I did."
good,Great place to work with an up and coming company. They have two different style stores. Ones like a regular grocery store and the other is more like a convenience store.
good,"As a store manger that is paid on a salary basis, the job is enjoyable, but can be very demanding and stressful at the same time. It has it's pros and cons. I ran my own store and take very much pride in it as I deal with the public. I treat it as my own home, because I'm usually there if not at home. The company demands based on budget seem to grow more and more only to satisfy monetary company goals. Quality of life as individuals seems to be overlooked."
good,"Honestly i love my job with dollar general, it just doesn't pay enough. It is a wonderful place to work tho if you looking for a part time job. Hours are flexible and you have a good work/ life balance."
good,I really loved working at DG. The customers are amazing and often made my day. I also can't say enough about my co-workers. Always ready and willing to help each other.
good,I loved working there because it was slow and the other employees where nice and fun. The manager was great and very interactive with his customers and employees. The pay was not great and there are no benefits.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General as an employee was never the same every single day. Some days you would work the front register and greet customers, other days you would organize aisles and work on inventory and facing products."
good,"This job was bitter sweet. I like my store manager, he was a fair person, but I was past over by his boss. I had been working as the lead cashier and 3rd key without the promotion and pay. My store managers boss began to hire from off the streets instead of from with in. So I resigned my position and found another job."
good,"It was a very comfortable work place and great experience with customer service. I learned a lot from my fellow coworkers, they were very nice and professional and willing to help when needed."
good,Managment wasn't responsible. No one showed up for work when needed... if you wanting a part time job and going to school highly recomended.. just don't consider the job for a career
good,"Working at Dollar General is a hit or miss. It all comes down to one thing."
good,working at dollar general was a good experience. it taught me how to change out shelfs and products. I learned basic skills with the money counter and doing payroll.
good,It's a busy place to work at you have to be multi-task person management it's okay the environment is good the hardest part of the job is dealing with bad customer
good,"Dollar General employees form a 'family' of associates, keyholders, and managers--I feel close to coworkers even after a short time of working with them.  The workload depends on the truck that week, it can be stressful or slow; the influx of customers depends on the day of the week.  Mostly steady work pace."
good,good company but hard to advance a lot of tests and certifications to take to advance a lot of physical work if you are actually doing your job correctly.
good,"Good place to work, hard work never a dull moment. Very hands on in the management roll, like any place else not enough staff/hours to get the work done so it all falls on you to get it done"
good,"Stressful when your lane was over 3000 units, but learned how to keep up pace, management was understandable, the culture was good when you hanged with the right people,hardest part was if you didn't know anybody, nobody would help."
good,"It is a good starter job for anyone looking to ga8n some expwrience in the retail business, but would not rwcommend for those who are looking for a livable wage."
good,"Not as busy as fast food is, but definitely enough work to keep you busy throughout the day. Very kind hearted community and workforce. Can get stressful if busy."
good,"A typical day at work starting off with checking out costumers and i do that through the time i work, stocking shelves everything has to be put in the right spot i learned how to read labels on each item, learned how to use a hand held scanner, learned how to recover shelves, learned how to set shelves so that the store is in great condition."
good,hard work but it was fun. fast pace. but if you quit make sure you give a 2 week notice or they will put you on a no rehire list. you get backs about every couple hours. loud noise the whole shift.
good,"It was a good job to have starting out, and it was job. I've always love to work and I can work with anyone, I've always been an independent person, plus I had a family to take care of."
good,I loved working here but you only get health insurance if you are a manager. not a lot of room for advancement. But I loved my coworkers. Is always busy.
good,"The management is good, but the customers are hard to please. It is a very demanding job with a very poor work/life balance. But other than that it is a pretty decent job."
good,I absolutely loved working for dollar general.  The team was very nice and helping. They tried to help you cover shifts when needed. And worked around a busy college students life.
good,"In a short time span working there I was able to advance in my career. Enjoyed seeing regular customers. A typical day you're cashing out people, doing floor recovery, and stocking."
good,The job was close by and always provided a clean friendly environment. Workers were friendly as we're most customers and it was a fun place to work at.
good,This was my first retail job. sort of similar to fast food in that you have to serve customers. enjoyed the pace and the atmosphere. disliked the pay.
good,its a company strives in customer satisfaction and you work hard for them it takes patients  and learning tonget all your responsibility is for rather a cashier lead or manager you stock shelfs help clean up store and keep.it flowing under their standards  get a good manger and you can thrive there
good,It’s good place to work needs some better management training but overall is a fun and exciting place to work with opportunities to advance up into corporate positions
good,cool employees & pays every week. did not have a bad time working for the location I was at. management was cool. toughest thing was being on time easy job.
good,work days varied depending on the stores specails sales for that day i learned to work with other key holders as myself management was ok but fun hardest part of the job trying to run the store short staffed
good,"It is a very good work environment, along with some really great people. That being said it is retail so not every day goes as smoothly as the rest of them."
good,"Great Service & Happy Customers. Clean & Organized. All employees are friendly. The management did a great job as well keeping everything all together, nice & neat."
good,I enjoyed working there. I wasn't receiving many hours for the travel time. I enjoyed serving and helping customers. I would have stayed if I was receiving more hours. Also was suppose to transfer and that never happened as my paperwork got lost.
good,dollar general respected me as a human being. respected how hard i worked for their company and acknowledged that i worked hard. gave me good hours and always had my back
good,"Dollar General was an overall good company to work for. The manager I was under did her best to make sure everything was fair and no one got more than the other, which lead to less drama in the work area."
good,Best job i had when i was in high school. Keep money in my pocket and all you had to do was keep the store neat and clean. Went back when i need a job badly and sad to say nothing changes over time. Stil same great environment but unable to compete with other paying jobs. Will return if need be but its a good place when you have a team available.
good,"I loved being a team player at dollar general. Some days were fast-paced, and others were steady. I learned to stock shelves and run end of sale reports. My responsibilities included helping customers with their purchases and handling transactions accurately and quickly."
good,can be stressful at times but all in all a great place to work co workers are awesome managers can be understanding at times but you must remember we are here to take care of the customer so do have to work weekends
good,"In my personal opinion, the most enjoyable part of the job was becoming so close with everyone. We were in a small town, where everyone knows everyone and EVERYONE became family; coworkers and customers."
good,Must do math and clean and do great customer service multitask be fast with stocking and be willing to travel sometime for hrs andbe willing to run a store basically solo
good,"very fast pasted production based job with great benefits and job advancements benefits, great people to work with and very understanding management team when it come down to job and personal related issues."
good,"Working at Dollar General in Harrison Michigan, is a pretty great place to work. It is a very good learning experience as to retail and the people one would have to deal with on a daily basis."
good,"This is a great place to work if just starting out in adult life. There is always a task to do. Whether it be helping a customer or restocking the shelves, there is no shortage of productivity to be had."
good,"Good place to work with good benefits, but long hours and hard work, always away from family and friends. Long strenuous hours and lots of wear and tear on your body,"
good,The experience with Dollar General has been interesting. During this time I have strengthen my customer service skills and as well as managing employees. Time management and multi-tasking ability is a big part of the the job as well as having strong organizational skills.
good,Love meeting new people. You learn a lot working at a fast paced company like this one. I enjoy the work but I need Benefits for my family and my self.
good,its a friendly but fast paced environment.You must think and work fast at this company. all of the employees are friendly and helpful. we work as a team as it should be in any other work place.
good,Can get very busy something for two people may also be good to have night stockers even if for 4 hours a night to keep store stocked and clean. Then may not be so hard to keep up when store is busy with customers
good,Dollar General is an ok place to work at it’s just the location and how bad the store is in its condition. Most dollar generals have good and ok stock but some store just have to much overstock.
good,"under the right supervision there are a lot of positive advancements. Wonderful place to meet and learn exciting new trades and people, very hands on and fast pace."
good,"For the type of work to be done, heavy lifting, cleaning, stocking shelves etc, the rate of pay does not seem to be adequate.  The individuals I worked with were pleasant and made work enjoyable most times."
good,It was actually a good place to work. Sometimes it could be a little hectic. Over all it's not to bad. Laid back work as team. No problems with customers.
good,"Friendly enough staff, had problems with stocking the shelves. Management could be lazy at times and didn't do the job. Nice though. Staff would help you if asked."
good,helping customers find stuff they are looking for and bringing a smile to there face. I fill that it makes my day better at work and helping someone and being nice and friendly will bring that customer back.
good,"long long work hours. barely had time to sleep, let alone have family time. i was in a bad location, where the employees never showed up so i'd have to compensate for them."
good,"Dollar General is an okay place to work.  It can be stressful at times, especially if you are a key holder like a lead sales associate or a manager.  It is pretty much just like working a grocery store."
good,It would be a really good place to work if they was to get the right ones in there that would be willing to work as a team .I also noticed that some managers and district manager has their favorite and the reason for this is because these employee's can show up late or be short on their register and when you write them up you notice how no action takes place .
good,"As a store manager, you had 1 day off if possible. Worked, 10 - 14 hours a day, and if another hourly manager called out, it was not uncommon to work from 5am to 11Pm. Worked with P&L daily, vendors daily, and company presentation program that was updated weekly"
good,Lot's of changes every month --stressful--and hard to have work-life balance. Management changes were very frequent--job security in upper management not good.
good,"I loved working for Dollar general, but When you are full time and are offered insurance, your pay decreases drastically. I went from bringing home $300-$400 a wee to less than $100 some weeks. Part time is even worse. Not worth driving."
good,I gained customer service knowledge also  good communication skills teamwork and reliability are an important part of a job and maintaining good relationships with co workers as well as management goes a long way
good,I like that the retail environment is small and intimate which allows teenager to not get overwhelmed with the struggle of juggling customers and merchandise.
good,Dollar general is a good company to work for if you are a student or want a good part time job. They offer weekly pay and a flexible schedule. Upper management does their best with responding to comments and complaints and make sure you're grievances and or concerns are taken care of. I would recommend this company to others.
good,i worked for Dollar General for over 3 years in management it is a great place to get experience but the pay is low and i have come to a point in my life where i need more good company low pay
good,Dollar General is a friendly non-stressful company to work for. Management was very supportive and very willing to work with scheduling. Customer service was a top priority.
good,Dollar General is basically for someone who's in college. It's a flexible shift. It's a fun work place and you will enjoy it. Or it can also be for extra pay on the side.
good,had a very awesome work experience . great people to work with but the pay just wasn't enough to pay my bills for my home. other than that I would show up ready to work on time . I am a very reliable person. and would work all of the hours they would give me
good,"This is a decent place to work for a starter job. The pay doesn't match well with the amount of work expected. The budget hours given for scheduling are laughable. Many times I opened/closed, worked alone in a very busy location. Overall it is ok...just a stepping stone."
good,i use to love working at dollar general until they switched management. They do not work well with set  schedules and if you work at night its hard on you because the morning crew does not help with recovery or cleaning up
good,The location I work at is high paced but the people you work with are very nice and will become like a second family. The customers are nice as well and easy to work with.
good,Management not good to work with always behind and never wanted to improve the store for employees and customers. There is advancement if under good management.
good,It was ok. They are a typical retail business. Centered around customers. My particular supervisor had a problem with pushing her workers too hard. Made us feel like we had to kill ourselves for the job to please her or she would yell at us. Liked helping the customers and that is why i stayed for a year and even tried to be assistant manager of my store. When i found out that my coworkers didnt care about making the store great for the customers and only wanted a power trip thats when i gave my notice. shame.
good,My manager there was awesome and made my experience there better than expected. The work was typical retail work and the schedule made was very flexible.
good,"Opening paperwork, opening the store, balancing the money for the opening shifts, making sure the store is recovered, the stock room is tidy and the sales floor has a neat and presentable for the customers.  Greeting, speaking to the customers, handling any issues that arise.  Stocking if needed to replenish products.  Ordering products for customers if they need products I do not have.  At the end of shift, counting down the til and making the deposit. "
good,"a typical work day at dg is assisting the customers,stocking freight,doing paperwork, checking in vendors etc.I learned how to order merchandise,perform the cycle count,scan the nons and tons. Being a manager is cool job if your team is strong the work place is laid back,the hardest part of the job is to catch up on your freight when u get behind and I enjoy my job because i like working with the public."
good,"General customer service, cleaning, and dealing with problems"
good,This company tries hard to take care of all their employees. Even though the work is a little tough it is a great place.  Hours are long and pay isn't the greatest.
good,"It's an easy starter job, can be fast paced, you get good breaks. The frustrating thing is that you need a managers key to do anything. Otherwise no problems."
good,This was my first job and it helped me learn a lot. I learned to better my people skills and time management skills. It's great for people who are just starting out. They help you learn and grow as an individual. Great for a first job.
good,It is a interesting place to see all kinds of people. Always stuff to do when stocking shelves and arranging items. Dealing with rude people always a bit of a challenge.
good,Fun place to work. Loved my store manager. Some of the customers is why I love my job so much. The only down fall to working in the area I work is the shoplifters.
good,Loved working here at this company. The pay was good but the distance was far from where I lived & daily assignments were often inconsistent on a weekly basis. Good supervisors & managers
good,"Most the time it was short staffed, safety hazards and risks. Scheduling was all over, closing one night then having to open the next morning, no consistency."
good,It is like a very small War-Mart. Got to stock and be a cashier at the same time.  Managers got to have time before closing to put up or take down the sale tags .
good,I love the store and the employees but the pay has to be increased for a person to live anymore. Its not the 50's anymore! Americans cant live on just minimum wage anymore.
good,"not a bad place to work. The only thing negative was some of the totes that the warehouse filled were way to heavy for probably most women to handle, but for me it was okay, was used to lifting a lot from previous job."
good,I was responsible for so much at the store but I loved it. I was in charge of scheduling and staffing as well as all paperwork and vendors. It was a very fast paced environment and the only reason I left dollar general was the travel. The 1 hr commute each way everyday was hard. A 10 hour work day turned into 12 with travel.
good,"Dollar general was a decent job I actually enjoyed  working there ,meeting new people and i didn't have an issue with work requirements  . I mainly left this job due to management ,which  wasn't  the best at all.  She was often rude,very controlling, and i felt as though  she abused her authority instead of utilizing it to the best of her ability."
good,"Only worked here temporarily as it was my first job. I was a sales associate so I did cashier and stocking. Operating the register was easy and I learned to operate it 90% on my own. Customer flow was heavy mid-day but calmed down during afternoons and evenings. Enjoyed working with my fellow employees as they were very helpful and understanding of my inexperience. I recently decided to leave the job because of random hours and physical and emotional stress. If you can handle the physical demands of running back and forth from register to stocking shelves, then I recommend this job. Might be too demanding for the inexperienced."
good,Know how to handle situationsin in a work environment . Take time to learn new things even if you think you already know everything. Be humble and love to help.
good,"I could see myself growing in this company, but I'm looking for a different opportunity to grow as an individual. I can't wait to see what the future has for me after learning new skills from Dollar General."
good,"It's a great job if you want to be phyiscally active, and if you need some spare change at the end of the week. Management was okay, they could have been better with scheduling people. I learned what it's like to work for money, as opposed to just being given it. The most enjoyable part was getting paid each week. The hardest part, as with all retail jobs, was the consumers/customers. A typical day as a sales asscoiate; expect to be stuck on a register, while doing totes, a rolltainer or two, checking bathrooms, doing the grunt work. It will teach you patience, responsiblity, respect, etc."
good,The typical work day is 8 hrs or less. I have learned if you are not in a management position you wont get a 40 hr work week. hardest part of the job is no set schedule.
good,"Open and make bank deposits, prepare tills , check voice mails , receive truck start stocking, helping customers, plan a grams, help cashiers,  hold interviews, make  schedules, responsible for other employees, have enough change, count down tills .Great responsibility was learned.  Long hours when staff called out .  Loved the staff and customers,"
good,"Dollar general is a good place work. Since I have started with the new building we have had our ups and downs but the management team keeps everyone upbeat and confident in the work they are doing. They try to make it a very good and comfortable place to work, overall it will be fantastic especially now that we are getting all the staff that's needed to get the job done in an adequate amount of time"
good,"I loved working with this company until we got a new manager about 3 months ago. If the manager is good, it is the best place to work. If the manager isn't good, I would stay as far away from this place as possible."
good,I loved my coworkers but management treated me like I didn't do a good job! I showed up on time and even worked over time! Rarely complained and always finished my work. When I asked for a little raise I wasn't even presented with one nor did they give me a reason why. I switched locations and they never gave me hours.
good,"The work was pretty easy as the day went by. I love working with people who try their hardest at what they do. The hardest part of working customer service would be the rude customers that always try to make it the cashiers fault. There is so much you'd like to say, but taking a deep breath is all that you can do. The best part of my job is meeting new people, and putting a smile on their faces. I love being in management,  but not for the wrong company. At first, it was easy breezy. But as a couple of months went by, it started to get a little hectic with all the stress you have thrown upon you."
good,I honestly say I really did enjoy working at DG my time there was very well productive only thing a didn't agree with was the low pay and little hours that was given.
good,Its a great place to work if you are people friendly although the pay and the hours aren't great for future incomes. Always lots of work to be done and not enough pay. Other then that it teaches you plenty of responsibility and how to handle situations in a work place.
good,Working for Dollar General was an exciting new adventure for someone who has only really ever worked in the fast food industry. I liked the Job but was very disturbed in the way the district manager handled situations.
good,"Most days on the job were pretty leisurely, but there were peak times of customers thoroughly through out the day.  The only true hard part about the job is some of the customers that would come in after having a bad day or something along those lines."
good,"Working at dollar general over all was a good experience. Was able to get the days off I needed, and seemed to be very accommodating to everyones scheduling"
good,"Fast past, but fun, challenging and at times rewarding.  Not the place for you if you are not looking fo, can handle or thrive on always having a heavy work-load."
good,"Learned how to be self efficient, trained in management and work under pressure. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with the management team and being able to interact with customers."
good,"Great Enviroment "
good,it was a medium paced job. friendly co-workers and good boss. i worked on truck days unloading the truck and loading items onto shelves. I also worked the register
good,If you're just starting out it's a good place to work. It's very demanding job. You have good managers and bad just like any company. They do want you to do more than just cashier work which at times can be stressful
good,It was a fast paced work place but it kept me busy and I couldn't complain. The staff I worked with were great. The customers were enjoyable people more days then not.
good,"My typical day at work consist of opening the store and preparing the registers for the employees coming in to work, running the register and putting away stock. I learned how to do returns and exchanges. My boss was very flexible and friendly. I loved the environment and everyone worked together to keep our store presentable. The hardest part of the job was store diagrams. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see the same customers everyday and they were just as happy to see me."
good,"Work wasn't hard. Assisted customers daily. Stocked shelves, recovered store for the next business day. Prepared store for inventory. Setup in store displays and collect payment from customers."
good,Liked my job.  It is only what you make of it.  Train and develop your team to make your work / life balance work to your benefit.  Take 5 minutes out of your life to train and the reward is long term managing.
good,"Dollar General is a fun place to work. It is a fast paced environment and can be stressful at times. The teams on each shift work together and swiftly, which makes for a stress free work zone. The hardest part of the job are the long hours during holidays. The most enjoyable part is the relationships you build with people on a day to day basis."
good,"Usually a typical day at work consist of me working the register, while also preparing to close. While working at Dollar General, I have learned to work as a team to get the job done, in a quick and orderly fashion. Working at Dollar general, has made me a more well rounded person, and has really brought me out of my shell of shyness. The workplace at Dollar General is welcoming, and enjoyable."
good,"-Balancing volume with in the department"
good,"It can be fun, its very demanding. It never ends and you will work or you will not have a job. The pay is low, hours are long, the benefits are sub-par"
good,Working at Dollar General was an ok experience. It wasn't bad nor was it good. The stores I worked in were in very bad areas so I had to deal with a lot of thieves.
good,"Although the manager is new to our store we are still training him. Our hours are getting cut lower than what two of us are promised, and what two others thought they would get is less than what they are getting."
good,A typical work day consisted of getting the registers open for the store. Stocking all new merchandise. Management was harsh and untolerable. The assistant managers were wonderful to the put one of them now is the general manager.
good,Enjoy my time with Dollar General. Working hours was based on locations and experiences of management team. When you put in the work it pays off by helping your management team understand their roles and expectations.
good,I like doing my job and I love working in general. There's always things you can do to keep and stay busy. Seeing customers leave with a good experience is the motto.
good,I enjoyed learning retail. I appreciate and respect anybody in retail. It is a busy job. I did enjoy the contact with people. I enjoyed the workout of stocking. It was also a learning experience considering I worked in the restaurant business my whole life it was a nice change of pace.
good,I like the people I work with but I am currently trying to move and make more money.I stock shelves and run register when needed. I make bailsand can run a cardboard compactor. I go out and get carts whenever they need me too
good,A nice and friendly atmosphere. A great place for customer service. I learned a lot from  the management team and am grateful for the experience and opportunities I was given.
good,There is a lot of pressure at this job getting tasks completed with sometimes little help. I have learned to mutli-task.
good,"I had certain days off, and with this knowledge I would make plans ahead of time. They would call me in when I had plans and that would ruin what I had to do."
good,The management personnel are young and unqualified for the position. DG needs to hire older people with more experience and put them in that position.
good,Hard working atmosphere but the average person has the ability to to perform every task given! Timed work assignments and a great workout! Make sure you eat enough and drink lots of water. Fun work environment. The company really does take care of its employees!
good,"I like this job because it is easy and kind of repetitive. Like I said, it would make a great first job. The people are nice. Management is nice and will work with you if you have scheduling issues (because of college for example)."
good,"Loved my job. "
good,"Minimum wage for a store the size of a large appartment, or bottom floor of a house. Duties involve stocking, cleaning, and managing the register."
good,It was a good job. Was offered full time. Management was great and I learned basic retail skills hands on. People that came in were friendly. Breaks were reasonable and lunch was a great way to take a break as well.
good,"a typical day at work would be unloading truck and stocking shelf, alway open to learn more, team player management, co worker are a team player too, working in a timely manner, getting my work done on time in a timely manner"
good,A lot of work to do to be successful. Can not be a Store Manager and expect to do 45 hours weekly. I worked an additional 15-20 hours weekly to be successful.
good,"Dollar general is a productive workplace. In addition to the good environment, it also has excellent workers. A day at work most of the time would be pretty busy sometimes hectic but for the most time enjoyable."
good,"I come in normally to relieve day managers, and am there as a closing manager.  Count registers, customer service, deposits, computers, phones, stocking supplies, general cleaning up, finally able to lock up store and end my night."
good,The people are fun. The truck vendors are nice.. It's a good environment.. Its easy work. The hours were always good for me.. Its a Minimum wage job..
good,A typical day would usually include 11 hours with a 30 minute lunch break. The management is understanding with other schedules but  not flexible with giving that time off.
good,"Not the best company to work for, but it wasn't the worst either . I worked at the one on myatt Dr in madison tn. If you have ever been there you know that store is falling apart and so tiny it's hard to have a good business from that establishment."
good,"this job you will do more than just run the register. You clean up, help customers, stock shelves, so if you don't know how to multi-task you will learn."
good,You'll definitely stay busy working here. It is alright as long as you are efficient. The managers are pretty cook but can be a little difficult. Overall it was a good place to work. Good work environment
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar general. If i could get hired back i would most definitely return to work there. The environment was a great, Most of the employees were nice to work with. And working with the customers was always a benefit"
good,"This was a very comfortable environment to work in despite how busy the store could get. Generally, the work is easy to do and should be enjoyable if you have decent coworkers."
good,"I was always kept on my toes on a typical day at work.  I learned customer service skills.  I was usually only working one other person, the manager.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working at the register."
good,it was ok it could have been better but it also could have been a lot worse. the people that i worked with were nice and some were standoffish it was ok
good,"this was an easy job to do. the only thing is they could of gave me more hours, but far as manger, my manger was very easy to talk to and helped me with a lot that I didn't not know, co workers also was great they made my day when I enter the store, I made friends easy. this was a easy paying job for little to nothing work"
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is operating a cash register and stocking and recovery of shelves. Placing weekly ads and moving product around for seasonal and discounted sales. "
good,I enjoyed working with my direct reports and i was challenged daily by my manager to get better as a person and supervisor. They're a company that believes in promoting within as i have see it first hand. Were employees were promoted to Supervisor
good,"You have to be a fast,nice,and productive employee or you won't last. My time working was great until the very end there is a lot of pressure when you are in management."
good,"A typical day at work is basically and mainly dealing with customers and their issues while they are shopping within the store. What I have learned is operating the cash register, and working in other areas in the store. Management is okay. The co workers work as a team. The hardest part of the job is trying to solve customers problems and trying to maintain working the register while a another employee is helping other customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is to make sure the customers are pleased while they are shopping within the store."
good,"Plenty of hours and lots of work. Stocking the shelves, checking people out, making sure the store is presentable. Lots of lifting and moving."
good,I have mixed emotions about this job.  I love it but at the same times some things should be fixed. Having interactions with different  people everyday is something i find exciting and new. At  the same time doing things 3 to 4 times over again is a waste of time which is a waste of money. I  just find that many  things could be fixed if they paid more attention to all stores  and not just a few.
good,"A typical day at Dillar General can start from not so busy to a casual day. Other times it's very busy depending on what day it is and if it's a holiday."
good,this is  a good place for someone wanting to get into management. wouldn't recommend for a permanent job  or career . also do your research on places before applying.
good,"they have very nice workplace"
good,"Normally when I would go to work, I would clock in, get a drawer from the manager on duty, count it, put it in the register and perform my necessary duties.  Other times, I would just stock or face products and work as backup for the main cashier.  I usually worked at least a five hour shift, but sometimes I would work between six and eight hours.  If I helped to close, I would make sure everything was picked up in the store and stay until the manager was done.  "
good,The management I worked for aimed for hiring only the absolute best for low paying entry level work. This meant that often times aside from myself and the store manager there was one maybe two workers. We didn't have an assistant manager half the time I worked there so I learned to do their job duties myself as a lsa which doubled my workload essentially. But management tried their best to make sure their team was taken care of so there's that.
good,I had an overall good time at my job but my managers were not the most understanding people and could use some work on that aspect. Other than that it was a good and secure job.
good,I loved this job until hours were cut. freight started piling on the floor because lines at the register need back up all the time.. It is a very fast pace and you are always busy and on top of all of this the environment this job was located in was high  in theft and rudeness.
good,"It was okay, it paid. Sadly, though, many coworkers often came in under the influence of narcotics. The manager was actually aware of this but, because it was her favorite employee, did nothing to solve it."
good,"I loved working for dollar General! I am a people person and enjoy helping the public.I liked going in waiting on customers and stocking shelves. my co-workers were great and I got along with them. I feel I wMy manager was well liked and would work with you. I was starting chemo and radiation when I quit, but she was very understanding.ent above and beyond to satisfy my customers and co-workers.There was no really hard part of the job just had to be on your toes stocking and waiting on customers."
good,"The issue with Dollar General is that it will constantly lose focus of their goals. They are hesitant to accept new ideas, if they have decided on a preliminary course."
good,There was plenty to keep you occupied throughout your shift. Very easy going work place and awesome people there. Never a dull moment and never ran out of thing to do.
good,"My typical day at work would start in a few different ways depending if I was receiving truck or not. On most days though I would get there and begin to count my drawer because I was assigned to the front half of the store a majority of the time. Once my draw was counted and I was clocked on I would begin stocking the shelves or pulling the older products to the front while checking the dates. It would remain about the same up until close and my duties didn't change much. I would have to clean and sweep towards the end of the day. "
good,"Typical Day: Stock, ring up customers, rinse and repeat."
good,Loved cutomer service.Enjoyed the retail business. Loved setting up retail items and keeping the store up and getting ready for holidays. Got along with all of the employees
good,If you have no home life and want to devote everything to the company then it's great to work for. I have been with the company for almost 10 years and it's a good company to work for as long your not the manager then you have no personal life mandatoried 6 days a week at 48 hours a week
good,This was a part time job while at junior college. The pay was below average and work was that of a stocker and cashier. I enjoyed helping people and learning the register.
good,"Working at Dollar general was a happy well organized environment. It teaches you how to be responsible and being n assistant manager put your reliability to the test. The employees are wonderful company. The hardest part about the job is the lack of communication you sometimes experience with other employees, but the best part is once communication is established all parties stay on the same page, from management to employees."
good,"DG can either be a pretty good place to work (if you work with people who care) or pretty terrible. Corporate seems to keep cutting hours while sending more and more stock to the stores, and the point-of-sale terminals have never worked the way they should."
good,Always something to do.  Everyday is like an adventure.  I feel proud  of the fact that we as a company have the ability to help people nationwide.
good,Always doing something at this job. Whether it be cashiering or stocking the shelves while their are no customers to check out.
good,"a typical day at my job is assisting customers,putting out stock,i love working with my co-workers and customers,im a friendly and social person so I greet everyone when they come in the door."
good,Everything is great except there is no room for advancement and the pay wage is low. Lunch breaks not long enough. Management is fun and easy going.
good,"This job is not for everyone. I like to build personal relationships with my customers which I was not allowed much time to get to know them. I am a fun person who gets my job done but they do not allow ""fun"" I mean that in the sense of talking with your customers while they shop if they engage a conversation."
good,"my overall experience was ok, you could not go over 40 hrs a week and they expected way to much from you. the hardest part is rolltainers, i have gained alot of experience while working at dollar general"
good,"Cashiering, opening/closing store"
good,"Typical day at work "
good,"I liked working here. Sometimes the pace was pretty quick, but its a pretty simple job to do. The main thing i did not like about working here was the workload. The managers expected a certain amount of merchandise to be put up in a short amount of time. It was sometimes deemed as impossible. Other than that it was cool."
good,I actually enjoyed this job. The mangers were extremely flexible and considerate. My co-workers were the best. They were entertaining and loveable.
good,"The typical day at work for Dollar General, is walking in, singing on to punch in your time. The manager on duty will have to count you're drawer and when that is done, work on truck (Stocking) if needed. Cash out customers and help them on the sales floor. Recovering the store and doing what ever assigned by the manager. "
good,It's a productive work environment but management can sometimes show lack of knowledge about your store. They want to do stuff a certain way while it just won't work in your store.
good,I loved the people I worked with and the job in itself. I did not agree with mandatory weekends (every weekend) for staff other than management.
good,My mother said if you don't have anything nice to say than don't say anything at all. Otherwise great place to meet new people and get paid weekly
good,"This is the kind of job where people who show up and work hard are able to make a decent living. Not for people who are unreliable. All management positions require a lot of physical work. Customers are rude, labor hours are limited, and there is always more work than time to do it"
good,My kinda day was watching over the money stocking the store making surethe store was clean for close .Then there was counting the draws now at the end of the day.My employe were good to work with but some of the other mangers were not.The hardest part of my day was getting the store closed on time and getting out.
good,Good place to work. Coworkers are great and store manager is terrific only part time is available and I need a full time position
good,I really loved working for DG. Always a great group of individuals. Love the fast paced environment and steady work. Always had stock to throw or a register to run! I loved being able to do both.
good,"We recently had many dramatic changes.  Our typical day is spent auditing, looking for opportunities for improvement."
good,running a 2.7 million dollar store  is a challenge but the rewards for me were my customers ..they had seen the pros and cons of a typical work week and in the end the sales aspect of the store was truly remarkable...I will always have good things to say about this company
good,"You are busy from the time you walk in to the time you leave. Most people have to complete work after hours. Personally I had great leaders, they cared about their team and were always willing to teach you what they know, willing to listen to other points of view. "
good,"needs improvement on work/life balance very good DM's, good people, just needs quality of life improvements, but, good company and good benefits in place"
good,What I've learned about pass job experiences would be to handle customers in a respectful manner and how to provide great customer services in an timely manner and also how to multi-task in a busy or non-busy atmosphere
good,"-mobile equipment operator picked products off pallets into roll containers to be shipped to customers "
good,"- a typical day at work is pretty much always busy"
good,I was there to help set up the store according to the blue print layout and to set the store up according to the planners. I wasn't hired on as a permanent worker but would work there if given the chance.
good,"I liked working here.  as a cashier you have no problem meeting the sales requirements which they tally and post daily, for all to see.  as a manager I would get demerits for lowest sales because I would help customers with 1 or 2 items so they didn't have to wait too long in line,    that worked against me here,   also my manager gave me minimal keyholder training before letting me go solo.  I was not ready."
good,"enjoyed working there. liked the management. nothing was hard about the job. learned how to retail, stock things. No long hours to work."
good,working at dollar general was fun and very productive. we had a great team and all worked together. my co-workers were awesome and we all got along. I loved making to customers happy by being able to help them in anyway.
good,The company is not a bad place to work for its the management you have to worry about it not a hard job most people you come in contact with are very nice and if you have a problem or any questions they are helpful
good,"unload merchandise from conveyor belt , unpacked & set on selves,"
good,Working in the licensing department is busy and offers a lot of learning opportunities. A good multi faceted and fast growing company.
good,A typical day at work would only describe or define us as busy retail. I wish that the company would train their management team very tension.
good,Typical day starts at 6 am or earlier might not have an associate with you in the store until 10 am depending on the day. typical store budget for hours is less than 200 hours of labor plus yourself.
good,A typical day at work is seeing at least 100 different people a day. I learned that we are all just people trying to make it in this world day by day. The management team was very hard working. My co-workers were the best group of people to work with each day. The hardest part of the job was being called in at the last minute. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers.
good,"I have learned a lot. I would just like a job with 40 hours a week and more flexible. It is a good place to work as long as you do not have children and a lot of bills,"
good,Working here I've pretty much learned how to do everything from checking in vendors to closing up for the night. It's a very good place to learn and gain experience.
good,I did enjoy my job.  The only thing I didn't like was being in the store all by myself.  I did not feel secure working by myself.
good,"I typically put in a 12 hour day. never a dull moment at the store. Always something to do at store.putting out over stock, checking in vendors, handling customers,setting planagrams , doing daily reports.handling bank deposits and getting change."
good,My time at dollar general was time spent well. I learned many new things and the people were very friendly. The work environment was fast paced and clean. The customers were friendly.
good,"I loved working there. the enviorment is great. I got along with all of my co- workers and the customers were all nice. I learned how to set plan-o -grams as well as how to count the registers down at the end of the night. My hard part of the job was when they were training me to become third key, I had to learn all the extra stuff which came easy once I got the hang of it. I  moved away so I never took the position."
good,"working her for 4 yrs was a great experiance yes its a retail establishment but the customers were definately shown to be a great big part in the business.  Shedules stayed flexible, not a very high turn over rate. Company treated associates with the utmost respect along with the customers.  Working eployees around truck day was a sinch. Had a great system going knowing what the associates weaknesses and strenghts were and letting the work to the best of their abiliity.Must room for moving up and improvement. Employees ddint always get along but it never showed in front of the customers. Differences were left behind employee doors."
good,"Helping the customers find supplies in the store.Working the registers and making bank deposit drops unloading the freight. "
good,"Fast paced, you are responsible for the success or failure of your store you are expected to work with in the payroll constrains, so always apply for a high volume store.  You will only be as successful as the team you hire anywhere from 5 to 8 employees.  The hardest part of the job is the time you will spend at your operating unit, the fun is interacting with your regular customers."
good,"learned how to lead a great team and accept venders, setting shelves would of been the hardest thing to do because you have to get shelves level."
good,"I would either open/close. Balance tills, go to the bank.  I would stock shelves/move rolltainers to the floor or stock room.It was a very nice work place."
good,this an okay company. I really enjoyed my time there. The atmosphere is what you make it. positive =positive. It was very challenging and rewarding at the same time. It was hard to find the home/work balance but If you plan and execute effectively it will work at this particular employer.
good,"I had to contact business owners on the phone, which automatically dialed the numbers for us. After we went through the contact list, our work day was done. Management was not very understanding that we needed to know before hand when there was not going to be any leads to call out to. So we would go a month or 3 without any work"
good,"Mainly worked on the cash register. Most days would be calm because the store was out of the way. Management changed frequently, and the hardest part would have been layouts. There is not a lot of other coworkers so you learn about them pretty quickly."
good,"fun employees to work with. helping staff willing to teach the ins and outs of things. learned how to use the cash register. the most enjoying part of work was being around the co workers. the hardest part of work was unloading all my stock carts on time before my dead line. a typical day involved clocking in, unlocking stocks all day or working cash register for 6 to 8 hours."
good,"Management made this job enjoyable. The customers were rude but were manageable with a positive attitude. The typical day required a lot of standing and walking. Learned professionalism, cash management, and other retail skills. This job was very fast paced all day."
good,"The Dollar General was a very slow paced work environment.  Management was wonderful, and the coworkers were great.  Generally, the customers were fine.  There are hardly any positions to advance to available, so you stay where you start."
good,"You work some pretty different hours, I learned how to do the paperwork for store opening and close. I learned how to supervise other employees. The hardest part of this job is the stocking issue because you are supposed to do 6 containers in a hour and that's not available when the shelves are overstocked or stuff is in wrong place and ring up customers too."
good,When I first worked there it was a little difficult on the first two days. I learned how to communicate with other customers. I managed to have a day list to keep me focused on my job and accomplish better and better. My co workers were my friends and if it was something I didn't understand I would ask them how to fix a problem. The hardest part of the job was to keep people from stealing. The best part about the job was making new friends and experience something's that was right from wrong.
good,great work place but people would come and go like flies. great pay and great people just need more work with helping their employees and more understanding that they have lives and family.
good,Was my first job and meet a lot of great people along the way and learned alot. I feel like management could be done alot better. The most enjoyable part was the people who I actually became friends with.
good,Enjoyed being around the people I worked with although it wasn't what I wanted to be doing for the rest of my life. The work was easy and at times challenging when learning something new but overall I enjoyed the time I was here.
good,"Typical day. Go in at 6am and start your paperwork from last night. If there's time left, plan out your day. Work on START tasks and complete them before 8am. Manager on duty usually works alone til 2pm due to hours being scarce. As a store manager you are under intense pressure to coordinate completion of programs yourself. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done in the time they want you to, and with the hours they give you. Retention is another challenge they should investigate deeper. A more competitive wage would help that. The part I enjoyed was the week long class they give you teaching you DG inside and out. It would be more beneficial to get that information in the beginning of employment, but they'd rather put the manager in the store to get them familiar with what will be discussed in class."
good,"Enjoyable environment, working with nice employees and the public. Generally a fast paced environment. I learned how to stage and market sale items to promote them. I liked my manager. She was a well organized and fair leader. Great co-workers, everyone worked well together. I did not find the job difficult in any way. I enjoyed busy days with lots of customers and stocking new merchandise,"
good,I absolutely loved the team I worked with. We were a well oiled machine that kept the store running smoothly. The management was fantastic and always brought out in the best in me.
good,Enjoyed problem solving along with inventory control.  Days varied according to number of customers attended to as well as delivery; of goods each week. Staff was always a pleasure to work with.
good,Although a little rough to the start Dollar General quickly became and easy place to wake up and go to work for. My Co-workers were very well mannered and pushed through the hard times when dealing with negativity from few customers. I would definitely work for this company again given the chance.
good,Dollar General was a good place to work if you are by yourself and the never would help you.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of pulling rolltainers and stocking shelves. I learned about retail, and management and my co workers where very nice. The hardest part of the job was learning the store when I started. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction."
good,"working at dollar general is fun, but dealing wit the townspeople is a lot of hard work. making sure that you say the right things, do what your are asked, and help when they need it is number one working in retail."
good,Very good management and laid back culture. Benefits were not very good and neither was the pay. Hours were average as it is a retail store. Enjoyed working here but could not make a career out of it.
good,This was a good company to work for. Only problem was my managers couldn't understand that I had children and when one of them got sick I would need to stay home to take care of them cause the daycare does not allow sick children to be there.  They fired me cause I had to stay home for one day to take care of my baby because she was throwing up and running a fever.
good,"A fairly easy job with basic duties. Very easy to get a hang of the job and to find a rhythm for the day-to-day chores. Schedules are done weekly and with little notice, however, and can cause problems without reliable transportation and will cause problems with appointments. Training is video-based and on-the-job."
good,"Coordinated daily activities of workers engaged in handling, loading, unloading, trasporting stocking, selling and maintaining store levels for a higher performance; monitored company and customers needs to assure to timely matters with commitment."
good,i have good co-workers. Get along with all my co-workers. The manager and assistant manager are nice also and make sure you know how to do your job 100%.
good,"I cashed and greet my customers with a smile and help them find whatever they need . I made sure the store looked nice and clean . I enjoyed putting our products on the shelfs and I hate mopping the floor at the end of the day , I had trouble with it ."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of being on the checkstand or stocking shelves with product. What I learned was the basics of retail and customer service as it was my first job. Management was decent, could be demanding at times but in retrospect was understandable considering the size of the store and how small the staff was. Co-workers were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job for me on a personal level, I was let go but I was trying to get over a heart problem which I since recovered from, it took about 6 months but at that time it was just too much for my body at the time to handle, unloading the truck could be strenuous at times but was manageable. Most enjoyable part was learning how retail worked and about customer service and how it worked."
good,"Managers and co-worker's are amazing. We are all like a big family. Everyone is always willing to help one another. Manger always had schedule up two weeks in advance, which is nice since you can plan your weeks out."
good,"Challenging, great merchandising, planograms updated constantly, some labor issues"
good,"I worked here when I was in Maryland. I was a cashier, I also helped cleaned as well as stock items and help organize the place by putting items back and doing what was needed."
good,"I was able to cross train for other positions and this eventually helped me to promote within the company. I was able to bring forward ideas and have them heard respectfully, allowing easier functioning within our job tasks and efficiency /ease for our customers."
good,Long fast pace days I really enjoyed working for Dollar General.
good,"enjoyed going to work everyday, seen new people everyday. got along with coworkers, wanted to work more hours to make up the pay"
good,"Dollar General was one of my favorite places to work. Very stressful indeed, but overall, I fell in love with all my co workers and my customers. I enjoyed every part of this job."
good,"Great customers, Loved working with all the people. Enjoyed putting up the truck and working planograms"
good,"Days at DG would always vary. Sometimes they were very bad or busy or good. There was always something to do and there was never a dull day. I have learned how to be a manager. I was promoted the a Lead Associate after a few months of being a cashier. I have learned to take control and delegate tasks without acting as boss. I have learned the best way to work with others and still be in charge is work as one and know that whatever the task is, it reflects on you. I always tell the cashiers what a great job they did that day and that appreciate them because that is not something you here to often."
good,cuts hours too much especially when we are busy then people complain about there only being one cashier. its hard to have more when you don't have enough hours to spread.
good,"•	Quality Control"
good,Come in count safe and get the store ready for the day. I learned how to properly multi-task and manage employees on a very positive proactive basis. I encouraged all employees so that they can maintain a positive morale as well as remain professional and friendly at all times while getting their area duties done.
good,"Would spend day stocking and cashiering. Stores were nice and management was friendly and hard working. However, had several days working open to close due to coworker call outs."
good,"I really did enjoy my job, however I was hand picked for the position and in 6 months some new person came and the job was taken from me and given to this individual and also was giving their own store to manage, when that was the proposal I was  supposed to be given and within in a year CIA Agents walked this individual out of his store and charged him with embezzlement. His stole a 150,000 in a year. After that I relocated to Austin, Texas."
good,"There are days that are more stressful than others, but I enjoy the interaction with the customers, vendors, and stocking the shelves. I like that I learn something new everyday, and can see how the company processes are used to make the daily work easier."
good,"Walk in, greet current Cashier and Manager on Duty, sign in, wait for register, go to the office and sign in so that I can count my drawer in, count it in, sign my initials to acknowledge that the change for my beginning drawer is correct, sign off and go to the front so that the manager can put my drawer in.  Run the register, help customers as wanted or needed, keep the area around the register well stocked, stock the aisles as needed while making sure that the aisles near the front and in the greatest need are neat and organized, clean up spills asap, keep an eye out for misplaced items, etc.  When closing: bring everything that is outside inside, make sure that there are no customers inside before locking the doors, sweep the front and the areas that need it most, throw the trash into the back, restock the cold drinks, mop the front and the areas that need extra help, sign off, check all personal objects (bags, jackets, anything bought during shift) before leaving, manager security locks doors.  The end of Work Day.  The importance of working fast while keeping up the quality of my work and how much being personable can help everyone (customers, co-workers, and even myself) have a better day.  The Head Manager for the Dollar General at West Jefferson Street is awesome. She often works with the workers and if she sees you doing your best and improving, she will work with you even more and encourage your growth in the ranks. (Ex.: If you are a hard worker who wants to get more hours and is willing to take them on, she will let you as she is able) My co-workers were nice to"
good,"My experience with Dollar General was brief, but from my previous retail experiences, I can say that although the workload was a bit heavier (since, because of store size, you effectively do the jobs of what would be multiple employees at a larger store), the working environment was a bit more friendlier."
good,"A manager is actually kinda bad but the rest are good. She also can be disrespectful to the people she works with, and she makes rules and doesnt even follow them, she does whatever she wants."
good,"If not for the huge salary differance,would still be there,lots of training made it easy,good Dm,cared alot about your improvment"
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers. There is no hard part. I love the customers and am willing to be as curteous as possible to them.
good,"love stocking and resetting the shelves an display,doing promagram,he's cool to work with, got along fine,there  was nothing hard about the job making the customer happy."
good,I am normally running the cash register and helping customers.
good,"A typical day at work requires some freight to get done and cleaning up the store so that it is presentable the next day. I learned many new skills as a key holder. The management is well put together and the employees are team players. The hardest part is being short staffed and not being able to get help that is needed. The most enjoyable part is the people, they are all great."
good,Dollar General as a company is fine at a corporate level. As a store manager I was working 80 hours a week and received very little help from district and regional manages.
good,I could see myself advancing in the company until you tell them you need personal time and they forget what you have given to them.
good,"A typical day we would punch in, pull product out on the sales floor, divide the work and stock shelves, clean store/ grounds, unload delivery truck and check in inventory, making friendly conversation with my coworkers. The hardest part of the day was the inventory because you are add/subtracting product of the daily inventory list. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the daily costumers"
good,I really liked working for Dollar General. You can advance very fast in this company. They really care about their employees.
good,dollar general corporation is a good company. they have many opportunities for management
good,On a daily basis we are committed to overall great customer service. Have a great crew at this store.
good,I come in and make sure my area is clean and I start my day assisting customers and unloading freight and restocking the shelves
good,They provide training. Provide education .. Clean and structured environment. Friendly. Great placeto work.
good,"Assist customers, inventory, count drawers, clean up. My co-workers were pleasant."
good,"Dollar General, was a great place to work, I loved my crews that I had at every store they put me in. The only thing I didn't like was the bosses treat the store manager and ast manager like they mean nothing and don't thank them for being a 100 percent store and don't like to pay them for the time we put in."
good,"Typically products would be replenished and customers would be given quality customer service. "
good,U have good days and some bad days its all of what u make of it u learn a lot of different things and meet a lot of customers with different personalities but u just have to love them they make the day go by. U can always move up to a higher job field with the right training and being focused
good,The best part of my job is having a relationship with my customers and them knowing and trusting me and my team with their everyday needs
good,"wait on customers and help them find things, stock and recover items."
good,As my first job I enjoyed my managers and co workers. I was very pleased with my job. Jobs were completed and things got done.
good,"It depends on who is the store manager, as to what rules are enforced. The stores are great to work in, because they are in small towns and big cities."
good,"I loved walking into work and always having something to do. The customers were great and the staff was very nice. The hardest part is the unorganized chaos of a new job, where I had no prior training to be an Asst. Manager. The greatest part of this job was meeting new people and seeing the regular customers come in and leave happy when they found everything they needed. "
good,Here is where I enhanced my driving skills. I was on the second shift and the time spent here with co-workers was priceless.
good,We had fun while getting work done. It was a relaxed enviorment.
good,Flexible schedule; fast-paced; meet a lot of different customers
good,"my review was based on the month I spent working there it was a good experince but needed more time with my children"
good,Dollar General offered a good work environment with decent management. Work was based on individual production rates instead of group production rates.
good,The hardest part of this job is lifting up heavy packages. My mangers  were very nice.
good,"I love the customers - they make me laugh and make me feel good when they would rather stand in line and wait for me to cash them out as they know I will make them laugh as well"
good,"Assisted in management of store operations, stocked shelves and store recovery."
good,"Get to work about 6:00 am, watch CCTV camera from previous day! Write up daily paperwork and recount office to make sure everyting is correct. I have learned that a strong will and being dedicated to what you are doing will take you along ways. I enjoy working in management not just to make your own schedule, but for the enjoymentyou receive when your employees are happy because you make their work enviroment pleasant. The hardest part of my job is working truck, which really isn't that bad! The most enjoyable part of my job is pleasing my customers!"
good,I get along well with co-workers and customers. In addition I have moved up from cashier to asst. Mgr. but feel like I am at a stand still because of others being hired from outside the company filling Manager position instead of promoting within for qualified employees like myself.
good,"planned half of my workday, other half planned by customers;"
good,"Stayed busy on truck days other days it was very slow, overall a great place to work the hours get cut alot thats the con of it."
good,"I sign on to my register check out customers non stop for two to three hours at a time, our store is very busy. When i have the time I help to replenish merchandise. All my coworkers are good people we all work together to get things done, there is no we or I. The hardest part of my job is moping the floor at closing time. I like meeting new people, most are very interesting, there are the rare few who can be very rude."
good,Great co-workers and management team
good,"I liked working for Dollar General, there was plenty of work to do and everyone got along fine. However, pay wasn't great. They didn't offer any sort of employee discount. But, if you enjoy working in Customer Service than it's really good."
good,"Not a bad place to work. A typical work day includes stocking, and setting plan-o-grams. Ive learned to think sometimes outside of the box when something doesnt first work. My co workers are okay, besides the favoritism going on in the store. The hard part of my job is avoiding the store drama and sticking to my own. The enjoyable part of the job is when i get to focus on it and not the other stressful moments in life."
good,"Management is great, breaks are a good length, although benefits are scant."
good,I was busy from the time I clocked in until the end of my shift. I learned a lot working for this company. The management was fair. I liked working with the group of people I was working with. The hardest part was stocking the shelves on truck day. I enjoyed communicating and helping the customers.
good,"A typical day at work involves balancing the tills and setting up the registers, recovering the store and stocking the shelves, and doing return and voids. I learned how to multi-task, how to improve on customer service skills, bookkeeping the sales, and how to take inventory. Management is organized and shows good leadership. My co-workers are fun, respectable, and jumps at the opportunity to help each other. The hardest part of my job is keeping track of the daily changes.The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers."
good,Good benefits and company offers advancement. I enjoyed being able to move around and multi tasking.
good,"pushing or pulling displays from one side to the other, i learned to work better in a bigger group of people, my coworkers were the best always willing to help when you needed. the hardest part was moving the shelves still fully stocked. lunk was the most enjoyable part hour and a half."
good,It was a fun and interesting job! I made new friends and met new people everyday!
good,"Count my daily register, Get started on daily assingment and run the register while putting up stock. 8:30 start cleaning up store and get ready to close. Managers were very nice and understanding and keep me working hard and made me a stronger worker. Co-workers was just like friends and very well rounded and positive people to be around. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep it organized for weekly visits. I enjoyed the customers and mangement and co-workers and see the store clean."
good,"I worked here through college, and overall, it wasnt that bad. However, towards the end, we did get new management, and I eventually had to quit because of management. But like I said, that was towards the end of my employment. They worked around my school schedule and gave me regular breaks."
good,"I enjoyed my job, because I am a huge people person, and I got to interact with people everyday. No day was the same."
good,Keeps selves stocked sweep and mop whole store. Run cash register. Unload trucks.
good,with cutting my hours thats when i decided to work for family dollar
good,"Stocking, helping customers, and help clean the store."
good,co workers are good to be around fast place to work in was a plus for me
good,"assist the guest with purchases , assist the team member , clean the store and collect carts outside"
good,managing other employees
good,"Dollar General was very easy to get through day to day, you get your angry customes but I learned to smile and keep on with the day. I learned that I can deal with any kind of customer, I love to clean because I did a lot of that, and I learned that I enjoy working hard. The hardest part of the job was having to put up the stock & tend to the customers at the same time; however, I learned how to manage doing both at the same time. I enjoy myy co-workers & customers the most. My co-workers & I became a little family."
good,stock shelves and unload shipments and make orders and open and close store and manage co-workers schedules and other manager duties. i learned managerial duties and somewhat how to run a business. management was very good it was reasonable and manager was kind and helped when he could. great co-workers very hard workers and friendly to customers and each others. hardest part was the long hrs and on call 24/7. most enjoyable part was the freedom and great work environment.
good,I enjoyed the fast pace. Seeing old friends and new faces.
good,"Great place to work. Very family oriented, great discount prices."
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with conflict but was able to handle it well.
good,Busy...busy...busy
good,A typical day there was maintaining a clean register area & helping customers the hardest part was finding enough time in the day to get everything done. I really enjoyed the customers & i worked there a long time so i no alot them & they no me & i would conversate with them all. The managment was friendly as well as my co-workers it took us all workin together to get the jobs accomplished. I have learned you treat people the same way you would want to be treated & to always be cortious & friendly & they will keep comeing back to shop.
good,"customer service and retail sales, checking out customers, mopping, recovering the store at night and sweeping the floors"
good,"It was a regular day. I learned mostly out this job that working hard is the most important thing, The management was well done. My co workers were great. The hardest part of this job was lifting. I enjoed the break."
good,"Working at DG was great the people there were awesome. management did nothing but sit there and company wouldnt get rid of the manager because ""legal reasons"" according to what i was told! Company didnt care about employees all that much. pretty much if you could read you could work there. most of the co workers were too good for the job but worked to live... i loved it there but idk if id ever go back"
good,"Great people to work with and fun,exciting,fast paced environment."
good,a typical day at work is sometimes busy. i learned that it is so much to do in so little time. the management there is good. my co-worker are good. i think the hardest part of the job but not that hard is i would say closing sometimes. the most enjoyable part of the job is i would say seeing new customers
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new skils, new ways to manage time and helping the customers."
good,Dollar General is a decent job but I believe they have too high of work standards for just the cashier positions. You must be the flexible type or you have no chance for keeping your job.
good,"Very fast paced and focused environment with an emphasis on professionalism, personal development, and attention to detail."
good,this company is great to work for if your seeking part time employment. a fast paste work environment that requires lots of potential and energy. must have great customer services.
good,Dollar General is a solid company. They supply a bonus once per year and you can have a good future with them if you do your job.
good,I loved the customers at my location. Really made my job fun and exciting. Felt like i was really helping instead of just doing a job. Not a whole lot of room for moving up though.
good,"This job, is a perfect first job for any new individuals who are willing to have experience at a retail store before managing to work more hours in another job similar to a cashier"
good,Great company just needs some help with the way it's managed needs more care and attention to much back Freight not enough staff. Needs better training program and better registers
good,Schedules are always put up by Thursday evenings and ready to be reviewed online and on paper. The manager is very open and pushes employees to move further in the company. The manager is always willing to work with employees scheduled if given enough notice. She looks to see if others are taking lead or if they need help in areas of work performance.
good,The wages are must lower than what the job calls for. With a small crew it make it seem like you are doing a lot of work for such little pay. The wages and hours are not enough to do this type of job.
good,"I love my coworkers"
good,"I really enjoyed my time working as a store manager for Dollar General until they redistributed stores and I got a terrible DM. Until then my store was always soaring and recognized as one of the top in the district.  I was given creative freedom and trust to run my store efficiently. I had well below average shrink and the store was always kept clean. My staff was wonderful and you could see their happiness with their jobs in their performance. All of that changed with the new DM. He came in and micromanaged every aspect and because of that morale changed completely. I even lost some of my best staff. So I too took another position elsewhere. It was a sad day to leave the company, but I want to work for someone who trusts and believes in my managerial skills."
good,During my time at Dollar General in the beginning everything was okay then the General manager started not coming to work and never doing what she was supposed to do and we as well as the assistant manager had to pick up the slack of her mess.
good,"All you had to do was make sure that the customer was happy, stock the stuff that needs to be stock, and make sure to straighting everything before you leave, and know what you are doing!!"
good,It was great getting more familiar with my community and drawing close to their generosity for your help and kindness towards them. There were a few moments that were out of our hands to fix at times and customers seemed to take to strongly on their reactions when nothing could be solved at the moment of a situation occurring.
good,The staff I worked with were very friendly and kind. The manager was very tempermental and didn't have great communication skills leading to misunderstandings throughout all staff members.
good,"I loved working at the hopedale OH location. My manager there was caring and very helpful when I moved I went to the Bridgeport OH location and it was awful I only worked there for a month"
good,"Lots of stocking and being on register which I do not mind at all. Very fast paced which I like a lot, makes the time go by faster. It has taught me being better at my time management skills."
good,"This job is an extremely fast paced job that requires walking, bending,heavy and light lifting.  They offer plenty of overtime and the pay is good "
good,Corporate could have been better to the management and rest of the employees. Loved being in charge at times and showing the customers great services.
good,"Fun place to work at but sometimes the customer are rude. You'll work at the resister 90% of the time the other 10% your cleaning or stocking. The manager is awesome and helps you if you don't know something, she's taught me so much."
good,"Customer service is our main priority, making sure every customer was happy with their experience and help every customer find what they were searching for"
good,"Decent store level management, average pay for the area.  District/regional managers do not allow the hours for the stores to be stocked to their appropriate levels.  Cashiers are left alone on shifts, sometimes for hours at a stretch."
good,"working at Dollar General was a good experience. yo sound always be truthful, and shouldn't take advantage of them or the store. it's a good lace to work with good management. the team work could be a little better. the hardest part of the job would be the other workers slacking and you having to pick the slack up. most enjoyable part of the job would have been meeting all the different people, and engaging in conversions."
good,Working at dollar general was a mediocre experience with some awesome management thrown into the mix. My managers were really nice and I always felt comfortable going to them with any questions or concerns
good,"While working at Dollar General I had a great experience with my manager. She made working there better with the sure-can attitude. However, the new hires/associates were very abrupt at times and unreliable. You would get constant call-ins because of them so you would have to change plans. That meant that our manager had to reluctantly call every person on the list, but being a reliable worker I would take on the majority of it. It's a good starter job that I would recommend to get experience, but one that I wouldn't want anyone to stay working at for a long period of time unless you're in a fickle with your finances. While working there as a key holder, you would have to make extra sure that vendors are doing their jobs correctly. That's right, you have to sometimes babysit them doing their job so they don't rush out and not do a proper presentation."
good,"Sales Manger Assistant, Customer service, Head Cashier, Reconciliation report and make daily Deposit transactions reports at the end of the day, Stock Inventory of all items, Receptionist"
good,The work isn't to bad however the hours aren't constant or consistent but overall not a bad second job. If anyone is working and want a second job I would highly recommend dollars General as a side job however not a good main job unless you become promoted I believe.
good,"A typical day at work in Dollar General all depends on the day of the week it falls on. But every day, I either come in before the store opens (generally an hour before) and get the store set up for the day's business, or come in to relieve a manager and close the store at the time of closing (generally 30 minutes after closing). If it's truck day, I would stage my receiving room to receive the truck and work the truck as it's coming in and continue to work it until the end of my shift. I would set my team members up with drawers to take care of customers' purchases and relieve them if we get busy. I would handle disgruntled customers along with employees as well. I would make a schedule once a week and have 3 weeks of schedule up so my team would be able to create a good home life balance. A happy team, makes a happy me. Teamwork is a strong stand point for me, and I feel if you have the right team in place, it's hard for you to fail at anything. I would straighten up shelves as I walk through the store and ensure there are enough product on the shelves from our receiving room and from our vendors. I would partner with vendors to create a strong relationship with them to ensure my store was in good standings from a vendors point of view. There is a system depending g on the day, whether that be work on certain departments ts on certain days, and it's a cycle. As long as you maintain that cycle , it can be the easiest job you can have."
good,The main focus at DG is to have great team players. Its takes a dedicated friendly crew. I'm willing to go back to work for this company. No over night. Friendly customer service.
good,"Working at Dollar general was a great job. I loved working with the costumers as well as the employees. At Dollar general I started as a cashier which I was quickly promoted to a MOD which is a Manager On duty my duty as a MOD was helping the main cashier with issues they had, doing returns, stocking shelf's, and nighty bank deposits and closing the store"
good,the management was not the best. a lot of times got stuck alone with no other help and became very stressful. I would cover people who called out but when I had to work sick.
good,"I really loved the environment working there. Management could have been better and schedules were a conflicting issue. Although, I did have plenty of opportunities to grow or advance on a professional level."
good,Working for dollar general was a great experience that definitely had it's cons! If you don't wanna spend alot of time at home Dollar General is the job for you!  Other than my complaint about quality time with family. Dollar general is a great job to have!!
good,It was fun helping restock shelves and getting to know the other employees even though we had to work off the clock a good bit. It was very rewarding because you got to meet new people everyday.
good,"Dollar General was an excellent company to work for. Although, with their labor model, a salaried manager will have difficulty managing a work/life balance, there is plenty of opportunity to advance within the company. Management strives to promote within ti encourage a strong foundation of dedicated leaders to run the day-to-day operations."
good,I only worked at Dollar General for 5 weeks due to personal reasons but my time there was exactly what I expected. I cashiered and stocked shelves between customers. My co-workers were great and easy to be around. My boss was nice and I wasn't afraid to approach her with problems. Application/interview/training was easy and quick.
good,Well the hardest part about working at Dollar general is probably having to deal with some of the customers that come through. Some can be very difficult to deal with.
good,"Great traiing! Monthly incentives! Competiitve and fun place to work."
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar General because I always had something to do. My mind was constantly busy and I think that is a very good thing. Also the possibility of growing with the company was a huge plus.
good,Good learning experience. Enjoy interacting with customers. My direct manager s knowledges and willingness to share and put me in a position to someday manage my own store was invaluable
good,I was able to work when I needed and make my own schedule.It was a relaxed environment that I could pace myself in. I travelled between several stores.
good,A great place to work. A great place to work if you love to work with people. Everybody always have an smile on there face. Management is great. The hardest part is recovering.
good,Easy to advance and grow. All the training was provided. The demands are changing and becoming harder for one person to maintain. Store managers are responsible for absolutely everything and its alot for one person.
good,Enjoyed my customer service duties. Management created a new position for me to greet the customers and invited me on conference calls regarding customer service.
good,"It's honestly not bad, key holders work their butt off tho and and managers get blamed for everything that. But it's not bad if you like to move and move fast"
good,Dollar general showed me how to be a hardworking and dedicated worker. Dollar general Showed me how to work as a team worker and also work on my own and work to where I didn’t need anybody for help.
good,"Dollar General has a very laid-back and relaxed environment. Steady hours and average pay, with great co-workers. Overall it's a very pleasant place to work."
good,The work here is easy and the people are usually noce. A lot of people steal things on a daily basis. It is also very hard to get the amount of work done that we need too when one person has to stock and also run the register.
good,"In my experience, my store manager was amazing. She made working there enjoyable and interesting. She always kept the store running smoothly, which made everyone's job easier. Because of that, I believe Dollar General can be a very notable place to work, especially in the early working years."
good,"I would recommend Dollar General to anyone that wants to build their career and have job stability. The company strives to get people in to work and has a very good dedicated training program, and their turnover is just like any other DC, and not entirely of the company, it also has to do with the individual. In all a good company to work for, excellent Human Resources Department and great benefits for associates and management."
good,Good for part time. Lots of stuff to do but not enough staff to do it with. Needed to either pay better or give more hours to keep people working. To many responsibilities for the lowest person on the pay role.
good,fun and fast paced. manager requirements took a little long to grasp but work was great. the pace of the job would be both fast and steady pace and the scheduling and management roles were easy to fill after you get use to them
good,With one employee on leave with a new baby we were already short handed when I became extremely ill. I was not harassed. I was given time for the meds to work and to heal. And I still have a job.
good,"You get close to certain customers who are regulars. you learn something new everyday, nothing cant be fixed. if you have a problem, thats what the manager is for. Overall a nice place to work."
good,"The hardest part is balancing running registers while you are stocking shelves, keeping recovery done, cleaning, and giving good customer service. The best part of the job is getting to know you're customers .there is always opportunity of advancement."
good,"Okay place to work needs better management and lack of communication skills, it is a good place for first job but not for people who have worked a lot"
good,Dollar General pushes you hard to get stocking done in a short period if time. Very tough work!! The pay doesn't match the amount of work you have to do in the time you have to do it in. Most of time you can't complete the goals they set for you.
good,While I was there I had a wonderful time. I was excited to go to work every day. My boss was basically like my mother and my co workers were my family. It was nice. We were all appreciated for hard work and always held to a high standard and rewarded when we did good.
good,I liked meeting new people and helping customers find what they needed. The work pass was easy to handle. The different tasks was easy to accomplish and none stressful.
good,I love my customers and my associates. I always tried to perform my best while working. I didn't think that the store manager at the time performed their duties like they were suppose to.
good,"I worked at Dollar General for a year and it is a ok place, but it is not a place I would work for a long time. I worked there just to get by while looking for a better job."
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General. It was an easy going work environment with very likable co-workers. The store manager really did her best to accommodate everyone's hours with their children's school hours.
good,"When i first started working there I didnt make very much money, but within the first week I had already received two raises and collected more as i worked there, and evemtually.made my way to assistant manager. The job was great for the most part but couldnt sustain me financially unfortunately. I think the job would be best for students."
good,I had a great experience working for Dollar General. My manager was a good guy and the work itself wasn't hard and I actually enjoyed going to work. I just wish it had paid a little more.
good,"Dollar General is an amazing place to work, I loved it so much. It was my very first job, I learned much more communication skills, and how to properly stock shelves, etc. The hardest part of my job was leaving, it was very enjoyable while I worked there."
good,My work experience while at Dollar General was great. It taught me communication skills and helped me to become a better person all together. I love my DG crew
good,I have so far enjoyed my time at Dollar General. With previous shift running experience I was able to move up to a part time key holder fairly quickly. Hours vary weekly but if you need a flexible schedule it's great.
good,Order pullers worked at a feverous pace to make production. The 6AM start and shift to 10 hour workdays make it a physical challenge to work here. It is rewarding if you can handle the physical stress. pay is good.
good,"the establishment is great and fun to work for, but i was suffering financially and had to change jobs. i still shop there because i trust the products."
good,"I did the normal, cashed people out at the register, stocked and cleaned. It was always an upbeat, stay busy type of job. It was fun but I think that I really just love being in an store environment."
good,I got let go because of a transaction failure . They was workers who never did their job and then the next day me and another worker had to clean up their mess.
good,Ive been there a year this month and i love the job and my customers but i do not approve of the Manager being gone all the time and having to work 7 days a week because of coverage problems. I was told i would be trained to have my own store but has not happened yet.
good,"My coworkers where very pleasant to work with. Got to meet a lot of interesting people everyday. I got to be in charge, due to my status of my job there."
good,The district manager was horrible was not for the people was for the money! When my kids was sick I wasn’t allowed to take a day off even if it was covered to attend to my kids
good,while the company is limited on benefits and work place advancements; it does treat it employees fairly and is open to resolving most issues. A good manager is the best way to have a good work environment.
good,I really enjoyed working at Dollar General and overall it is a good company to work for. The down side is that at times you never really know what your schedule is going to be. This makes work life balance really hard if you have kids. They do try to work with you to give you time off needed to take care of family but don't make any plans for vacation time. Chances of promotions are really good as they hire from within more often than not.
good,"The coworkers are nice, the pay is alright, you get paid weekly. Fast paced at times. They keep you busy. You have goals to meet everyday.  The customers are great!"
good,The job was good and having fewer individuals inside the store was challenging at times but it worked better in the end. I would say the most enjoyable part was talking to the customers.
good,"Working at Dollar General was comfortable environment. Training could have been better, but help understanding tasks after was fine. Enjoyable to interact with customers."
good,"Enjoyed working with  the manager and employees, loved helping customers, stocking shelves, learning the job to help with  other employees, good team player"
good,Cool and laid back. Customers may have certain requests and we are required to make sure they are met to the best of our ability. Management is nevr a problem.
good,Dollar General is a great place to work. The pay is not so great so I would work it as a second job during the summer at this time. When I need a job or extra money I apply at DG first.
good,Loved working with my customers. Loved everything I had to do on a day to day basis. I worked there long enough to know that no matter what 1 bad manager can take everyone down.
good,"Great place to start out. You can quickly advance. Flexible hours so college students can earn some extra money. Would not recommend as a career choice unless you plan to advance to Store management position or beyond, Pay isn't that great compared to other retail."
good,I enjoyed being able to move around most of the day and not sitting/standing still. helped with customers.  help with unloading truck and moving carts into the backroom
good,Stay calm don't get your panties in a bind the customers are always right even though they maybe  wrong they are right.dont let your people you know talk you into doing anything you know is wrong
good,"Dollar general is a fast paced stressful environment.  Loved my customer,  adored my employees. Promotions at the beginning came quick. District managers change semi annually,  or so it would seem. The company overall is structured decently, but each DM I have have over the past 5 years has gone a different direction. Making it hard to keep up."
good,"Management was very childish. It's under new management and I was asked to return, but I'm having a hard time getting back in the establishment because of the no rehire the old management put on my application."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for dollar general, the only reason I had to put in my two week notice was a lack of available hours. When I was hired I was told it would be a full time position but unfortunately the management switched right after I started there and new management told me they had no idea why I had been offered a full time position as there were no full time positions even available at that time."
good,"Their HR Department is filled with bright people and mentors/management that are great. In HR it's almost expected that you move from department to department to gain an overall HR core set of skills and they want you to promote and learn and build a career.  Nearly all managers are fair, and good to work for, there is annual performance based teamshare, cafeteria on site, gym on site, daycare on site, pretty pleasant work setting, and just some really wonderful people. "
good,needs more benefits. hardest part there was when customers swarmed to the cashier and your trying to hurry up and get them rang up answer there questions watch everything to make sure everything is okay ect.
good,I enjoyed my time employed with this company we had a good staff and we all worked well together I hated when the store closed . I have even applied several times recently and would not mind going back .
good,You have to get at the right store because I worked at a different store a few times and it was horrible. Also we changed store managers a lot!! I guess no one liked being the manager over our specific store.
good,"n/a "
good,"Id start my shift off by grabbing my till, taking into office counting it in. And reviewing cctv, security cameras, check on employees, then begin to run register, and amongst other things. Stocking shelves, unloading truck"
good,"Working there was a challenge at times. It’s a very fast-paced job, There is never anything to do. It teaches you to feel comfortable talking with strangers."
good,Working at Dollar General changed my whole mindset on how mangers treat the workers and how the communication between the two are supposed to conducted without coming to a disagreement.
good,this job really was fun. i was able to work in every area of position. seasonal time was energetic and working to set up the store for holidays was great.
good,I ran the register and communicated with customers. i learned how to run daily reports and make deposits. i loved all the people i was able to meet. i loved working there.
good,"A lot of moving around, never getting to sit still, always something to do. I had a lot of paperwork that had to be completed every week, my boss was a great person who always worked with you on anything."
good,"I learned dollar general's work methods. My manager was really friendly. The job was really easy, didn't have to do much. They were very unorganized though, I've noticed that with about any dollar general I've been in though."
good,"I had a good time working here. small store and regular customers made the job an easy place to get used to."
good,This job wasnt that bad . Just do what the management needs you to do and your day will go smooth its mostly a stocking and cleaning around the store job and watching out for people that steal.
good,It was fun place to work at and it taught me how to stock well.I also enjoy my managers they wasn’t mean at all and they did a lotta work and they didn’t just put the work on the part timers.
good,"A typical day at DG is usually busy. We work are hardest to get customers in and out of the store. On top of this, we make sure the store is clean and organized."
good,"clock in, see what the board says. check people out, stock shelves.  sweep, front face, keep eye out for thieves. greet people, make drops and at end of day count your tell"
good,Working at dollar general taught me alot about working in  retail. Dollar general was one of my most favorite jobs. For anyone that is looking for a company you can grow in and achieve I would highly recommend this place for employment.
good,"Working at this place was very nice, it's a great first job to have. Hours are flexible but sometimes not. The place was usually calm, except around 3-5 pm. Over all, its a great place. Just make sure you can stand a long time.. Oh also, it pays minimum wage.. $7.25 an hour."
good,"Great workplace, friendly, simple to learn everyone is all about teamwork you can learn and experience the inventory and see how they receive store items. .Guidance on trying to be"
good,Very fast pace. Workflow set. Enjoyable interacting with the community schedule set and can request days off in advance. Not hard work just busy work  I enjoyed the experience
good,"I had the best coworkers ever at this job. The customers treat you horribly, especially when you have to ask for ID when they are purchasing alcohol or cigarettes."
good,Overall not a bad retail environment. But the constant cutting of hours and constant pressure to do even more with even less is stressful to say the least.
good,Great place to work but your hours are never the same and get cut so it would be a great second job. They don't have enough people to work either so you stock and do everything on your own.
good,"It was fun to work there. Always busy interacting with customers,helping them find what they need or cashing them out. We also stayed busy stocking. I also stayed busy clening and mopping front of store and restrooms."
good,"In the short time I was with the company, I was considered for a General Manager position in 6 months. Unfortunately, due to  workplace injuries I was unable to stay with the company."
good,Love this job!!!  Left for a few months and missed my customers.  Couldn't get back fast enough.   This job has its ups and downs like all jobs but the company is a good one to work for.   If you do your job they will let you know appreciated you are.
good,Working for this company was a fun experience. I loved the coworkers I had. I learned how to run their register and how to put the truck up. I also learned that the amount of stress you deal with isn't worth the pay. I worked for this company for a year and I will be honest I had a great time but they just wouldn't work with my schedule.
good,I loved working at Dollar General it’s be my most favorite job since I started working. I love people and I’m a people person. I love to put stock up.
good,"This is a nice little job, however one must be wary and careful of how one acts if one wants to get up to a suitable position."
good,Great company to work for if u r willing to work hard.  Flexible hours depending on which store you work at. Great customer service and very clean.  Was 1 of my favorite jobs.
good,"Working at Dollar General gave  a chance to learn all about customer service.I really wanted to advance with the Company, but the opportunity never arrived."
good,"A typical workday involves; greeting customers, understanding how to work a cash register, simple math, stocking products, cleaning facility after closing."
good,"I would like to come back to DG, I got along with everyone. But I can only work part time. I loved all my customers, we had many mangers at our store sometimes that could make it a little crazy."
good,I enjoy working at Dollar General and don’t have many complaints. The only thing I really don’t like is that the pay is not great or even very good at all.
good,"Quick paced "
good,The customers in the area were mostly friendly and the management team was very helpful. Not many full time postitions available due to the lack of hours allowed for scheduling and management was usually left in the store by themselves for a few hours daily for the same reason.
good,"Was always trying to have fun while working, be it singing to the radio, dancing abit at the register and trying to make jokes with the customers. I had only left because I was offered a better position at a different company."
good,"It was a great workplace they just don’t pay enough. Minimum wage unless you are management, the job itself was awesome but they pay is what I didn’t like about it."
good,"Dollar general is a great company to work for and all, but the job can be a little stressful. The branch I work at is usually ran by two people: myself and one of my coworkers. The store is often times opened with only one person working that day, which is very dangerous. The company itself is a great company to work for. The pay is decent and your boss tends to be very flexible with your schedule as you need it."
good,Dollar General is a fast paced job. You have to constantly move at a steady pace in order to maintain your 95% or higher. It's very common that you will not received that 95% while working 12 hours a day for 5 or 6 days a week. The supervisor are great(some of them). Managers are okay with some employers and with others they just don't care. The only good thing about Dollar General is the pay.
good,"Extremely hard work, but I loved it! You were able to run your store with not to much interference with the DM. As long as you followed company rules. I had the same crew for years and it was just a really great company to work for"
good,Allowing some employees to get overtime at certain times. More help with daily workflow. More employees on same shift. Allowing more time for certain tasks. Better training. Better security as far as video inside and outside to cut down on robbies. Holiday pay for employees that work that certain day. Better training means employees can handle customers in better ways.
good,I really enjoyed working at DG i just didn't like the fact that i could never call in if needed. And we were always short handed so it started getting to the point where i was there more than at home and it really started to hurt me as a single mother. However the people i worked with were great. It was kinda like a second family. Everyone was there for each other. If they were to up the wages to a decent amount i would diffiently go back to DG but after having a second child i couldn't afford to work there.
good,Great place to work if you don't mind it being hot. Fast paced. Good people to work with. Supervisors are pretty cool. They send you to other areas to work alot though.
good,Your experience at Dollar General is different based on who your manager is. I personally had a wonderful manager but other employees made things difficult. But overall it wasn’t a bad experience and I learned a lot.
good,"putting out truck in 2 days,the customers are the best.enjoyed working there.If you have a good crew it can be a good place to work.If everyone doesn't pull together,it really makes it hard.Didnt like having to be open on thanksgiving an Christmas."
good,As a first job working at a Dollar General store it's great to get some cashier experience and basic knowledge of how the retail industry works. Working at a Dollar General store isn't as stressful as working at a big store such as Walmart where things can get chaotic with hundreds of customers asking about a giant store so you get eased into the retail business rather than thrown in.
good,"One of my favorite places to be other then with my daughter and family. My manager was awesome, understanding to daily life. Would definitely go back if my old manager was still there"
good,I loved working at Dollar General! I loved my manager and co workers. They are like family. I still call my former manager sister. It was an awesome place
good,"I had just had my first baby before starting work at Dollar General . i started as a cashier and within a year i was moved to a shift leader and would travel to different stores to manage and work with others to get the new stores up and going for grand openings. i was promised a management position , that i never got , instead a new applicant got the position. I put my 2 weeks notice in and moved on to other opportunities as i thought i could've had advancement in the company . I was wrong !"
good,"I loved working at a Dollar General especially when I was going to school. They work with hours. I decided to leave because a family member was sick. They could not offer more hours so I could pay bills for the family. So I left for a better paying job. I also understood why they could not offer more hours, because they had more associates than normal. I would definitely go back to work for a Dollar General now that I no longer have to pay family bills and my own."
good,"Laidback sometimes, maybe busy for up to a hour. Some people are nice, other don’t mind being rude. Went through 2 managers & 3 asst. managers they where all nice."
good,"As an assistant manager at Dollar General I can say it is a decent, friendly environment to work in. At times it can be stressful and challenging. You’re constantly moving and on your feet. I enjoyed working here and learned many things and progressed with this company."
good,It's a ok company you can work for if you don't have a family.  I like the job most days. But when a stressful situation arises no will help. Have had to pull allot of doubles. The pay is not the best
good,"A typical day work included facing the store checking out and greeting customers, making sure the deposit for the next shift was balanced correctly, and making sure the store looked and was full at all times"
good,"good to work with people that are nice and friendly, manager is helpful and part of the team. Good start up job for someone wanting to move up slowly and save up good money."
good,Work environment was good had some great customers. Employees work wood as a team but couldn't work under conditions of my boss have some disagreement
good,The job is fulfilling and challenging in thw since of the things that need to do done. The seasonal changes are a bare but after all is said and done that store is in great condition. Being a part of a new store makes things run smoother. The management personnel really know there stuff and know what to do if asked questions.
good,"Pretty easy job, just looking for better pay and something more along the line of what I want to do. Love the store I work at, has really great people and management."
good,I enjoyed very much working here. Stocking the shelves and running supply would be my only complaint. They would time that and I would literally have to sweat and run to finish.
good,My issue is you have store managers and district managers that puxk and choose which sops to fellow and which ones not to and they are quick to throw others under the bus.. Once I advanced up the latter it got better but kens district is the best to work for he cares about his employees where the other two do not
good,I really liked the job because I like reacting with the customers  im a people person. Also because the job gets paid weekly. I would recommend the job
good,Would not return to this job. They should train their managers alot better. And thay expect way to much for one person to do and do not know how to speak to you as a person
good,"I loved Working For Dollar General. I think Relocation without Transferring was one of my worst decisions. It's fun, energetic and Flexible. I would definitely encourage friends to apply."
good,My district manager was great but the store management where I was were dishonest and thieves.There was many days that the job was very enjoyable but not every day. Sadly.
good,The environment I work at is very well put. We work hard and work very well together. The people I work with all understand each other and the customers we service are just as amazing . The location of our store provides us with many amazing people and it’s a joy to work at this store.
good,"A majority of my time at DG was enjoyable, but with all jobs there are always some downsides. Sometimes I didn't have my schedule on time and other times I had it way ahead of time, and it all falls back on the kind of manager you have."
good,"I actually liked working there but the management was good, it just felt unprofessional to me. I felt like I had to do everything at one which was impossible to do."
good,Great coworkers and customers. Store was very clean and easy to locate produces as well as navigating customers around the store. only problem was management make schedule that suits them.
good,The people at dollar general were nice and friendly Management does work with you in most cases of family and personal issues. The hardest part of the job was stocking the store.  They wanted you to put up a truck within a time frame no matter how large or small.
good,"A typical work day would begin with morning stretches. Then we would be onto picking the orders for the whole day. Its not too bad you can go at a steady pace, i preferred to go at a faster pace as i enjoyed making a game out of it to see if i could beat my highscore."
good,"I loved working at Dollar General. Sometimes it was fast-paced other times it was slow-paced. It got stressful at times with no manager but we pulled through until we got 1.  My hours started getting cut because, more people got hired on and they were only allowed to work their employees so many hours per week. It wasn't the place for me since i was trying to raise a 5 year old with a part-time job."
good,You have to have tough skin to work there and a very professional attitude. The co-workers are great. But DG doesn't take our safety seriously which needs improvement.
good,"Dollar General work pace can vary from store to store. Still, there is a lot to get done on a typical shift. From running register to stocking, and doing recovery, you always have something to work on."
good,"It was ok working there but sometimes I work go straight to work after school. I would have to change in the restroom and I would take my backpack off the car so when I had my lunch time I would study a little bit but the Assisant Manager got mad cause I took my backpack. He made me felt uncomfortable, as if I was stealing from the store."
good,Back when I worked at dollar general the manager was so friendly sadly he literally would try and over work you if he could and the pay sucked especially living in iowa but overall if I had to work  there again I would if your willing to work as many hours as possible your checks would be pretty nice
good,My manager was pretty awesome with her employees to a certain extent. I have no bad words for her. A typical day at work was always busy and exciting. You never really knew what was going to happen. Hardest part of my job was not being to complete my daily task due to being so busy.
good,the store is peaceful and tend to have great customers. the only issue i have is the pay and they aren't offering full time at the store i currently work. but i never intended to work at this store for long. only because of my own goals
good,i loved the job. the advancement were great. but this company dont like to pay. i stay busy in i learned alot in meet alot of people.this company love to under staff you.
good,"The most important thing that I learned from Dollar General is how to multi-task. One minute I'm one the floor stocking. The next minute I'm one the register. I always had something to do. Management was good for the most part. The workplace is peaceful most of the time. The hardest part of the job was the management. Not bad but could've been better. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the customers. Whether they are good or bad, they are the most important part of almost any work place and I enjoyed all of the interactions."
good,"I came into work and set up the drawers for the day and the daily planner, scheduling the employees for the daily tasks to be completed.  balanced the changed box and did the previous days paperwork.  during the course of the work shift, I received drop shipments, waited on customers, handled returns and complaints, answered the phone, and did any office work plus the daily projects that were scheduled for the day.  i worked on truck and stocking, scanning out damages for inventory purposes.    "
good,"Dollar General is a potentially good company to work for, but upper management requires a lot of time and flexibility The company trains its people and provides very good benefits for their managers."
good,High school job and benefits that you get paid weekly but pay is not great and no benefits. But fun job get to meet different people and interact with guest.
good,As long as you have got good team members in that store. It is a good job to start your career or to grow with them and advance your position with the team.
good,"Hours are inconsistent, but you can normally get however many you like. Advanced to an assistant manager fairly quick. You will get reimbursed for gas if you have to use your own car for a bank deposit."
good,"Dollar General was one of my favorite jobs. I liked stocking the shelves and interacting with the customers. When I helped a customer find a product they were looking for, it brought me so much joy."
good,"Dollar General is a good corporation to work for. A sales associate position is a good position to start from but not one to make a career out of. You are expected to work quickly and be friendly, helpful and respectful. Your work experience entirely depends on the store you work in because each store, the managers there, and the community the store is in is different. Overall Dollar General has a low turn over rate so long as you complete your tasks and do your job well. The company does push for customer satisfaction to a high degree, so expect to have to learn how to go above and beyond for a customer when necessary."
good,I personally didnt like dollar general . the management there wasnt very good at all. the hours were awful. i wanted to get out of the retail business.
good,Working at Dollar General was not an awful time- the customers were the issue. I've been in retail for over a year and a half now and Dollar General was something else. I enjoyed the friends I made out of the people I worked with and they made the job worth it.
good,"My time at Dollar General consisted of a fast-paced work environment, job advancement opportunities, opportunities to connect with customers daily, and job security."
good,"It's a great place to work but it can become very stressful. Employees that have worked their for years are treated with less respect then new employees. On the plus side, you do have fun sometimes while you work."
good,"Typical work days are relaxed."
good,Very fast paced. Assist customers with checkouts of products or questions or concerns customers have. Scanned products for correct counts and outs to be ordered. Submitted payroll weekly. Checked budget daily for hours and pay. Assisted with vendors. Checked in truck from warehouse.
good,"Customer service was my favorite part of the job. If a customer was unhappy in any way it was my job to make them happy. My sayings was ""what can I do to fix this""?"
good,Job was good but pay was not enough compared to hours given. Management can be the difference from making the job fun or stressful. Customers made my day better sometimes.
good,"At dollar General you are treated not just as an employee but as a friend and a member of the team. Everyone works together to complete the daily tasks and in General everyone enjoys it !! We do our best to focus on ""customer first"" and our hard work shows in the cleanliness of the store and the happiness of our customers!!"
good,Management was great! They satisfied every customer. Big smiles and always active. Made the co-workers feel comfortable and was always cautious. The only hard part about the job was the rude customers but knowing how to deal with it helped out a lot.
good,"I love working for dollar general,  I like meeting new people and I love talking to the customers that come in they all know me by name and it make my day."
good,"Advancement is possible if you are a hard worker,  the only really bad thing is they don't have enough workers there at a time. I generally worked by myself or with one other person so you weren't able to complete your tasks."
good,"People come and go constantly and it’s really easy to apply and to get the job itself . However it does take an toll on your life. Sometimes not always working the time your supposed to, being calling in on your day off"
good,Open store and do daily paperwork. Set up registers. Daily plan then is prepared. Look into start and begging any task . Do banking procedures.Customer service
good,okay place to work all according to what kind of team you have.you have to be prepared to handle any situations that comes your way.can move up very fast
good,Its a good place to work the only draw back is the pay you get for the job you do...Training could use some work as somethings you learn while doing yes but are questionable.
good,While working for this company I learned how to work by my self with little to no help at all.  The manager was almost always there but not to helpful.  The most enjoyable part of this job was being so close to home and not having to drive very far.  Other than that I did not enjoy my time at all.
good,"While working with Dollar General was part time. I worked has if it was not a part time position. Working on the weekend, working over thirty hours a week."
good,"A typical day with working with dollar general was decent at times it was rough but was able to to get through quite a few situations. while working at dollar general I learned how to operate with the computer system an was able to do things like returns, exchanges,an or even abort a transaction, along with doing deposits an running reports on the sales associates when their shifts are over.The workplace culture of working there was fairly decent somedays were better than others.The hardest part of the job was sometimes on having to please an angry customer or when an employee has had a bad day an wanting to be able to comfort them.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiling faces on employees an customers they always for the most part had their ways of brightening a bad day in a great one."
good,It a great place to work but  truck and customer suck. It gets old after a while but they take care of their employees. definitely good for a small part time job.
good,Fun and laid back work environment. Great customer interactions. Friendly staff members. Easy and fun work place. Simple tasks to complete. Looked forward to going to work.
good,"Things can get chaotic on truck days, but overall, a good place to work. There is always something to do. You get paid weekly, which is really convient."
good,My manager was amazing and a hard working woman. A typical day at work was always busy. There was always something to do. I learned how to effectively solve complex problems with customers who would have immediate problems and demand attention right away. I also learned how to manage a team effectively in the absence of the store manager. The hardest part of the job was when people would decide to call out of work at the last minute and I would have to stay at work from open until close. It began to take over family time. Dealing with people stealing and being caught. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone pulled together to get projects done such as holiday setups and when the sales hit and the store became flooded with customers.
good,Great place to work. Fast advancement. Can be tedious at times. Lots of production required from individual. Management is extremely friendly and helpful. Long work weeks.
good,An average day at work insisted of me going in at 6am-10am stocking shelves and unloading truck. I learned more customer service skills and helping the community with locating idems. The hardest part of my job was lifting the heavy boxes of house hold idems such as bleach and laundry detergent.
good,Dollar General is a great place for a first job or for someone without a big family...It is a lot of physical work and you have to be fit..Other than that i love it
good,"I liked working at dollar general. I wish I could've gotten paid more from them though. It was kind of boring just standing there sometimes. Being the cashier and stuff I like a harder job than that, I like to move around."
good,"Good place for college student to work, incentive to college students in education.  Low wages in management positions, overall payroll based on retail store sales, so low wages for multiple job duties, most of time management is performed alone with no cashiers on staff."
good,Productive and fun. Always something to do. Very busy. Fast pace. Friendly environment. Awesome store manager. Clean environment.open door policy. Um u can only be let go or fired by one person the store manager witch is good because it cuts out the chances of ppl banding together as friends & bullying up on individuals and cuts out the chances of falsely being terminated. HR and there information is posted for everyone to see. There good with giving you breaks & lunches.

good,"A typical day at work would be very active in planning for next big sales event and giving excellent customer service."
good,Great culture. Labor is constant issue. Cutting hours for employees because stores have employees that milk the clock is the only negative issue. It is a fast paced environment with friendly service.
good,"You come in, start working on something, have the occasional chat with customers, clean up, stock shelves, ring up customers till shift is over then go home. It's a pretty standard job, not too difficult if you don't let it overwhelm you. The manager was great, we got along very well, same with co-workers. The hardest part of the day was dealing with too many customers at once, most enjoyable parts were after hours, chatted with co-workers and cleaned then went home. If you just need work to take your mind off stuff or need extra money, I would recommend this, excellent for people looking for their first job."
good,typical day is helping the manager with things around the store and learning things along the way the hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers
good,"The hardest part of the job is Trucks days,thats when when we have to unload the Truck and some days it may take hours..Any weather,rain,sleet,or snow"
good,Loved my job. Just hated my distract manager. Not enough employees. I didn't get payed enough to sleep at the store. Not enough time for one person to do everything.  To many problems . Stressed to the max . Hardly seen my family. .
good,"I felt that I was a great working environment, learned how to restock how to deal with certain customers how to do toots how to sell products use coupons and make new friends in the work place."
good,There are never more than three people working at once at my location. Most of the time it's only two. The employees were very fun to work with and also very welcoming and helpful when you need help.
good,I learned many cash handling skills while working here and also any customer service skills. The job was a great first job because it taught me many skills about the workplace.
good,"Hardest part of this job is it is very repetitive, but pretty easy.  My favorite thing about this job is the coworkers and customers.  Most things are common sense"
good,I love working with customers so working for Dollar General was fun. Not enough pay or hours.  No benefits because only assistant manager and managers get benefits and full time.
good,"opening / closing store, checking in deliveries, ordering certain products. Stocking shelves, pricing for clearance.  Daily Money count. employee supervision."
good,"Working at Dollar General was ok. I enjoyed having great coworkers and an awesome manager. However, some of the coworkers would get lazy and sit in the office while I was hustling to get stuff done."
good,I really enjoyed working at Dollar General. It is great for entry level management positions for people wishing for advancement. I did however have to work a lot of hours and I was salary so I didn't get compensated for the extra time I put in. My district manager was fantastic and she allowed me to run the store my way and allowed me to make decisions on my own with out micro managing.
good,"Fun to work at, great joyful customers, wonderful employees. all nice and greating everyone who comes in and making them feel welcome. always there for the customers when they need assistance."
good,I loved how competitive the job was i was always putting sales adds on the shelf. Resetting shelves. Unload roll tainers uboats and tots.  I loved recovering the shelves and making te store nice n tidey.  Most of all i loved was being interactive with the customer's n cash handling.
good,"Simple cash register easy to learn. Quick pace, fun and friendly place. Stocking in quick fast past. Team members help each other and mangers work with the team"
good,I enjoyed assisting customers while being a cashier at Dollar General. I learned how to take inventory by using a hand held device. It can get really overwhelming sometimes because their is usually only 1 cashier depending on the location of the store and at any given time their can be a sudden burst of customers.
good,"Very easy place to work, mostly stocking, cleaning. low customer service as many people already know where everything is. pay could be higher and more hours would be nice but it is a good place to work"
good,Making the store neat and clean for the customers. I learned how to manage hour with a short staff. Management was always one call away.Nothing is hard about the job.I enjoyed training and see people get promoted from the things i taught them.
good,its can get very busy very fast . the hardest part is satnding up most of the day . manmagement is good  i learned that hard work pays off . the work culture is good !
good,"I wasn't stressed at dollar general. Higher management were picky about how things were done often but overall, the job wasn't too difficult. I was never overworked and I understood what needed to be done."
good,It was an easy job. Just  wasn't a stable work schedule. Meeting new people everyday. Always something to do. I actually got a lunch break it was nice.
good,This was my first job senior year in high school. I loved it; although sometimes it can be stressful depending on your manager and what they want you to do. They worked around my school schedule and I got paid quite good and got a lot hours but that also depends on where you are.
good,"I am lucky to work at one of the nicer stores and its overall alright. The hours are inconsistant but unsurprising and the pay isnt anything fancy. Its not a relaxed environment, theres always work to be done. Its not a bad place to work at if the people are nice."
good,"Great place if you are looking to build yourself up on the chain of command, good employees, always something new to do, fun to change stuff for holidays and more"
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General. The hours were great and co-workers were friendly. I enjoyed running the cash register and helping people. The overall experience was a good one.
good,Dollar General is a good place to work. Through their literacy program they are helping improve the communities in which they're located. The company's growth makes it a good place to come on board and if you work hard and have the basic skills you can make this into a good career choice.
good,"Dollar General was my first job and was very average. The management was phenomenal and the workplace was friendly, there were no advancement opportunities, the pay was minimal, and the hours were low. I learned the basic skills for future employment as well as how to operate a cash register. The most difficult thing about the job was having an influx of customers during certain hours. It was just a very average, minimum wage job."
good,Working at Dollar General was a great experience because I learned a lot and was always meeting new people all the time.  I enjoyed learning the techniques and trainings that was involved in learning how to open and close the store.
good,"I like my job, but the manager makes in almost unbarable. I just need more hours and a steady job while I’m in college. I’ve never had a problem with my co-workers."
good,There is so much to be done during scheduled shift. Your hours will vary to store needs. Trying to throw freight and cashier at the same time was the hardest part to me.
good,"While i do enjoy this job i only intended for it to be temporary. This place is not for people who are lazy. You are responsible for your mistakes. If you aren't willing to work, you will be out the door very quickly."
good,"I have been at Dollar General for a year and a month now. Around Christmas time is when it get kind of crazy/hectic. The job is easy to do, but its the customers that make this job hard at times.They complain about the littlest things that are not your fault like digital coupons, bank card declining etc etc. But I like that you get to meet a lot of different people."
good,"A nice work place. Also well paced. They have some employees who doesnt mind working. I enjoyed it personally, a lot of nice respectful people. I wouldnt mind working in their franchise again."
good,"overseeing operations, ensuring customer satisfaction, setting schedules, involves hands-on and verbal orientation and supervising entry-level employees."
good,I love working there because you are a community store. You get to see the same customer everyday. You feel like you are a part of the community. The customers love coming into a store where they see a friendly face.
good,"Typical day at work was pretty busy most of the time but i was always smiling and do it with my best, good place to work but i had to move, it was an ok company"
good,It was my first job I liked it it was OK you meet a lot of new people you learn a lot of new things there's always room for Vance me make sure you like your manager or transferred to a new store etc. etc.
good,Working here has helped shape me as an individual and make connections with customers and fellow employees. Dollar General is a great place to enter the work force and has provided me with enough social skills and tools to advance in my future careers.
good,Its very fast paced. You never run out of things to do. Never a dull moment. Good pay. Pay is weekly. Very demanding and must multi task. It may take over your life if you enter management but worth it.
good,This was my first job and I think that it would be a good job for someone still in high school or for someone who doesn't need a lot of hours. There is a lot of lifting that you have to do in this job so keep that in mind when applying.
good,Dollar General was a good company to work for. I worked for them for almost 19yrs and enjoyed my role in helping the company grow. It was only my last year that I started to hate going to work. In my 19yrs with the company I went thru many management changes and never had any issues with any of them until my last supervisor. Who came in wanting me gone and never hid the fact that she was out for my job. In all my years I never had been given a write up or a verbal. I was the most dedicated employee anyone would want.  She made my job unbearable. So I decided that a change was needed. And left the company.
good,I enjoy my job.It is a place to learn new things and expand your knowledge of how a company is run. You learn to be responsible for many of the background that keeps the store running.
good,At first the job was cool. Then like thes next couple of months it got worse. The managers were lazy and had all the cashiers doing their jobs. It wasnt a good experience for me.
good,"I was  a shift manager I opened and close the store. I took deposits to the bank and went got change when needed.I checked in the vendores, stocked shelves, unloaded the trucks, help customers, ran the registers. caught shoplifters when there was a call in I stayed. when we had to get everything ready for inventory I stayed over to make sure things were done.. I did all this work for 8.50 an hour than I find out that I was hired as part time so they didnt have to give me the benifits  working 30 to 40 hrs a week.. and having to go to other stores and help them when needed."
good,Typical day at work included fast paced environment and set guidelines to make sure truck and stocking shelves is accomplished by the end of day. I enjoyed this job but I did not like past management.
good,"The people were so welcoming and the area was not stressful or fast paced. The customers were friendly themselves, and the work flow was very relaxed."
good,"A typical work day is busy. It's hard to stock when you're a cashier because you have to take care of your customers as well. Personally, I think that is the hardest part of the job."
good,If I had to describe my time working at (DG) it would be that it was a very peaceful place with a small community of people who would return there on a weekly basis. You were able to get familiar and get to know the customers you worked with. I totally enjoyed my time there.
good,Easy job advancement opportunities. Lots of hard work involved. Fun company to work for. Management is helpful and will work with you. Friendly customers.
good,"Awesome job opportunity for a first job. Flexible hours for a student. Advancement is average, worked here for 2 weeks then promoted to let holder. It's a little bit of everthing(stocking, cashier, and customer service) so great way to get your feet wet."
good,"The average day at DG was fairly decent. Made lots of friends that were semi regular customers. You had to be really good with talking to people, even ones you didn't like."
good,I loved my job at dollar general. I loved interacting and helping the customers as well as stocking the shelves! It was a great variety of work and I loved the faced paced environment
good,Probably enjoyed working here more than any job ive had.. i worked very close with the community i live in. i worked with managers i have knew all my life. i worked with friends. typical day was stressful. had to unload load trucks recieve trucks.. stock and cashier. it was a little overwhelming at times. it was a very good learning experience though
good,"Loved my job, co-workers,and management here. Very easy work and fun environment. I miss working for DG. I like the whole experience. They closed the Dollar general I worked for though"
good,There is always something to do to stay busy here. Never worry about being bored. For the most part everyone gets along great and getting advanced in job title is usually very quick.
good,the boss is always downing the people who work hard or either is something that where not doing right but its some times good and bad though but trying to get everything t=down on the truck is stressful when you have two people trying their best to get thing straight for the job the next day and the truck finish exactly the way she wants it. but its a good store to work but I'm ready to find another place to work at with a better pay..
good,"Too many unnecessary operational policies and procedures. Company stresses to much on internal shrink, while not addressing the more prevailing external issues."
good,A typical day at work is pretty busy no matter if there were alot of customers or not.  Which is a good thing. Staying busy is an important part of a job for me. Sometimes we had alot more product than I could seem to push out but overall a pretty steady and relaxed work environment.
good,"A lot of fun and more my style.  I was able to work at a comfortable pace and with a few exceptions I got along great with the customers.  Management and some policies were not that great, but everything is changed a bit now.  Hopefully for the better."
good,"I am a lift operator at Dollar General, that means 10 - 11 hour days with the option of over time. My department is light hearted because if we can get the work done early we can go home. there is usually ""high paced"" work towards the end of the night so we can go home early."
good,i did not work for this company for very long but in the time i did work for them they treated me very well and i enjoyed the customer interaction and that the job was different every day.
good,Dollar General is an ok Company to work for... I was in Management and you spend alotta hours in the store to keep it up! You need great workers to keep tour store ran Great
good,Dollar General is a great company to work for. They offer a lot to there employees. Good co-workers happy atmosphere great custmore service. It's one of my favorite store to shop at.
good,"- A healthy balance in pace, depending on your job for the day."
good,"It's was quite pleasing to someone in a small town setting, the pay every week comes in handy. If you go in and do your job the right way u will have a productive work day"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of engaging in transactions with customers using cash, credit/debit and checks and keeping the store clean.My job was to demonstrate exceptional customer service."
good,"Unless you are a regional manager, you are devalued.  Store managers are unpaid and overworked.  They also have a hard time balancing life and work because they have to be devoted to the store. The sale associates are underpaid."
good,"Most days were long and drawn out, but since the location was in a small town everyone knew everyone, this made the job fun as i got to see friends often while on the job (of course never altering my pace for conversation but rather just the quick ""hey, hows life"" sort of thing)"
good,"Manage total store level operations,, including staff hiring, training, evaluation, and work schedules for associates that directly reported to me"
good,"Obtained knowledge of customer service. management was ok. there was no insurance available , but the job was easy to perform and I enjoyed working with my team memebers, and helping the customers ."
good,A hour lunch break was awesome you get 2 15 min break and you do not have the supervisor walking the floor trying to keep up to see what you be doing because we work by a headset
good,Turnovers in management is every high from regional directors to store managers. I have been with the company for over a year and I have been had 3 DM's.
good,Dollar General is a good place to work. The most enjoyable thing there was the customers and getting to know them as you get repeat customers. The hardest part is the unloading of supplies from the trucks.
good,Fair work environment. Easy to catch on to routine. Helpful employees and management. Minimum wage but the work was simple enough. Always stayed busy which helps the day go by.
good,Room for advancement and a good team to work with.  Days were not long but hours were available.  Paid weekly and direct deposit  made life quicker and easier.
good,"I stocked shelves, and helped take the truck deliverys. We would sort through, then take out and stock everything needed to completely refil that day and the next with fill ins through out and other random tasks between."
good,I had fun working here and would have stayed much longer. Unfortunately I had to make an unexpected move out of state. The only problem with this job was that I would typically only get about 8-12 hours a week.
good,"Dollar general has a tough interview process but the job itself is pretty awesome. You run register, you stock, you just stay busy and social with the store and customers. The hardest part of the job is if you have to reset an area, which happens like once a month. I think the best part is restocking. It's like putting a puzzle together."
good,my manager (tammy) has been my favorite boss she is very kind and understanding. we have a lot of fun at the workplace but she keeps us very structured. she treats all her employees like family and we all fully understand our role in keeping our store up to par.
good,ok place to work for just depends on you and he people who run what ever store..some take carfe of you some dont..they dont acknowledge there workers at times
good,Good place to work. problem keeping management so it makes staying hard. Turn over rate is high. Good work though and friendly customers. has peak times but mostly easy days.
good,Employee's were fairly well to adjust to and alright to get along with. Work was relatively easy and pay was fair. Store was constantly worked and cleaned. Information was easy to get and was easy to comprehend.
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar General. It was a great experience that I would like to have again if given the chance. My hours got cut so I unfortunately had to find new employment but the job was good none the less.
good,"the co workers were somewhat easy to get along with, they were very helpful. They were there when you needed to call out and needed someone to cover the shift. And was very understanding"
good,Dollar general is a good place to work. The people are nice and sometimes the customers are too. Breaks are short and you receive no discounts on any items in the store. But overall a pretty quaint environment to work at.
good,"love the work but just not enough hours to take care of young children, can't afford a house, and so on. Its best to not have outside debt and if your not looking for that many hours."
good,good place to work part time. It is very fast paced and hard to keep employees there. The customers can sometime be hhard to deal with because the store is always a mess due toi the shortage of employees.
good,"Dollar General is a job that you love to hate, it is very fast paced and always so much to do to meet company standards. I love working there and I love what I did there and I am good at it! It does get exhausting due to the fact they do not give enough payroll to accomplish everything that needs to be done without the store manager working extra hours to complete the tasks."
good,It is a well paying job but can be stressful and takes a toll on your body due to extreme physical hard work. Most of the supervisors are very nice and treat each employee fairly.
good,"It pretty much was just a typical work environment. The only bad thing was the location. It was in a semi-bad neighborhood. People would get caught stealing, and it would be nothing we could do about it. We had no security, and corporate didn't allow us to put our hands on customers stealing. So we were only allowed to say something, and they would just walk away with merchandise."
good,"Easy work and good management. Allowed to have ideas and help make decision to improve store sales  and improve work efficiency."
good,"It was a small store, so you got to know every one you where working with pretty well. It was a petty good job until the management changed. I liked my manager, and my coworkers, but I am not sure what I think of dollar general as a company."
good,Dollar General is  a competitive environment with quality merchandise. with the skilled workers it can be a great place to work. I believe there should be required engagement  between the District Managers and all members of staff below. There should be quarterly meetings within the districts and store meetings should be held once a week for updates and feedback.
good,"Dollar General was always under staffed and I was way under paid,i worked over 50 hrs.most weeks.I learned how they kept up with"
good,i was only at dollar general for a few months and i must say it was the best few months of my job career. i worked early mornings stocking the shelves and i must say it was easy. So if you looking for a easy job this would be a great choice
good,"A lot of hard work, not enough time to get everything done that they require to be done.  Dealing with irate customers once in a while.  Feel like you are being pulled in many directions at once."
good,i like my job hard work it keeps you going . but little pay for the job your ex to do you're a miracle worker. expected to do everything   you can move up quick in the company  if your a worker.
good,I enjoyed my time at Dollar General.  The management that I worked under was very understanding and flexible.  The work was reasonable and not overwhelming.  The only complaint I had was insufficient hours.
good,Dollar general is fast paced and will make a person stay on their toes. The people are friendly and the management is pretty good. It is a pretty good place to start at for your first job.
good,Normal day at work includes 4-5 hrs on your feet non-stop with work always being done. Never a slow day until late at night. Management is understanding but does have a point where they will tell you to leave if need be.
good,"Was good place to work, just not enough hours offered.  The managemental was very last minute with things.  I also think a pay increase could of been considered"
good,"You always have to be quick on your feet and willing to stand for more than 5 hours a day"
good,"A typical work day at the dollar general was overall a good day for me.I learned how to deal with people a lot better,you have your bad days when you deal with a lot of theft that was also that hardest part of the job"
good,"good job, with all retail jobs comes store level drama and favoritism, but if you manage to avoid that and move up its a great place to work. Do your best and you will be rewarded."
good,i liked dollar general alot i just wanted to grow with dollar general.but i got to grow with walmart a fast growing store.i love working with people all the time.
good,Great place to start working. Pay is okay. You are required to work at a very fast pace. But overall I would recommend working there for anyone looking for a job.
good,"At first it was okay place to work. There wasn't too much that I had to do. As a the person who ran the cash register; my job was a part time position. As time went on though they started to give me more hours, too many hours. So now I'm working fulltime hours on part time pay with no benefits. Another problem was that I never got two days of in a row. Sometimes I only got one day off a work week, and on days I had off I would be called in alot. One time I even had to work nine days in a row. I It was too stressful for me and not enough down time so I had to quit."
good,Numerous opportunities to explore various employment roles at the corporate level. Team building activities. Able to work with limited supervision and great benefits!
good,"Even though I was a cashier, I still had to stock items on the shelfs, that seems easy, but very hard. I enjoy talking to co workers and customers. Good hours"
good,"I loved the job duties and my colleagues. The managers were good, but the only thing was that I didn't get enough hours. Naturally, I had to find another job because 12-15 hours a week doesn't pay the bills. Thinking back on it now, maybe I could've juggled another part time job to compensate for the limited hours at Dollar General. If I had a chance to get rehired here, I'd certainly take it because I loved the work. I just checked out customers, stocked shelves, put carts back and ensured that the store was clean and safe at all times. A pretty easy job, if you ask me."
good,"Dollar General is a very fast paced place to work! And? You learn some amazing things! There is ALWAYS room for advancement.... However, do NOT get lost in the maze! You can and WILL BE MUCH OVERWORKED, and UNDERPAID!"
good,"depended on the work day typicaly good, management for retail and money counting, good and fair, good, stocking and clean uo, drawer counts and deposites"
good,Didnt have enough people for the stores in the area so there was a lot of going from one store to another.The people i worked with were nice and helpful i liked the way everything was run.
good,"Basic retail job, consisting mainly of keeping the store clean and updating price tags. The managerial staff is very fair, and consistent with the customers."
good,"I would usually run the cashier, stock the aisles that I was ordered to put away, bag the customers items. The management was great, the people that worked there were friendly."
good,Very laid back and adjustable environment. Friendly and out going members. There was no hard part of the job. Just some days are good and some not OK like any other job.
good,I usually have a good day at work except on days when we do more than planned but that doesn't happen often.  I have had 3 jobs in the warehouse since I started working there along with learning how to operate multiple pieces of equipment
good,"I've had bad managers who have discriminated but I've also had extremely nice managers. The work environment varies by location, but the work itself is generally easy. It's a basic customer service and stocking job."
good,"Overall, i loved my time at Dollar General many up & downs great perks at times but i should have prepared myself for the ending."
good,The atmosphere was very relaxed and enjoyable. The employees were wonderful to work with. And the manager was fair to everyone and always followed through on plans when needed.
good,"Well the typical day at work starts out as me walking in the store and clocking in.Then either me doing truck or if they need me on register."
good,"When I came to this company I was new to retail. My General Manager taught me the basics of retail, and I began to learn as I go. I became a manager within 2 months and it is such a great experience."
good,Working for dollar general was a  good experience. It was kind of a culture shock working retail at first simply because i was coming out of the military but now im looking for a job that best fits my skills.
good,The management was very flexible with the schedule and co-workers were nice however pay not so great and advancement was not there.
good,"I loved working there and it wasn't difficult in any form; however, I had to move for a family emergency after two weeks to Georgia."
good,"A typical day involves clocking in, checking people out, helping people find items, and stocking shelves. I learned about multi- tasking and being careful with money. Management is nice and easy to work with. It is mainly you and one other person who  works the store and one manager, so there are very few people to work with which leaves room for very minimal issues to occur. The hardest part of the job was handling coupons and the customers who came with them. The most enjoyable part was the fact that it was low intensity for it to be my first job."
good,"the store was super messy everything out of order and the management is super rude but the co workers i had were great , helpful and we got the job done day in and day out."
good,It tests your patience and builds your tolerance when dealing with customer/people as well as teaches you how to better read people's actions and how they word things to an extent and how to better interact with them from what information you gather.
good,Love how the job kept you active throughout your shift. Loved the coworkers.  Had good benefits and took care of their workers in anyway possible. Loved working there.
good,The politics are the only thing that allows the culture to divert into favorites.Going by the books isn't the issue the issue is gong against great employees.
good,"Laid back is a good way to describe this place. You're not paid much but the job isn't hard. Of course managers act like rush rush rush but they have to. The district manager once said to me when I contacted him about needing some more help in my shop, he says ""Don't work yourself so hard, it all pays the same"" Put me right over the edge, being a control freak, but eventually I understood."
good,"I like working hear pick your own work hours and work as much as you can ,you are home with family more. the people that you work for are very nice and they provide you with safe vans to drive. overall its a great place to work."
good,"At Dollar General, there is plenty of work to be done. I enjoyed my job, always stayed busy, and the pay was fair. There is always an opportunity to move up in the company if you are willing to put in the work. The hardest part of the job was working around the payroll hours that you are allowed to attain the goals you set each week. I enjoyed the customers and seeing what all I had accomplished at the end of each shift."
good,"It's easier to work in the mornings but during the afternoons it's very busy. I learned to unpack boxes fast and work at a fast pace. Management is okay"
good,"Typical day consist of stocking, assisting cashiers with register duties, having fun and laughing, assisting customer's with merchandise purchases"
good,Working at Dollar General has been a great experience for me so far.  It is a very fast paced company that's growing everyday. You get to meet a lot of different people.
good,It's slow some hours but get crazy busy other hours. It's a easy place to work at. The cost worker were nice & friendly. Some days I didn't feel safe because I'd work 1 to 2 hours by myself. I also disliked the management.
good,"It's a pretty typical retail job. You stock things, greet people, work the cash register. If you're interested in a first time job, or you're an experienced retail associate looking for a position in management, this is the company for you."
good,"I love working for Dollar General it was a great place fun environment. everyone was helpful and nice, I've meet some nice customers along the way. great management staff ."
good,"As a Cashier at Dollar General, I found the job to be fun and stimulating. A typical day at work includes welcoming many customers into the store and helping them find what they need. There is also the very important job of keeping the store-front neat, stocked and appealing. Once clocked in one must count down their drawer and begin ringing up customers usually immediately. During any down time, its best to stock and recover shelves as much as possible to keep up with the appearance and supply and demand of the store. Co-workers are generally kind and caring and management is very organized and considerate. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people each day and brief conversations with regular customers. Co-workers and customers at Dollar General seem more like friends and family."

good,The management is very flexible with schedule and everyone gets along very well. There is room for advancement and good benefits. I like this job but it is only part time and I need a full time job.

good,"Working for Dollar General was good. My days never stayed the same. I liked the responsibilities that were placed upon me once I was promoted to management after only two months of being employed. As a manager, I enjoyed the leadership and coaching that was essential to my title. In management, the most important thing I learned was to listen to my team and effectively get the problems solved and keep the shift going smoothly. I may say the hardest part of the job was inventory. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customer satisfaction."
good,Great people friendly professional great management team work great pay. Best place to work hands down. Alway a change

good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General. The people I worked with were extremely helpful and kind. It was a good way to start out learning how to work with the public.
good,Management is nice and fun. Work isn't hard to do as long as you don't mind lifting boxes. Breaks depend on how long you work. I love working for this company.
good,"Working in a warehouse is rarely different from one place to the next.  Along with Wal-Mart, Dollar General is an industry leader in making cookie cutter templates for what a warehouse facility looks like.  You could say they are very innovative."
good,The balance of work was handled very well. Management does a well job on training. But you always have that bad apple co-worker
good,"Dollar General is an okay job if you are looking for extra money. It isn't a place to make a living at. Overall, I enjoy working there. The people are nice and the job is easy."
good,Easy to advance in the company.  I started as a cashier and was a manager in less than a year.  Once you are a manager it can be hard to have a work/life balance with the changing hours every week and sometimes unreliable staff.

good,"good career/business route. great retail experience, always customers and work to do, nice environment, many ways to work and show skills.mnagement is okay."
good,A day at work is busy. I have to do recovery in between helping customers and operating the register. I have to clean at the end of the night. I am glad to have this experience.
good,"My typical work day was great! I learned to run the cash register for the first time working there, although I still need to learn. The management was good. My co-workers were lovely! The hardest part of my job was when I couldn't help someone, an the most enjoyable part was when I could help everyone, an had a great day!"
good,I enjoyed joining a store that truly cared about customer service. We got to know our return customer by name because it was store in a small town. I was rocky though because we kept getting more over stock that we could put out so our inventory was cost because we could not get it out and we end up eating on our P and L. We did our best but it never seemed to be enough.
good,"Did unloading and loading of trucks, muop driver."

good,A continually busy workplace but enjoyable.  Great manager and co-workers.  We are continually filling the shelves and cleaning the store.
good,i didnt particularly like the fact that i had no set hours always had to find out at the end of the end of the week if my next time going to work is when the schedule is set in. there were a lot of inconsistencies other than that it wasn't terrible coworkers were alright one in particular was fun to close shop with. overall it wasn't terrible even though the pay was poo.
good,"I learned a lot while working here. I got to meet a lot of new people who, most of the time, were very polite. The management here is pretty good. They are understanding, for the most part, about when things happen and how your schedule works. There is a bit of a family feel to working here."
good,Working for an automotive firm is rewarding the pay is good the work is steady and the benefits are good as well I felt there was to much favoritism at this job and if you weren't willing to bow down the expect to get looked over
good,"The day going by pretty smoothly every now and then you get a few irate customers but who doesn't . most days your stocking, cleaning or just updating aisle"
good,It was always clean and very organized. Alot of us got along some of us didnt work well together which is one of the reasons a few of us left. Management was trouble & were never on the same page as one another. Honestly the hardest part of working there was management. The most enjoyable was meeting a few amazing co workers that always came together to make sure everything ran smoothly and teach you the way things are suppose to be taken care of.
good,"Great workplace to have a career . The co-workers and supervisors are great and very helpful . The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the lanes you are assigned to .

I also gained management skills at my time there. My coworkers were always one of the best parts of my job. Getting to know them and work with such great people was a wonderful experience. Overall my time working at Dollar General was positive.
good,Opening the store for customers meeting new people is a great experience. I have learned so much from this job how to open and closethestore alone is very scary that is the hardest part of being a manager. I enjoy meeting new people everyday customers tell you there life storey and you get close to them.  My co-workers are the best they work hard and help me run the store keeping it clean and in order!
good,I loved working there because of the customers and co-workers. the sad part is that I was working at minimum wage. it also a good place for a first job.
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking out customers, putting up stock, recovering store, closing the store, and counting nightly deposits. I have learned better communication and how to handle angry customers in a proper manner. I love my co-workers. We communicate very well and all work well together. The hardest part of the job is getting the truck put out on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is my customers. I absolutely love my customers."
good,"Very stressful everything depended on me. But I managed to pull through, didnt feel that management was that great at the time."
good,"A typical day at work usually consist of stocking, resets, cleaning on the floor, along with money management and monitoring of the profits being made.

The hardest part of the job are the customers but they are also the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,night shift is way under stafed never have time for family money is good had a family emergcy had to take time off which led to me getting fired
good,I really like it here it just doesn't pay enough. We have fun and still get things done. my co workers are fun and energetic and our customers like us! the manager is great!!

good,"Typical work day was very fast paced and planned out"
good,"Learned lots of new skills. Great work environment. The managers are easy to work with, as well as the other employees. Flexible work schedule."
good,I would have to say that the retail aspect of Dollar General is a little overrated.  Perhaps a job in marketing would have been a better decision for me but if you are good with people and don't have a problem lifting 30 pounds or so maybe this is the right place for you.  Advancement is possible through hard-work and discipline if you seek more responsibility and pay.  I have to say that this is a good company.
good,I would love to work in a management position again. The experience learned there was very rewarding.
good,"Very easy job, but the management is terrible. They can never get on the same page. The work gets overwhelming at times when there is only one cashier."
good,"I have managed for Dollar General for the third time since 2003, it has been a great experience, and I have learned a lot while being with this company.  My days are demanding, but with a strong team, I have accomplished great things.  I have learned with dedication and hard work anything can be accomplished.  The hardest part of my job is learning to allow my management team to share some responsibilities instead of myself trying to do it all, I have learned that this is the only way my store can succeed, it takes a team to make things happen.  I enjoy seeing and hearing our customers happy and the compliments that they say to us, allowing my staff and I to know that we have satisfied there needs.  That's a wonderful feeling."
good,"When it comes to Dollar General, you are working with the jack of most every trade out there. You get a little bit of most everything; clothes, food, groceries. Think of it as a mini mall, except there's more than just one type of product."
good,a work day at is very busy I learned management skills co-worker worked well
good,"I currently manage at the Dollar General in Dupo IL and Dupo is a very small town and Dollar General is the only place to shop and get anything you need. Because of that we are extremely busy 24/7 and especially on weekends. Being busy requires constant fast pace movement and rushing around trying to get things done while maintaining customer satisfaction. A typical day at work is trying to get a 1500 piece truck out on the sales floor before another truck comes the following week, because of payroll we don't have many people to work on it so it is like always playing catch up through out the week and then you have customers everywhere throughout the store as you are stocking. I believe that is the most difficult task of this job. Managing isn't difficult for me but its isn't exactly easy either. I have to make sure everything is running the way it should be, fix any problems including computer problems. money problems, sale problems, customer problems, and make sure my cashiers and crew members are doing their jobs.Last but not least the money. Because we are the only thing in Dupo, we make more money than any other Dollar General is our area, so saying that I constantly have to make sure the money is exact and make sure the deposits are never short. Also managing requires inventory count and ordering merchandise. My co-workers are all very nice and together we make a very good team, working together means everything and maintaining a good work ethic. My most enjoyment everyday is seeing our regulars come in and having a good work relationship with all my co-workers."
good,dollar general was a great company to work for it truly felt like a family. i really enjoyed the closeness of the environment that i shared with my co worker.
good,"	Reported Daily Sales, Matched Invoices"
good,"The job was pretty simple. You spend the day stocking shelves, organizing products, assisting customers, and working a cash register. The staff was quite friendly. The store was located in a small town, so everyone basically knew everyone else (staff and customers). It was really a great place to work."
good,"I could meet new people and learned how to chart, complete scheduling for cashiers, and fun environment."
good,"Day to day hiring training, and keeping store staffed, and having a well balanced team to run store to store model standards staying visual of store needs, keeping store merchandised full of product having what our customers need when they come to shop. Keeping business in a safe and friendly environment."
good,The most important thing is to make the customers happy. I learned how to put information into the system. I also learned how things were placed in the store. When I started there I wasn't much of a people person but I got used to how it was and got to know how to handle and talk to people.
good,Working here gave me opportunities that would enhance my character and work ethics. My store manager and store team was amazing to a whole. The encouragement and belief they showed help me to discover my strength.
good,"i ran the register and stocked when i didn't have customers."
good,This was my 2nd job. i enjoyed working there meeting new people and making sure that there needs were met.

good,"At Goldkist it was a very cold environment, but yet warm. It was all about making sure everything was clean. I learned how to clean and cut a whole chicken. I had plenty of co-workers. There really wasn't an hard part of the job. I enjoyed everything about it."
good,"never slow, management wasn't understanding when not able to show up or needing to leave, will right you up over the smallest thing with no warning it was an easy job"
good,"Dollar General is a pretty good place to work depending on your job. It's a warehouse, so some jobs are a lot more physical and tougher than others. For me, I came in everyday and did my job to the best of my abilities and it wasn't really all that bad. Some days are worse than others, but what job isn't like that? Probably the worst part is that it's a little random when you get off as the job ends when everything is shipped. Thus, it's sometimes hard to make plans. But I did truly like my job while I was there and even met some good friends."
good,"Great job, cool co-workers, hardest part of my job was the stocking."
good,Stock the shelfs work with good employee's work with the people and service the customers..
good,"Start with opening the store, getting the registers counted and ready, stock the shelves and ring up customers. At the end of the day I would count the registers, do closing paper work, close the store, run to the bank to make the end of the day deposits."
good,"Easy hours, people always have positive attitudes, harderst part of the job when we are slow. Other than being slow or lack of business an awesome job"

good,I enjoyed being in a management position and  providing customers with the best service I could. I made sure all of my planograms and projects were completed on time and loved the daily paperwork and counting banks.
good,it was the perfect part-time job and i enjoyed working with the staff
good,I would stock and face the entire store. My managers were amazing and taught me a lot. I learned how to stock every item many different ways. The hardest part of my job was taking down the boxes. I loved my job very much. I was constantly busy and had something to do every minute I was there.
good,"-fast pace"
good,"Making sure co-workers are staying on task."
good,Very productive wokplace store stayed clutterd and cowokers was very nice.
good,"very challenging , keep u going.  Great people, lots of cross training, lots of room for advancement"
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, reviewing the daily planner for what needs to be done, getting this list of things done before the end of the shift, making sure, as a 3rd Key Manager, that my co-worker got their list done as well. I learned how to manage a store and keep it running throughout the day. The hardest part of the job would be the challenge of getting everything done even if other more important situations would arise. The most enjoyable part, like I said earlier, would be the customers. The different people I met made my job feel like home, comfortable and a place I was happy to work at."
good,"A typical work day is very busy from the time the store opens until the store closes."
good,This job entailed basic retail necessities including managing a cashier and stocking shelves daily. It was a good experience and introduction to what life would be like inside a retailer's or corporation's life.  We handled everything at the micro level which means we provided all the merchandise for in-store customers
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, I learned how to manage my time efficiently and accurately proceed to the next duty assigned to me by my store manager. Overtime, I learned how to finish everything in an orderly fashion so that things can be done neatly and on time. My co-workers were very friendly teamworking individuals. They helped out with things that I may have fell short on, and that helped me do better next time. The hardest part of the job was in the beginning I couldn't really always understand how to handle the irate customers. I felt pressured and confused. Overtime, as I continued to watch my manager and the way she would handle things, I learned how to serve customers the best way possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting across a difficult and challenging customer by putting a smile on their face."
good,I really enjoy this job a lot it was a summer job. I love my co workers very fun and work very hard. My manager  was the best. Hardest part was unloading a truck alone sometimes.
good,"at dollar general we has really tight management. our store stayed clean and each ""cart"" of stock out in 30 mins or less.this job was good for self discipline and time management"
good,"It is not an easy job.  The work is consistent and on the average managers start with paperwork and then go into stocking and setting the store to a layout that changes from week to week. Stocking and changing the layout from week to week may be the hardest part of the job, due to you have to make sure that you have gotten your  truck from your delivery date put up.  The most enjoyable part of the job I can say is the people."
good,"Basic: Cashier/ stock"
good,"Enjoyed working for this company, daily work was very steady and simple to handle. I learned that I still have lots of my skills from my  past that my manager at time could of used. The hardest part of my job was watching how I approached my young manager as to not feel like I was trying to tell her how to do her job, rather make suggestions to help better the store. My co-workers were for the most part very easy to get along with, The most enjoyable part of my job was customer service. I really like dealing with the public and helping them find things they need."
good,"Managed 5 employees to include scheduling, coaching’s and evaluations.  Responsible for store budget, keeping an accurate account of all inventories, submitting invoices for vendors, preparing all mark up and mark down reports and resetting modular’s according to plan-o-grams."
good,it wasa a brand new warehouse so it had its ups and downs the period i was there
good,"I would get to work at 8:00am, unless it was truck day then it was 5:00am. I would set-up cash registers, straigten up store if needed. Open up store at 9:00am run cash register until 10:00am when first employee came, then I would stock up shelves and reorder merchandise, load u boats (dollies) with merchandise in order for myself and other employees to stock shelves throughout the day. Greet customers, retreive carts, wipe down shelves, organise shelves set up plan-o-grams, set-up receipts of the day, set-up pay-roll, organize employee team meetings, provide interventions if needed, closing store buy doing everything in reverse, and taking cash receipts to the bank.  The most enjoyable time for me was setting the example for my employees on how to treat one another and hearing how they would follow through with that example when I was not there."
good,they are wonderful workers and its a vdery fun and at times fast pace and very busy but its a grwat job to have because yonever be boresd
good,"My typical work day starts by opening the store at 6:45 a.m. and counting the morning money in the safe and getting the registers up and running. I then start by filing my office paper work, and then by that time I usually have my first vendor of the day. Usually I have certain projects to work on each day, which includes plan-o-gram resets, stocking, moving shelves, recovering store, and offering outstanding customer service which would have to be the best part of my job. The hardest part would have to be getting an upset customer that may come across as hard to deal with but if your patient and understanding with them any problem can be resolved."
good,I enjoyed working for this company greatly and the atmosphere
good,A typical work day was going in and getting to work. I learned to meet the needs to get along with everyone. All my co-workers were really great. This job wasn't hard it was fairly easy to me. I mostly enjoyed every part of this job.

good,good place to work for starting out in customer service. Gives u the skills and patients required to work in the customer service field.This place has been very rewarding to me and my family. Will consider working for them in the future.
good,its a good company to work for but isn't something that you want to do for your future
good,I advanced a lot at the job. Great place to work and great people.
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers and interacting with the customers. My manager is easy going but also knows how to be a boss.
good,"The company is very good in what they do as far as serving the community, sell good products, have excellent upper management. The lower level management sucks, they have too many novice and make the company to have bad reputation, lower level management provide poor judgment and weak decision. very slow in taking action and scare good people off."
good,good job not enough to do and not enough room in the store either to even stock the shelves
good,"It was a very stressful job on some days. I disliked the idea when new management took over from Winn-Dixie stores to run our stores. The management team did not really have a understanding of our daily work operation. I didlike the fact I cleaned up three strores, just to have them given to some of the new management old team workers. I thought this was so unfair."
good,"I worked a split shift 5 days a week open/close"
good,Productive setting if the right team is in the store. Depending on your manager some are willing to work around your schedule outside of work.
good,"This is a great job for someone that wants to make it through school. Flexible hours and if you are in a great area for ""regular customers' you can create great friendships. "
good,"A typical day would be making sure each employee did his or her job."
good,"Dollar General is a laid back but sometimes really busy work environment that's great for meeting new people. Working there I have learned how a retail store is ran, handled, and organized as well as how the store is all around put together and stocked. Depending on the store you work at the management varies from being the easiest people to work for to the type that you can't wait to get out of there as soon as you clock in but all and all they can be hard but fair and the same goes for my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is working on a busy day short staffed or working with others that makes your job harder or longer. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking a month off from the same day to day routine to work from store to store resetting them in the district."
good,A typical day at work for me is managing any where from 10 to 20 people a day setting up a new store from start to finish in 7 days.  We set up gondolas for two days and then stock the store in 5 days.  A total of 3 full 18 wheelers in 4 days.  I have learned a lot on how to manage a wide variety of people.  When I arrive to store on a Monday I have never met these people in my life.  I have learned to deal with many different work qualities in so many different people in a short amount of time.  I am putting my trust in these employees to be able to accomplish my job.  The hardest part of my job is being away from home so much.  I am only home about 10 days a month and put about 3000 miles a month on.  I travel all over the country setting up new stores for the company.  The most enjoyable part of my job is completing something of this magnitude and walking away and looking at it and saying I did this.  Also meeting so many different people every month is a plus too.
good,"I enjoyed my work love the experience, just didn't have enough time wit my family..."
good,"I would arrive to work at 4:55 and immediately punch in to work. I would work from 5 p.m. until sometimes 5 a.m. I learned hard work and what it takes to be successful in the distribution business. The management was very laid back but seemed not to help on the floor as much as they made out. My co-workers were very hard working and loyal to the business. They knew what it took to succeed and did just that. The hardest part of the job to me was the long hours with minimal breaks and working on Sundays. We had two decently long breaks but until you walked to the designated area the time was close to being up. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was the physical part, I knew I was going to stay in shape and be in a family oriented workforce."
good,A typical day at work involoved closing or opening the store. Depositing money if needed. Taking care of the petty cash and tills. Unloading the Weekly truck and placing merchadise onto the shelves and stockroom nicely. The Best part of the job was the workout from truck and the co-workers. The hardest part was the unset schedule.
good,Dollar general was a fun workplace with nice people and customers. The benefits were really good and you could go further in the company if you choose to..
good,"Hours were for the most part flexible. However, there is hardly any room for advancement or promotion.  Store is located in questionable area and hourly wage could be better."
good,"unloaded truck, inventory, plan-o-grams, cashier, constant customer interaction, etc..."
good,I loved working for the Dollar General. MY coworkers were great and friendly. My manager at the time was transferred to a different store. The new manager that came in and took over was not great. He was very inappropriate towards me. That is why I quit.
good,"Great company to work for, enjoyed going to work everyday. Never a dull moment. The most difficult part of this job was the extended job duties managers take on with limited hours required in a high volume store. liked giving my customers a clean and friendly shopping experience. training my  employees on the importance of keeping shrink down"
good,very nice managers and a nice working environment.  my manager even gave me a birthday card. 
good,"Great job fun and safe work enviroment. Most of the managers were great to work for. Hard work enjoyed the team work to meet goals"
good,"the hardest part of the job is getting around the limited hours to start with. I enjoyed all of the customers that came through, and I did like a few of my managers. But my co-workers were just fun"
good,"boring"
good,A typical day at Dollar General was good and worth every hour that was worked. I learned how to deal with people and different culture. Management was good I have no complaints my co workers was fun to be around we got along great.The hardest part of job was being laid off. The enjoyable part of job was making customers happy.
good,my experience working with dollar general was awsome. I learned how to become a great cashier and more of of people person. i worked with of group of amazing people.
good,well I really enjoyed dollar general but when my manger changed it was less enjoyible. 
good,A definite hands on place to work for managers.  Most of a typical day is spent either stocking shelves or running the register.  It is a good company to work for and if you do your job well you will be rewarded.
good,"I believe Dollar General is good for providing our customers with quality items at competitive prices,which is the best part of my"
good,"On a typical day at Dollar General, there was no such thing really. Working with the public you never know what is going to happen next, so you have to be flexible and have a good temperament and generally love people or you will never advance. I started this job out at a 3rd Level Keyholder in Management. I was so good at my job that they moved me over to reset all the other stores in the area with a special team. I loved everyone I worked with and the Mgt. at the local stores. The hardest part of the job was stocking the shelves, a good deal of physical labor. "
good,I loved my job it was more hands on and keeps you busy if you work and don't goof off time goes by fast
good,Very nice place if like to interact with customers. Dealing with flexable hours. I learned that you have to be a people person to handle job.
good,you work alot of hours for this company. No time for social or personal life. 60-70 hours a week.
good,I enjoyed my customers as well as setting the new displays for the store
good,Learned how to read SKU numbers and properly bag items according to weight. Management was helpful in learning everything. Coworkers were nice and easy to get along with.
good,"I worked down in the loading dock as a temporary a couple years back. I really enjoyed the job and the pay (considering I was only a temp) but the management and atmosphere was extremely cruddy. You'll definitely lose weight and get bigger paychecks in the summer and around the holidays but temps are excluded from holiday bonuses and company promotions. All in all the DG warehouse isn't a bad place to work, but they're definitely lacking in many fields."
good,"I loved working here. The hours were great, they did a good job working with me on my schedule balancing it with my home life. My boss' and co-workers were very understanding, helpful and patient. The atmosphere at this job was incredible, there was never any real pressure. I knew exactly what I was supposed to do and how to do it. This was my first job and I regret having to leave it. I'd love for the chance to work here again. I didn't dislike anything about this job."
good,steady pace not that very busy of a store so you can run a register and be able to stock shelves as well.
good,A typical day at work is usually busy and full of enjoyable customer interactions. (most days)
good,"i loved working for dollar general and miss this type of work but dont miss putting in 100-110 hours a week due to lack of good help ,lack of payroll and work load with paperwork and stocking and changing planograms went 3 months without a day off and finally gave up."
good,"employees and management work great together. customers were awesome. pay and hours were pretty good, benefits could have been a little better though"
good,"Co-workers were great, as well as they pay. The bad part is the management and the understanding of an injury is very poor."
good,"This is a good company to work for. There is room for growth in the company and industry. The benefits are comenstrate with other companys of its nature. Personally, I feel that I don't get the life work balance I need with my young children, and time off durring holidays that many other companies offer. I also dislike the fact that retail in general has a high turnover rate when looking for employees to staff a store."
good,It is hard to maintain an easy flow between home life and work life.
good,"The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck. Due to low payroll, I sometimes unloaded the truck with only 1 other employee. At my Rehoboth and Long Neck stores, the whole truck was ours."
good,"Although the pay is horrendous, I loved working there. Awesome managers and very flexible schedule."
good,I learned how to stock shelves with products at a young age working with my father so being a stocker was simple. I already knew how to rotate products by date. I learned how to check vendors in the back door. My management was good but i went through 4 managers when i worked here. The hardest part of the job was my schedule because i worked this job around going to college. I enjoyed the job because of the nice customers.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is rewarding at times, love interacting with customers, vendors are nice also, struggle a little with staff due to attitudes but dealing with it. Dollar General is becoming a very structured company and that is rewarding."
good,"I enjoyed working here, I knew everyone who worked there or shopped there, so it was a blast to see everyone. I would clock in and work at register and put up stock, though it was fun because we played jokes and had fun but still got the job done."
good,"A typical day at work would include most happy customers, some angry, but they all leave satisfied. A short conversation helps me get to know my regular customers more. When I do not have customers in line, I do a little stocking or recovery until another customer comes up. There is no hard part about the job. The most enjoyable part is getting to know more people."
good,I work with a group of hard working people who can get the job done regardless of what is thrown at us.
good,that was the worst job i ever had the manger was rude to us and never had break and it just sucked
good,great manager and good working conditions. If you work hard you can move up. I was part time and could not get enough hours. At the time I was there I tryed to get full time work but there was no openings.
good,To ask about a typical day in the workplace is hardd to describe becuase there really isn't a typical day. Each day is different and as a hard working employee a typical work day is what you make of it.
good,I would usually come in at nine a.m. and begin stocking. Then I would wait on customers until the other cashiers showed up at 11a.m. About that time I would take a break for lunch. Then come back and start stocking again. The best part of the day was how all the workers were friendly and helpful.
good,I greatly enjoy interacting with our customers. The manager of the store was very friendly and took great pride in her store. On more than one occasion we were considered to be a model store.
good,"Arrive at work 8am and clock in. I would pick up my cash drawer out of the office and count it. Then I would sign on to my register so that I am able to check out my customers. As customers entered my store I greeted them by welcoming them to dollar general. I assist them in helping them find merchandise on the sales floor and any questions they may have. When we have our slow periods I stock merchandise on the shelves. At the end of my shift I clean up my station, count my cash drawer, and balance out the subtotal of what was made for that day. Then make a deposit in the drop box. My manager had tought me how to manage money and take inventory. I thank him for taking the time to show me so that one day when its my chance to manage a store I know how. My co-workers were very helpful and caring. The hardest part about my job was leaving for school to start my first year of college. I enjoyed every moment and everyday working with a wonderful group of people,"
good,A typical work day is o.k. there. You make sure the customer is taken care of and your co-workers have what they needed. truck day You make sure you get 1 to 2 roll tanners done within an hour.I learned how to mange a store. Management there was o.k. but got wore out because was required a great bit of responsibility that sometimes required a lot of hires.The co-workers was o.k. but sometimes hard to work with because of me younger than them I was treated like I didn't know what i was talking about or doing.The hardest part of the job was getting my co-workers to listen when i was in charge.The most enjoyable part of my job was when everyone put team work together and helped each other.
good,"A typical day at work no stress peaceful and things go great at the end of the day. I have learned how to stock, recover, unload rolltainers, use uboats, and how to use my customer service skills. My coworkers were great well a few of them but we had a great team. the hardest part of the job was certain things on the cash register but besides that every thing else was easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was using customer service."
good,I enjoyed working here and would love to again. I was learning to do a lot more then I should have been taught.
good,Assist Leasing agents with Lease Agreements and Closing of Stores. My duties were to make sure copies went to Lenders and Banks and Lease Holders. My coworkers were some of the best to work with.
good,"I have learned alot about how the company does not back their older employees up.(the one that has been employed so long) Had good benefits, Had a good team to work with.Hardest part of the job being lied to,get promise thing and do not get.Unloading the truck.I really enjoyed working with the public,getting to meet different types of people and helping them find thing and make suggestion to them"
good,"a typical day at work was handling customer complaints, forwarding the shelves, cashiering doing night deposits. I learned how to set floor plans and endcapps. I was a small part of the management team. I was the one who motivated my co-workers and helped them complete there nightly tasks I usually closed. The location and getting there was not easy it was not on a bus route so I had to walk a mile to get there. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the public and talking with the customers."
good,"I liked working here, the only things that I didn't dig was the small number of people, naturally leads to gossip and what not."
good,"Good company that really cares about serving the community. Also really nice to work somewhere that has policy laid out and so clearly defined. However, you must be willing to consistantly work over 40 hours a week."
good,Working with the public everyday brings you something different and new always
good,When you have the right management the job can be alot of fun.
good,It was a good place to work at I know almost everyone that came in. The customer that came in was happy to see that I was working..
good,This is a good place to work if you need benifits. Its all about what you want to put into your store and the time you want to spend there.
good,good place to work nice people all around it was a blast never depressing just dont be afraid to work the pay is somewhat decent but the peeople u meet make it worth it .
good,It’s an ok company to work for. I have worked for better. I wouldn’t tell anyone I loved to work for them. They only care about themselves. Maybe if you find the right store it’s better.
good,I very much enjoyed my employment at this company. I was given chances to advance and was treated fairly and equally. I was worked with when I was not performing to expectations
good,"Working for a promotion here is competitive and almost ""management pleasing"" which was something I did not like. Other than that, the work was great other than the fact that I was working right at minimum wage and part time."
good,Well I feel like I should have been moved up to assistant manager from key holder but instead I was told I couldn't do the job but I was told to train a cashier that had only been there 3 yrs to do the job
good,I learned how to greet customers learn how to open and close learn how to count the money and take it to the bank learn about assembly learn how to give advice and take advice
good,"A typical day at work included assisting customers with finding an item, understanding customer concerns, managing staff, keeping the store recovered and clean. The management could have been improved but for the most part they were understanding and helpful. The best part of the job is you feel like youre making a difference when a customer is pleasant and polite with you and compliments their experience while they shopped."
good,Nice boss good work environment just not enough hours and low pay not very flexible with the hours And don’t fulfill promises that are made to employees
good,Manager would start drinking beer in back room about 3 until he went home . Wasn’t productive an wasn’t good with customers an actually forgot where products where located an ask us associates to help customer .
good,The people were fun to work with; it was very team oriented and fast paced. I had no problem fitting in and advancing. It was family friendly and clean.
good,To be honest my time at dollar general was quite boring. I prefer a place that’s got more hustle and bustle with being able to be in the sun etc. That being said if you prefer something more kid back and stationary then you would be able to get a better experience
good,Usually a steady flow of customers. Certain times of the day there would be pops in which there would be many more customers than usual. A good bit of heavy lifting.
good,typical day at this Dollar General was very busy taking care of product and customers. Management struggles constantly to take a break. The hardest part of the job was staying on task.
good,"love the company, giving back to the community, easy in and out.  Friendly staff, most always in-stock, great people to work with, good support from the upper management."
good,The job worked well for an entry level customer service job. There was typical drama involved because of the average age of employees. They were very concerned for employee safety.
good,"If you are looking for fair pay for work then you can find it here. Benefits are good and sheduling is flexable. The one I work at has food, gas and a larger floor layout."
good,"Nice pay, great place to work, great coworkers, caring upper management , nothing to hard about this job, honestly its a fairly easy job, various locations for work"
good,"I am a very hard working and productive person..  I work harder under pressure and can balance more than one than at time. Have have experience with scheduling, inventory flow, instock, receiving merchandise."
good,It's a good place to work. They were good about working with a diverse schedule. It was a small town so working with the customers was always pretty easy to do.
good,Pretty good place to work at. All adults as you must be 18 years old or older. It’s pretty easy to get the days off that you need and it’s pretty good about switching days with coworkers.
good,"Very laid back, easy job. Paid weekly, minimum wage. I didn't like that I didn't get many hours as a cashier, but that is probably just the store I worked at."
good,I am not one to ask this - the company has alot of room to grow - but the safety of the employee should be first I was robbed at gun point and then the store was robbed again  in less than a month. I resigned
good,Needs a little more diversity. I stayed to myself and did my job. Management needs a little more awareness training of employees. The environment could be a little more open.
good,Good company for those who don't mind working evenings often. I have 6 children so this is why I'm In the market for change. Otherwise it's ok. Apply.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is basically openind the store, puting out certain items for sale, it really is just a slow paced work environment for me."
good,I loved working at Dollar General..I wish I was still there. But unfortunately my till came up short on 3 different occasions and instead of checking tapes and behind cash drawer. I was fired
good,My time at Dollar general wasn't a very long working experience yet I do think I was one of my best as it was the first time I was actually considered a manager position due to any of my previous work history.
good,always on the go which I loved that part.. stayed busy .but upper mgt in the end was about themselves and not personable ..so did my job over and beyond and went home
good,It is a good company to work for. They have good training material and I have seen them work with you to improve in areas that need development. They work with scheduling needs as well.
good,I loved the people I worked with. They worked around my school schedule as needed. As in any customer service field you will see the good and the bad.
good,Dollar General is a wonderful company to work if you show up on time and do your duties you can definitely move up in the company in a short period of time
good,"Good place to work if you like to have something to do all the time. "
good,good place to work if your in high school looking for easy money to have i your pockets. work is easy and pretty much straight forward with whatever task you have
good,It was good at first and then management changed over. They had trouble keeping good management and keeping up on the store. Other than things being hectic because of high turn over in management it was not a bad place to work.
good,Great work place not to hard of tasks other employs works great together.  i enjoy helping all the customers get what they like with a smile. Fun job really enjoy it.
good,"I’ve worked at dollar general for a little while, it was great. I was always around my kids and my coworkers embraced them coming to the job. I was a stocker and loved by employees and consumers."
good,Dollar general is a nice place I worked at good location hours was far at the time I worked there Management could have been better. Overall I enjoyed my job.
good,"Work was to the point and simple, mainly involved stocking shelves and customer satisfaction. Manager and employees at this location became family to me in a sense."
good,They are nice and some of the managers understand situations that you get in especially when you have kids And understand that you have to take some time off or you don’t have time to come into work sometimes because of your kids being sick and I like that about them
good,Working at Dollar General was a full experience of diversity. I was mostly fun at work and alot of the customers lived in the community. This store location was in the center of the neighborhood.
good,"This was a good place to work, as the work kept me busy, and I made friends along the way. The customers were honestly the worst part of the job. Maybe it was the location? We always had druggies and alcoholics coming in starting stuff with the employees all the time. Every day we were banning customers, or arguing with them because they don't agree with our prices, or the ID laws for purchasing tobacco products. It 2019 people, get used to it. I loved my job, and I do miss it there, it always kept my on my toes. I was informed from a close employee that we were all getting fired and replaced soon, with no warning from the higher Ups. So, I found a new job The look on the managers face was priceless. Was that mean of me?, maybe. Should the manager should have warned everyone instead of firing everyone without warning? Yup."
good,"Dollar General is a very hands on, multitasking job. Improvising and stocking are the two most major daily jobs. They lack the most important part about a growing company, the proper training for their employees. If they could step that one factor up it would improve the turn over as well as the culture."
good,"It was pretty easy working at Dollar General. The only problem was that I couldn't have a social life at all because I would either work 25 hours a week or 47 hours a week. The pay isn't very good ( at 8/hour) and when you do get a raise its 25 to 50 cents more. The good part is you learn how to do everything, you learn to do cash register, stock items, inventory, returns, exchanges."
good,I loved working for this particular store. Stressful at times but loved it. My managers were great and very understanding. The customers were awesome. The only down side was the general manager or regional manager was to harsh on our store manager. We would have freight that didn’t get put up when expected but it was due to not having enough employees. But everyone did their best.
good,"Dollar General is a great job to have if you are seeking only to make side money but as for full time employment, I wouldn’t suggest it. Unless you’re in mgmt,you don’t get paid enough for the amount of work you do"
good,I loved working at Dollar General. They had friendly employees and even friendlier customers. The work was difficult but very fun. I never had a bad work day.
good,Managers need to be trained properly to train their employees properly. Cash register is easy to learn  and the over all work flow must always go smoothly
good,"manage team,cash register and do inventory they back truck and also stocking  shelve food and items  balanceing register at the end of shifts also open and closing store"
good,"Fast paced, never dull or boring and you get to know your customers and community. Don't bother applying if you think you're just going to stand at the register.  There are many advancement opportunities."
good,"Good benefits, good people to work with.  Work / life balance could use some work.  This would be one of the hardest parts of the job.  Your workload/time at work is too unpredictable."
good,"Decent job management was really greet, advancement opportunities were quick and on point. Training was offered and assested... Health care and benifits im not sure if were offered at the time of employment."
good,"Working for dollar general was an alright experience - however, due to my coworkers I found myself often picking up the slack and not generally being compensated or praised for it."
good,They need to update their hardware and review some of their policies. DIGITAL COUPONS CAUSE STRESS ON EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS. Problems with coupons hold up  lines at the register and upsets the customer.
good,not enough hours to get by but a fun place to work. mangers were nice and supportive. the customers were always nice and caring instead of being rude.
good,"my work included instructing employees, cleaning, organizing, unloading freight, checking in vendors, checking dates, observing customers to decrease theft, counting cash, making deposits, making weekly employee schedules, setting store to mag. Keeping store organized and most of all great customer service"
good,"I worked at a store that was very disorganized at first. New management came in and the store got a little better. It was always something to do, so I like that."
good,You meet plenty of people that become your regulars. You get raises once a year. If you're fulltime then you get pretty good benefits. They treat you fair.
good,"On the go, highly stressful, extreme customer service skills required. Need to be happy and love your job. Give your all, don't stop. Multi tasking daily."
good,"Working for dollar General opened many opportunities for myself and my family. Although I am not longer working for the company, I still shop from the stores on a daily basis and I would recommend shopping and working to anyone that was looking for a friendly environment for families."
good,Everybody's good to get along with its a very good company to work at to me the customers are friendly the hardest part is leaving all the friendly smiling faces
good,A great place to work if you're starting off because it accesses your ability to interact with people and solving problems within a work environment that are displayed.
good,"Good paying company..have a couple of things they can work on..attitude towards others. Really think they need to listen to employees more often. Other then that, they are a good company to work for."
good,"As long as you work with good, motivated people. This job is great, however the lazy ones are hard to work with, and will drive you crazy. The right people make this job amazing though!"
good,Working with customers and setting up the a store for seasonal holidays keeps you busy year long. Basic stocking and setting up. Great coworkers and flexible hours
good,"professional positive workplace. defiantly a place foe multiple advancements.i can say the hardest part about working there is also the most enjoyable, would be getting to know the customers and their needs."
good,The store I worked at was very nice. The manager and asst. manager was super nice. I loved the work and the work environment. I loved working at that store.
good,"Running a Dollar General store is a physical and demanding job.  There is no one to come help you if you fall behind and you are required to catch your store back up to standards at all times of the year.  It can be a great place to work if you have the right boss, but there are incompetent ones out there.  Pay is solid for store managers."
good,I asking for your help on trying to better help me assist myself to finding another career.. I wanna try different careers to see where the next level will be and how i can prepare myself for it..
good,Corporate needs to give the store managers more hours to be able to divide up between the employees.. need to allow more time to get the truck put away if they aren't going to give more hours to the employees .
good,"Working here was a lot of fun (with the right people), but also very stressful, especially when corporate came into town, or when it was time for inventory. The worst part about the job was working nights and weekends, but this is a staple in any retail job. The best part was the regular customers and the employees. When you see someone almost every day for a year, you become friendly."
good,"Everyday when I went to work I would go and restock shelves and make sure items where where they needed to be, then I would greet customers when they walked into the store and helped them on there way out from ringing up there bags to taking there bags for them if there was another employee on the register."
good,typical day at dollar general is slow and does get a little boring. How to be patient with others. There is no hard parts while working there. Most enjoyable part about working there is talking with the customers
good,"I have no real problems with Dollar General,  it is a decent place to work.  But it's good for those that need their first job or want to supplement their income."
good,I grew to love my work family at The Dollar General. I made friends that I still have today. It's also an easy job. I became close with my regulars that came in.
good,The hardest part of my job was co-worker had their work and personal lives messed up.they all friends outside work so naturally nothing I could do was gud enough
good,"Ok place to work wasn’t bad at all. Had ok hours."
good,"Exciting, looking to win every day starting with analysis of my business, focus in on opportunities to drive results. Then taking action to get results, product, people, process or tools. Following up on actions that will get needed results. Get support as needed while giving support as needed. Assess the daily results and plan actions at end of day for tomorrow. I use management as a tool to get results, learn, and pass on what I learn to those around me. This will create a culture of fun, teaching, learning all the while driving the expected Company expected results. "
good,"My Experience workin with dollar general i would say was satisfying. I experienced alot of hands on tasks, became very social with customers thay really helped boost my customer service skills and learned alot of responsibility going through the managment process. Over all I had a great learning experience  with this company."
good,"I worked in two different Dollar Generals. My first store for a year, second store for two years. My first store manager went from having me work four days a week, 6 hour shifts to one day a week for 4 hours, she would clock in and then leave the store for her whole shift. Her ASM trained me from day one and when he was made a SM at another store, he transferred me with him. He was great to work with. The pay could be increased to $9 and hour, it's not a hard job but the customers are almost always rude and impatient and the amount of work each employee is more then one can handle, esp. if there are only two or three working at once."
good,The work was hard but fun in some ways. There was a set schedual that was comanly change for production needs. They had many procedure changes in the the time I was there which lead to miscommunication and procedure confusion. Over all I like the job.
good,They wanted you to work off the clock. Everyone was nice and easy to get along with. Job was easy to learn. Was asked quick to be a key holder. I accepted.
good,"Warehouse job. so its hot and cold depending on the weather outside. Hard work but the pay was good. most of the people are nice and friendly."
good,Productive and fast pace environment. Easy to get alone with co workers and management. There are long work hours. The schedule can cause difficulties at home when childcare is needed
good,"So so. Too many variables to summariz"
good,I loved working at Dollar General. I love my regular customers. And i had a good manager. If i didnt get robbed on duty i would still be there.. But overall i loved it.
good,Every shift had a load of tasks and responsibilities. My main focus was the customers and helping them find items. Trying to be around when cashier needed help checking out the customers. I enjoyed working there part time.
good,Working for this company is okay if you looking for a job to support your family dollar general isn’t the right place to be because the pay is weird but other than that it’s a okay job
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy vents up and down. The management is cool to work with.
good,I learned to stay on task always smile and help costemers and have a good attitude because if not your gonna have a bad day at work if not you are gonna take your anger out on everyone that is around you and not meaning to
good,"Good benefits, and 401k plan. Keeps you in shape with competitive labor. Always room for improvement at this company, but still an ok place to work at."

good,"Dollar general is a great company I experienced alot, learned budgeting labor,sales. Merchandise product to get Salle's, excellent customer service is a must."
good,There are times its fast and other times it is slow. The management is wonderful. The hardest part of the job is standing there during a rush. All the co-workers are really easy to work with.
good,"Overall great company! I loved working here. Advancement opportunities are great! A typical day included opening/closing the store, providing customer service, operating a cash register, maintaining the stock and cleanliness of the store"
good,It was an overall good work experience. The more willing you were to do do you job the more hours you received. I had really great management. And my coworkers and I seemed to get along well. Any problems were addressed as necessary.
good,"Some of the workers were very lazy and was criminals stealing out of the register and the store "
good,The work was not hard ran a cash register and stocked shelves. Had good employees not really alot of hours work was not really fast. Nice customers they were very friendly but usually the same people.
good,In the 3 years that I work at this store I had enjoy working there. I gotten along with the manager and the team. We always tried to work together. I had the  up most respect for them and the customers.
good,"Working at Dollar General was overall a good experience. I put into work my extensive retail management experience, as well as my merchandising techniques. Coworkers were pleasant to work with. Most customers were friendly and overtime became quite acquainted with the personnel at the store."
good,"I put in a lot of hours at the Dollar General i worked at and my biggest issue was the pay, i made $8 a hour and spent my whole weekends running the store most of the time by myself because we was so under staffed which made things hard because i am a  mom of 3 that hardly got anytime with my kids because of the understaffed store and the pay was terrible for all the responsibilities i had"
good,Dollar General is very diverse in every way and we aim to satisfy out customers. If the customers are unhappy with a purchase then we aim to mane the situation better!!
good,I liked working around people I didn't care how dollar general treated their employees.  When you're salary they expected you to work 80 hours a week.
good,"I really did not have a problem with this job. My manager was great at her job, she treated us as like family but still made sure our work was done. I left because I had to get my grade up in school."
good,"Was pretty easy, take care of customers and stock the store. "
good,I have been working with the Dollar General Company since Oct 2018 Customer Service cashier/key holder work with a good group of people but lacks benifets
good,I made great friends while working at Dollar General. I enjoyed my time there. Most days that i worked were relaxed and fun.The only problem I had was not getting enough hours to live on.
good,I was trained for my job untill I understood what I needed to do and when I needed to do everything so that I could get it all completed in the time alowed. I always got a lunch break if I worked more then 5 hours.
good,My typical work day consisted of me arriving early in the morning were I stocked and organized shelves. I had to work under certain deadlines for certain isles. This was measured by the number of carts that I did an hour.
good,DG taught me a lot about my personal development and what I needed to accomplsh for growth. Definitely HARD WORK! Stick to it and you will see the benefits.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is what you would expect.  Nose down in a cubicle, attending meetings, and working hard to grow our stature as a low cost retailer."
good,"It's good a place to work you get lots of overtime"
good,"Dollar General is a great first job or early job, but there is not much room for advancement to entirely label it a career. There are not many benefits that go along with working for the company. The mangers and others in leadership do a very good job of going above and beyond what they are required to do. They try to create a 'team' atmosphere that makes everyone more eager to work and succeed."
good,Dollar General was a good first job. I would come in sign in on the register and begin helping customers. If I came in early enough I would assist with stocking and preparing the store for customer use.
good,Very fast pace. Easy work but a lot of it. Lots of friendly people. Lots of chances to advance in this company. Would love to go back to work here if possible
good,"Stock items present items neatly on shelf for customers, help customers finds items if needed, keep store clean, sometimes work the register and answer store phone if needed."
good,"My coworkers were great and so were the hours I received from my manager. The job itself was fairly easy to perform. As I was not a keyholder though, I did not have as many responsibilities."
good,"The hours are a little long some weeks, but that's all due to shipping volume. Overall, they are a good employer based on type of work and rate of pay."
good,"Busy days with inventory and shipments. Learned to set planograms, enjoyed staying busy, most difficult physically helping unload trucks. Large store with high theft"
good,"I worked for Dollar General for less than 3 years, and loved my job. I advanced very quick into management (3 months) and climbed to the top given the opportunity to be Store Manager less than 4 months later. Due to personal reasons had to leave the company, hoping to return. An ""acting"" district manager put me in the system as walk off the job, when that certainly was not what happened. There was a notice given, a week and a half prior to that day. My actual district manager was on medical leave at the time. Since my departure from Dollar General the same (actual) district manager, i had, has referred me to Driveline Retail Merchandising and has tried to get me rehired with the company. I currently work in his district for three of his stores as their driveline represenative."
good,"it started off  good and after 6 months things got got hard with crew members quitting for various reasons, in return makes my job and duties more difficult...it can take upwards of 2 weeks to hire in new employee..my job ended over something i think looking back i think now is quite silly ..its all about having good working crew..period"
good,"Each day as my 2nd shift started I would put my cashier in and take out the morning shift cashier. I would count down the teal and I would balance her. As my shift started I would work on totes, I would "
good,The Dollar General  I worked at only had fast paced moments throughout the day as it was located in a small community. Organization and time management were the most important parts of getting everything done.
good,"Quick paced job, but it's also easy going. The hardest part about the job is stocking and straightening the aisles and shelves at night. During the day it gets pretty busy so you have to straighten the shelves even you can. Night shift is usually when all the stocking and straightening gets done."
good,"I consider dollar general a great place to work specially if you’re a college student, full time mother etc well this place of business will be your best decision."
good,Enjoyable working experience. Got to work hard tho. Lloyds of responsibility if willing to take it on. The job involves al ot of customer service which is a fun aspect off the work.
good,"My time with Dollar General was an interesting time. I have to say the company is good, if you are willing to put forth the effort. In just a month I was promoted to key holder because my drive and skill were noticed. Like all retail positions your days will vary, based on customers and stocking needs."
good,"I liked the job and co- workers. most customers were friendly. there was a chance for promotions, but I didn't get to stay there long enough because we moved."
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General Distribution. The pay was great and we got plenty of hours whether u wanted it or not. I left because I had relocate so I could take care of personal business back home.
good,"It is an okay job! It's tough and strenuous...very demanding!!! Always busy and fast paced, never a dull moment. There is always something to do...not a lot of down time."
good,"Constant work no time for games ,helps the day go by fast. The hardest part of the job is lack of security and theft and threats to employees, enjoy my co-worker."
good,"I was attending online college when employed here, and they worked with my schedule so that I could continue my online classes and finish course work in a timely manner."
good,I had very good managers. You do have to lift a lot for stocking and when my health declined I had to quit because I could no longer meet the job requirements. I believe they gave vacation time but they did not give any discounts. You did get a 30 min to an hour break depending on how many hours you worked in a day. They were very flexible with scheduling.
good,Enjoyed my co workers an customers. I learned a lot from working for dollar general. It was very hard work but I enjoyed it. I stayed in good physical shape while working for the company
good,"A typical day at work actually varies depending on the day.  Several times through the week their is sales ad that need put up and old ad taken down.  New endcaps and displays that change weekly.  "
good,"Dollar general is a fast paced, extremely stressful job that atleast offers higher pay vs. Dollar tree. If your management team is positive you will love it."
good,My customers make my day. I work well with my employees. It's all about keeping up with the stock and paperwork. As long as you have the right team you'll love your job.
good,"i was fast paced to make sure my job was done and my cashier! when you do your job then the boss was happy! my customers are like easy to please, but sometimes you cant please everyone"
good,"The hardest part of the job was trying to run my shift, while working freight out.  You got to be able to juggle stocing shelves, recovery, running a register. And trying not to go over your hours or cooperate would have a fit"
good,I managed a team of 8-10. Loved working with the public. The hardest part of the job was getting people who actually wanted to work. Management was great and stood behind their employees.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is usually stressful because of not having enough help to finish projects. I've learned a lot while being with Dollar General (balancing deposits, cashiers drawers, printing out reports), etc. The management at Dollar General is one of the best that I've worked with. The culture at Dollar General could use improving. The hardest part of working at Dollar General, is watching who you talking to because they run back to the manager and tell all."
good,Its a good job opportunity great place to work but the hour are always getting cut the DMs are not fair with the hours. Also the job is a little scary to work for we never feel safe they have people work alone.
good,"Everyone was nice to one another which made stress free work days. Cheap, cheap pay. No one stays pay is cheap. You are always busy, never boring. Need more than $7 an hour!!!!"
good,I liked working there because we had a hard working team. We all did our part and it made it much easier for everyone... I really enjoyed putting up truck and stocking merchandise and also resetting planograms.. my least favorite thing was running the registar because it felt like I had no time to do anything other than run the registar
good,"The work days were stressful, but the pay was really good for a college student. It provided a lot of experience within the short time I was there. Overall a rather average work experience."
good,This company is easy to work for and if you are willing you can advance to higher rolls. You get paid vacation days after 6 months of being full time. They offer medical and other benefits.
good,"A normal day at Dollar General is usually not easy but does have its slow times to take a breather. The job consisted of stocking inventory items and making sales to customers. At times it would be impossible to get anything done because of having to assist customers. The hardest part of working with Dollar General is the work load. You are expected to get a certain amount of stocking down everyday while also keeping customer satisfaction high, and what made it so hard was the fact that there's 3 employees at a single Dollar General at one time. Above all, the customers are the most enjoyable part of working there because when you help someone find what they need and they leave smiling it reminds you that your doing a good job."
good,"fast paced hard to pay the bills if you are a cashier at Dollar General. only SM,ASM,and full time lead get hrs and you cant find another part time job due to the scheadule changing"
good,Working at dollar general has taught me a lot about retail.Dollar general provides the community with a clean well stocked friendly place to shop.I have learned how to run a retail business .
good,This wasn't a bad job it was just the hours I was scheduled for for my position took away from the whole day and was hard to balance personal life at times .
good,The hardest  part of the job would include unloading a 53ft. trailer in a maximum of 2 hrs. I learned resiliency during the duration of my time. I enjoyed the pay.
good,I loved the team members that I worked with but they just couldn’t work around my husbands job hours and the times I needed off to be with my boys. It became hard for me to get hours with my husband working overnights
good,Dollar general is a great place to work that has tremendous upside. Management is up to par the benefits can be expanded on but it is a career path that is rewarding
good,"this job was located in the heart of Tampa, still had a small town neighborhood store feel. learned a bunch of multi tasking techniques here. loved the customers"
good,"You have to have the drive and focus of a champion to work here. If you want a management position then you have to work your butt off in order to get it, but if you are content with doing the bare minimum then this is not the place for you."
good,"It’s a fairly easy job, just stocking the sales floor basically and greeting customers, learning how to work the register and all the controls doesn’t take too long, It’s nice because you start seeing your regular customers come in and you start forming relationships with them"
good,"Managers were understanding, if you are in college and any prior responsibilities. Co-workers are friendly. There  are minor cons but everyone is helpful."
good,It was really fun to work there for the amount of time they need me too. I got to make some good friends and I would go back and work there again if they ever need someone to stock their shelves.
good,"Overall nice, can't complain about much. A typical day was generally easy going, going between manning the register and stocking, so simple enough. Workplace culture was decent as well. No hard parts of the job, the most enjoyable was the workplace environment."
good,I loved my manager. He kept me working there. DG has some unrealistic expectations of my particular store. They offered little pay but good hours. Its retail so not high expectations
good,"Manager fair "
good,All in all was a great place to work. I would definitely work here again. upper management should have more open dialog with the store managers. managers should have more freedom to be able to complete paperwork required.
good,overall it's a decent job. interaction with customers. Stay busy throughout the whole shift. very knowledgable of store layout. great place to work if you have kids.
good,i loved my job and all my coworkers i had i loved most of the customers but had some that i couldnt stand the site of because they judged me for my sexuality
good,I became an assistant  manager rather quickly once I become comfortable with the work duties. I was also given a good bit of overtime hours once I became a manager.
good,"I enjoyed working there. I started as an assistant store manager, with the possibility of advancement. The benefits are really good. It is a fast paced job."
good,The typical day I work start immediately checking out customers after counting my till. I have learned how to deal with all types of customers and the workplace is friendly and productive. The managment is reliable and cooperative with employees. The hardest part of the job for me is dealing with coupons because of the many rules that apply to them. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with many different people each day making no day dull.
good,they are a very good company to work for. some of the managers were all for themselves and only applied rules to certain employees. the management that i was under were some backstabbers.
good,I started as a cashier and stocker then move my way up to assistant manager had to handle vendors come in door with new product sign count product had to do returns for customers override all problems at registers count all registers .do end of the shift process and process for closing store on the nights I close assist manager when needed also when manager was unable to work act as acting manager. Supervise and help with inventory. Help with customers needs when they needed assistanc.
good,Id have the say the hardest part of the job was being belittled and getting attitudes from customers for having to show ID. What i liked most about working for Dollar General was helping and assisting customers and putting a smile on their faces. I also liked the upbeat pace and the employees.
good,Company is very productive. Every store is maintained and well stocked. Customers and products are the most important things to every Dollar General team.
good,"The pay was not that great, however the customers and vendors made it a good environment. The store got its busy times and slow times but always something to do"
good,"- Scheduled routine on a daily basis"
good,I like dollar general as a great and productive company.. U can learn a lot about retail. Over all the district managers and all are cool people. I would rate the company at a 7.
good,Great people nice place always clean workers always busy nice customer service easy to find easy to get out good parking prices are great you can find almost everything you need there but meat
good,Typical retail job. Decent hours. Pays minimum wage. Customers can be ridiculous sometimes. Some of the customers make your work worthwhile though...like the ones you help and they are grateful and their day is better just by interacting with you.
good,"Dollar General is a very fast paced job and there is never a dull moment, they provide opportunities for you to move up in the company and work with your personal life schedule."
good,"At Dollar General, the customer is always right. No matter what, you must yield to the consumer, even if their behavior is very questionable. Most stores are located in sketchy neighborhoods, so you have to learn how to proceed with caution in moments of conflict."
good,Dollar General is the most relaxed fast pace working environment there is I enjoyed coming to work meeting new people the staff is friendly and helpful.
good,I enjoyed my time at dollar General. Team members were well trained and the job itself was simple and repetitive. Not a bad place to work overall. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone.
good,Was my first job and was very enjoyable. I loved most of the customers and the co workers. Very flexible with hours. Only bad thing I can say about it is the pay
good,It was a great work experience I recommend anyone who is barely starting to look for a job to consider working at this establishment. It is a great way to start a career
good,The job it's self is ok. The hours worked  and that it is always changing is something I didn't like. Sometimes the schedule would change a few times a week. That is something hard to deal with when you have small children. I would recommend this job for someone with no real home life. Single or married with no kids or someone with older children.
good,Working at dollar general was a once in a lifetime experience. They work with you and help you grow. They are patient and understanding. They work with you when you need schedule assistance.
good,"Easy jobs, biggest thing to deal with is the general public. overall pretty easy work and easy to learn. Not a bad place to look for advancement either."
good,"The more you like your coworkers the less stressful the job because its a team effort to keep the store looking presentable and keeping it stocked without falling behind."
good,i really enjoyed working with the public and i did opening and closing did deposit to bank i did inventory and stocking i also did outs and also recieving and so much more
good,Working for Dollar General was fast-paced and enjoyable. Running registers was easy and helping customers was satisfying. Paperwork was the hardest part of the job and helping the customers the most enjoyable.
good,great company to work for. Willing to give any one in the company a chance for grow and develop. the pay is competitive and the benefits are great. I would recommend this company
good,"The staff I worked with was great, but any higher ups didn't seem to care and we're letting the store fall apart. It was usually dirty, and stock would need delivered to the wrong store."
good,Good management and a good place to work a part time job for minimum wage. Friendly staff and management make it a fun temporary job with understandable shifts that work to benefit single collage students.
good,Had a bad experience with one manager. Other than that the job was easy. Enjoyed most of my co workers. And pay was great for the time that i worked there.
good,I loved working at the location I worked in. The only downfall was that I had no choice but to leave because I gave birth to my son and couldn't go back to work only making $8.60 an hour. I wasn't making enough to pay for my child to go to daycare and sustain life.
good,"I loved this company, because There is many opportunities for advancement. My store manager was very supportive with my training and setting me up for success. The pay and benefits could be a lot better."
good,I recommend this job to students because it is very flexible. Not a company to live off of. Compensation not to well. But does believe in second chances.
good,Dollar General does provide opportunities for training and advancement even more so if individuals are willing to relocate. It is a stable company and growing in the US.
good,"Great advancement opportunities. "
good,"Needed a job in a hurry when I relocated and they hired me on the spot. Has been a good place to work for past two years. There are no benefits for part time workers and no perks. "
good,"While a Sales Associate can do quite a lot, I myself have been stuck as a cashier for a very long time.  With almost nine months of work, I've only been able to not use a cash register a grand total of three times, despite bringing it up with my manager, bless their heart, despite how much they try to help me out.  A lot of regulars come by, and knowing that they genuinely appreciate your job can really brighten up your day despite the few bad apples who appear to be determined to make you miserable."
good,"I love my job, but advancement is proving to be very difficult. Stellar reviews don't necessarily mean you are suggested for promotion. Sadly, the better you are in your current position, the more reluctant they are to advise promotion or lateral moves. Management has always been great, and willing to teach. We are like a big family... that doesn't want anyone to grow up and move out."
good,Security wasn’t really a thing there I believe. Anyone could come and cause harm. The employees weee terrific. I loved being promoted from one store to another
good,Clock in and get drawer for the register.  Put drawer in register and start work.  Work the register when customers come in to purchase products.  When no one is in the store then I would go to restock the shelves until a customer would come into the store.  At the end of my shift if it was in the evening we would mop the floors after locking the door.  Then clock out and go home.
good,It was a fun first experience for a job but it was a lot of things this job lacked on. The store was to big for just 2 or 3 people per shift. People always stealing. Certain things didn’t work. And it was hard to stock
good,This job was a great experience and gave me the opportunity to now have retail and management skills for future jobs. The management was great and the employees were always helpful. The most difficult thing was training new employees and the least was the day to day tasks of recovery and cashiering. There are computer based learning videos that are a big part of training.
good,"This was a very physical, but fun loving job.  I enjoyed my interaction with the customers. I enjoy making someone's day.  The hardest part of the day, was putting the freight away.  That was very physical and draining."
good,"the typical day would depend on the time and day, some days are slow and other days are busy. the hardest part of the job would be rude customers and what I enjoyed the most was the people I worked with."
good,"It's not entirely stressful but you do need to stay up to date with the constantly changing special sale offers. In my experience there, you would have to learn not only how to operate a cash register, but address phone calls from customers as well. Aside from that the work experience is rather calm."
good,"Reviewing  reports at 5 am in the morning,  , "
good,"Sometimes it can be too much to handle because of lack of management. It's a descent company to work for, a lot people just can't handle it with the low pay."
good,"Customer where good, flexible hours but not enough, management was good, employees were okay, location was good, pay needs to be based on your experience."
good,Friendly work environment. Must be a people person and can follow directions and tasks in a timely manner. I enjoyed working here made good friends and great customers.
good,Great work environment and they are very understanding of needing time off for personal reasons. Laid back and nice customers.i stocked the shelves whenever the truck came in and waited on the customers when they were ready to checkout
good,"This place was fun as well , everybody got along, it was a team. The manager noticed another employee struggling with a pallet and went to help him not realizing there was another pallet falling and I jumped in to make sure none of my co workers got hurt"
good,"I loved my job, but after being robbed at gun-point I was treated very unfair by corporate, so I left. It was hard bc I loved the job. It wasn't and easy job that anyone can do. It can be stressful, but it can also be rewarding. It's a great place to get job experience. Depending on management and your co-workers, if everyone does their job, gets along, and you are treated well, you can move up and make a career out of it. Just don't get robbed!"
good,Good comfortable place nice workers stand up people work there.. it's a nice place for kids who graduated from high school to start off a responsible jobs
good,"This is a good jo for someone to have that would like to be in business, either entrepreneurial or management. I liked the team that I managed. I really wish that I could become a manager again, either for this company or another. I liked being the leader for a team."
good,The work environment isn't quite the best but for not having any job experience it is a great start for anyone. The hours that they can give you are very flexible.
good,Depending on the day of the week you can be overwhelmed with work from helping out a customer to restocking or receiving  or even just  organizing  price tags or you could find yourself behind the register trying to find something to do to look busy because there is nothing to do .
good,The day was like any other day i would have to clock and work on the register which took some time to learn as well as stocking. Recovery and Clean up were my strong points and what I was good at
good,While working at Dollar General I discovered the art of multi-tasking. I  had to ensure merchandise was in rotation and shelves were fully stocked for customers to purchase. I also had to unload supply trucks which came in weekly.
good,"you are going from the time you get in until you leave. from the time you punch in you get your cash draw,count it d.own .now we start to un-load the truck.this could take several days depending on the coverage.you also have to wait on customers and answer the phone..my co workers are great we can have some laughs. the hardest part of my job is the ladder. i need the ladder because  am short sometimes my legs hurt .the best part of my job are the people i meet daily.,so many great people i have formed o bondwith..management is going thru a change .we just got a new store manager she is learning every day.the"
good,"A typical day at DG would be busy.It can get a little hectic during the peak times.I learned a lot while working there such as merchandising,resets and management after being promoted to assistant manager.The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be when Im able to help my customers have an amazing shopping experience."
good,"Working at Dollar General is considerably hard work, though it is worth it. You cannot go wrong with this job due to the kindness of the management and the work ethic of the other coworkers."
good,"It was ok place to work managers were very helpful, but trying to recover the store was impossible.  They worked with me and my busy family life and gave me a schedule that worked for me."
good,"I was a key holder, so I had to stock the rest of the store with the truck. As a key holder you also have to keep an eye on the cahsier and listen for a phone call, they may need you to void an item out on the register, or change the price if incorrect."
good,"I loved working at Dollar General, they are a great company to work for and will take the time to help you advance if you put the work in. They had a lot of District Manager turnover while I was there which was frustrating but they finally landed on a great DM and things went smoother."
good,"The normal day being a keyholder there was opening the store setting the alarm and getting everyone prepared for your customers and cashier. through out the day normally stocked our shelves and recovered alot, at times we woud have a problematic customer but it wasnt anything i was unhappy to take of for them."
good,"In my time at dollar general, i learned how to build people skills i previously lacked and learned to appreciate both saving money, and the hard work required to make a living. While the pay wasnt what id like, its better now, and everyone i worked with were hard working in their own way."
good,"Good People to Work with"
good,Typical work day consists of various activities that you have to do by the end of each day. Most of them are truck days and it repeats in a never ending cycle.
good,Dollar General is a very interesting fast-paced place to work. Always something new to learn. Very rewarding job if you have the right team to support you
good,Good advancement opportunities if you are hard working and dont mind long hours. You are expected to work at least 6 days per week. I was promoted from within to District Manager
good,"This is a company where each moment in the day can be different, from fun to stressful to exciting. This company is a good company to work for if starting out in life or trying to learn the retail business."
good,"It wasn't my first choice of places to work, but it was one of my favorites over recent years. I don't know how working at other DG stores is, but I had a blast."
good,"Working at DG can be good and bad at the same time. I go to work to my own area and to do my work and someone comes and bothers you with their work. So you help them and next thing you know you're behind on your work. Other days you go to work and have a great day, it just all depends on the day."
good,It was fun and easy when I worked there but the pace was to fast to be working there and they wanted to write people up for walking to slow or something that’s simple
good,I enjoyed working at dollar general but the pay for the assistant store manager was very lacking. Compared to the regular associates the compensation wasn't adequate.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting each and every customer when they enter the store and when leaving, Being courteous and helpful. Maintain a cleanly appearance of store and displays as well as checkout area. Maintain knowledge of products on hand as well as location. As an assistant manager, oversee cashiers, scheduling, payroll, inventory, planograms and current sales. Opening and closing of store, cash handling and computer usage. Making sure that all customers are satisfied."
good,Would recommend for a first job. Paid fairly and hard work will advance your position quickly. Flexibility in scheduling and accommodating needs of employees.
good,Things ran smoothly and quick. everything in the store was done in a timely fashion. Everyone is respectful and understanding and professional. Everyone is hardworking.
good,"I really loved working at DG, my first five years there was wonderful, until they  bought out the company. The atmosphere changed. I learned how to do many different jobs, and how to fix a lot of things. it is a place where promotion can be achieved. nothing was hard about my job, but you did have to stay on your toes."
good,"Running a cash register, cleaning, and stock were the main job duties  preformed. I would not say there was anything hard about the job. I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the position."
good,I love the store as for working there its not my place. The manager is a sweet heart and most the workers are amazing but I'm looking for a job that I myself will feel like I fit in!
good,Able to  learn skills and other abilities that can help better yourself along with the store and company. though my experience was short i would recommend this job
good,Learned a lot. Enjoyed working with my co workers. Everyone worked as a team. It was fast paced but done efficiently. Rearranged isles and displays made things change up on occasion.
good,I loved my customers that came in just about everyday. It was a very fast paced and busy job. Everyone in the job got along very good and we all worked well together.
good,"Employment at Dollar General was always fast paced - this is not the kind of job you should walk into if you think it will be easy.  Stocking, register, cleaning, organizing, and customer service are mandatory for all employees.  This was a good place to work because of the team of coworkers."
good,"hired in as a stocker, with hard work droped weight from 260 down to 180, kept constantly busy on the job and felt great, in store management was great and worked with me for the oppertunitys to advance to low key management to assistant management within 1 yr."
good,It was a fun environment.. everyone was helpful ... just wasn’t enough pay! The staff was great and the company was great just wasn’t the tripe of hours I was looking for !
good,Dollar General is a good place to work with good people there. There isn't always a very clear path of advancement but they do have your interest in mind.
good,"I wasn't really sure how I would feel working with the public after over a decade of working in manufacturing and logistics, but I enjoy it a lot. I love my customers, even the ""occasional characters"". There is always something to do and rarely a dull moment."
good,"Dollar General was one of the places in the years i've worked i enjoyed the most. It became a mini family there and was very relaxed, i got to know my customers very well, and there is a lot of opportunity to grow in the company if you work hard. (I started off as a cashier and became a Key Holder in a month and held a Assistant Manager position for awhile). The only, but big part of it's downfall is Management. I had some very cool bosses, don't get me wrong. But i was there for a year and a half and the place went through 4 managers, there isn't something right there. It's frustrating for employees because we get used to doing things a certain way and then someone may have a different way of doing it and want to change it, even though what we have done is working and at that point, (sorry) we know more of how our day flow works. I was told by Managers that only lasted weeks, that they got false promises of scheduling or money or the current stores conditions."
good,The work day at DG is long but very rewarding.  We have developed a remodel process that only takes 5 days or less.  I was part of the team helping to streamline this process.  Opportunity to advance is there for those who desire it.  I started with the company as a Store Manager Candidate.  I have quickly advanced from there through the ranks with 3 promotions in the years I've been with the company.  The hardest part of the job is the long days of physical output and long hours of driving.  The hardest part of the job leads to the best part which is a very fair amount of time off.
good,Working at Dollar General was a nice company to work for although it has its pros and cons just like any other job. The people are super friendly..although at times you will get some not so friendly people you just have to greet them with a smile and be as helpful as you can.
good,Liked working there but sometimes the hours are to much for me. Good place to work as far as benefits go. The vacation days are awesome. two weeks after one year.
good,Dollar General was not a bad company to work for. you had a mandatory amount of hours you had to work but it went fast. The were there to help you and the pay was good.
good,Was an awesome workplace and loved the co-workers. The inconsistent hours is what i cant deal with. I love working in retail now because of this job and seeing the smiles on the customers faces is what makes the job worth it.
good,"I love working at the dollar general that I am at, I have great coworkers and manager.. I just wish we got paid more, especially since my store is ranked 2 in the district for sales. I work at least 40 hrs a week and don't get paid enough, especially since I would like to move out on my own."
good,"The job is defiantly a people person environment. Must not be afraid to work in the public. Do not be offended by the different diversity of customers that have many different need, want, and attitudes."
good,I really loved working at dollar general I work at 2 stores and they both was completely deferent but working at dollar general was the best one.. I would pick dollar general over Walmart
good,Pay is sub par and your expected to work non stop but with the right group of co workers it makes this a easy and fun place to work u must like faced paced challenging workplace.
good,Fast paced job mainly focused on satisfying customers and restocking store supplies.  Fair hours and supportive management that is willing to help if you have any questions.
good,At dollar general you are responsible for not only cashier duties you also have to stock clean and manage coustomers while you continue working. It’s like a circus on steroids some days
good,"Fast paced with lots of duties to do. Unload truck and stock shelves.  Cashier, relieve cashiers for breaks. I learned how to do a lot of management duties and I enjoyed it."
good,My only problem was I have epilepsy and tire quickly!It was very stressful for me at the time.Might go back to DG to work!It is a wonderful place to work and there is a new crew now!
good,"It's hard work. You are putting cases of detergent into a rolling container and lifting sometimes more than 50 pounds over your head. You have to be very fast. They give you a 12 week ramp up period in order (for me at least) to build up the muscles you need. You will be sore.  Management tries to work with you. Most people are nice but because everyone is trying to ear their own bonuses, people do unsafe things. They try to stress safety but on the other hand stress speed so much. It's doable, but it's hard. If you like a challenge, want to be paid well, and like lifting this is the job for you. Not on a bus route, and start time is really early like 4:53 am for some shifts so hard for parents with day cares not opening that early."
good,Had to stay productive stocking and making things pretty. I learned a lot about costumer service. Learned how to work with others and to be respectful
good,great place to work and great team members. manger was fair and understanding. schedule was very flexible as well.  Very steady work flow times goes by fast.
good,Dollar general is a really good company to work for. They are very loyal to there employees. They don't fire and hire often unless needed. They work with you if have children and care about you and you family. I truly appreciate this company
good,"Dollar General is a great first job, I started as an entry-level cashier. They are willing to work with students and individuals with tight schedules."
good,My coworkers became like family to me. I went from cashier to Store Manager in less than two years. Two early mornings a week we had to help unload trucks -- usually only about three of us around 5:30 am. I enjoyed overseeing my assigned section of the store and creating eye catching endcaps to sell 'must-go' or seasonal items. The pay was incredibly low even when I became Store Manager and was working 50+ hours a week.
good,"You won't be exposed to weather, you won't get your hands dirty or scared for the most part (if you follow safety procedures). In my short experience there, you leave your personal business at the door and just put in your hours they ask of you. You do that, and you'll pretty always have a place with them."
good,Work is fast paced. My co-workers are all friendly and helpful. The most difficult aspect of the job is the physical demands of stocking and dealing with products. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with customers.
good,I would recommend Dollar General as like a first time job or something to fill your time up with part time hours. One of the best jobs I ever had and stocking isn't that demanding.
good,"Being on call on the whole floor was a great experience for maintaining verbal customer skills and great multi-tasking skills."
good,"I worked for the company for six years, was devoted and going to retire. Unfortunately, I quit due to personal reasons. It was time for a new career. Company gave managers an increase in pay and along with that an increase in the hours we worked. Constant changes of store do's and dont's that we had to adjust to. Certain times it would be overwhelming and stressful and that comes with my position but I also need support from dm. That wasn't always the case. I was a confident, dedicated, efficient, detailed and committed manager/leader. But my company made me second guess my worth and asset to them. Its all business."
good,"The job was great, until the boss DEMANDED perfection everyday, I was written up for not picking up one box that was hidden in the corner. I was messaged by my manager off the clock over something I didn't do. Creating drama, so I relocated to another manager who appreciated me and made me really fall in love with the job."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. The only thing was a manager that didn't do her job. She threatend my job allot due to her wanting her personal time off.
good,Great benefits and reasonable pay fairly easy work but can be very fast paced. I would still be willing to work here if i had a different store manager.
good,"I loved working here, friendly people & coworkers, not so great hours & rate of pay & no store discounts."
good,"Most employee are under paid compared to other competitive companies in the same field. Which i think is one if the main reason previous employee no longer which for the cmpany, to seek better pay"
good,"I would always do the same thing every night , but I was able to balance each job and was able to have great customers compliment me and really didn't have any problems"
good,Typical day was very busy. Stocking and facing the store was ninety percent of this job. Most of your day you are spending time stocking the shelve with seasonal products.
good,It is a great place to work but pay rate is very low. We keep changing managers so it is stressful to get used to the way each manager likes to run the place
good,"Could be paid more for the hours that you work. The company is a pretty good place to work at, most of the people are nice and easy to get along with."
good,Being assistant manager is a great opportunity and I recommend it to anyone wanting to move up. Main goal to go up to store manager but it is a lot of hard work and hours. You have to be willing to put in the effort. I love it.
good,Dollar General Store is not a bad place to work. The pay rate is only minimum wage. No benefits. The Managers are not hard to work for.I would say it is a job for someone who just wants to make some extra money. Can't really make a living there.
good,"Very stressful job especially being a manager and working over 60 hours a week. Obtained experience on the register, ordering, making a schedule, handling money and customer service."
good,"The work is steady most of the time. There are stressful days and there are calmer day. Balanced most of the time."
good,Dollar General has been great to me; offering advancement when that is what I was seeking and a position to step back to when I felt the time was right to do so.
good,Dollar General has been a great place for me to get experience with customer services and retail.  Learning how to recover and stock has been proven very good for the store and we make high amounts of revenue everyday. I just need a place with higher pay.
good,The company does value and take care of it's employees. Individual managers can sometimes be problematic. But over the pay scale is outstanding the line of business that it is.
good,"It was a productive, fun place to work at. The hours were super flexible with friendly coworkers. There were times it became busy and a little tough but over all it was an easy place to work at."
good,asked a lot of as part time employee. Seems like most stores are always under staffed for amount of work load that is needed to be completed on a weekly basis.
good,the store i worked at had a very high volume of sales and freight. this was stressful at times. It was very difficult finding good sales associates because of the pay for the position and the amount of work required.
good,"This place was a fun and fast place to work at. I enjoyed seeing regular customers and meeting new customers. I learned to multitask better with this position. Management was really nice. The most enjoyable part of the job, in my opinion, is the rush I would get from how quick paced the job was."
good,"This is a good place to learn the basics of a retail job, and also teaches you a lot about how to take care of the public customer needs, and adapt as needed."
good,"Great benefits - this company pays very well, but you do have to work hard for them. The job is not something you can just sit in an office and do. You have to be involved in the day to day operations."
good,Everyone chooses their own path and the room to advance is great but it will come with sacrifices to your personal life but in the end it’s what you make of it!
good,working the truck is the hardest part of my job but it can be fun learning where the new things go and cleaning up the store meeting new guest and seeing the regulars
good,Great company to work for. Training program is great. You are able to move up in the company easily. Work environment is awesome with the right store team.
good,"A typical day for me was to count my till, be a cashier, stock shelves and recover as well as cleaning. Management was understanding and worked with my hours and days. I love my customers they make my day worth being there."
good,It was always a great pleasure to walk into work greeting with smiles ready to start my day giving great customer service and making sure each one of my customers are happy and satisfied !
good,"Keeping the store stocked, Working the truck when it comes in. Putting out overstock of food and other merchandise. Greeting and talking to customers."
good,"The work is pretty easy you stock, clean, cashier. It's pretty cut and dry what your job is. I enjoyed working with my manager. Some stores need more help than others because the employees and managers don't do their job or don't enforce the jobs to be done. I learned how do a key holder position. The hardest part of the job is going up and down the step ladders and keeping your back storage room clean and organized. The most enjoyable part is meeting the wonderful customers"
good,enjoy working in this industry. had a great time working well with others as a team player. taught me a lot about  being a strong minded person. got along well with customers and employees.
good,"Mostly a good place to work, flexible schedules, good hours,you stay busy,not to hard to learn the job, great co workers,decent pay,advancement opportunities"
good,I enjoyed my job as manager at Dollar General. Im a take charge type of person and liked running the store. I also enjoy meeting new people and working with the public.
good,"Could be fast paced at times but I learned alot while I was there. Hardest part counting money everynight, loved meeting people. Training other cashiers was challenging at times."
good,"A typical day at work would entail setting up displays, stocking shelves, maintaining a clean work area, and check out the customers with a smile. A great day would include a balanced customer flow and maintaining stocked shelves. The hardest part of the job would be the lifting and the most enjoyable part would be to have assisted the customers to their satisfaction and done with a smile."
good,"There is always a lot to do between customers and freight.  It never takes a break.  Once the customers get to know you, they are very friendly.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the freight."
good,"Things are always fast paced at Dollar General but they are still fun and a very family oriented place to work. I enjoy my co-workers, boss, and customers. They make the place fun and amazing to be a part of."
good,"You could have crazy busy days, or you could have slow boring days. You never knew what was going to happen. I especially enjoyed my regulars who showed their appreciation. They made coming to work that much more exciting. The bosses worked with you on scheduling which made it easy to have a life outside of work and to enjoy family time."
good,It's a great job if you like people and get a good manager. I was supposed to be training for management but the district manager was never willing to do the interview.
good,I enjoyed working for dollar general. My only complaint was the constant resets of store layout. If you like costumer experience this is the job for you.
good,"Organizational and customer service skills strengthened, "
good,I've been with the company twice and have had good experiences both times and managers were friendly and helped with the workload and never no stress.
good,Its a job your expected to work like every other job every job has it's ups and down's sometimes people stay a really long time some times they don't.
good,"Stocking shelves and working the cash counter, all kinds of customers which kept it interesting. Would do this again. Manager at the time was awesome, small tight staff"
good,This was my first job I liked it. My favorite part of the job was putting away truck deliveries because it kept me busy. Learned how to run a register cash handling and customer service.
good,It was a quiet and cool place. Kept me busy most of the time. Days where the truck would run it was busy and we had a certain amount to put up. Easy some days.
good,As far as part time employment goes this place is wonderful. They are willing to work around your schedule. There is always room for advancement as advancement and promotion is based off of individual performance not seniority. Your hour count will always be on the low side.
good,"This job can easily begin to slip its way into becoming your main priority, even if you don't want it to. It is still a good experience, though. It pays well, and they work around your schedule when they can."
good,"A day to day, repetitious type of job. You knew what you were going to do everyday. Business plan displayed in break room. Great atmosphere and filled with great employees and management."
good,This Dollar General definitely kept me on my toes. With such a large store and never enough workers the store always had trouble with keeping stock out.
good,Great job as long as your flexible with the days and hours available always new people and things are constantly changing so it keeps it very interesting
good,"My experience at this job was sometimes overwhelming, all co workers where very productive. They all made team work to be able tonfinishnstocking quicker, they were all great people and very friendly very likely like my second family."
good,"Time management, being friendly with the customers, reducing shrink, knowing and following policy, and good teamwork effort is a great way to advance within the company."
good,"mostly ran cashier, took care of customer complaints, make sure every customer left happy and wanted to return to my store. I enjoyed learning all the management part of my job and dealing and getting to know my vendors. hardest part was the sometime customers, no matter how hard you try they were not satisfied favorite thing of my job was seeing all my regular customers and them telling me they love having me at the store"
good,"Depending on the day, you felt great or you felt horrible. Some days go the way you want to like getting everything finished with no interruptions. Then you have the days where you're slammed with things to do and someone tries to steal. Or when the manager is mad because he/she is getting chewed out because the numbers are down."
good,"A typical day at work may include stocking shelves, assisting customers, working the register, and providing customer service. I learned how to be more proactive and how to take iniative without being told to do so. If you go in and show that you wanna work you can advance your career very easily."
good,"Quickly learn how to make a job as simple as possible through Organization, communication, and hard work.  The hardest part about the job was some of the hours I had to put in.  The best part of the job was being self taught through trial and error to run a successful retail establishment.  Could have used more support from DM in the beginning."
good,The management did a good job and the other employees were fun to work with. The only problem  is that no one ever wanted to work their shifts so everyone else had to take the fall.
good,I very much so enjoyed workimg here. The co-workers and management was very friendly and helpful. I would most definitely recommend people to work for this company.
good,I think that dollar general was a good place to work for someone just starting out that needs a job but not for someone that needs a career to make ends meet
good,"A good work place to start for a person just entering the work force. a good place place to build up customer service experience, work ethics, being social with public relations and  good character."
good,"Always stay busy within the store.  However there never seems to be enough time to get everything done since the minimal staffing requires cashiers to both checkout and stock, which depending on the day one or the other will suffer."
good,I loved my job by management made it hard for a lot of people. Supervisors had their picks. If you was not a supervisor's pick then your job was hard. I don't think that people got treated fair. the pay was great. you just did not know from one day to another how you was going to work it was fine with me because I kind of set my own hours because of the job that I had. I felt sorry for the single mothers that was trying to take care of their young kids and keep their job with this company. They did not care about your personal life.
good,Place is a great place to work. Great people to work with also to get to know. It has given me great experience to move up in the company and make friends
good,"Retail is fast paced and ever changing. This position keeps you on your toes. If you love working with people, this is the place to be. The money isn't horrible but for an assistant manager position they should offer better hourly pay and at least 40 hours a week with the opportunity to work overtime."
good,hard part of the job was having to run register and stock at the same time.  being able to see what is new coming to the store and being able to get it first before other customers
good,The manager is awesome but there's a lot of pressure to get things done quickly. Your hours are different every week. Have to have a flexible schedule.
good,I enjoy working here but get so fed up with people calling in on our days off. I fill in a lot for people calling in. Sometimes I work 7 days straight with out a day off. And I'm not afraid of working either. I'm a hard worker.
good,"I honestly enjoyed going to work, I could expect grateful customers (not that its a necessity), my co-workers were fun and sociable people (again not a necessity)."
good,This job could be very stressful at times especially during peak times because most times we were understaffed. As long as you had a good handle on your store then you could manage it to a certain extent.
good,I liked my job as assistant manager. I loved my customers made many friends with them. Looked forward to seeing them on a daily basis. I like working in retail.
good,I recommend anyone thats looking for a quick and easy job apply qt dollar general. I had a nice experience working here. Had nice customer service skills for the customers and everything
good,It depends who your boss is because some are hard to work for others aren't. But the people that come in a great they are very sweet and caring. But you have to be able to be very nice at work.
good,"Working for dollar general has been a fun and learning experience. Not only does it have a very pleasant energy, but you learn a lot about customer service, management and its a place where you can easily move up in if you work hard enough"
good,"Great place to work, great people to work with. I learn where everything goes within the store every day. Easy job, nothing hard about it. Management is great. Most enjoyable part is getting to see the customers smile."
good,I really enjoyed working at DG simply for the people I worked with and the trust and teamwork we displayed. I enjoyed keeping the store organized and clean
good,"loved working at dollar General , i loved doing planograms and putting up  stock.I also loved helping the customer s .They have very good insurance and 401 k .only complaint is they don't give raises very often ."
good,the day is long and with all the hour we put in each week its very tiredsome i work on second shift so not many manger where there at night we have alot of fun at the end of the day before its time to leave
good,"Only problem I had with this job was that the manager wanted to demote me solely so one of he friend could have my job. I was never wrote up, or faced any problems with  work."
good,The managers are kind and the work is easy. And it has good pay if you stick it out. Also the jobs benifits are good too. I recommend this job to anyone looking for a nice paying warehouse job.
good,"I am a very hard working, reliable, always on time, trustworthy person. Great with people, great communication skills. The customers loved me had a very postivite attitude"
good,Management could be better. The hiring process takes a really long time.  There is alack of workers and key holders.  Hours are all over the place. A typical day is just stocking most of the day and then recovering at night.
good,Everyone there is on their A game. You have to be quick and know what stock goes where. You have to be a friendly person. They will teach you everything you need to know there.
good,Just do your job and tasks and everything is fine and easy. Hours could be better but you make them work. Co-workers are nice or at least most of them. Closing at 10 bites.
good,Very social environment with many jobs to be done. Standing in one spot does not happen for very long as stocking items will always keep you busy. Great customer service is a must. Fun environment when you correctly complete your job. Management works with you on everything and are very helpful.
good,Attending work everyday actually was not boring. Different tasks to keep you busy without worrying about a slow work day. Some of the day to day tasks were repetitive but nothing too hard. If you enjoy working with and meeting people from your area with pretty good work hours I suggest working here.
good,Dollar General can be a fun environment but the whole week is scheduled ahead of time and can be stressful to keep on schedule. The co workers and management is the reason I have stayed.
good,I learned how to work at a fast pace and got everything done that was expected of me. Even though the upper level management showed favoritism to other employees. I enjoyed my job and dealing with the customers was the best part.
good,"I was responsible for all money transactions. I cleaned through out my entire shift, I was responsible for great customer service and I always made sure they wanted to come back."
good,"Love the people and the job jus wasn't getting enough hours,it was a good experience for me and the pay was ohk .i worked,the register and I stocked i love the customers"
good,Dollar General gave me a chance to introduce my supervision skills and handle cash and take care of my customers and give the best customer service that I can offer
good,Dollar general is an ok job if youre wanting something part time. Its fast pace. I would recommend a.highschooler for the job. The hours would be perfect for them
good,"I did enjoy working here for the time i did, customers were very nice! although I wish you could atlest get one weekend day off  they worked with you if you needed a day off"
good,"Great place to work, with a lot of opportunity for advancement. Great staff and an excellent store manager. Very fast paced working environment. Hardest part of the job is also the most rewarding helping the customers have the best experience they can."
good,"-Easy work for good pay"
good,This is a very busy store. The staff are friendly and helpful. The customers are often repeat customers and dedicated to this store. I very much enjoyed working with these customers and staff that was there.
good,What I learned from Dollar General was how to organize the shelves in a fashionable and timely manner. Also I learned how to find and unpack the items received from trucks and locate the designated shelf in a fast time.
good,"It was a grate place to work for a first time job. "
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar General. The people (both employees and customers) were almost always friendly and polite.
good,This was one of the best jobs that I could have worked while I was in school. The most enjoyable part of this job is that I was allowed to work only mornings so that I could attend school at night.
good,"Good benefits, good upper management. Work's with your schedule if needed. Good base pay. Excellent insurance. They have good customer service skills. Prices are excellent."
good,Very nice employees and helpful managers. Will work around your schedule to help you. Dollar general is a clean environment and I enjoy working with the public everyday.
good,"clock in clean front of store, front face products, maintain register."
good,Dollar General was a very people family oriental place that I enjoyed working for. Very organized and everything was up to date. Dollar General staff and the manager were very up beat. Very prasiced with everything.
good,Not much done to compesnsate for customers. As a supervisor I make twenty-five cents over minimum wage after two years of service.
good,I learned how to handle customers who would make things slightly difficult during the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my fellow co-workers who had different personalities that was great. A typical day at work would be to greet customers as they coming to the store and help them find what they were looking for after I would help process their purchases.
good,very good managers and customers where allways great. the managment allways helped out if you needed it . Worked with me when i took care of my daughter and had to go home.
good,Well during the time of me working at dollar general was very enjoyable. I love to greet and put a smile on customers faces. With an outstanding Management it made it easier for me to take out the time to help out
good,plenty of advancement opportunities. management is great. coworker are nice and drama free. the customers you meet are mostly nice and i enjoy serving them.
good,i loved this job but it depends on if you have kids and what possition you hold. if you are just an employee its not bad if you are in managment and have children it can be hard
good,"typical day includes stocking shelves with merchindise "
good,Its a great place to get your foot in the door and help with work experiences of simple entry level tasks. Many opportunities and friends to make all while learning about the business and its goal.
good,"just like any other retail place, was great but pay was low, Since Dollar Tree took out Family Dollar they pay alot more now for same work."
good,I really liked my job. It kept you moving. Lot of oppertunity for advancement because high turnover. Always something to do
good,I've been there since graduating high school and for my store everyone is like a big family. The coworkers are nice willing to help you with anything.
good,"Good company,  fast pace environment great customers . Store manager is a great person. Awesome employees fun environent. Busy and slow time, alway things to do never a dull moment."
good,Preformed opening and closing procedures. Handled deposits. Set and met monthly goals. Worked great with co-workers. Loved meeting new people and doing daily reports.
good,"Only had a problem with a manager, other than that everyone else I worked with were great people and the job wasn't that bad either."
good,Working at Dollar General I learned valuable retail skills and insight into my community. My typical workday involved stocking various sections of the store with the occasional assistance to the cashiers as well as days where I cashiered and assisted customers. My management and coworkers were all wonderful people I was able to become very good friends with and learn a lot from. The hardest part of the job had to have been dealing with unruly customers but it was still a rewarding experience to properly handle tense situations and help prevent theft. The most enjoyable part of my job must have been my work environment and my coworkers; I wouldn't have traded either.
good,"I loved working for Dollar General Distribution Center. This was one of my greatest jobs ever. Sometimes a spoiled apple in a bunch can ruin the taste of them all. At one point, I loved my job but then a particular Supervisor ruined my entire experience. I would still be there if it wasn't for that person."
good,"long hours great pay fun people management has problems but all in all a great experience/"
good,"Dollar General is a great company to work with. Energetic crowd, generally speaking, with an ambition serve their customers."
good,A typical day at work would be stocking the store because with so many customers the shelves stayed empty. Checking out customers. Having to been well trained and speedy because of the fast paced of the store on a daily basis.
good,"It was good while I was able to be there. The staff and crew I work with was fun and ready to assist with any help I may need,I only wish I could Have stayed longer"
good,"My typical day at work usually is me clocking in and getting the things that I need to work on like stocking food, finishing the totes that we have piled up behind the counter and getting everything done before the night crew goes home for the night."
good,"Loved almost every aspect of the job. "
good,"I loved working for Dollar General, however there was people steeling at my location, including the managers. I had recently left a bad marriage with three kids, and I was not going to get caught up in there wrong doings just because I worked there. I advised the store district manager, and I put in my notice. I was not working under dishonest people. I loved my job, however it was okay pay and I was making ends meet. I just wish it did not end the way it did for me."
good,"I like DG, it's taught me a lot. My favorite part about working at Dollar General would have to be doing the trucks at four o’ clock in the morning. I say that because I know what product is coming into my store. I was able to organize my store that way, and it allowed me to get out of the store at a decent time and enjoy the rest of my day.The work environment at Dollar General was actually very quiet. That’s the best way I could describe it because there was usually only a manager and an associate there. So there was enough going on, you were stocking something, somebody was working the register, or you were cleaning something and somebody was working the register. So, believe it or not, you almost felt like an independent worker at Dollar General."
good,"Working here was fun. There is a lot of interaction with the customers. A typical day at work involves stocking, unloading trucks, recovering, cashiering, and cleaning. This job was very enjoyable, and the staff was amazing."
good,"This position has taught me how to be responsible, caring and patient. I worked my way up to assistant manager and loved the people I worked with."
good,"I loved the regular customers they always made me laugh.. the projects were really enjoyable even when hard.."
good,The job is what you make of it...the hard work pays off.  Should always go in with a positive attitude. Staff is pretty good when solving problems within the company.
good,"I think Dollar General is good company overall despite a few odd things here and there (basket size three strike rule). When employed, I started on registers, then my store manager offered a stocking position, and from there i was offered opportunities to do SMART team work and store builds. I was eventually promoted to a key-holder position, almost against my will. That is where things got odd with management. The district manager didn't want me opening or closing stores, and I was wanting out of the SMART team, and unfortunately, we never came to a compromise. I got along with everyone i worked with forged some friendships out of it. Honestly, it was the best job I ever had."
good,After being here over a year this job has made me aware of how productive I can be in the workplace.  The experience of being here at this job is never ending especially with all the customer satisfaction.  I was able to accomplish so many undone tasks and learn so many policies and regulations of the workplace thus share it with others.  I have received working here. The managers are the best and are very communicative when it comes to assignments that need to be done. I love it here!  Dollar General is highly recommended for those looking for a minimum wage place of employment. The money may not be much but the experiences are worth it.
good,I learned to communicate with others better and I've also learned that I could get along with others very well and also how to deal with issues with other people.
good,"I loved my co-workers, They were caring and helped out when needed, Manger I did not really care for she never worked with us, did he own thing, she would put everything onto us. I enjoyed helping others with what they needed."
good,you would clock in and receive customers on the registrar and attended to them. it was very calm place to work at. I enjoyed the manager at the time I worked here it was very fun.
good,"I worked down of of Warwick Blvd. And I really liked it. I moved from Newport News, VA to VA. Beach, VA and unfortunately my sister was also management so I has to loose out on working for Dollar General. Family at that time couldn't be in the same district as management. I loved it though. Haven't been back unfortunately because I was a navy wife and traveling last 14 years."
good,The Dollar General Store needs to get a better balance on the staffing issues in their stores.  The turn-over rate is very high because this is very demanding job.
good,"Not that hard of a day until the rush hours. I learned how to truly be a part of a team and how to dissolve conflict. Management was great, always supportive."
good,"Working at Dollar General is easy, flowing, and constant. As a cashier, I have to maintain my presence on the sales floor, assist customers in any needs, and operate a cash register. Other priorities such as recovering product to the front of shelves, restocking shelved from plastic shipping totes, ""U-boats"", or small boxes, and pricing items depend on a variety of factors. I learned how to operate a register, maintain a helpful personality, maintain my stress level and emotions in problematic or hectic situations, how to greet customers politely, and maintain a plan throughout the day when given tasks such as restocking or recovery. "
good,"- The work days can be very long, but the amount of people you interact with throughout the day help you dramatically better understand not only yourself, but the community as a whole. "
good,it was a good opportunity to learn many skills learned how to return take invoices along with some other useful skills and oprotuites
good,"A typical workday was fast paced, fun & exciting."
good,"I have only worked for Dollar General for a few weeks.  I think if I were to go on full time, I would rapidly advance.  Seems to be a good company so far."
good,"I was hired as a part time sales lead and within seven months I was the assistant store manager. There is a VERY high turnover rate, particularly with management. I had three store managers in the year I was there. This is NOT a retail position for someone who wants to make a few easy bucks standing at a register all day. Payroll is very limited weekly and thus hours will be given to the employees who prove their worth. Multitasking is a requirement, and oftentimes you will get more hours than originally negotiated. I had probably three months of working 50+ hours weekly while understaffed and I had all of my part timers at about 30. Over all, fun, dynamic place to work for those who are willing to put in the effort."
good,Recently had management changes due to someone walking out. So asst. managers have had to make up the hours and try to keep things running the best we could. They are real slow at hiring new people. I don't know if maybe the way the DG site is set up or what but it takes months to get hired. I feel that people don't get properly trained.
good,"•	Monitor the dormitory and fitness center "
good,ok company to work for same as alot of other companies long hours low salary compensation for the hours worked. would recommend this company
good,"It was a great experience, but shipping and receiving was a lot of work, especially when the store isn't fully staffed. The managers and team were nice and great people, but did hire lazy people at times."
good,I was one of the first employees with this company and enjoyed helping to start this company. Thought the pay could have been a little bit higher but there was always opportunities to move up in the company.
good,I have very pleasant coworkers.  There is a lack of help.  Some heavy pushing involved which is too much for me sometimes.  There is a lot of rushing around trying to get the truck completed.
good,"I was a cashier daily there, not a bad place to work. Although, it is in a bad area. You have to look over your shoulder in the area, although there are very nice people who live and work in the neighborhood."
good,"Always learning something new."
good,"Enjoyed being part of the management team as well as being a part of my stores team. learned how to merchandise according to schematics. Learned how to prioritize my days."
good,"The job created a great deal of independence.  I was able to leverage my skills and creativity to implement programs that I knew would be effective in reducing shrink.  "
good,"While I do Love working at my Dollar General Store. The frequent Schedule changes, sometimes without notice tend to make things a little hard on people."
good,Fun place with supportive management. Decent hours for all. Lots of heavy lifting. Lots of customer service. The biggest thing I gained was strength and people skills.
good,The days went by quickly due to always having a lot to accomplish which I liked. I don't feel that it should be mandatory for store managers to work 6 days a week
good,Great employees and excellent customers.  Plenty of room for growth and development as long as you have the ambition to excel.
good,"During my time at Dollar General, I had a wonderful time as a manager. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I loved serving customers and being a leader for my employees. My co-workers were fantastic. They would always listen to me and we got along great. A typical day of work would consist of receiving deliveries from a vendor, restocking shelves, and accommodating customers  to the best of my ability. The most difficult part of the job would be that we were understaffed a lot. I had no control over the scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job would be making sure the customers got the best service I could offer them."
good,"Good place to work, especially if want upward mobility, needs to have a better work/life balance. Found the job rewarding and my hard work recognized as a District Manager."
good,"Providing exceptional Customer Service, stock & ordering, set up of displays throughout the store, hiring & scheduling of current employees, set up trainings for employees through HR, payroll, open and close of the store"
good,"I spend time each day working at the cash register, processing and collecting money from purchases made.  Sometimes I have to explain policy when it comes to submitting identification for cigarette and certain movies.    When I am the manager of the day, then I get to come to the front to explain said procedures.  Sometimes I get to go to the bank to get change or make deposits.  The hardest part of my job, is to make sure that I am treating each employee fairly and consistently.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to talk with each customer as if they were a part of my family.  I get to hear their stories and they get to hear mine.  I love this part of my job."
good,You walk into a demanding store with managers that expect nothing short of the standard. You come to work and not become friends.
good,"Dollar General is a good place to work, although the starting rate left a bit to be desired. I enjoyed working there, but it was the pay that ultimately affected my decision to leave."
good,"My job was to greet customers, tell them about the sales, assist customers with products and service. Set up sales products and services to customers.  Set promotional displays for seasonal holidays.  Handle returns for merchandise and product knowledge to customers.  Cashier and end of day door counting and balancing.  Excellent co-workers at the location i worked and the customers where very friendly.   We all worked as a team and all task where competed on time.  The store was clean and everyone got alone very well. The work was demanding, however it builds character and a great work ethics.  Hats off to you all!"
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General because I came in contact with new people on a daily basis.  I also enjoyed the load I carried as assistant manager.
good,"Working with the public is challenging, but I find it very rewarding when I can take a persons frown and turn it upside down into a smile.We have to realize that everyone has needs and to be able to understand and help all we can, that's all it takes to brighten someones day."
good,I loved working for them.  I just wish when I moved back to Florida that I could have transferred.  They just didn't seem to care about keeping someone that was working for them for 5 to 6 years for them.
good,It was great learning how to manage the store by running the cash registering and also while stocking everything in store at the same time it really teaches you how to manage your time the correct way
good,"I have nothing bad to say about Dollar General, they gave me my first job after college and I learned alot from this company."
good,If your good at dealing with customers then this is a good job. I learned how to run a cash register. the management at the store are really good at their job. the hardest part of the job is standing all day.
good,"Depending on my shift(am/pm), an am shift would require you to be there by 7:45am to have the store ready to open at 8. in those 15 minutes you would recover the store lighlty and prepare your work area, which taught me to be very quick on my feet and to do quality work in a timely fashion.pm shift; you would clock in at 3:30pm, and count your register drawer for the day, then you would briefly speak to your coworkers and find out what they were working on so you can continue where they left off.The management seemed to have ran smoothly, we would all communicate and develop a flow. I had all around good, hardworking co-workers that have become friends. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the whole store while attending customer at the front, and getting an assigned job to work on. I enjoyed getting off of work and feeling accomplished and confident that the next day would run as smooth as possible due to a job well done the day before!"
good,My employment was enjoyable with this company right up to the time they let me go for an honest mistake. I had the unfortunate opportunity of being let go for being honest.
good,"Getting some great discount store sales & customer service experience. As well as opening/closing the store, stocking on day to day basis, while learning the protocols of a 3rd key shift manager. Other co-workers were willing to keep me informed on things I needed to learn. The hardest part of the job was keeping the store products well organized along with keeping lost prevention under control."
good,"The hardest part about this job was dealing with the occasional abusive customer, but that's with any customer service job. The best part about this job is actually making a customer smile (which is difficult to accomplish when you're obviously a liberal-looking person in a conservative area like Bel Air)."
good,"Working at Dollar General is a exciting, fun, and very productive. Since I've worked for this company I've learned that having a positive attitude and good customer service skills makes you and the customers have a great day. Also working with friendly coworkers helps the day go by nice and smooth. The hardest part of this job is dealing with rude customers. But all you have to do is be yourself and stay in character. So the most enjoyable part is helping customers and making sure shopping is easier for everybody."
good,"Working at dollar general was a nice job I enjoyed it.  Manager worked with my schedule .  Being that I was a key holder I would open and close the store, work store resets and end caps, stock truck, take down and put up sale signs, & make sure cashier was on task and customers were satisfied.  It might seem hard but it was an easy job.  I enjoyed it."
good,"Typically, I would be expected to stock shelves with freight and assist customers in the store. Being my first job, I learned a lot about stocking and operating the cash register. In addition, I gained skills in how to deal with customers in an appropriate manner. I always set a goal for myself at work and hope to exceed my employer's expectations. From my first to last day at work, I kept a friendly and professional relationship with all of my co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was picking up slack of other workers. I would always do my best at encouraging the others to keep working hard and as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the work done and dealing with customers. You knew it was a good day when there were no customer complaints and all of the stock made it to the shelves."
good,"enjoyable, fast excelling work place."
good,i loved working with  the customers the bosses was not always so nice to work for. co-workers were great i loved working with them we got along very well.
good,You have to be hard working and organized to be successful. What you put in you got out. Yes its hard work sometimes but it pays off in the end.
good,"Fast paced, welcoming environment. Loved the team I worked with. Loves my customers also. I always worked hard to make my store look presentable to my customers."
good,"A typical day of work is running the register for a few hours until you have another person that comes in to help. You take your lunch, then recover the store to make it look nice and presentable for customer shopping experience, then you go home."
good,"Hard, honest work but very redundant. People are cool to work with. You have good days off. Overtime is always available."
good,"I open the store, get the paperwork done, check on the start program to see what is expected of us that day. Make sure recovery is in place. Continue to greet customers with a smile and friendly attitude. The hardest part of my job is not having enough time to make things perfect. I guess you could say I'm a perfectionist. The most enjoyable thing about my job is being in the public. I'm a people person and love making them smile."
good,This job kept me busy. I liked that about it. I learned how to deal with all kinds of people. The management and co-workers were all pleasant to work with. Co-workers were ready to help in any way possible. I didn't find this job hard for me. The only thing that happened from time to time is that it could be a bit stressful.
good,"i enjoyed working here. the staff wasn't all that great, it was always busy but what story is not. the hardest part was trying to run the cash-register but the manger also wanted you to stock shelves in the store."
good,There are opportunities for advancement.  Hour are flexible to work around other schedules. Have to be able to work in a fast pace environment.
good,"upper management changed this to suit them"

good,I learned how to work in a fast paste environment and manage multiple employees at a time. In this job you can and will advance very quickly with desire
good,"Work isn't very hard, rush times can be difficult and many evenings were spent working but that is too be expected in a retail position. I feel like their compensation is low for my location, because we do the second best nationally in sales per year but most of my fellow associates and myself only made minimum wage."
good,"I enjoy the job, flexible hours and co-workers are always willing to train. I learned how to close the store on occasion. The hardest part of the job was the amount of inventory that needed to be stocked. We had a great team that was consistent in getting the mission accomplished."
good,"i learned how to stock merchandise."
good,"A typical day at work consists of stocking shelfs for up to 2 hours, handling customer needs, and cleaning/facing store. I handle customer mishaps with patience and understanding. The managment in Dollar General is very professional, the managers handle problems extremely well, and the customers leave satisfied. My co-workers are great team players as well as myself. If a situation came about, we work togther to find the best possible solution. The hardest part of the job would have to be when a ""Couponer"", a customer that uses for the most part coupons to their advantage. Couponers will use their coupons, sometimes not fully understanding the limit of benefits of their coupon. The most enjoyable part of my job is having customers leave satisfied and returning to shop."
good,Checking customers out and stocking shelves.  I learned how to operate a cash register.  My co-workers and I got along well.  The hardest part about my job was trying to stock shelves and have a customer waiting to be checked out.
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General. The manager and other employees were great. The wonderful customers were awesome as well.
good,"I loved working at dollar general, my co workers were great. we all worked as a team. i enjoyed meeting new people, and developing relationships with some of the frequent customer. Its not a hard job, everything can be caught on to easily."
good,"I only worked there for three months before starting school, but it was a good start, and it prepared to work future jobs. I was never given a company manual, but the job was easy enough to learn from experience. The hours were flexible, but my schedule was sporadic. If you need a job and are willing to work for minimum wage, it's definitely the job for you."
good,"A typical started off verifying night deposit and petty cash funds, safety walk of store, reviewing camera for previous transactions and any issue that needed to be reviewed, document daily assignment for scheduled staff, provide excellent customer services to all customers, greet all customers that enter the store and follow-up to check statuses of assigned task. And address any issues or concerns that arise throughout the day,,,"
good,"Went in checked if the coolers were filled put away all returns. Check customers out. keep clean. My co workers were fun to work with, we all helped each other out with our assigned things."
good,I have learned that people will do anything to get things for free.  A fairly easy job with basic duties. Very easy to get a hang of the job and to find a rhythm for the day-to-day chores. Schedules are done weekly and with little notice.
good,"assist customers ive learned how to log orders in using handheld,how read and set planagrams,end caps,godola etc,First thing i do is clock-in,then run to the bank and get change for registor,then check numbers from night before to make sure inventory and the money is accounted for."
good,I assisted all customers in my work experience. I learned how to stay positive and work at a very fast pace. My management team members taught me how to assist customers and solve their problems. My co-workers were very nice and productive. I haven't found a job that is hard for me just yet. I love challenges.I enjoyed helping other people and being apart of a team.
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to get management experience although having a more time conscious team would have helped a lot.
good,Best time was with customers and Worst time was angry customers.
good,I had no troubles working here. My job was fun and the people I worked around were great. My only complaint is the salary.
good,Dollar General provides customers with a great customer service experience. I learned how to interact with customers and maintain a clean and orderly work enviroment.
good,"maintain cashier , greeting people , management skills"
good,"I cleaned high end homes. I would walk, feed, or bathe their pet if needed.  Do laundry, clean stove, refridgerator.  I would deep clean the houses on a weekly basis.  The hardest part of the job was the time restraint.  I had to get all my cleaning done before the owners came home, even if they came home early.  I enjoyed doing a good job for my clients, and feeling like I did the best I could."
good,A very busy place to work...Always something to do. Mngmt is great and very willing to work around your schedule.  I have been there a over a year and have enjoyed my job still to this day!
good,I love the store I was at! I was recently transferred OUT of my store and my DM doesn't know where he's putting me yet.
good,"The work environment can be rough. It depends on the staff you work with."
good,Working at Metro is fun. Work is flexible with inside and outside work each day. Flexible schedules and great district manager in Dallas. Good pay and work independently with little supervision.
good,"you must love being in a fast paced environment and have a knack for working with people. You will deals with all different types of customers, some days will be great other days no so much, You have an opportunity to advance and grow with the company if you try hard enough. The management is, most of the time, great, Recent pressure of added duties on the store have sent expectation sky high. Every store manager runs their store differently so be prepared if you have worked for this company before, it has changed! As a cashier you will do just about everything from running the register, cleaning, stocking, setting up store fixtures and displays. We now sell tobacco as well as alcohol so must be comfortable checking everyones I.D's. The hardest part of the job will have to be being on the losing shift and getting all set tasks done before end shift. Not only are you usually the only one on the register but you are expected to do a variety of other tasks before the end of your shift."
good,"I was the manager of a store, so typical day was opening the store, counting tills, counting deposits, you poll your computer to find out what is supposed to be done in that particular day. Check in vendors, do refunds, receive the truck., order merchandise, do plan o grams, etc."
good,the environment was enjoyable and very friendly. I would of stayed but couldn't afford to stay
good,lack of pay for the management position was the reason for leaving
good,"I would stock shelves, receive truck delivery, help the cashier, get deposit ready, balance drawers"
good,"Working as a cashier was never boring, stayed busy interacting with customers daily."
good,"Days were predictable depending on warehouse machinery was functioning properly. Management lacked great communication. Co-workers at times were easy going, some liked to horseplay but over all tolerable. Hardest part of the job was trying to adjust to different plans every single day and the new production systems that they were constantly trying to fix each day. Most enjoyable part of the job was a guaranteed check every week and knowing what to expect everyday with out any problems."
good,"a typical day at work is running the cash register and straightening the store aswell as putting up merchandise, the management is quiet good coworkers are good nice to work with the hardest part of the job is dealing with disgruntled customers the most enjoyable part is that the coworkers are pretty easy going and we can joke and have some fun during our shift"
good,go in set up  the register turn lights on opened the doors ran register stock shelves unloaded  the truck  did everything .most of my coworker were good .Is working  all the time
good,"Overseeing of daily store openings and closing, funding cash register drawers, authorizng voids, exchanges and refunds, submitting bank deposits, scheduling of employees, and calculating payroll. Additional roles include playing a key roll in the opening of new reorganizing of existing stores. Major emphasis is on customer satisfaction and customer service."
good,I got along with my coworkers and i loved the experienced working with others and learning new things.
good,"Your day was spend keeping the store neat, organized and stocked.  Along with checking out customers, and helping them find what they needed.  Learn to set plan o grams, for monthly specials.  Was promoted to lead sales associate and learning to open and close the store, check in the truck, and vendors."
good,"Dollar General was a great stepping stone in my retail career, I learned how to manage employees, along with many other responsibilities that came along with my position."
good,"I very much enjoyed working at Dollar General. A typical day at work consisted of high volume clientel. If you are not a ""people"" person I do not recommend working here. It is very fast paced. I learned a great deal of patience. I absolutely loved all of the customers."
good,"productive, full-time"
good,"New challenges every day, but at the same time I dealt with some regular customers on a weekly basis. A friendly, family environment. I learned more about the retail industry in my one year with this company than during 5 years of other retail employment."
good,wasnt enough of work/life balance for me with children at home
good,"I check computer for updates.  I make sure we have enough money for the day.  The job teaches you good stocking skills.  It is a demanding job.  You have to be able to work with customers while getting your other duties done.  The other duties include stocking shelves, setting displays, checking in vendors, and sometimes cashiering."
good,"i was always excited to go to work because it was my first full-time job ,i learned so much working there , being independent and proactive . the management was great they always made things easier for me . my co-workers were very friendly they made me feel so welcomed. id say the hardest part of the job was doing checkout assistance on a busy day most people would get frustrated . the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people with what they need and at the end of the day i got to talk and laugh with my co-workers."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General was getting all the truck put out and keeping the customers satisfied as much as possible. What I learned from Dollar General was to multi-purpose through out the day and still stay productive at the same time. The management was ok, but she did not really want to put in the time for the store. She had the habit of giving the rest of the managers to make up for the rest of the duties she did not accomplish. My co-workers was fun and very enjoyable to work with most of the time. I would have to say the hardest part was to keep the stock put out in time, so the truck loads would not over in the store. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the customers that I got to meet."
good,"A typical day is usually laid back, with a steady flow of customers but not so many that you are unable to complete other required tasks. I learned how to seamlessly work with customers and still do stocking and cleaning without neglecting either. The managers work just as hard as the on the floor salespeople, the hardest part of the job would be the variety of tasks that need to be completed in any given work day but its not a bad thing because although there are many things to get done nothing is too hard which allows you to enjoy each task as the day progresses."
good,The Cashier will finalize the process of merchandise purchase of the customer. She receives the payment that the customer is due and in turn she should give the change that is due to the customer. The cashier must at all times show courtesy while doing the customers transaction with the store no matter how crowded the store could get. She must also account for the money in the register making sure of its accuracy.
good,"I've worked for the company for 2+ years. Within the time frame, my store alone was robbed 12 or more times. No one from the corporate office has done anything about it outside of providing us with a number to call and expecting us to return to work the following day. Other than the frequent robberies; the job is fast-paced and friendly. If it is your first job, you'll learn a lot! The hardest part of this job is following the contradictive tasks. The easiest part is dealing with customers."
good,Good raises and benefits with reliable income in the long term. Work is harder than average.
good,"I was such a kid when I first started in the workforce but I'm glad I had the chance to start it with Dollar General. It was such an experience for me to learn. Dealing with good and bad, ups and downs, twists and turns, I found out a taste of what the retail world was like. And it turns out that I enjoyed it more than I thought because experiences from there have stuck with me in and out."
good,"responsible for overall store operations"
good,"Dollar General managers tend to be caring individuals who will work with you on scheduling and such, but corporate doesn't appear to care about the employees at all."
good,I really enjoyed and had fun helping and greeting customers throughout the day at work.
good,"The typical day at work is a very Productive and enjoyable, Love the customers, What I learned is check in vendors, How to work with other People, The Best Management, Loved My co-workers, Nothing is never to hard for me,enjoyable part is the Customers."
good,"I learned that a job title comes with multiple duties so it qualifies you for multiple jobs. Even though you're courteous to employees and customers, doesn't mean they're nice to you. But you still keep a positive attitude."
good,"I enjoyed the face to face interaction with customers, yet a lot of times it was slow."
good,"A typical day at work would include taking care of customer issues, checking in vendors and unloading our freight. The best part of the job would be helping our elderly customers, they are genuinely appreciative and usually have a great story to tell. All in all it's a great place to work, the pay is good and I have insurance. The downside is all of the heavy lifting involved, it really takes a toll on my body."
good,Company policies where excellent. Some benefits. Easy growth.
good,"Typical day at work includes opening the register, greeting the customers and stocking and cleaning the store. The management is friendly and willing to work with you on things. My co-workers are the best we became quick friends and all work hard together to get things done.  The hardest part of the job is getting the things your are required to do done when the store is busy, but we always get as much done as we can.  The most enjoyable part is the customers you get to know so many of them as they become regulars and they get to know you."
good,"A typical day would be greeting customers, rotating stock, the unloading of merchandise from the truck or back stock room onto the floor, handling money, and working on new planograms."
good,"a typical day at work is usually about four to seven hours including 15min to one hour breaks. The pay is not too bad, and they have more benefits then most minimum wage jobs. The employees are very helpful and nice. The general work is basic and easy. I don't mind being part of that."
good,I did very well working for this company. I became one of the youngest managers the company ever had. After working there for a short time I was quickly promoted. My co-workers for the most part were amazing. The General Manager was really nice and helped me learn the skills I needed to become a great manager. 
good,"We start our day at 6am and stock until 12pm, at that time we have a short impromptu meeting outlining our tasks and goals for the day, from then until 5pm all employees complete said tasks. Promptly at 5pm we begin to tidy up and clean the store for business the next day. I have learned that in retail and in most businesses that everyone must work as a team to reach a common goal. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable, the daily tasks and challenges of the job."
good,"I enjoy working with the public. A day at work would be,waiting on customers,putting stock out,making sure items are where they are supposed to be,working as a team player,dealing with money. I enjoy working with my co-workers,they help me when i can't find where our products go.not being able to help the customers like i would like."
good,"Work day"
good,This place requires a 6 day work week of all store Managers and DMs. To be great you work an average of 55-70 hours a week due to low budgets for payroll.
good,"A typical day at work consists of 5 star customer service, all day everyday. It's a great atmosphere to work in, the customers are always pleasant and the employees are excellent to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing the customers by their first name, remembering what they usually shop for and helping them find anything that they can't on their own. "
good,"A typical day is to get ready for customer service and finding challenging ways to accomplish tasks that the company may ask of us to do."
good,"each day I opened the store. On some days there was not anyone there except me until 9:00.  After that time I worked on the paper work, planograms, put up stock. reset shelves, did bank deposit.  For the most part I got along well with all of my co-workers.  the hardest part of the job was making sure that the store was zoned and recovered every day as it should have been since most of the time there was only enough payroll to allow for two people to be at work for the night shift.  Because of the amount of payroll there was never more than three people at work at the same time any day except on truck day and the day after . the most enjoyable part of my day was my regular customers and employees"
good,"- Get to work and have a meeting"
good,"enjoyed the people i worked with,but management didnt care for theyre employees."
good,A typical day a Dollar General included either running a register or stocking freight. The work environment was extremely slack but my manager was awesome.  
good,I had a great time working for dollar general the co-workers that I was working with we're friendly and I loved it.
good,"You are always moving by stocking shelves and making sure the store looked great. I learned that customers are always right that if you argue with them then they complain about you to your manager. The management was alright, worked with your schedule. My co-workers were great. Hardest part would be the travel that they wanted me to do then they cut my hours. The enjoyable part would also have to be the traveling for the miles I would get paid for."
good,"Its a good job to start off your career in business, and very easy to move up the ladder."
good,Good experience. Store Managers really good I think. Training is ok depending on who is training you. Helpful sales associates.
good,I would open and close the store on a daily bases . Taken care of the customers and my employee.
good,"A typical day was come in, stock the shelves, and assist customers."
good,"Recruiting/hiring/training/evaluations/schedules/payroll, inventory control/ordering, bookkeeping/banking, marketing, vendors, more."
good,low pay biggest problem
good,"Management and coworkers fun to work with. Very professional. Fast paced job. Hard work but, if you did your job well the day went by quickly."
good,"Through this job I was able to learn opening and closing procedures, payroll filing and finalization, and improve my customer service skills. As well as learning what it's like to be a part of a hard-working team and managing that team to success, success meaning increased profits and a lower shrink rate each and every year progressively."
good,The typical day at work was fast and productive. i learned how to move faster each day
good,the management was worst part while working there. being the underpaid manager and the higher manager recieving credit for what you did was a huge issue while working there.
good,Enjoy going to work
good,"I enjoyed Dollar General, just was too much for my personal life; working 60-70 hours a week on salary"
good,"I typically stocked merchandise that was empty for the week, or unloaded and worked the truck that we had once a week. I could do 10 rolltainers in one shift. I also worked the cash register, and cleaned and mopped the floors on a daily basis. I enjoyed my co workers, the customer interaction, the hard work I performed and oppurtunity to advance. I just didn't hit it off with the managers. Not that I had a bad relationship with them, but that they had their favorites of who they wanted to advance, and I feel I had worked hard enough and did everything that they asked me to do to advance."
good,We work hard to bring a great customer service. We bring customers and products together. We make customers feel happy to shop with us. I enjoy helping customers find their product.
good,"Management was great, same work everyday. Minimum wage job. can get boring if not busy"
good,I loved this company. Great management support for managers and staff. I would have never left this company if my family medical needs hadn't needed me more.
good,Day to Day operations and requirements arent a deal breaker working with the continued district shifting and all district managers operate independently of the the company ideas unless corrected. But most wont stand behind their instructions.
good,It was a good place to work. Room for advancement. Friendly enviorment
good,"This was my first job so I learned alot about products, the register, stocking, customers and what it feels like to make your own money. I greatly enjoyed working with my fellow employees and management. Everyone was helpful and we were all very close like a family."
good,"The particular store that I was employed at was good. They did need a lot of help though, but one of the major problems was that the whole disrtrict has a lot of issues"
good,The associates that I worked with was hard working. I loved the job and I felt I did my 100% everyday I worked. I started out stocking and managed to advance to assistant manager.
good,"check in all vender,store recovery, reviving truck, stocking shelves,planogram."
good,Fun place to work with plenty of opportunities for advancement
good,"A typical day at Dollar General was filled with many activiates, from waiting on customers to setting planagrams to stocking. I enjoyed getting to know some of our regular customers and doing the planagrams. I came to Dollar General with alot of knowledge so was able to do the job without much additional learning. You can advance in the company if you want to work hard and put in alot of hours, I learn alot about the company I just chose to work parttime. Putting out alot of heavy products was the hardest part of the job and mopping a large store with only a cotton mop put alot of extra stress on your body that wasn't necessary. I feel if they would have provided a better way of handling stock and mopping floors I would still be there."
good,A typical day is easy and filled with surprises. Learned a number of things. Management was alright. Fun co-workers. Hardest part of the job is when store manager has one or two people to run truck.
good,Meeting new people.. Always something to do.. Moving up is not easy to do...
good,This was a lot of responsibility at the age I was. I was considered a manager and had a hard time making the other workers listen to me. I enjoyed it mostly but it was stressful.
good,wonderful place to work however if hyou are in management plan to give up much of a home life.
good,"i am amazed at the volume of work and integrity this corporation houses. With the ultimate goal of 20,000 stores - DG has more company-owned stores than any other retailer in the country. Being beind the scenes of DG has reiterated a sense of pride, self-discipline, and strong work ethic."
good,I would open the store for the day and get the deposit ready for bank. most times only one in store until 9 or 10 am. would receive truck weekly and unload with a small staff one morning a week. Always reading the reports of profit and loss seeing how to improve and do weekly scheduling. I had a great management staff that worked together as a team. The hardest part of this job was getting the merchandise to the shelf's for the customer. I loved the small staff and the one on one time with the customer.
good,"A typical day at work for me would consist of runnin the register and helping custmers with questions and concerns. I meet new people everyday. My team of managers are excellent, as well as my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be meeting new people."
good,i put labels on boxes coming down conveyor and stacked them on pallets
good,"very buisy, always something to do. Hardest part of job, not anough quality of life. managers work 60 + hrs week, company tight on hours."
good,"Each day was different in some way shape form of fashion. For example, there good days where I faced no challenges, as well as days where there was one challenge after another. I looked forward to facing each new day."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General started by closing the previous manager on duty register by balancing the cash drawer, counting the checks to make sure they add up to what is in the system and dropping the access in the safe. Then I would open the manager's drawer under my name. I would talk with the previous manager on duty to go over particular task that need to get done that day in addition to the everyday duties. I would check and record the temperature for the coolers. Override voids, and promptly assist any customer with problems, questions or concerns. I stocked product accurately on the sales floor and kept the stockroom organized and made sure new product was put out on the sales floor daily and rotated by date efficiently. I movtivated and guided employees on their daily task to effectively manage the store and projects."
good,"Was a fun place to work, needed better district managment. I love retail and managing. My girls love me and would work with me anywhere i go."
good,"Caught on quickly, good trainer, Learned how to use handheld computers for vending intake, All the vendors were nice and respectful, Learned marketing and advertisement techniques, After transferring to Clarksville, the stores there welcomed me, worked as a team to get the job done ."
good,"Dollar general in Charleston is one of the best jobs i have had. I like my boss and the crew i work with. We are all flexible with our scheduling and are easy to get along with, so that makes the work day let alone the work week go by fast and easily. Overall Dollar General in Charleston is a great place."
good,Dollar General is a great place to work if you are young and looking for a job. I worked there my first three years of college because of the flexible work hours and constant weekly pay. There is always room to grow if you dedicate enough time and effort with Dollar General.
good,"Working for Dollar General taught me the importance of loyalty, dedication, and work ethic. I enjoyed the company and I am very appreciative for the information I learned over my four year career."
good,"While working at Dollar General, I was introduced to new skills that I did not have previously. My manager listened to my questions and suggestions and took them all into consideration."
good,dollar general is a very warm environment. when i was working there we always made sure the customers were satisfied. Dollar generals work place is very clean and need. it is a very professional place.
good,"I was in charge of the cash register, and i've met alot of people while i worked there. It was a very pleasant experience."
good,"If you’re looking for a part time job fresh out of high school, this is a great place. Hours are flexible (sometimes a little too flexible) and there’s potential to grow, if you stick with it. Within 6 months, an unfortunate event led to my promotion, but that’s why I say it’s potential to grow in the company. Someone’s always quitting, moving up, or retiring. Management is nice, but each location is different. Go in listening and willing to learn."
good,Enjoyed the other employees that worked there and the management was wonderful. Always learning new things and always kept busy. Was stressful at times.
good,"This was a good job for me to get back on my feet from the previous job I had. I have no problem with coworkers, management is great and works with my schedule and work hours."
good,It was one of the best jobs I had. Every day it was like coming into a different family where you could be yourself and still get the job done. The communication was awesome and the customer service we gave out was the best.
good,It was great! good experience. I loved the people i worked with and the environment i worked in. There was great management  and made me feel like i was wanted and made me wanted to keep working there.
good,"Everyday brought new adventures. Each day brought different customers, routines, goals, and ideas which made the days feel extremely fast paced.  The company seemed to be very well organized therefore made learning process very adaptable."
good,I liked working for dollar general it was a great experience for me. It was a decent job but after awhile our manager quit and the store was falling apart so I needed something different
good,"It was good working there,it was good to see the satisfaction on the customers faces when they were satisfied with my customer service, I just feel like the job needs to implement better cash drop procedures"
good,Great job advancement is great family friendly one sto shop great values very accommodating. Motivation to move u growth through company. Flexible hours
good,If you are detail-oriented and enjoy having multiple things to do then this is a great job choice. The hours can be long and physically demanding but keeping an enthusiastic attitude really helps you get through each shift.
good,"It was a lot of work there and had to lift some heavy boxes. Not enough pay and sometimes not enough hours. I was part-time, so I got the least amount of hours and was only making about $20 a week"
good,i love working for dollar general. the days are long but the reward is great. seeing the joy you can bring to customers is like no other. if given the chance i would work here forever.
good,My Manager gave me a chance when nobody else would despite my 10 year gap in employment. I was in an abusive marriage and not allowed to work as a means of control.
good,"Was hired and sent to another DG I hadn't applied with. Lucky to get  5 hours a week. With my mast expeciance, not worth it. More managers then associates. Suck up all the hours given to the store. Some weeks i don't get any hours at all. Just may be the store i'm with. One I regularly shop with associates have hours n happy."
good,"The co workers were super nice and the customer were out stand."
good,"I like my job, the room to move up is amazing. Everyday is new and fun."
good,I was a shift manager which i closed the store every night.. Handled register and supervised one other cashier. Night deposits and counted out safe. Recovered store for the next day to open. Kept the store up to safe regulations and also unloaded trucks and stocked shelves
good,"Overall I really enjoyed this company, mostly because of the people I met. Having worked at a total of 5 locations, the quality of the store and work environments typically depend on the integrity of the store manager. Luckily I have had the pleasure of having some great Store Managers. A great manager can make this job great. They can work with you on schedules, help you out with any unexpected issues."
good,"It’s hard work, hours aren’t really there all the time so take them while you can, pay is alright but not enough for what you have to do, most people don’t confess to there mess up so just hold your ground"
good,Great company to work for. All types of customers! Always great to meet new people. Employees and managers were always friendly and treat you like family
good,"Everything from the benefits and hours were sufficient."
good,I felt overwhelmed at the start of working there but for the most part they are a relaxed work place team oriented and they value their employees safety over everything else
good,I loved the job I did as a store manager you have a lot of responsibility. You have to be caring towards customers and employees. As long as you are doing your job going to work is not stressful.
good,It was nice working there I love company but some employees are unwelcoming. I loved doing recovery would’ve been more excited about working floor then being on cash register to much .
good,Opening the store and taking the deposit to the bank and made sure that the drawers are the correct amount in them and to clean up the store and to make sure to keep the store in order to
good,"The job at some times was nice, while others were also bad. Helping everyone was was but also fun, and making the customers day was always a nice perk."
good,"I enjoyed working there met interesting people,learned how to work at a fast pace,and not to fold under pressure. It was a good experience though I only worked there a short while it was a pleasant atmosphere. I don't feel there budget is high enough to compensate for the workers they need,and the workers do work hard and should be paid accordingly."
good,Working with the public and learning about the company and merchandise was a great learning experience. They were able to help me with flexible working hours.
good,I was lucky and had an awesome store manger that was willing to work with me on my work schedule. Normally you work from 4 to 6 hours and can be morning or evening. The store mangers are the only employee that get 40 hours a week or more.
good,"Wonderful entry level company. Higher levels are for a specific kind of person. It suits some, not most however. Good benefits. Company cares for its employees almost as much as its customers."
good,"Dollar General stores are very oxymoronic. By that, I mean the set task for the day should be the same in theory (truck, backstock, filling MAG, POG sets, etc.) but you never know what you are gonna get. You could be ready to set endcaps and the manager says nope we have a pricing audit, or we have to refresh the Dollar Section. Always expect the unexpected."
good,Great job to advance in. Family oriented and able to work around schedules. Good first experience for those looking to get into the retail environment
good,Starting in retail here is not a bad thing. Be prepared to be expected to do more than what's normally required to do of your position. All around not a bad place to work.
good,Had tons of fun working here nice coworkers and an amazing manager jen. I enjoyed work every day it was not a chore to wake up everyday for work. Wish i could go back.
good,The plus about work this job is its it's a weekly paying job. It's also a laid back job and the work is not complicated at all. You also can climb the ladder to becoming a assistant manager and manager.
good,"Loved my Job, getting 100 % is to stressful, and causes Accidents, breaks were to short, People were ok to Work with, wish I had stayed, but I was told things have changed, so I made the right move by resigning"
good,Worked there for four years and was quite impressed to have kept the job for that long. The management was a bit unfocused but lenient at the same time. The stress wasn't as harsh and the work load was an all day task so it was at time laid back.
good,The only problem with working here is that even though I was a full time MOD I didn’t get enough hrs at all per week so it just wasn’t working out for me the manager here was great though
good,Very great at keeping store stocked with store product. Management was very poor at Making a schedule and keeping his social life out of the work setting.
good,"Dollar general is always growing. Great for a first job, fast paced work place. It’s a great place to shop. The only downside of working there they don’t give enough hour sometimes. It’s stressful sometimes."
good,Need to work an excessive amount of hours to get things done. No balance between having a life it's always dg first.  Still not good enough after busting your butt
good,"While being a single mother of three working fulltime, my store manager is very flexible and understanding with my schedule. I wish my store had more cultural variety for hair products."
good,It’s a really easy job and it’s good paying for how easy it is. Boss is easygoing. Flexible hours and overtime available. Fast paced but it has a good work environment.
good,"I loved working at Dollar General, the employees were kind and they let me ask as many questions as I needed, the only downside of the job was the few rude customers"
good,Always something to be done so your day really flies by. I enjoyed the fast paced work environment and the customers. The store I worked at was in the middle of getting new management and getting back on track.
good,"I loved my job there. Its a lot of heavy lifting, stocking shelves, cleaning, cash register, communicating with customers, getting to know your community. People I worked with were amazing"
good,"The warehouse at Dollar General never sleeps. With meetings twice a shift and message boards in every break room people are kept aware of safety hazards and social events. If you are unhappy with your job position then you can apply for another position within the company. The job is fast-paced no matter the position. Keep in mind that this a warehouse job: you need to be relatively fit, expect a dirty environment and be prepared to be flexible."
good,Great place to work . Just don’t pay enough. Not enough hours . You meet great people. Your job title sometimes hold a lot of responsibilities. Only get annual raise
good,"This job got me to now look on the outlook that any job benefit within companies, and I quite enjoyed my experience so I don’t nothing for granted. What I can learn from that is to keep doing what it important and how I can change and take that energy and put it to something worthwhile."
good,Great job to get you buy for a while it is relaxed not too stressful and pays enough to get you by. Definitely one of the better jobs I’ve had so far.
good,Dollar General was a nice place to work. The people working they were usually easy to get along with. The pay could have been better considering the amount of work that is required.
good,"This was my first job ever. Started when I was 18 years old. I love it. The store manager kept the employees going and most importantly the customers. She always made sure that everyone was good before herself. The store stayed in tip top shape. It was nice that the store (15834) was brought to Rocky Mount, Va. It was very convenient to the surrounding local people."
good,The management was when i worked there wasnt the best but she tried.. The customers where amazing. The hours go by quick cause your never standing arounf
good,my last manager did a good job regardless of having a lot on his plate but some of my coworkers were really bad about calling in sick a lot so i was usually the go to so i basically lived at the store.  Pay rate could have been better
good,"Doesn’t work well if you are a single parent. Overall loved the job cause of the team I did have and because of the customers. Not ideal pay, and only getting a .30 cent raise in six months doesn’t cut it after running a store with no manager, or staff."
good,"This is a good company to work for, great hours, decent pay. Friendly staff & boss. Plenty of room for advancement. Each to catch on & easy to learn! G"
good,I’m the strong Manager I am because of Dollar General. I’ve learned how to mange and lead a store ; Learn to set goals and accomplish them ; I would say the hardest part of my job is maintaining my job with my life balance we only get one day off and it’s becoming overwhelming
good,"I was with this company for 17 days as an associate before being offered a store. While I wanted the store manager position and couldn't say no to the money, the store wasn't ready for me. I had been pulled between multiple stores due to managers quitting left and right and finally settled into a store that had been without a manger for 2 weeks almost. The upper management try so hard to help you out on the lower end of the ladder. The only issue with the company is it doesn't pay enough to retain entry level employees. They encourage hiring as low as possible. I can't retain people to work as hard as I do for a fraction of the cost."
good,Its takes alot of hard work and dedication to have a successful store. Having the right team is also important. Things never slow down. Some weeks are busier then others. If dont stay on track it will take you a long time to catch up.
good,Dollar general is a great place to work if you’re quick worker and learner. Dollar general is great networking with customers and a great experience also.
good,The store is in a bad neighborhood. The customers make the job stressful. Management is good and listens to feedback.  They give me the hours I asked for. The manager works with me in schedule.
good,"Is a great and growing company to work for. It is very fast paced and at times stressful during season changes with as much product is pushed on a store with minimum labor hours to use. However, once you have hired and trained a good crew with common goals, work flow cycle becomes like clockwork. I have learned many new skills since becoming the store manager such as inventory control, hiring/terminating, in store marketing, scheduling, labor budgeting, planning, and many others. The store manager HAS to be persistent with good work ethic and planning or you can expect to work over 50 hours a week as a salary employee. Everything about being a store manager for Dollar General is something I truly have become to enjoy, however its the pay that just doesn't equate to the amount of work you have to do. This is a hands on store manager type job so you can expect to not only be the store manager but everything else as well. If you're able to multitask, have high energy, and leadership qualities this is a job that will challenge you."
good,Overall good experience for a young person not having too many financial responsibilities.   Pay is not adequate for demands of the job.  Hours are very good for school age individuals
good,"Great place too work great people love the place "
good,"As a manager I like working with people and enjoy taking care of my workers as scheduling, making sure they were happy.The store it is nice to have it nice and clean and skippable for our customers."
good,"The job was very easy, but it was only to far for me.  Some of the employees had an attitude but other than their attitudes they were pretty nice. The manager is really nice. They really helped out a lot."
good,"The amount of customers fluctuate from time to time, you learn how to run a register, maintain the floors, stock, bag groceries. The work place environment is very nice and the people are amazing to work with."
good,It’s a good job and I’m pretty sure it’s very easy to move up and have your own store the way they throwing up Dollar Generals. But over all if you’re a people person this is the job for you!
good,You'll learn how to do planograms and endcaps and how to read a label on the box to stock it. Always on the go doing something. Depending on the manager the work culture is normally pretty lacks and easy going/ fun work place.
good,"Have to be patient with Costumers and willing to help them with anything. Have respect for your costumers and your fellow employees. It’s an okay job you get to meet new people, interact with new people, get use to working on retail. It’s good if your a shy person really getting to know other people. It’s not an easy job, but it’s worth it if you can do the work that’s handed to you."
good,"This was my first job working in a store type of setting. I was hired on part time as cashier. I also stocked, cleaned, and organized merchandise. The job was pretty laid back but also got a little hectic during certain times, but nothing overwhelming. Not a bad job overall."
good,Very good company if you want to move up to Corporate or get your own store. Truck days are the worse trying to get products out on the floor while maintaining the store and making sure the costumers have everything they need and to smoothly get them in and out. Typical day at work is making sure costumers have what they need keeping the store clean and safe while managing my cashier.
good,My main problem I see at DG is they need to hire more people. Operating at business with sometimes just 2 people and expecting the store to be neat and tidy just won't work.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I liked the management and the coworkers. Got along with everyone and was able to work a flexible schedule.
good,My months at Dollar General was great I had a job I was excited for everyday. I enjoyed my time there it was productive and fun at the same time making the work environment peaceful but the change in management made me think about my position there
good,Good place to work just need more training time and more professional management within the company. Need security officer in stores to ensure employees safety.
good,Has its ups and downs but all jobs do. Its what you make of it and how you take your job. Be proud and make yourself look good always. Give 110% never make yourself look bad.
good,Depends on what you start go to there each different each manager runs it a different way there are rules they still do follow the manager I had who ran our store was wonderful great always willing to work with people and to help them around their schedule I left because I wasn’t making enough hours but my manager was sad to see me go
good,"Should pay there managers more, allow more full time positions & offer part time employees benefits. Work life balance is great! Must be willing to work though not just stand around."
good,Overall experience is great if you enjoy working with the public in a retail setting. Co-workers were very proficient as a team and the atmosphere always pleasant.
good,Dollar General was a good place to work with a huge opportunity for advancement. Only real problem was that compensation for the employees was not even close to other businesses in the area  which caused a huge strain on the salaried management as they had to compensate for the high turn over of employees.
good,Nice clean store to work at. Met a lot of good people as far as coworkers and customers. They are very accommodating and helpful to their employees. I enjoyed working for this company in so many ways.
good,You on your feet your whole work shift restocking items recovering eisles helping out with customers makin sure they find everything checkin out customers
good,"Very high paced work environment. You will always be moving and doing something, which I enjoy. Advancement is not that hard to achieve, however you don't get paid as much as you would like to."
good,"Taught me a lot about "
good,"I loved working in Dollar General. I had a great boss. Very productive team and positive attitude. Every day I loved being at my job. The higher I went up, the harder the job got. Which is great except when you work for so many hours and have no help from higher up"
good,"The store is clean, mostly organized,friendly. We really care about our customers needs.we always make sure we help one another. Teamwork is the key for our store. That's what makes the store that it is."
good,"You're always doing something, either stocking or running the cashier. It's a pretty fun place to work at, they have a lot of deals going on so you were always busy."
good,"Management is cooperative, work is standard retail. Nothing too difficult, but plenty to learn. If you can do the job right, it is very rewarding. No designated time for short breaks, 1/2 hour break any shirt >6 hrs, friendly environment, advancement possible"
good,I like working there but I need a better paying job to support myself and my daughter.  My job is good but just need more of a set schedule for my daughter and myself. On a weekly basis.
good,"Lack of hours, but the current manager is pleasent to work for. Most of the coworkers are pleasent and cheerfull with a few exceptions. Pace is high but can be relaxed at times."
good,Prepared for fast pace and speedy service fast on register and count to three you should have scanned your next item and on and on until sales is complete. Freight is a challenge but totally worth the investment in speed and accurate placement of all inventory walking in the store and know how and what items are carried and location is knowledgeable in customer service . Co workers are fabulous and be nice and smile
good,I had to be absent one time and store phone was not working I called the assistant manager.She never told Manager and I was tiered for no show. I was told I would not be moved to a new store if I was I would be yrained as key holder neither happened so I was let go.
good,"Stressful company, some locations we're very un-organized, employees are nice, easy training programs, "
good,Dollar General was a great place to work. I have nothing more i need or would like to answer concerning this job. Being an Assistant Store Manager was great experience for me.
good,Great place to gain multi-unit leadership experience. Solid training program. Labor model is very lean and turnover can be challenging depending on the market that you are in.
good,A great Company and good jobs for students that need a part time job. Helps you improve on your customer services experience. Just need improvement on pay roll
good,"I really enjoyed the time that I worked at Dollar General. I was a key holder. The company just keeps cutting hours, so it made it difficult to make ends meet."
good,"enjoyed my time at dollar general. management and pay could be improved but overall a great place to work. offers benefits, decent hours, always friendly employees."
good,"I like the customers had some nice people come through. Wish more then two people worked store was busy. Wish the system was more updated, register where a little slow."
good,The Dollar General crew in Spring City was one of the best places and people I have worked for. They are a very family oriented and caring group. They helped me in my time of need and was flexible with my hours that I needed off.
good,"Dollar General usually gets a bad name because some stores aren't properly managed. This store, however, is managed well and kept clean constantly. Employees are treated fairly and given equal opportunities."
good,Fun place to work. Great teamwork and the customers were always friendly as well. The management was good and everyone focused on ways to make the store have improvements.
good,Always something to do. Wonderful costomers and employees. Fast paced job. Have to be able to multitask while you will be cashing out customers and stocking and cleaning all needing done by you.
good,We needed security. Robbery my first day as a key holder. Two more robberies and had a mental customer to trash the place twice because my manager didn’t follow the police and band him.
good,slower paced and not to stressful the only downside is the low pay and chance of being robed and customer not wanting to leave at closing . and managment aprecieates you more
good,I did enjoy the customers and the people I worked with as well as the type of work. I wished I had a better balance of work and home life after taking management position. It was hard to plan anything not knowing if I would have to come back to work for something unexpected or when someone wasn't able to be in for there shift.
good,Good place to work. Fun laid back environment. Management is awesome. Job is easy stocking & running a register. If your looking for a fun laid back place to work with flexible hours DG is the place.
good,"A typical day is busy  starting at 7 am or earlier,   Most mornings  the Manager on duty will work alone  Stocking, waiting on customers and checking in vendors and other duties,   managing cash is important  but also keeping customer happy.   The only thing I do not like about my Job at Dollar General is I believe that more Payroll hours should be allotted to stores to help take care of  customers and running the store correctly .    I don't think you should have to work alone  at any time  during open hours .  Each store is allotted hours based on LAST YR sales,   I Would like to see the payroll system be re evaluated and more hours added to each store,   Do not overwork the Manager who is salary, and your retention level will continue to grow"
good,The positive side of the job was being able to interact with the customers.  It was enjoyable doing the merchandising of the product.  It was a positive challenge increasing the profit margin
good,"I stocked shelves and worked at the cash register, they have all employees work on all tasks and only managers can void items. However, there were a lot pf unruly customers, who would  throw their products at us."
good,"I was hired as the store manager at the store in Onalaska, Texas. The store had not had a manager for more than 18 months.  I was working between 80 and 90 hours a week to get the store back to company standards; i wound up in the hospital. Still, it was a job I had sought for over 20 years.  I would do it again if given the opportunity."
good,"A typical day included greeting customers, assisting them with purchases, helping customers find items they were looking for, maintaining a clean work area, such as; putting return products back on the shelves, restocking shelves, and rotating the stock on the shelves. My favorite part of the job was providing great customer service to my customers."
good,"This store has some of the best stuff, and we tried to keep it clean and decent. Most days were slow and most were like a nonstop line and then there were days where nothing wanted to work right."
good,While working at dollar general I had a great experience with customers. They converse with me and I tend to show good listening and replies. I really like meeting new people to speak to.
good,"I started as cycle counter at this job and wore many different hats while employed here.MUOP operator, cycle counter, WMS operator, Inventory Control Clerk and Repack Leadership Candidate. There is room for moving up but you have to be aggressive"
good,"I've learned a lot of different things from Dg that I can apply to my everyday life. For the most part the work schedule was flexible. I also got to interact with the locals, I go to know names and certain products clientele would often request. The only negatives were lack of team work and constant change to schedule."
good,"Small crews work together to make the store a good place. It is always a team effort and each one had to pull their weight. Stocking and friendly customer care is most important' Keeping well maintained store is essential, so yes it is a lot of work and it is busy, but with a good crew it is enjoyable and rewarding. A person can work up in company and receive training. I can be a career job or a part time, students can work around their schedule. You can feel an important part of the community, as it may be the only dollar and grocery store in the area. You can transfer to different locations. Excellent job opportunity for rural areas."
good,"I did seasonal stocking at DG. I enjoyed it, but did not want full-time employment at that point. It was an easy part-time job that gave me the little bit of extra money I needed."
good,"Managed and maintained the operations of multiple locations and over 100 employees. "
good,I loved working part time at dollar general while I was going to school. The only thing I hated about working there was my manager. She would talk about everyone behind their back and play favorites.
good,I like working at dg just wish i could get a littlr bit more pay from it but i like it its cool. Its fast paste but if you take your time everything willand can get done.
good,A fun workplace where coworkers become a big family.  You are there for each other and share a bond. You learn so much from one another. You make some memories that you will cherish.
good,"Some managers made things harder but usually you're o  your own. You run the register, stock, clean, and help customers with the manager in the back which can be stressful at times."
good,Dollar general is not a bad place to work. We get paid weekly and paid through direct deposit. I had some fun while being employed at Dollar General. I would recommend Dollar General to a friend as an extra/additional source of income.
good,"I enjoy going to work, I truly love interacting with people, meeting new people and seeing different lifestyles everyday. When I first started working for dollar general I was excited because it was my first job. I learned how to work the cash register in one day, learned how to stock the shelves, recover and make sure everything stayed looking nice."
good,"I really liked working for the company, I got to meet a lot of new people. My customers became my friends, it was nice to see them everyday. My manager was like my family. She always tried to work around everyone's schedule and still be a shoulder to lean on."
good,"Labeled and picked packages for shipping."
good,"Walk in, grab a U-Boat and stock the product. That was the general day for me. Once a week I did have to unload the delivery truck and stack the boxes in the inventory section of the store."
good,While the job as a whole was a fun experience. The constant switching of new employees and new management and the lack of care from higher management made working there hard. Outdated security and cash systems that broke down constantly and the lack of proper cleaning routine left the building vulnerable.
good,"good work place but managers do what they want, many managers don't help the workers, its a good company a with great benefits, long drive to work, safety came 1st"

good,"I was a third key person which means I closed the store at nigh. I leared how to close out the registers and get the money ready for deposit in the morning. I would run the register, stock shelves, let the other clerk know what needs to be done."
good,"I liked this job. I was upset when the manager put his notice in."
good,You have a flexible schedule so if you need a day off you can have it off with notice. It is a very physical job and you have to be on your feet all day and lift boxes.
good,"your district manager will determine what kind of experience you have there"
good,"Great place to work, with great people. Great benefits. Stock awards, bonuses, and merit increases, each year. Could only be better if I could work remote from home area in Texas."

good,Fun job for the most part. You get to chat with a lot of people and be very helpful. I didn't like having to wait until the store was empty to clean. Cash register is easy to learn and operate.
good,It was fun and manager was very flexible on hours for the wages just need better raises and learning system don't take as long to do and customers are friendly
good,I really enjoy working at Dollar General. It is fun and it has taught me how to deal with all kind of customers. I have gained Communications skills and speech.
good,The hours was critically interfering with my personal life if they was as strong minded as me I would have stayed and worked even harder with my co-workers but I was the only one left
good,I was hired FT during summer hours. I went PT during school time. Flexible hours which I appreciated. I could work as little or more as I wanted. Great manager. Positive and upbeat. Supportive staff.
good,I liked the dollar General because it was welcoming. I loved the team I worked with. I would recommend this job to mainly a younger person. I most definitely would work at DG again.
good,Good place to work with good benefits. Company is growing rapidly opening up opportunity to advance with the company. Company is dedicated to bring in the right personnel to make a better work environment.
good,I enjoyed every aspect of my employment at DG. My management team was extremely supportive. There was always room for advancement. As a store manager I was expected to be available 24/7 but I didn't mind because the culture of my employment was fully supported.
good,I learned a lot of different skills dealing with my job and dealing with the customers.and also learned about myself. I really enjoyed myself and dealing with the customers.
good,"As a Lead Sales Associate for Dollar General one is responsible for training associates that are new to the company as well as being a model example of the management team.  I learned from my Store Manager the basics of Stocking and Merchandising and was typically responsible for seasonal sets and end caps.  The hardest part of the job is running an efficient store when it may be busy and you are short staffed,  I enjoyed building rapport and life long relationships with the customers from my/the neighborhood."
good,A day at Dollar General was a smooth one. Most days I was a cashier and some days I stocked product. I enjoyed helping people find what they need. I kelp the store cleaned and helped unload the truck when it came.
good,"When I worked at dollar general, the company was changing management so quickly. A lot of things were overlooked in the beginning and the employees didn't ever seem to stay long."
good,"They would always change policy non-stop , hard to work around school schedules , district didn't really help out the stores if they needed anything , customers weren't really happy with the store either."
good,"Didn't really have a good time working there at all. But did learn the cash register really easily. The job wasn't hard at all. Typical day at work was, come in be a cashier then stock until someone else was ready to check out then leave at closing time. I felt like the job was too plain."
good,"I really enjoyed my job at Dollar General, I wish they would take me back. I know how to do deposits and plan o grams and i know the system. One of the most enjoyable parts of my job as the lead sales associate was the customers i really enjoyed helping the customers,seeing that they found everything they were looking for and know that they were leaving as a satisfied customer."
good,"Working at 3 different stores, I always got along well with the management and didnt have any problems with co-workers. Loved making my store look good and proud."
good,A typical work day at dollar general is fun and fast paced from assisting customers with helping them finding the things they're looking for to providing them with speedy service at checkout.
good,"No complaints about the company itself. In fact the company does a great job of assigning tasks to employees. Very organized and reasonable time frames for tasks. Unfortunately near the end of my employment my district manager did not give enough hours to staff my store. I managed for a few months without a pay increase, not allotted any extra hours to tackle the work load, no help from any upper management from other stores. Was then questioned why my store was not making deadlines and was a mess. Very seriously did not have the man power to tackle the work load."
good,I wish they trained their employees before advancement! This company is very unorganized and they go through employees rapidly. Impossible work load with the amount of hours allowed for the week.
good,Well stocked and taken care of no problems with the store or management. Sometimes the work schedule was a little messed up and sometimes had problem with workers coming in but it all worked out in the end thanks to management.
good,"I love my job, I just went to college and graduated. So now its time for me to use my degree. It is alot of hands on work and helping customers. It takes dedication to run a store but it is hard to find people with similiar work ethic, so your workload is usually atleast double it should be."
good,"Dollar General is a good place to work for. I learned management skills, and I was promoted to shift manager in less than a year. The hardest part was dealing with some co workers who thought they knew everything and took no responsibility for what they did wrong. I did enjoy all the customers that came in especially if they were regulars."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. Fun environment. Quickly learned tasks to do. Easy to restock. Nice bosses. Close to home. Didn't have health insurance.
good,"The manager at the time from 2015 to 2016 was kind and respectful for all workers that were there. Taught me how to use their register. Could work days and night, depending on what the manager had set up. No good parts and no bad parts of the job."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Dollar General. I was young when I started and learned a lot from the managers and work environment. I was able to move up the ranks fairly quick, and learned even more. Is this a place to make a career? You decide. I can say that it was good experience for how young I was and to really get my foot in the door."
good,"I liked working there, I liked my customer and I think they liked me. I did not trust me District Managers. Overall I could have stayed there. Dollar General does a lot for the community///"
good,This company is a very enjoyable place to work.  It has it's everyday routines. The only down side are the hours and the pay rate.  Guidelines are easy to follow and understand.
good,A typical work day included providing excellent customer service with a lot of help and guidance from management. The hardest part of the job was doing repetitive work. overall a good place to work part time.
good,Job very easy to work at and will give you a time to relax when you need to. Management is good. Breaks could be better. The most enjoyable part of the job is to restock the shelfs and attend costumers.
good,"High volume Retail store, very fast paced."
good,Dollar general was a fast paced work environment but its hard to get a lot of hours because you have to share them with the managers. The managers are very helpful.
good,Great job . Wish I could of got more hours.  But being enrolled in school prevented that from happening. Their we’re time where I could’ve have got more hours but I had to prepare for graduation .
good,Dollar General was fun job to work at while I in college. The hours are flexible and they work with you. The only problem that I had was scheduling. my manager was late on getting me the schedule for the upcoming week. which made it hard for me to plan my week accordingly.
good,"I enjoyed working with Dollar General. I never had a problem with getting days off or if I needed to switch with someone. It is an amazing job for a first time job. The hardest part is sometimes dealing with customers, but the longer you work there you realize how they are."

good,Great company to work for. Focused on growth and development of employees. Huge impact in the community with Serving Others. Good compensation and benefits package.
good,"Its a lot of work and very buys but if you are willing to put forth the effort,its a good place to be. Just try your best and be considerate of the customers and their needs and wants, do what your manager asks of you and get along with your fellow co-workers."
good,"Worked all day with only a 30 minute break. No discounts on anything you buy. I learned how to work a register and communicate with the customers. The manager was sweet and caring, she understood if you couldn't make it to work due to an emergency. not all of the employees were all nice and always never showed up. The hardest part of the job was having to drop everything I was doing to go work because no one would show up and constantly having to lift heavy containers. The most enjoyable part was the people I did make friends with and the customers that were so sweet."
good,"A typical work day consist of stocking and recovering shelves. As well as, new product sets like seasonal items that were to be  discounted and replaced with new items.

good,I feel like its good for anyone looking for a first job. The work is easy  as long as you can read and follow instructions.  The only issue is that the work can be repetitive and mundane.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar general. In the first week I was promoted to management. If you put the time and effort in your work, the advancement is rewarding."
good,Its a very busy retail working constantly as a Supervisor to meet all store deadlines. Only hard working people need to apply to these kind of retail stores.
good,"While I worked at Dollar General I became better at interacting with other people, and I absolutely loved my job. The only reason I left was because there weren't enough hours available for me to work. There is a very positive environment and the staff are very understanding and caring about helping the customers find what they need."
good,"Great job but if you have a family its a little hard, they tell you not to put in a ton of hours and really you do not, just make sure you have the right team and the right attitude. Wonderful"
good,"I enjoy working here, partly because this is the first employer that recognized my previous retail experience and hired me on as a ""cashier supervisor"".  My actual title is Lead II Associate-Part time.  My store manager is very flexible if things come up that need adjustment.  The schedule runs Saturday to Friday, which is a little strange based on the previous jobs I have had; however, the new schedule is usually posted by Thursday so you have time to make changes if necessary.  The salary posted on Indeed is lower than the salary I am actually making.  Another thing I enjoy is that we get paid every Friday, most of my past jobs had a bi-weekly pay period."
good,I loved working at Dollar general. I wish I could go back because I enjoyed the workers and the vibe of the place. I wish I had more hours when I was working there but I was in school.
good,"The hardest part of the job is controlling shrink when located in an urban neighborhood with no security and customers are walking out the store with baskets  garbage cans or totes full of merchandise. Arriving to work alone in the pitch black dark at 530 am. Getting robbed 2 times at gun point having a fake security company that does not answer the phone when needed because the system is always down those are the down falls"
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General because of the crew I worked with. Everyone was no fuss and very productive. We all were eager to learn and cross-train.
good,The customers were great and so were the other employees. It was hard work you were always busy and everyday was different. Which I liked.  They always made sure you had your breaks.
good,"Overall, my experience at Dollar General has been great. The managers work with your schedule and the employees are extremely nice. I would recommend a teenager or young adult to work there. For the job is extremely active and you have to pick up heavy items."
good,"the hardest part about this job is that you can have no life.,you work all the time and don't make that much..dealing with rude customers and drama with employees was always a problem. I liked it when I first started but as I continued to work there I started to hate it."
good,"Advancement from cashier to keyholder is pretty easy if you have a good work ethic. Coworkers are pretty cool and Management is alright. The only problem you may have is not having your shift covered, even if it's an emergency."
good,"The day begins by reviewing the deposit and taking it to the bank. All money is counted and tills are prepared for the day."
good,Its a great job that will teach you multiple important skills that one will need to know and master for multiple different types of jobs. Also this company is very compassionate when it comes to family or medical emergencies.
good,"I believe I worked about 30 hours a week, the environment was great, loved management, enjoy servicing customers. Operating the cash register was pretty easy, the only complaint was income."
good,Typically very easy to work here it good management and not a lot for you to get overwhelmed over. I was able to learn about what it takes to be a manager without being overwhelmed and having to work at overwhelming speed.
good,"In general good company to work for, I had a great VP manager who trusted my job and was very complimentary of my performance. I had a great team working for me, the only issue was that Dollar General is a very conservative company did not like to take any risk.Good environment in the office and in the community."
good,Worked alongside a team of friendly and productive employees. Nice in-store environment workplace complete with adequate employee breaks and mealtimes.
good,"typical work day - busy"
good,"Fun relaxed place to work if you have a good team. If one person slacks the whole store goes down, but if everyone does their part its easy going. There are a few stresses as with any job, but you form a work family."
good,"Willing to work around people's life outside of work. "
good,"It wasn't hard work, but it was tiring. They had carry-ins every month and they did random giveaways. The pay was worth the work. You are part of a team in that your entire department has a goal to hit, but you are also working by yourself. There is an expected production rate that starts at 50% and steps up until your expected rate is 100%. if you are falling a little short, everything is tracked through the computer systems and the supervisors can send help accordingly."
good,"Opened the store counted the tills, made deposits, and usually closed the store. Learned to bookkeep. The management i cant really account for. The culture was great though."
good,"Management was great, all employees were friendly and helpful. Schedules were flexible. Job duties were varied and split fairly between all employees. Loved the job, salary not so much"
good,"Working at Dollar General was a fun experience. I was hired when the store was being ""remodeled"" and got new management. Though it was a little difficult getting started, I think it was a worthwhile experience. I had fun working with my co-workers and the current manager. I would highly recommend people to work here."
good,Good place to work if you are just starting off in this job field. Pay is good. Work environment is good. Managers treat you fair. you have opportunity to grow.
good,"I love it there. I learned a lot:"
good,"Is not a bad place to work cool customers, the Dm just try to work you for a lil bit of nothing. Hardest part about the job is when they want you to stock the shelves and work the register."
good,"Most work days you work alone and are expected to multi-task at all times. I learned a great deal about a many different areas of retail management in a short period of time. Working with outside vendors, facility issues, human resource development, and shrink reduction. I worked with many wonderful, hard-working people everyday. However, if you are short on quality workers, your job can become nearly impossible. You must ensure that all tasks are completed whether you completed it alone or not. No tasks can be neglected if the store is to run properly. The job was fast-paced and there was opportunity for advancement for nearly every employee."
good,Dollar General is a good place to start your career in retail sales. They are fairly slow paced but also competive. they have good health insurance as long as you are in management.
good,They are all upbeat expecially the manager! Always understanding. He’s Funny! Has some serious honesty! He’s also helpful on so many levels! Work is great when you have great co workers!
good,"Was my first retail job and also my first time working a cash register,the job was based right in the center of downtown Johnstown,Pa,meaning there will be times to where you will be extremely busy.The manangers where very nice."
good,"It was an alright job. I loved the manager, she was awesome, always worked with my schedule. Friendly customers most of the time. I suppose every job has great and not so great customers. Would recommend & rate this job (8/10)"
good,"Dollar General Market has high standard and enjoy making customers happy. Dollar General Market has a monthly recognition policy, where employees are recognized for quality work"
good,"Customer service, bank deposits, zoning and unloading the 53 foot trucks. Some employees work slower than others. The manager was awesome and our store was always clean."
good,The job wasnt the bad part because i loved it but the management was terrible and after being offered assistant manager position and then only getting paid 8.60 an hour was NOT worth it!!!
good,I would get in and start up on register and if there was no one in the store I would try to fix up the isles a little bit till we had costumers then I would take care of them and then maybe help my manger doing stocking the shelf's and then if I was almost time for me to clock off I would spend the rest of my time cleaning the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was having fun while doing my job and the people I worked with were fun to work with and we got things done.
good,The store i work at was an amazing experience for me and if i could go back i would without a secobd thought. 16852 is the store number. I also worked for a horrible Store the store was ran well by the managment team but the environment was horrible. All in all dollar general has alot of opportunity for the life time retailer looking for a job just make sure you find a good store in a nice neighborhood.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves and running a cash register to check out customers.  I learned how to rotate produce, handle money, count registers, and how to work with the public.  The management was friendly and worked with you to give you the hours you desired.  They treated the employees with respect and fairness.  The values and beliefs behind the company was to treat every customer with respect and assist them whenever seemed fit.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers that were confrontational and argumentative.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment and pride after blocking all the items in the aisle or completely unloading the truck ahead of schedule."
good,I enjoyed serving my customers.  Meeting new people including the various vendors and employees. Stocking shelves and receiving weekly merchandise for my consumers was great.
good,"Good company to build a career with that has good job security and benefits comparable to any in retail"
good,This was a second job and my managers were great. The only down fall I had with this job was the low pay grade. It was simply not enough to make a full time job even as a key holder.
good,"The job keeps you busy, keeps you moving, and can be fast paced.  As long as everyone is doing their part things go smoothly. However, like anywhere, when one piece falls the others get behind. It definitely requires a group effort and team players to be successful"
good,"they dont supply enough hours for things to get done, they expect to much out of managers, 2 people per shift is not enough, and more attention from DMs"
good,"Good place to work if you can handle customer service in the retail business. The employees make the reputation of the store, I had the privilege to work with a good crew of co-workers."
good,"Dollar General is a solid place to work part time depending upon your circumstances. The culture there is solid as well. You're always pushed to do more and to do better,"
good,"good experience"
good,Dollar General is a decent place to work. The atmosphere is not very stressful even though the workload can seem heavy. There never seems to be enough staff on schedule though.
good,"Would be better if job applicants were interested in more than a pay check. Cashiers need to smile and be people friendly."
good,A typical work day for me is like going to work and working very hard and trying to start your life off in the right direction. Qorking there would be a fresh start for me and i can start my life off in a better path
good,"Typically i would work 12-9; this is because for most of the time I worked there I was the only cashier, and while I was considered part time I worked full time hours. Working in a small town meant that there were regular customers which was always fun because they were most of the time always friendly. The hardest thing was being the only cashier and that being stressful when the days got very busy. It was also unfortunate because I ended up having to work every holiday."
good,I loved the store and people I worked with. Their was constant change in leadership such as district managers and Managers. I feel that there are opportunities with this company if you apply yourself. Their in high demand for employment with this company at all times. Could utilize better benefits and more communication between employees and managers.
good,"there was nothign to really stay for. its a great job for a high school kid but not to support a family. the job didnt provide enough hours to even maintain bills, i enjoyed my co workers and most management. expectations were unrealistic."
good,"Managers are great, coworkers are great, good company to work for. Pay could be a bit better for the work you are expected to do but nothing comes free."
good,"Was a great working experience, if given the chance I would work for dollar general again. I enjoyed getting to know the regulars that came in you meet great people"
good,"I liked the people I work with , and the environment is nice it's just it's gets very stressful, and when you close and there is a certain amount of things that HAVE to be done before to leave as in recovery and stuff you have to finish it."
good,I got a lot of experience in the daily operations of the store. The management was good and the workplace culture was professoinal the hardest part was the hours.
good,A typical day at dollar general was usually a busy day. people would pass other dollar generals to come to our store. met alot of interesting people working there.
good,this is a great place to work :O) so much enjoyment when setting out holiday items. You also get to set racks and shelves. challenging taking the time to set up correctly
good,"I worked as a part-timer at DG for a short summer, but it was very nice.  I always had work to do, customers to help and was fairly stress-free.  It could be overwhelming at some times but they passed fairly quickly."
good,I enjoy working there because coworkers are great. It is a hard job and very fast paced. I would recommend it to soneone if nothing else the benefits are good. There is opportunity for advancement.
good,I started out at the bottom of the the ladder. I advanced to a temp DM in three years. This company really does believe in advancing employees that show potential.
good,Working at Dollar General has given me an eye-opening experience into how to provide great customer service to an assortment of people. It has also provided me with a chance to expand multitasking skills and how to delegate tasks more efficiently. It has also given me experience in how to talk to employees like an efficient leader. The management above myself are easy to talk to and receive help from if needed. Its a different task each day that you walk in the door.
good,loved working there really nice people loved helping people find what they needed. but the stocking is crazy too much to do and you have to work around people.
good,"At dollar general, there is a lot to do if the manager actually follow a truck chart. However, different districts pay different rates. But as a company, dollar general does not pay very well for the amount of work that we do. There are no raises for those who stands out. But, you can advance within the company pretty fast. Overall, I love working for dollar general. Like any other job, your going to have some managers that you don't like."
good,"The company has a whole has excellent morals and high standards. A company that helps push you above and beyond. Ability to move up quickly within the ranks is the best, as long as you are ready and can do it... Great company overall. I would consider rejoining the DG team and family.. I loved some of my stores from before but mainly I loved my customers. They are what I loved and miss the most.."
good,It's very convenient because it's so close to my house The managers are really nice and  helpful. I enjoy how I don't feel rush and requirements are still met
good,The job was fast pace and someone that was young would like it. It was easy but fast and you always had to complete your 8 hours and no more. The job is good for someone that is young.
good,You essentially are required to be well rounded as you will be required to effectively perform any task required of you in the store. This can consist of you running the register while setting stock or straightening the merchandise on the shelf to make it more presentable and cleaning after the store closes. The daily required tasks vary but they are easily learned and performed simultaneously as most tasks will be performed along side other tasks or will be halted in between other more important tasks such as checking out customers as this is given a higher priority to other tasks.
good,My Review on Dollar General is that its a good start off job. Customers some were nice some were mean. the coworkers were really nice if there was any problem theyll be willing to help.
good,The place is right off tha highway so it's easily accessible. The warehouse is big with many different areas of operation that are almost interlocked which make moving thruough the plant almost effortless.
good,"I worked for three years at Doolar General Market."
good,"slow and fast paced not to hard to handle stocking and watching your area. store was ran well by employees, management never to far behind. no hard moments unless you dont get it"
good,"Great company to work for, great flexible hours and good clean working conditons.  Room for growth. Benefits and salary could use improvement. otherwise a great company"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at dollar general. The environment was great and I was constantly busy.  Management slacked a lot and didn't do much to help.
good,I loved working with people I got a lot of experience in the retail field. The manager and employees were great. The hardest part of the job was getting weekly truck deliveries and having all products put on shelf by the following week. The most enjoyable part of working at the dollar store was working the register and interacting with the customers.
good,This job was very social so if you like talking to people this is for you. It was a very simple job but also took more concentration then one would think. Very good job.
good,Dollar General has its days but what job doesnt. There may be alot more to take on some days than other days. You have a great chance of moving up at this company if you are great at what you do!
good,"In a typical day, I would be a cashier. Some days, I would have to be at work earlier and unload truck and stock shelves. The manager was very good at taking care of her store and was always very nice and understanding."
good,"supervising entry-level employees, assisting in the hiring process, overseeing operations, ensuring customer satisfaction, setting schedules, involves hands-on, and verbal orientation."
good,"Very good pay, very good advancement after the initial 90 days. The initial days are the hardest to get past but after that the work flow comes naturally."
good,"This was otherwise a great place to work...when I actually got to work. I was lucky to get over 20 hours a week. If you're looking for a part-time second job, this is it. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
good,"Had total responsibility for everything that happened within the store. Dealing with all aspects of the operation of the business including customers, employees and vendors."
good,Great place to work friendly coworkers and understanding managment great oppertunities for advancment...loved working here. Was a fun fast passed environment
good,Each day is never the same because there are always a variety of people who come in and out of the store. Tasks for each day usually vary depending what is needed to be done.
good,"Working with the company Dollar General was a pleasure in their organization. The unloading and stock procedures were well thought through but, at the same time the staff was hired based on favoritism instead of experience. Overall the work environment was incredible with pleasant customers."
good,I was a chasier and I also did Restock. I learned how to communicate better and interacted with customers daily. Great organizational skills. I am also a quick learner and ever to work hard.
good,"This job helped me hone my people person skills and is great for learning how to run a register, count money, and conversate with townfolk you see on a day to day basis"
good,"A typical day at work was for the most part fast paced and busy. I learned patience, customer service, and communication. Management was a little hectic because we were short staff. Workplace culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job was short staffing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,"Like any job there are upsides and downs but with this job, peraonally, I felt i was making a difference within my community. Not simply selling inventory off of a shelf, the smiles i would see as well as sometimes create. It was a great job that definitely helped me get by for a while."
good,I enjoyed working for DG and would love to work for them again.  Work enviroment is good and upper management is very involved in daily sales and for the employees
good,"Three key assistant manager. Duties include customer service, inventory, call screening, filing paperwork, deposits, oversee task are completed by all employees, cleaning, and  checking in vendor orders."
good,a typical day is mostly busy but i like the paste. i learned how to multitask in a timely fashion. the management is good but the hours are low because of the amount of employees.the hardest part is trying to stock while running the front but i can manage just fine. the most enjoyable part about the job is helping the the customers and keeping them happy.
good,Work was productive and I learned how to manage more than 4 people. I was able to work with customers and management. Many questions would come up on different products. Learning about them was exciting and being able to explain it to the public was exceptional.
good,I stocked grocery items on shelf according to placements. i also checked out customers at the register. I assisted with facing store items and cleaning the store as well
good,"This was hands down the best job i have ever had. I worked on the warehouse and would still be there if my car hadn't broken down. Making over $15 after three months, getting three days off for thanksgiving and Two days off for Christmas, leave early on Fridays if workers do what they are supposed to do. They work with you to help you hit your numbers."
good,"dollar general is a good place to work...if you like hard labor with little pay,,alot of work need to be completed with little time alloted..this job is not for everyone"
good,Was my first job. It was a good job to learn and grow from. I advanced quickly. But wanted new experiences. Was a good foundation to start my work experience.
good,I've been at Dollar General for going on two years. It's a good place to work for younger people who have bills. The pay is great and benefits are available to full time workers. You work holidays but are given the choice of a float day or holiday pay.
good,Dollar General is a excellent company to work for they work with your schedule and try to give you as many hours as you like. You have to  be quick and move with fast pace and look at your surroundings really good.

good,"A typical day would be running the cash register, cashier scans items, processes payments, and bags items. It was very friendly. You interacted with a lot of people. Communicating with others would have to be my favorite part of the job."
good,"competitive"
good,clean store not many breaks. mangers don't get paid enough an are over worked however i like the work just not the pay hardest part of job was unloading trucks an having to have it stocked at fast pace
good,"My first job experience were I started as a sales associated and later became a key holder. It was here were I began to enhance bilingual skills, work skills, and management skills."
good,"Plenty of room for advancement if you apply yourself, flexible scheduling, low pay, poor benefits, multiple managers which can make job difficult at times."
good,i would start my day off by clocking in and stocking shelves. Then I would go to cash register and continue stocking shelves throughout the day. The job taught me time management. The hardest part was to deal with nasty people .
good,"Overall, I loved the job and the people. I got plenty of hours but never had time to enjoy being off. I missed my family and thought I wanted a change."
good,"my typical day would be cashier, customer service, stock, daily paperwork, deposits, resets, ordering, inventory, receiving, and scheduling, having fun with the customers"

good,Positive Workplace Great Pay and Benifits Very good leadership and managers working environment is safe and clean great place move up professionally..
good,"can be slow at times , not enough hours to survive on and management is not in sync with employees could of been ran a lot better if they had the right people"
good,"This is a simple job with great people. Management would help in any way they could if there was some sort of issue. You have regular customers, and after you're there for awhile, they treat you like family."
good,"Management is accommodating and reasonable. The work environment is ok. Overall, it is not a bad place to work, especially for a chain retail environment."
good,Truck days are tough but it keeps you busy throughout the day and makes it go by faster. I loved my team we all helped eachother. Always on your feet.
good,"Customers always come first. There is also a good balance between the employees and the duties of the employees. Also , they show great concern for safety & fairness throughout the store ."
good,A typical day at Dollar General consisted of stocking the store. One of the hardes things was trying to keep the store front looking nice. Management was always there to assist you in any way you needed.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time spent working for Dollar General, but the management culture (assistants, store managers, and even district managers) often presents poorly. Most stores are just horrible and people seem to just be there for a paycheck."
good,Loved my job..Loved people... Fast pace..So 10 hours flew by...Also was learning the repack desk work..Had my muop license...Did moves w the muop...Enjoyed that also...Also worked in noncons...And also the shipping office..Did that for a bit also...
good,This job was a great first job. I was promoted to key holder a few months after starting. Absolutely loved my job! Unfortunately had to leave due to starting college full time.
good,"Everyone I work with at my store is awesome, and so are so many of our customers. I feel like our manager really cares about us and tries to get to know us very well. It feels like a family atmosphere that includes most of our vendors."
good,"Did many different things at this company."
good,Dollar General is a place of business where people can come in and shop for cheaper things and still buy great things.I learned patience and how to deal with customers that are not satisfied with the product or sevice.
good,A lot of work for what you get paid for. I don't think corporate realizes how much the employees really do. I did really enjoy working with my in-store managers and district manager. They were all really hard workers and didn't put all of the work on the Associates.
good,This is a hard job. If you go there you will have to work and work hard. It is rewarding when you achieve things and the management does a good job reminding you of how to improve.
good,a typical day at work was very busy from the beginning of the shift and sometimes we needed more employees on the clock than what was there. I didnt really learn alot of new skills due to my employment history in the customer service retail industry.
good,"It's really like a fast workout but a constant workout everyday except the weekends, but overall it is a good job to work at."
good,"Friendly co-workers, customers, and vendors."
good,"Fun place to work, Management was easy to work with and work around other schedules that employees had.  Management was good with helping with an issue."
good,I love my job more than anything. I have a good time and it I'll succeed in my carear and I expect a normal life. My expectations are to be working everyday.
good,It was a productions jobs and you always had to be working at a certain pace no matter what. very hard to stay like that day in and day out. Never knew what time you would get off work.
good,I love everything about the experience except the pay and that you only receive 15 to 20 hours a week. Other than that it's the best job I've had in a long time.
good,"Customer interaction daily, stocking product , inventory control ongoing daily.  Setting seasonal in a timely manner and following a daily planner for productive day.   Management teams work closely and plan days schedule.  "
good,"This company is way better than Wal Mart, K Mart ect. They just need to pay their people better. If they get deeper into the grocery business they need to make sure they hire people with expertise to guide that side of the business to success."
good,I would love to work for dollar general again. I don't have any complaints. The store is always clean and spacious. Everyone always did what they were supposed to and very friendly. I'd have to say it was my favorite job I have ever had.
good,personally its a ok to work. Needs more security around the holidays to make the employees feel safe and also bring it back to the basics and remember the employees have families to and want to spend time with there family on the holidays as well. So instead on extending the hours and wasting money on labor cut the hours so the employees can have that time with there families as wells as corporate is doing with there family cause they are closes.
good,"Unless you are a store manager, this company has high turn over.  It's a typical retail employer.  The benefits are decent but not worth having with the amount one makes an hour.  Benefits are good for upper management because they make enough to afford them.  They rely heavily on CBL's which are videos you review and test on.  It saves time but you have little time to complete them when a store is given very little hours to complete the weekly responsibilities. This company is very customer orientated. If you are fortunate to work for an efficient and fair store manager, your experience will be a good one."
good,"My job requirements are to handle deposits, keeping my paperwork in order and completed weekly. Making weekly schedules, and making sure customer service is top priority."
good,"a typical day consisted of cleaning,stocking, keeping customers happy. I learned how to work in retail and make things look nice so people will buy the product.the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and making customers days better.  the hardest part was the managers not caring about their employees."
good,"Dollar General was a good place to make money. It had some great employees, but it just wasn't where I seen myself being for a long time."
good,"When everyone gets along and there is great communication between the staff and managers, the store is at its best. I've learned a lot about stuff i've never done before as this is my first job i got by my own means and it was worth it."
good,Awesome place to work lots to do plenty of room to grow in the company. only down fall with this company is the pay still start out with 7.25 and you only get a .25 cent raise every year
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was being by myself stocking shelves and staying busy"
good,This job consists of stocking shelves and cashing out customers. The hardest part of the job is getting stock put up when you have a lot of customers in your cash lane. The best part of the job is having fun coworkers.
good,I loved my job at Dollar General Market. I hated to leave. I had a family issue that needed my full undivided attention. My managers and assistant managers worked with me and my work schedule. Management team could use some work but other than that it was great.
good,"It was a good place to work, the management loved helping teach you and move you forward. The hours weren't constant and lots of call in on my days off from other employees calling in. Often worked you five days, that were four to five hour shifts, and that's it. Worked you often but for half days."
good,This store was a hard place to work in because of it being small and in an area where there was no other businesses around so there was few customer but a lot of frieght.
good,"As a sales associate, my job was to greet the customers and help them with their questions and needs and worked on the cash register and stocked items."
good,"I really enjoyed working there for the little time i was there. The people were nice, i enjoyed my coworkers and my boss was pretty cool."
good,I started out at as an entry level employee. There is always room for advancement in this company. Dollar General is a nice place to work. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
good,"Pay was not great. Did a lot more then job title. Expected to do more then what you can in a business day. They overloaded you with work, could not keep up and district manager did not care."
good,A good place to work for advancement. The neighborhood was rough to work in but I stayed professional and did my job. The company. Was a great company to work for overall.
good,"Most employees are easy to get along with, however, there can be some employees that will try to make your life difficult to make themselves look better."
good,I found myself running around like a chicken with my head cut off most the time. It was quite overwhelming but once you get the hang of things it flows a little better. Also where I worked may have just been a smaller store with less staff members. If you like staying busy then its the job for you!
good,I actually really liked my job here. I just wish they didn't have such strict policies like if your short or over two dollars you can get in trouble. That is a really crazy low number like that could easily happen.
good,Work is split evenly between employees. Everyone works just as hard as the next person. Once you know your store your job becomes even easier to put things back in place or assist customers with finding what they need.
good,"I was an assistant store manager working as a store manager. Our store manger was transferred out to a store that lost all its key holders, so I got a crash course in managing a store by myself. I had a great staff that I could rely on to help me & we made the store work."
good,"got to meet lots of different peoples. Manager was nice and friendly. Co workers were OK, some I got along with some I did not. I like that i got to met a lot of different peoples."
good,A typical workday isn't typical at all here! You are always doing something different but productive. The task given are always demanding and definitely build your skills in various ways. The hardest part of the job I would have to say would be keeping work separate from friendships. Everyone gets along so well and works so great together it's hard not to call all of your employees and co-workers your friends.
good,Not enough payroll for employees to make a decent paycheck unless you in management best for people looking for part time . Very easy job always have help if you get busy . Not very strenuous.
good,High turn over but good place to work. A good start for anyone seeking work. Long hours and good co workers to work with. Management is okay.
good,"A typical day at DG was always unexpected. One never knew who was going walk through the door and what that customer needed or wanted. "
good,I stared out as a cashier and in 1 yr was offerd the Assistant Manager position. The most enjoying part of the job was organizing other stores stock room.
good,"I worked the cash register all day"
good,The hardest part of this job was making sure customers do not steal without harassing or going against policy.  The management was sometimes pressuring us when things got hard for them.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get to interact with other customers
good,"The work is fine and fairly easy to accomplish.  The management is suspect and they have high turnover.  Pay,schedule, and benefits very good."
good,On a typical day you wouold get on the cash register to chechout coustemers or work restocking the store shelves with new products and moving old product items to the back of the store to be discontinued or marked down . On other days when a shipment came it you'd help with the unloading and checking the invoices to make sure that the items coming off the truck matched the invoice.
good,Dollar General Warehouse is a great company to work for although it has its flaws. there is no grace period for tardy. the pace that you work at is ind of stressful especially when you are being timed on your production but it doenot reflectthe work you are really doing.
good,Great place to work. If you like customer service or the retail industry then this is a good start. Hardest part of the job is getting product on the shelves while you have heavy traffic in the isles.
good,great place to work upper Management was great cared about the people and there Management team and they care about family time as well as work.
good,"I just transferred to a store closer to my home, and so far it's going pretty well. I have a great store manager, and for the most part most of my co-works are the same. I recently learned what blocking is, and my manager helped with that. I really do not have a hard part about my job, unless when I'm trying to reach the top shelves. I enjoy being a sales associate because I have the great pleasure of greeting customers and serving them when they are in need. It warms my heart to be able to put a smile on pretty much everyone that comes in the store."
good,"It was very busy talking with customer and helping co worker. i very good manager and co workers."
good,"I chose this job because I had experience in retail and it was close to home. I enjoy working with my coworkers, they are all helpful and friendly. However, my pay is too low which is why I am looking for a job with more pay. I ENJOY the everyday customers, I love helping them as much as possible."
good,"A typical day at work consists of fully stocking and inventory of store and warehouse. Customer service was at its peak, time management is well used. As a key holder I was not only in charge of the store, customers, associates, but of the money as well."
good,The review. Is good. I would be willing to challenge. This. Job i have worked with people i would be an asset to this company.
good,I loved working for Dollar General. My manager was great. She taught me a lot of new things.She was excited about teaching me how to become a supervisor.
good,"Really like working there, it is not as hard as you would think but i will say its more for people who are pasitive, and have the energy to do the job tasks. I have been employed there for 3 years and most people who dont have those things dont last. I really dont have any complaints about the company's district managers , they have been nothing but great to me."
good,i worked with this company for 2 years as a teenager. my first job! i loved it then but having children and trying to balance this type of job was stressful!
good,"Its a good place to work as a manager. It required a lot of dedication and time but was rewarding. I enjoyed the people I worked with and had the freedom to employee my own staff, and to build my own success within the company."
good,the job is a fast pace environment but yet rewarding. It allows you to be creative and yet resourceful. You are able to have great customer service.
good,"I'd get there at 6 AM, plan the day with my supervisor and start throwing freight, open the doors at 8 then return to freight until I left at 2 PM."
good,"A day of work for me is exciting. I go to work with the attitude that this day will be better then the day before. I make all my days great days, because I thank God for giving me the power to get up and enjoy the job he has provided for me. I tell all my employees thank you and how much I value them. We are a team and together we will do what it takes to make us successful."
good,"As a sales associate, I was responsible for checking people out, stocking the floor, cleaning routine and having great customer service."
good,"Overall, my work experience was good at Dollar General.  I mostly enjoyed the interaction with our customers!  We had an excellent local customer base, so we were all very familiar with each other.  "
good,All the customers loved me and asked if I was really always that happy and friendly and yes I am they also said they would come back hoping I was the cashier because the other ladies are rude. I loved unloading truck and closing the store I learned how to multitask by unloading and running register at the same time. Some co workers I loved until they hired new ones that weren't that friendly they were quite rude but I didn't let that effect my work in had to leave because I had my second child.
good,I loved how I was always active. I also liked how I was able to do different jobs instead of the same thing over and over. They had many incentives and it was enjoyable to go to work everyday.
good,"I exchanged money and debit card transactions for customers, counted register before and after shift, stocked shelves, and  cleaned up store."
good,"My days at work always went by quick. My customers were positive and I loved working with them. My coworkers were ok, and I loved my manager. The hardest part of my job was the cleaning once I got pregnant it was hard for me to do."
good,The job was very fun. I was properly trained and giving time to adjust to the time frame. The distance and location was the problem.
good,"Dollar General is a good place to go for your everyday needs, The employees arekind and will go out of their way to help you, also the store manager is sometimes able to work out deals with customers"
good,"The environment is fast paced at times and can be very hectic but my co-workers willingness to help each other makes it an enjoyable place to work. I have learned how to manage my time more proficiently. The interpersonal skills that I have gained here are invaluable. The hardest part of the job can be working face to face with customers, but it can also be the most pleasant part."
good,"I had to stock shelves and organize them as well. It was very enjoyable.It could be busy one moment and calm the next, which helped me learn how to stay calm under pressure. Overall a good working environment."
good,"Overall this was a good workplace, my manger was abusing her authority. Once cooperate was contacted and did an investigation, she was let go."
good,"my co-workers are great most of the time, "
good,Dollar General is always willing to work with your schedule if unexpected events arise.  The co-workers worked well as a team.  Everyone was helpful and willing to step up if needed.
good,"I really liked that the store was always busy with customers. There were always various tasks to complete, but it seemed that there were just not enough hours in the day to get it all done. I enjoyed working there because I love merchandising and I also love a challenge. My co-workers also worked hard and we had a good team. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the store was completely recovered and you got that ""Wow"" effect when you walked through the door. I loved it when customers would tell me that the store looked great...it was very rewarding to me."
good,"customer service, help customer find items. cash out customers"
good,Great place to work just the overheads are really py and expecting you to make everything better in a week or two. The customers are great. there is high theft in store. they expect you to work 6 to 7 days a week (which honestly the store needed it). I was there a month before being asked to step down and when I refused I was terminated. altho the sales were up and shrink was down
good,I believe working with people is the best way for you to get where you are going. I get alone with my co workers in the workplace. the hardest part of this job was when we had to pull over nights to get the store clear.
good,Much help and well represented company who takes care of their employees. Worked very well with my schedule with me going to school at the same time.
good,"A typical day at work would be, stocking product and tending to customers needs.I had to close the store which involve counting the cashiers money, making drops, and closing the store."
good,Dollar General is a great place of employment but they do not take into consideration the family of their employees. If numerous hours are needed the company will allow employees to work at other Dollar Generals if the store needs help. Dollar General will work around your schedule.
good,Store manager doesn't really know how to talk to people. Store management was a big problem why they couldn't keep anyone working.
good,They are strict on shop lifting and that's important. The regular customers are very friendly and down to earth. They need a better system to keep lines down aside from good management and clean atmosphere.
good,The overall review of my job was to stay focus on the customers that came into the workplace and be able to satisfy each person. The job title is more than what it says. The job is actually taking care of the store.
good,Working in dollar general helped me with my customer service and people skills. The hardest part of my job was trying to help an upset customer who was already at their breaking point with the company. I really enjoyed working their due to all the different people and languages that a came across with the customers.
good,Starting pay is very good but be prepard to work long hours with three split breaks ( two 30 mins and a 10 min if you work past 4:00)
good,"A typical day at work consist of scheduling, reconciliations, invoice matching and stocking. I love the environment that I work in and believe that yes I can be a manager without being hateful to my employees therefore creating an enjoyable work place with life long friends, yet we get the job done."
good,DG is a place where you are never stagnant and always changing. It is a very inviting work place. Most customers are very thoughtful and kind there and if there not you have the chance to change that and it could be as easy as saying hi.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General for the management teams starts with us reviewing the CBL to see if everyone is following company policy and procedures, Also, for training matters.Counting safe and ensuring that there is enough change for the day. Management also assign task. From that point on Managers work truck."
good,"Working for Dollar General can be fun and exhausting. You are constantly on the go. Whether you are stocking shelves, setting new planograms, or making sure that your store is neat for everyone who walks through the doors."
good,"Working management with Dollar General was interesting and fun. We had a great work crew. Everyone knew their daily duties. My favorite part of work was stocking, and setting end caps. We were expected to keep the store clean, make sure our customers were satisfied with their overall shopping experience. We made sure to keep shelves & drink coolers fully stocked. It was the most positive setting I've worked in yet. I miss those days & encourage anyone not looking for higher pay, to consider a career in retailing with Dollar General."
good,"It was alright for what it was. It wasn't to difficult and i got payed well. I got along with all my coworkers just fine, and management was decent."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General started with verification of registers, a review of the Transaction Analysis Log from the previous day and a walk through of the store . Once the store was opened, stocking, cleaning, assembly of displays and providing excellent customer service were the areas with the most focus. At the end of the day the focus shifted to recovery of the store, closing cleaning duties and preparation for the next day's business and special tasks."
good,"My job consisted of waiting on customers ,counting money, doing paperwork,ordering products,socking shelves, i enjoyed stocking and ordering and waiting on our customers we were in a rural area so basically seen the same Friendly people. . And i went to deliver money to the bank."
good,pretty straight forward guidelines for work. Great customers that can brighten your day. Strong use of customer service. Hardest part of the job was the days when the shipment comes in. Long hours of stocking shelves and doing paperwork.
good,"Responsible for order selection and stocking of material, supplies and equipment.  Assist in production and Company goals through the use of proper material handling and inventory control methods in a safe manner with quality workmanship. Insure timely receipt and disposition of component part materials by  order selection. Insure the proper and expeditious stocking of all component parts received. Material Handling and Computer data entry required."
good,"Dollar General is a great job for anyone who enjoys a fast-paced workplace. Stocking one roll-tainer per hour was a requirement at the dollar general location I worked. Friendly customers, excellent customer service and trustworthy management. They also provide awesome training videos for employees after being hired."
good,"Keeps me on my toes, I feel like I am always learning something new. The management at my store is excellent, they always perform their duties to the best of their ability and help their employees with anything they may have questions about."
good,8hour shift. Enjoyed interacting with co-workers. Had plenty of exercise when unloading trucks and stocking shelves on delivery day. All the vendors were courteous and friendly never had any altercations with them. Hardest part of the job was unloading the delivery truck with only two people makes the process slower. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and my coworkers.
good,"This was my first job where i handles money, and learned to stock. This job showed me a lot and that I love retail. I would come in some day at 0330 and unload the truck and then open at 0800 and would stay until about 1600. a typical day away from Thursday and Fridays I would cashier and stock and maintain the store since it wasnt a small store if I was closing I would retrieve carts and clean the bathrooms and floors. My co-workers were great, My manager was okay."
good,i enjoyed working here. i made bank tills everyday and filed paper work. i also helped customers with there daily transactions. my manager was a great person
good,"I loved my job. I loved to stay busy. It was hard work but I loved it. The worse part was unloading the truck on Fridays. The boxes can be very heavy. "
good,"Working at Dollar General was fun and productive. I started as a cashier and worked my way up to assistant manager and I loved my management position. However, it was a lot of responsibility, but I enjoyed it! We had to unload the trucks on Saturdays and have everything stalked on the shelves by the end of the day on Sunday. So on Sunday mornings, we would come in at 6 am and we would usually have the whole truck worked and everything put up no later than noon on Sundays. During the week, I was usually the one to open the store 2-3 days of the week and the other 2-3 days i closed the store. I really enjoyed what I did. I worked there for about a year and a half and then I ended up moving across the country to Michigan."
good,"I have been with the company for 5+ months as a Store Manager.  At times I feel like there are not enough hours in the day, as the company runs on low labor margins. I find my District Manager very enjoyable to work for, and very supportive of my success.  I have done very well with the company generally being in the top 3 in sales every week, but often work 55 hours or more a week.  I feel the company as a whole needs to bring workers in at a higher rate of pay to compensate for the low amount of employees there are.  To run on such small labor margins you must have well qualified, and dedicated staff. Compensation is reasonable for my area, but feel should be higher for the amount of both mental and physical labor you put forth.  I see the company as a good place for establishing career growth, with the opportunity to do so quickly. I do enjoy the fact I generally do not work more than one evening a week."
good,This workplace was very interesting. I had alot of fun interacting with the customers as well as my co-workers. There was always a job that had to be done and love keeping myself busy no one wants to just sit around. The co-workers that I worked with were also very rewarding and fun to work with as well.
good,Good overall work environment. Enjoy working the people I work with. Very cooperative when it comes to working around my children's schedules.
good,Dg has a good training program and you stay busy.  Our customers are very happy with our new store and our team of associates works very well together.
good,A typical day was easy usually just clock in and ask the manager where to start. I learned how to work the cash register. I have no complaints about the managers they were nice and did their job with utmost care. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the items were facing the shelves mainly due to how tiring and tedious it was. My favorite part of my job was clocking out for the day.
good,"All around a good company to work for, the hardest part of the job is making sure the shelves are fully stocked and the most enjoyable part of this job is having exactly what the customer is looking for, especially when they've already been to two or three other stores looking for the item."
good,"Responsible for customer relations and confidential file"
good,Dollar General work experience was knowledgeable. The hardest part about the job was the customer complaints. Some customers just can not be satisfied. Management was very helpful. Co-workers worked together as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was set up for the seasons.
good,I learned a lot with he registers and making schedules. The most enjoyable part about working here is the customers that you will meet. Management staff is always on top of everything that needs to be done so it is done on time
good,Came in and checked people out at the cashier.  I would also stock shelves along with cleaning the store and also counting my drawer at the end of my shift.
good,This was my first job. It was fun and exciting to meet new and different people everyday. I learned to work at a fast but efficient pace.
good,I loved working with the team members. My managers where great but the store lacks security efficient enough to stop thieves during store hours.
good,"they work with your schedule,they show you how to do something if your not sure how to do it.my co workers were great.nothing about the job was hard only because you all work together.most enjoyable for me were my customers."
good,"I really enjoyed my job and co-workers very pleasant.I held position as assistant manager and liked my job, i wanted to advance with the company and was to have the opportunity but was not properly trained by the one that held the manager position at the time."
good,Easy work. Stock what we got in on the truck. Run register. Front face merchandise. Typical retail job. Management was always great to me. Co-workers were awesome to be around. Hours weren't too good. That's practically my only complaint.
good,good jog if u do not have a lot of fiscal responcibiltys Fun work just really low pay Fun work challenging at times pretty boring at times
good,You are very busy at Dollar General. You are always doing something and you can stay busy very easily. You do at times get very rude customers and that can make it frustrating.
good,After working as a cashier for several months I quickly advanced into the management position.  Being in retail I was taught how to work I  a fast pace environment that gave me the confidence to move forward to open my own business.
good,As a store manager there wasn't anything in the store that I didn't do. I worked my way up from being a part time sales associate to becoming a store manager in about 7 months so there was room for growth it was just left up to the individual.
good,"A typical day at work at Dollar General includes running the cash register and organizing the store so that the store stays clean and manageable for the customers. All my co-workers are very friendly and always willing to lend a hand when necessary. The hardest part of the job is always trying to keep the shelves clean and organized, and the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers, and knowing the ""regulars""."
good,"always learned something new everyday "
good,"Our day at work is typically very busy.  I don't work alone though I always work with a manager or assistant manager and we all get along very well which makes me look forward to going to work no matter how much we need to do."
good,"I go to work six days a week. I  go in and first thing I do is check company emails. I do all task that the company wants done. I open the store and offer customer assistant all day. I receive in vendors. I make sure the stores pricing is set to company guidelines. I maintain inventory control and order any merchandise the store is out of, that the system did not order. I have learned to maintain my outs, so that the customer can find what they are looking for. I  have to make sure the store is set with the most current planograms. I coach and develop my staff to meet their goals. I have to make sure all employees are current and up to date with the company training. The hardest part of my job is  the lifting I have to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting a job done and working with the people I have on staff. We enjoy making our customers smile."
good,"It's generally busy, and fast paced. Being fast is a must! My manager is extremely friendly! Linda helps make the day run smoothly. The hardest part of the job would have to be, unloading the rolltainer with the cans because it takes much longer unloading than anything else."
good,Making the customer connection is great.Flexible schedules was a plus.

Cash out customers that need to be cashed out  along with stocking shelves and make sure the from is nice and neat so it looks like the customers are welcome to come and shop at the store."
good,They are very easy to get along with especially about schedules for school or military functions.
good,Good customer service job. Meet a lot of personalities which can make your customer service skills better.
good,"A typical day at work would begin at 12pm, and it'd end at 10pm, sometimes 10:30/11. The register was my post, but my duties also including unloading, restocking, and making sure all of the products were in their correct spot and facing forwards. I would also tend to any customers that needed help finding items around the store. Management was very hands off and let us work to our fullest without standing over us. I didn't interact with my coworkers as much as I interacted with customers; we never took breaks at the same time so there wasn't much room for talking unless it was a very slow day. I enjoyed talking with the customers the most. I'd get between 500 - 1000 customers on a daily basis and, even though a lot of the times it took but a few seconds to ring them up, conversations would still be made. The hardest part of the job was how late I'd get home. Aside from that everything else was fine."
good,"Like my job, but wanting a full time job. Have good management and co workers. I enjoy helping people to find what they are looking for. I am willing to re-locate."

good,I enjoyed  working there! Would highly reccomend!! :) The people I worked with were really great gals and the culture there was good. It was hectic all the time cause we were busy. But overall is a good place to work. Just not for me! :)
good,"as a cashier there's a lot more to do and everything anyone else didn't do can sometimes fall on you to finish as well. If the stores in a busy location and is always full of people then it can be hard to get everything you have to do done, unless you have a great manager who is willing to help. To me, the hardest part of the job is getting really worked up in a side task and then have to rush up front to ring someone up, then run back to the task only to run back and forth and get very little done at all. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is always when you really help someone save a little money. they're always so grateful it just warms my heart."
good,"I loved working at the Dollar General. I loved working with customers and working in a fast paced environment. I learned a lot about working in the retail industry and thought about sticking with the job for a longer period of time to advance to a higher position, but ended up getting a higher paying job."
good,"I have learned a great deal. Helping customers with locating products and any inquiries has been rewarding , although a bit challenging at times I feel it is my obligation to satisfy the customers with a pleasent experience when they come to shop."
good,"Typical customer servicing, cash out customers and stocked or restocked items."
good,"It was a great place to work. All the employees were wonderful and we all got along great. The better we got along the better the service was for our customers which kept them coming back to us. Not only were the employees great, but the benefits they offered were pretty wonderful as well. If I was still living in Indiana I would defiantly go back there to work again."
good,Typical day at work included stocking shelves and operating a cash register.  I learn various customer service skills.  Management and co-workers were great and down to earth....fun to work with.  Hardest part of the job was taking action and approaching someone suspected of stealing.

good,Open or close the store count down the drawers and do the nightly deposits finish all product stalking and unloading from the back of the store.
good,"We opened up the store clocked in on the register got my til signed in on the register. After i got set up for my customers I would stock the shelves with the merchandise and pull all the items to the front of the shelves. I already had customer service experience but i did learn how to do inventory and set up shelves for display for new products or featured products that were on sale. My management was great,  she was always willing to help us if we had a problem that we couldn't solve ourselves. She tried to be fair to all the cashiers about hours and would let me fill in for others when they called in. Very nice person to work for and enjoyed working by her side as a team player. My most enjoyable part of my job was stocking the shelves I always enjoyed making everything look nice and neat and took pride in making sure our customers had a great experience when coming in our store. The hardest part...well to be honest I didn't find anything hard if I had a problem or wasn't sure of something I would just ask my manager. She would come over and help and I would watch what she did so I would know the next time and would be able to fix the problem on my own. I can't say there is only one part I enjoyed because I enjoyed it all. I enjoy working with customers, working by myself, and as a group. i have always enjoyed working with the public and helping customers. The way I see it I want to treat them the way that I want to be treated and that is service with a smile."
good,"Dealing with customers, and their needs are important for us. "
good,"Nothing is more awesome then restocking product in the store with a melting pot of crazy fun people and managers. It was great fun, but it wasn't the job I wanted."
good,This was a great job. The hours were good. The compensations was good. Of course I would have wanted to make more. The employees were nice.

Provided leadership and assistance in training of new store team members.  Scanned and accounted for merchandise received by Vendors and Dollar General Truck.

Enjoyed my customers and the people I worked with."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General would be greeting customers, working totes(stocking), recovering at the end of the night and providing excellent customer service. I learned how to properly operate a POS system and how to recover. I love my manager, she means business but she's so uplifting and fun to work with. Co-workers are all so helpful and welcoming. None of the job is hard. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be making the customers happy."
good,Got the register till into the registers. Held a brief meeting with the employees. The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks and putting up the freight. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public

good,"I enjoyed working there, family atmosphere and you get payed once a week."
good,"A typical day consisted of cashiering, recovery of product and stocking. I've learned how to deal with costumers rather than just co-workers. The  management was friendly although very different than factory setting. My co-workers often worked as a team rather than individually like I was more accustomed too previously. The hardest part of my job was the rotating schedule and limited hours. My most enjoyable part of my job was the customer interaction."
good,"A typical day at work for me is I usually work nights so I would get there at 4p.m to 9:30p.m, I would punch in then I would start working on what ever project the morning shift was working on and didn't have time to finish, then I would do some inventory and recovery, in between all that I would cash people out and at the end of the night I will do about a hr more of recovery b4 we lock the store up at 9p.m, Then I would start sweeping the store and then moping the store. then we would punch out about 9:30p.m- 10p.m."

Management was excellent and couldn't ask for a better work experience. I am a truly hard work and can be reliable, trusted, and responsible."
good,"Overall I am pretty happy with my experience with Dollar General.  Being a 4th key, I get used as a cashier more than a manager, but it's still fun.  I know this will vary from store to store as some people hate it.  If you get a good manager, it will be pretty decent.  If you don't like your manager, transfer and grow with the company, the opportunities are there."
good,"Managing 6 to 8 co workers, cash handling, inventory control, customer service,"
good,"The manager was awesome, she helped to teach you unlike other managers ive experienced. She made sure you knew what your job was, and what you were supposed to be doing. It did seem like there were more employees than hours available, but thats understandable in aretail envirnment. Pay was around minimum wage which is also expected. the hours werent short, but werent overly long either, they were six to seven hour shifts depending on who else was there that day and what time you were assigned to come in."
good,Co managers are very helpful if you have a question The most enjoyable part is when your District Manager comes in and says you are doing a good job keep it up. The hardest part is to keep all employees focused on what they are suppose to be doing.

good,"This company was a great start to a career that i was sure i could handle doing, as well as being a single mom. I was wrong, it was hard for me to do both work and be mom.

good,"I stocked shelves and ran a register,enjoyable. I really miss the people I worked with and their is a chance for advancement here but the pay isn't that great."
good,Cashier duties as in running the register and helping customers. Cleaning at night when closing and stocking shelves during the day
good,"I got a long with the majority of the co-workers. The store manager was very good to work with/for, and was very understanding. The most difficult part as a Manager on duty was having angry customers when there were issues that only the store manager could deal with."
good,"I enjoyed working here. My managers treated you like you were family, and would do anything they could to help you out. It was very routine and a lot of hard work, but had the reward of steady hours. Then the payroll cuts happened and it was slowly declining in available hours. After about 3 months of only receving 4 - 10 hours a week i had to fing another job."
good,A typical day at work is that i had to geta machine then go to team meeting then we would go to work My co-workers were fun to work the supervisor could get own your nerves some times but hey what supervisor dont get own your nerves somtime but overall it was a fun job hard at times but fun

good,"My typical week was around 70 hours due to staffing issues."
good,"A typical day of mine included manning the cash register at all times while stocking shelves when I had no customers inside of the store. I loved working with my co-workers and loved the business itself but I believe a more suitable candidate to be a manager was much needed. He was a great guy but very young and very unprofessional, especially towards myself and the other young ladies around the store. As always though, my favorite part of the day was interacting with my customers and helping people achieve whatever they needed help with."

I got along well with all of my co-workers, and had great relations with the 'regulars' at the store site. For me, the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to be helpful to those around me."

good,I enjoyed working for Dollar General. The work is easy the schedule was flexible and enjoyed the customer interaction.
good,I learned how to associate with customers and helping them in any way needed. I also liked how I wasn't treated like a new employee once I learned the tasks I had to perform.
good,"Dollar General has established a fun, efficient working environment for their employees. Employees there looked forward to coming to work. They were highly trained in customer service with continuous training on a daily basis in problem resolution with customers, evoking a friendly, efficient, customer service driven environment. Management was like family. If an employee went to them with a problem or lacked the knowledge to carry out a job requirement, management was more than ready to train or explain in a very patient manner, what was expected or how to carry out responsibilities."

good,great atmosphere and wonderful coworkers... very safe and clean establishment.
good,"Everyday was something different. Whether it be the duties in need of being done that particular day or the experiences with the customers. The staff were all friendly, it was overall a very pleasant workplace. I learned about management skills, dealing with employees (instead of just being one). I learned a lot about myself actually, I can handle a lot more stress and workload than I originally thought I could. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the stats of the store. the most enjoyable part was actually an overall experience of the job."
good,"come in start as a cashier end stocking fun environment,hardest part is staying on your feet the whole time, most enjoyable was helping and relating to customers"
good,The Dollar General Market is a very organized and interesting place to work.
good,My job was pretty easy. I would unload the truck and stock in the mornings. Then I would hop on the register to check out customers later in the day. The customers were always great and I loved helping them find something in the store. I worked with a great group of people and the pay was pretty decent. The management really did their jobs. They weren't really friends with us but they weren't mean to us either. They would let us know when they needed us to do something and that was usually about it. Our schedule would change multiple times with it sometimes happening mid-week. It was hard to know when we worked next sometimes.
good,The job itself is very laid back and all the co workers are friendly. Company policy is really strict though.
good,I liked thepeople that I worked with. Good family orientated company.
good,It was a good experience loved tat I was busy all the time. Except
good,"A fun place to work, its a small store so all employees work as a team on a one on one basis.

Most of the time I was assiting the other cashiers, stocking, checking in vendors, assisting customers, making deposits, front facing merchandise, completing returns/exchanges. I learned a lot from working with Dollar General. When I started they were planning on moving the store to a larger location in which I learned how to do plannograms and pricing. It was a wonderful place to work!"

good,". depending of the day of the week need to finish putting out freight, recovering , sweeping and mopping store, bringing things in from outside, locking up Ice Machines at night, trying to make sure nothing is stolen,counting money, puting money in safe for am shift to take depost to bank."
good,"Customers, money, customer, money, customer, money, is how I would describe everyday in the work place. That is when I learned how to provide good customer service. The management was wonderful, they were always there for the employees when something was needed. The co-workers were fun to work around, they helped make the day go by faster. The hardest part of the job was making sure that everything was stocked and looked nice, the toy section especially. That was also the best part of the job; making everything look nice so the customer is satisfied with their shopping experience."
good,1.It was challenging and a fun workplace
good,"This is a great job for a student just graduating high school, retired person, or for summer break students... But for a single mother with three kids it doesn't actually meet the needs! A typical day of work was to first open your store, walk the store to look at your recovery from the night before and to make sure your alone. Next you were to count all your money make sure all number matched the night befores numbers open the safe retrive your deposit and then it's off to the bank. After returning and opening the store you load you registers with money sign your cashiers on and it's off to the office. Check all message and tasks on the computer to make sure every thing was up to date, if not you were to catch things up to the best of your ability, if so then if there was no new stock on the floor or in the back room to work out, you would work on overstock. After completing the stock a little recovery and cleaning before the store closed would be you next task. At closing you locked your doors, made sure your store was empty and begin pulling registers and counting money for your deposit. Once you were done and had every thing in your safe, you set your alarms and locked your doors behind you."
good,"Fun place to work, co workers are helpful and team work is always in full swing, managers are understanding and fair."

good,Loved the regulars that came in daily and my co workers. The supervisors are very understanding and willing to work with you on ANY problems that occur.

good,"The entire crew, including the manager, worked hard. The manager and key holders did not just sit in the office and do nothing, expecting the cashier or anyone else do the work. Everyone worked hard and worked together. The only reason I quit was because I was offered a better job."
good,This is a great starting out job but wages are to low for all the work you have to do. Your pay is based off a manager decision!  Customers can be rude over coupons but you have to just learn to solve it. Dollar general really is just place to experience work ethic
good,Great place to work i had a amazing drew who i was in charge of my direct manager was great very nice place to work only left because i moved only bad thing we was often under staffed
good,Overall I love this job and I loved fast food also but I'm looking to expand my experience and use what I have learned in a better career for me and be more prepared for that career.

good,"great benefits, extra digital coupons for employees, also discounts on cell phones and many other discounts on outside,just gp to DGme.Cashier work is good, fast paced with time to stock and reshop ,to keep the  store clean and neat. We have a great customers,that bring us holiday meals, donuts, different things, very nice people, it makes you feel great for being able to serve this community.There is lots of room for growth . I do feel the District Managers should pay the cashiers more compliments and call them by their name not HE,HIM, or SHE, HER."
good,Dollar general is a wonderful place to work .feel like my team is a family. I'm always learning new things .there is always opportunities for advisement.

good,"Great environment , friendly customers and fellow associates. Very fast pace work and turnover. Great company to grow and move up in. Just wanted more opportunity"
good,Good place to work and it is very busy. If you like a fast paced environment this would be a good place for you.  You ned to be able to lift about 50 lbs at times.
good,Like most companies they have pros and cons if you  get a good manager it's a good place to be. As a manager the job is great with the right team great things can be achieved
good,Easy job to have as long you are willing to put in effort . You work alone alot and always have something to do. You never get enough payroll but what you do have you need to learn how to make the most of it with great employees.
good,"I learned how to "
good,There were days when customers were rude and days were I had my bad days but an overall success I never let my bad days interfere with my working with customers
good,At time time I worked at Dollar General we had the best boss but as of now shes still there. But overall it was a nice family friendly store. Question is would I go back? Yes I would
good,"Dollar general is a very good place to work. The work is some time hard but only if you make it hard. The people that work at dollar general are very caring people if you need help with something they well stop to help. so if there is someone that would like to work at Dollar General, it is a great place to work."
good,"Great starter job, fun work environment. Enjoyed working there quite a bit, managers were super helpful and a joy to be around, any questions or concerns I had were answered perfectly."
good,I enjoyed working for the company and succeeding of the chain I would love to come back to the company and get the opportunity to to re-focus on my career and the opportunity to succeed higher in the company I would like to have the opportunity
good,"Decent place to work also met some of the greatest people but pay is still minimum wage . "
good,Good company to work for but low pay and have to do alot of work the whole time you on your shift for little pay. You have to very patience working for dollar general
good,Stays pretty busy so the work day goes by pretty fast and the people you work with are always willing to help you  find the things you are looking for
good,It was great experience just wasn’t enough hours for me to stay so I had to find another job with more hours and that didn’t really work for me. So I kinda just been searching.
good,I did enjoy working at Dollar general it was fun and enjoyable just interacting with the customers always made me happy. Just a normal day of working as a cashier and sometimes in between downtime stocking did take place.
good,"I love working with them jus not enough hours for the money they pay. "
good,"Well, I actually miss my customers,  the children the elderly,  I just loved it. BUT. Dollar General executives, come and go. Like General managers, any problem I've had, I quit , they get fired later. They do like to clean house allot, great company if u are young and staring out."
good,Hardest part of the job was getting off the clock when you were assigned those hours only because the labor was high. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers come into a clean store and leave satisfied. I also enjoyed the fact that small things like that will make your sales sky rocket!
good,"The management was good, however I think they were a little short staffed.  I had a good time working with the customers and the management. A day a work would go by very quickly with the fast pace."
good,I only worked at Dollar General for one summer. My time spent there however i got to work with everybody on staff multiple times a week and formed relationships. All the coworkers were very nice and understanding to/of each other. Everyone was willing to help any way possible to better the work environment.
good,"I learn more about position and knowledge on talking about items. To customers also, learning the location of the items through the manager. Love the family of Dollar General"
good,It was fun and I learned a lot. The only reason I left was because I moved to Atlanta. I was mostly stocking and unloading rotianers and u-boats. I was on the register here and there . I loved working here everyone was nice and we had lots of fun
good,Dollar General offers the time and hours I  am interested in working at this time. I have retired working full time and am looking for basically  a part time job for extra income at this time.
good,"This location had a great staff that always helped one another."
good,I guess it depends on the store that you get and the environment that each store has some stores are wonderful to work for in work.  are some that are not ... customer service is a priority and you only have two members at one time unless it's truck day and you can have up to 4 team mates to put out truck.. you can get frustrated because you want to get everything done and they just don't have the hours to give to get it all done
good,I loved working there for my first job.  The hours were good for my school schedule and the managers were nice.  I learned about inventory and merchandising as well.
good,my experience here characterized of a flexible work environment.this was a great environment where i enhanced on many skills on the job.management was understanding and with a culture to listen .General workplace culture was positive with a great team spirit.the hardest part of the job was to enabling people to embrace new ideas .overall it was a great success as effort yielded a motivated collaborative team .it was an awesome experience.
good,Interaction with customers daily. Each day feels unique. Connection with customers can grow. Each day at work gives a sense of purpose. Helping customers is a highlight if the day. Dollar General is family friendly and dedicated to customer service.
good,On a typical work day we were pushed to do better and at the same time maintain a safe work environment. All of the machine operators got along very well and communicated with one another. Management always commended those who did a great job and pushed those who they knew had the potential. I think the hardest part of the job was getting used to working overnight. The most enjoyable part I would have to say is how close the operators were.
good,The store was very busy and made my day go by fast. Each day consisted of something different which was a good way for me to learn new task within my role.
good,Love meeting new people and have that connection with them and help them find any product that they are looking for and sometimes you will see the same people.
good,"There are issues with a disconnection between corporate and the store, but working in the store is really great with a good manager and a good team. But, your gotta make yourself an asset. Remember that customers are your paycheck and you always make the customer your number one priority."
good,My only complaint was being understaffed so there was more to cram into a shift and constantly being asked to do over time (because of being understaffed). Large possibility of advancement. Constantly being praised and appreciated.
good,"Loved my job, loved my co+workers and loved my boss  I hated that I had to quit,  wish I had had the oppurinity to put in a notice which would have allowed me to re-apply"
good,"Worked for this company for months without calling in, was unable to get to work due to my car being repaired. was told I was fired after two days in the shop because the Store Manager had to cover my shift due to the crew having multiple people without proper availability."
good,"I loved this job, it was just that the pay made it impossible to work there. I took the same job at walmart, making almost 3 dollars more and hour. Like i said though, the job itself was enjoyable."
good,The dollar general is a great job for someone who maybe just got out of highschool or something like that. It was a slow paced job and wasnt very much to do.
good,"The work environment was enjoyable, on truck days things could be a bit more challenging but was helpful in learning new skills. Taking care of customers could be very pleasemt or not so much but knowing how to properly handle situations was very helpful"
good,Nice working environment it wasn't to bad I like it enjoyed most days but some customers can be rude and there was a lot if shrinkage stealage n robbery going on my assistant manager got stabbed in the back stock room so.wine broke in and was stealing loading a truck full of merchandise she got caught and put in harm's way kinda dangerous job night shift especially need an on sight police officer in store!!!
good,I loved working here. I got to help people and keep busy. It was a great work experience. They were nice and really helpful. I enjoyed my time and they worked with me while I was pregnant
good,Store was good. I use to shop there allot so I say why not work. Management was ok. Could have been better. Still was ok. My customers was happy with my customer service. They made my day
good,"Overall good company that provides quality products for a lower price."
good,"A typical is interesting would like more hours. Staff is good to work, I Enjoy working with customers and I am a part employee but would like to be a full time employee"
good,Dollar general was nice. I was lead key. Management Was good. So long as the store was picked up and I had no truck on the floor to where people can't get through.
good,"Great place to work!  Once you become a cross trained associate, your job role will vary either by the day or, by the shift.  Lots of catered meals for awards and employee centered activities outside of work for your family."
good,Greet place to work starting out To getting to know the basics of working and how a company runs. Would highly recommend it to someone to work there as a first job.
good,"I had a good boss he was very understanding. The location was good. The work wasn’t so hard, just have to be fast with assisting customers and on the register."
good,It was defiantly a good placeto work as maybe an introduction to the workplace but there were not to many advancement opportunities. I would recommend as a first job
good,Trains you properly gives you the time needed to adjust.its a good paced and friendly environment to work in.they make sure employes have a safe and friendly work environment.
good,"I started out just wanting extra money, and now I'm the assistant manager working full time. I love my job. It has a lot of career options if you want to keep moving up."
good,Good people to be around stranders needing helps but still to positive with not knowing you be constantly seeing you serve them with a smile and sense of humor
good,"Dollar general was a good place to work I started off as a cashier the moved up to a key holder then with in a few months I was asstaiant manager,  great for moving g up in the company"
good,"I enjoyed working there, sometimes I wish I did not leave. After having issues with the manager I decided to leave. It wasn't hard to work there just have to make sure you are fast."
good,typical day at work was starting my day good i learned many things about people management was great good workplace culture most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many people
good,I was able to move up very quickly. Dollar General has allowed me to meet new people through great customer service. Most of the people hired are outgoing.
good,I loved stocking this store an working there at first. Then once new people came in a started taken over things changed and others got blamed instead of the real person like me i got blamed for a ladder being left out when i didnt even work on the food side that night and they wouldnt pull the cameras.
good,I liked recovering the store and organizing everything. I liked talking to customers because I’m just a people person. It was an overall great experience to be an employee here.
good,"A pleasnt enough place to work, managers are easy to talk to, and will work with you. Plenty to do, you will never be bored. The store is also easy to navigate."
good,"Loved working at this DG, loved my customers and my employees. Management wasn't every good. In my opinion management should be trained more.. Other than a few cons DG is a great place of employment."
good,"My job was pretty cool I lied helping the customers. Really the customers is who make my day go by fast."
good,I became a Store Manager 1 day to the year of working for Dollar General.  If you work hard Dollar general can be a rewarding job. You must know how to manage people and stock.
good,Dollar General is a great place to work. I love to work with the people there as they are very friendly and helpful in their assistance with helping me find products that I am unaware of their respective locations. Much of the customers who come in are very friendly and amicable as well.
good,I love my job friendly employee staff a fun place to work.Managers make  it fun.You  can learn everything  about the company. I love it. I love it. I love it
good,"I enjoyed working there, I do feel that I did not get the training that I needed from the store manager (whom had only been store manager for about 2 months). There was a lot she did not know herself. Her and I worked as a team and I really enjoyed working there."
good,"Great experience. but left to seek  better pay for my family. great opportunity, but i didnt like working every holiday , with the exception of Christmas."
good,Dollar General is a good work place with plenty of opportunities for advancement and hours. Work environment varies form locations to location. Dollar General also offers multiple benefits for full time employees.
good,Loved seeing filmiar faces while checking people out. My old co-workers are so nice and help me with customers even if they were busy doing something.
good,"This is graet company to work for and get on your feet, the pay is the worst part I would say and sometime the management, but other than that it's great"
good,"Dollar General in Jefferson City is a cool job. Very chill due to the slow business, but just enough to keep you busy for your whope shift. Overall im happy with my choice in Dollar General."
good,"Like working there, don't go by hand book on all thing"
good,It was a great job and very easy. The working schedule is flexible for all employees. You will have busy days. Throughout the week it is not all that busy.
good,"Typical day at Dollar General, operating the till. Re-stocking and re-setting shelves. Cleaning. Receiving truck. Taking inventory. Receiving provisions."
good,Dollar General offered an easily adaptable work environment. Being an employee at Dollar General allowed opportunities for communication development and growth. Also due to multiple duties expected of their employees time management is gained.
good,"Everyone I worked with cared about one another on a personal level. I doubt I can find another job with the same sense of comradery. The pay was average, but for the fairly lax amount of work to be done, it was worth it in the end. No benefits or regular paid vacations, so I wouldn't suggest it for a super long-term job."
good,"Typical day before we opened would be to count the drawer and get everything set up inside and outside of the store. Clean up and restock shelves in between helper customers. Management was flexible and great at communicating. I learned customer service, how to handle money and got better at working in teams."
good,Working retail is a very unique experience but it also has its rewards of caring for and about your customers a small thing can make a very big difference in someone’s life
good,Dollar General is a work environment where you can always keep busy. The employees are very welcoming and helpful when it comes to needing assistance during your shift.
good,"My review on this job is I love and dislike it, the people I work with are very caring and understandable. The manager is very nice and very outgoing with your needs and wants but she does expect you to get the job done!"
good,You are on your feet all day and there is no downtime.  You are working from the time you clock in until you go home.  Its not a job for someone who can't stand or squat.
good,Working at Dollar General was a good experience. I have worked at two different locations and I have no complaints. Both of my bosses were very easy to get along with and worked with me if I ever needed to change my schedule.
good,"I loved that job so much. Wasent standing in one place. There was always something to get done. Everyone was so nice and the employees were great to work with. Stocking,truck,cashier and tidy up. It was great"
good,"I like what I do, I get along with the customers and the employees. My boss is hostile and I go into work in defense mode and it is not worth it. I am hoping to get another job that is a better work environment."
good,I learned a lot about being a supervisor. Since it was a smaller store I learned how to receive shipments. How to take product from vendors. Also how to maintain a safe and happy work environment.
good,I had great hours good pay great people to work with i really enjoyed working there. The manager was very reasonable with my schedule because I have 2 younger children
good,Dollar General is a good place to work the management at my store is great we have a good bunch of workers they offer good work hours and have benefits Along the way also
good,Wasn't bad to work. People were friendly. Enjoyed the customers. Easy to figure out were things go. Other employees were nice. Worked around your schedule.
good,An awesome opportunity for advancement and really good benefits plus time off. They have a great culture within the company and strive for better year after year
good,I love this job because manager and assistant manager were nice and its a challenge. I learned to multitask within this job. I would recommend it to family and friends.
good,If you’re looking for a part time job then it’s a great place to work. It’s mostly a minimum wage job unless you are a manager/ key holder. Management for the most part is pretty great. Customers are the worst part of the job.
good,It is a pretty good company to work for. Much room for advancement and plenty of training opportunities. Very hands on and not too hard of a job. Benefits are fairly decent.
good,"You keep busy with cashing out customers, answering questions and inquiries. Stock shelves and clean the store. You become familiar with repeat customers and those that go in quite requently."
good,I enjoy my job.  My boss is super caring and a lot of fun. As long as you do your job she will work hard to help you anyway she can.  My only complaint is I think the pay could be better.
good,I like to stock shelves and help the customers find what they are looking for.   I like to check out the customers.  everyone I work with is enjoyable.
good,Cool place flexible hours able to relocate great prices seasonal items I had a good time working there I had a great manager and great co workers !!!!!!
good,"fast-paced environment with lots of friendly faces, I absolutely loved working with the customers and helping them. The management is not the best but worth working for."
good,I would say the hardest part of the job is having to call the law whwn you catch someone stealing feom ur store. And when you have to write up your coworkers because they haven't been doing there jobs or basically refusing to do what they are supposed to be doing.
good,"In management they expect you to do everything the store manager does with out the title or higher pay, your held accountable for the store managers job and if others aren't doing their job including the store manager, the store manager dumps it off on her managers to not get in trouble with the district mananger.. leading to write ups that wasn't your fault. Their manangement systems are crooked and faultyareIts crooked and faulty!!"
good,"It is a okay place to go to work, nothing more, low pay and the pace is okay, nothing stressful about it. Don’t worry about getting your stuff done, there is always the next time"
good,The managment was professional and helpful. The job its self was very simple and had plenty of hours. The staff were very kind and productive. I enjoyed the job and staff.
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone whonlobes customer service and learning new things, they take the time to explain things to you if you do not understand."
good,OI enjoy my job until I started working at kcmo store and we go a new manager and he did like me. He used a something that went on in the back of the store. To get me fired.
good,"Dollar general was great, I did travel and help set up other stores. I learned how to manage my time and had great people to work with. However, while I was gone helping set up other stores, I was blamed for employees working off the clock, which I had no ideal. So therefore, I had a problem with their appeal system."
good,It was a very easy job. I knew how to do everything there. The customers had made things even more fun for me to work there. The only bad part was depending on how I would work with during the day or night.
good,It was an Excellent Experience. I was working 2 jobs at the time enjoyed both of them. Being a key holder came with a lot of responsibility but it was a great experience into management.
good,Working at Dollar general started out good. The hours worked great with my home life and my kids. Unfortunately there was a huge turnover on store managers. (9 in my 3 years) because of this my schedule was constantly being changed around and I wasn't treated like how an employee of 3 years should be treated.
good,I enjoyed working there had great hours. Staff and management was friendly and helpful. We all worked as a great team. If I could find another job at Dollar general I would do it again.
good,It's a good company. But the pay isn't all there. People who apply get minimum wage for the work this company has it's not worth the pay. I'm sorry but we can pay more some of these stores are just to the ground.
good,Enjoyed working at Dollar General and it was close to home but sometimes the stress could get worse. I enjoyed working with the people I was scheduled to work with.
good,"The pay is goid. Is a real fiscal job, lift pull, walk all day and drive equipment. Good coworker's, friendly environment. Helpful management, meeting regularly, opportunity for grow"
good,"I have loved my time with dollar genreal, it has taught me so much. it's a great company that's growing fast and provides jobs in so many areas. Also a good place for a first job"
good,"I had no problem at the Dollar store, I worked there and went to college at the same time until I was not able to go to college anymore. We stayed pretty busy."
good,"Dollar General, is a fast promoting company and see things that no one else sees in their employees. They like to promote within the company, and the look outside for associates."
good,It was a good job just had poor management. The manager didn't always want to do her job. Most of the time it was up to me and the other assistant manager to get everything handled.
good,"It was fast-paced, i enjoyed my time there. the other associates were pretty decent. i enjoyed working with them. i learned a lot from other associates."
good,Many duties as manager  but the outcome is great have a great team and it can be a career for some is very awarding but you must keep up with the task giving
good,I teally enjoy the job and would suggest applying so long as your able to perform and multitask. Not a job to be a slacker and must be on your toes when it comes to thief.
good,I had a very good experience as an employee with this company.  I was promoted from within from a temporary employee to permanent. This a  solid company to work for.
good,The environment was very relaxed but there were still goals that needed to be accomplished by the end of your shift. The staff was easy-going with excellent managers.
good,I became friends with a lot of the customers that came into the store. Had a good standing with the manager. Loved throwing freight and helping the customers shop.
good,"Dollar General was a great place to work, like all places it too had its drama. But I quickly fit and made lots of friends and lots of memories most of the time it didn't feel like I was working, it was like hanging out with friends and being able to help people all at the same time. I would have to say my most favorite part about that job, was the fact that I got to travel and meet new people and do new things at different stores."
good,well i hoped will a great  to have and i am good with people  and staff always want to do my very best work never know to stop work on my task at hand thank for your time you like this
good,"I really like it , but I have to pay for school. It's not really helping me. it's a good environment to be in. I wouldn't change it for nothing in the world."
good,Working for dollar general is good. It’s a friendly environment and creates great opportunities. It’s a good start for younger people that are in high school as well.
good,Just opening the store putting the draw in register.  Making sure all tags are up where they supposed to be. Help customers find the items they want and see if i can help them with anything
good,"Very well attended to,nice greetings on entry, great supply of products, from Auto to a freezer foods, cleaning public restroom,and it very easy to get an product exchange."
good,A typical day would be first getting my till out of the safe and counting it to make sure the right amount was in it to start with.  Then putting it on of the cash registers.  Wait on customers to come into the store and greet them as they came in the store.  Cash them out when they were done doing their shopping.  I would clean the front of the store when the store was slow.
good,"Nice place to work , good pay, good employees I would good backing if I could I would recommend it to anyone who wants a job and a long time one with benefits"
good,"there are a lot of stores in my area and have a lot of opportunities. I received a promotion just my second day on the job, though I didn't take it since a had a second job. You'll work part-time until you take on a management position. Pay's not that good."
good,"I truly enjoyed my job, staff and customers. My manager on the other hand was less then desirable. She was never there, never called in. Everyone assumed i was the manager bc I did my hours plus hers and she paid me cash under the table. I told the GM and nothing was done about it. The employee rate was horrible. No one could stand to work under her. When she was there, 99% of the time she sat in the office. She would mark stuff on the computer as completed (etc. Changing shelf displays) when she never did them.  People would not take a break bc it was busy. She would go into the time cards and change it so they had a break and much more."
good,I worked as a cashier so I made sure I provided customer care. I Stocked and made sure to store was ready for customers. I made sure store was clean and tidy.
good,Good job . Left because I moved out of the state. Would like to work there again   wish they would give more hours to the employees. But would love the chance to work with them again
good,"I was A Dollar General Store Manager,for 6 years , I changed a store that was in shambles to one of the top 10 selling stores in the district, Working there was like having another family, everyone got along and we had fun working together. Everyday there was something to do, As a manager you was always busy, with confenerce calls, and meetings and helping people find jobs."

good,"My 3 Years at DG were great! Pay was LOW, BUT I enjoyed my Job! My Manager was a Great Man, Very Flexible and knew All his Staff personally! "
good,"The ability to motivate an entire group to strive toward a specific goal is a major part of what makes a good manager. Enhancing a team's strengths and improving upon their weaknesses is how a manager demonstrates their leadership. They use fun, engaging activities to keep everyone motivated and boost team morale."
good,I think that over the course of my time there I have had my good days my hectic days and my u know manageable days but i guess in the end its worth it cause they all about team Dollar General and If you're not on  it they will get u on cause I think they generally care about they workers and That I have noticed. I think the overall management  is great but depending on who u have and where u are located . This isn't a job for lazy folk I would say that cause u have to be ready for call ins and outs of others and also what changes hourly wise. Other than that u should be fine the back breaking work gets me irritating but it builds character so .
good,"I worked for dollar general from 2016 to 2019 .I enjoyed my job but wasn't enough money l was always struggling financially,so I took another job very good pay but didn't work out for me , now I'm unemployed and wish I would have stayed ."
good,"All and all was a good career, didnt have to many issues. I just felt that I wasnt getting paid enough for what I had to deal with at that specific store."
good,"I love to work it was just hard to find employees in that area . I just wish that we had more employees and more time to get things done in our stores. I had the ability to meet new people that were wonderful and some that stole from me but I think some learned there lesson and some just didn't I was . I was by myself a lot in the store so i would have to run register and run the store, I was my  own loss prevention. I loved my job and hope to find another management job soon"
good,"Low pay. Not enough hours,asked for more hours after a couple of months was told no because they didn't like to pay benefits,tried to stay longer but job could not meet my needs"
good,DG has job security and vast opportunities if one is willing to relocate. There are 16 DC's around the country with jobs for everyone. Pay is good also.
good,I was able show my team that I would never ask them do something in the store that I wasn't willing to do myself.  I always tried to show my team  I was willing to work just as hard as they work.. it's all about teamwork..
good,Dollar general is a job that woeful be great for someone who is looking to just make some money while in school or to have a second job that fits the work hours of another job

good,"Fast paced place to work always more to do than time to get it completed.Great place for an entrepreneurial spirit.Very little direct supervision, just an occasional visit to make sure you are following the program"
good,"It was a lot of doing the same thing on the same day of he week each week, so its kind of repetitive but the customers were nice always caring, sweet. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely working with the customers I love helping people."
good,"Good company to work for, had an awesome manager who was flexible with everything. Worked with awesome people, learned alot about customer service and retail."
good,only worked here for a month so I don't have much of a review. In the time I did work there it was ok. You must be able to handle difficult customers because you will have them.
good,long hours not very much staff I managed the place in the evenings and I was alone many nights I was uncomfortable here but made it work people were awesome and Customers were great.
good,"Working at Dollar General was okay.  It is defiantly a job for first timers or young people.  The job itself was not that hard.  Being store manager was kind of tough because sometimes you could not count on your employees, with them being young that comes with the territory."

good,I loved working for this company in general. I had to leave because I felt I was treated unfairly by the higher up management and didn't get to show my full potential. Was spoken down to and just made to feel like nothing I did was ever going to be good enough by her even when I went above and beyond my job.
good,"It was a very busy store. So you stayed active the entire time you was there. I like that because its boring if there is not a lot going on and it makes it feel like time slows down. I liked the management they always seem to work with you. The people I worked with was really nice to. Sometimes they would pick me up for work or take me home until I got a car. I learned how to read plan-a-grams and reset merchandise, I learned how to do price reductions. The hardest part of the job was getting the stuff done that was supposed to be accomplished in between customers, before the end of the night. The store stayed so busy it was almost impossible. You usually had to wait until the end of the night when the store closed to get it done. I wouldn't have minded that but they didn't want you going over your schedule time. I liked the job because I enjoyed the people I worked, and I enjoyed the customers."

good,A place where you are part of an awesome team. A place where you can use all your skills. You work along side some awesome people who are always giving there best to make the business awesome.
good,"A typical day would depend on whether I worked day or evening shift. If I worked the day shift I would have to stock whatever was in the storeroom. We were allowed a 1 hr. lunch break. If I worked the evening shift I was a cashier. During my shift I had to make sure the shelves were presentable for the next day as far as bringing everything forward on the shelf or stocking what was left from the day shift. Upon closing I had to sweep/mop the floor and clean the restrooms. After the doors were locked I had to count my drawer to be sure it added up with the receipts. It taught me how to be more efficient. I dealt with a few managers, but all in all they were okay. The workplace was very presentable. I didn't have any problems with any of my co-workers. The hardest part was the cleaning up at closing time, but I did enjoy the atmosphere."

Management was good and I was headed to an Assistant Manager job until college came and I needed to go back. The workplace was very comfortable. The hardest part was unloading the trucks. The most enjoyable part was getting to know your customers because I enjoy learning about people and most customers loved ""the tall guy behind the register."""

good,"Have morning meeting and mandatory stretch, then go out to my lane and get it set up for the day. Once product starts to come I would separate product into different rolltainers based on what it is as in chemical or food. Once rolltainers are filled up I would push them inside the freight, then I would place larger boxes on top and would strap the rolltainers down.

good,"After clocking in begin to manage the register and assist customers in any way possible. If no customer is in line recover the store by pulling items forward or stacking them so that there is little to no empty room on the shelves, but also following the stickers instructions as to how many are to be facing the front. If truck has arrived recently restock the shelves, putting items in their correct places and removing all items past their expiration date. At the end of the night the store is to be dust mopped and all trash from inside and outside the building is to be taken out of their bins and put into the specified dumpster."

There was't all ways good day some of the days got hard, working short handed and having to try to be 4 people at 1 time. The best thing I like going to work for was the Elderly customers that I met on a daily bases.The work load is hard because you had to do it all pretty much, unload ,cashier,stock, and wait on customers. Over all it was a good learning experience."
good,"It was a good place to work. The environment was great, the employees were fun to be around. The District Manager is the only problem. He had some kind of vendetta against me and no one understood why. I had to close the store early, to rush to get to my son because he had hurt himself. I showed him proof, and he had the store manager fire me and I never had previous write ups. Other than that, the job was great."

good,dollar general is a good place to start if you need a little extra cash. The job becomes grueling when you have to move from one area to another hastily to satisfy customers. for example cashiers may also double as stokers so you may have to leave the cash registers when there aren't any customers to stock - this could continue back and forth all day. but its a good entry level job.

good,"Overall this was an enjoyable, good work environment. Work was distributed evenly among employees. All employees worked as a team, got along, and the work was always done. Management at the time I was employed was terrible but that is an issue that has been resolved."
good,"Great people to work with."
good,I love working for this company because they really involve their employees in the company. working here is a team effort and the staff is always willing to promote and train you.
good,I really enjoy interacting with and assisting customers. Also working with employees. The workplace structure is on a scale of 1 to 10 is a five or six.
good,this is a very fast paced environment. i have seen good stores and bad ones. it all comes down to the management and the type of people that they hire. i would still recommend it as a place to work
good,this was an ok place to work dealt with several different district managers in the few years that I was there. Had a lot of workers pay was also not that great.
good,A typical day is very hectic and if you can't handle a busy environment or always having something to do then this isn't the job for you. The most enjoyable part is the customers but it is a very fast-paced job. I was part of management and yes we are stressed out but very friendly and very welcoming into the store. The hardest part of the job was being able to get everything done in a timely manner.
good,"I learned a lot and caught on quickly to everything I was taught. I advanced quickly with this company and within six months went into a management position. I took management further away then was moved again further away which then once winter came didn't work for me was suppose to move back to one by my house, but never happened."
good,great job and pay great down side is working 12 hours alot but great people . start as a picker and after 90 day amd can switch postions so not tht bad
good,The company itself isnt bad. sometimes they hire managers who dont know how to keep up on the store but the customers are decent and so are the hourly employees
good,It's a  good starter job. Very nice place to work if you have the right crew. DM is a good man and so is lost prevention. The store manager was ok before she stepped down.
good,I loved dollar general i loved seeing all my regular customers everyday. The customers we great the company is great i love there products as well. Had SOME busy daysbut most partit was fun.
good,"Very busy pace, many different customers, different learning experiences, different learning equipment and  just different environment of work and details"
good,Fast paced. Productive and great place of work. Well managed. Great work environment to keep you on your feet. Excellent way to meet new faces and become more social.
good,"Working for Dollar general was very helpful in my life it taught me about leadership, team work and a very good listener. As an assi. manager I had be on top of everything I was in charge of my crew making sure merchandise was stock and store well kept."
good,appilcation was hard to complete for redirecting. completed app but had issues with completing i enjoyed the companies i worked for but i am looking for a change due to changes in my situation
good,"Fast pace, great staff to work with, also have a few regulars, it is a quick learning job, easy but you must be willing to work to make it easy with your fellow associates"
good,"Working with Dollar General at store level is simple. Its easy to understand however there is a lot of work that needs to be done. Like most corporate companies, they are money grubbing. They want to hire more people than needed so that each employee gets as few hours as they can so that way they do not have to pay any one person too much. They expect a lot of work to be done in a minimal amount of time. It is reasonable, to an extent, but often it is not. However, working up into the company is fairly easy. The turnover rate is so big, if you just stay with the company, they are likely to ask if you'd like a promotion."
good,On a typical work a day at DG was good until you got their and seen how big the run was. I learned a lot at DG. the management I had was awesome. the hardest part was trying to get a big batch done in 8 hours. the most enjoyable part was just going to work and having fun
good,A typical day at work for me is amazing cause you see the same people almost all the time and you meet new people I learned a lot of different things I know how to get my work down on time and sometimes early management was amazing and always understanding the hardest part of my job is picking up other slack but hey what can you say Team work is dream work we work together it gets done
good,"Had an extremely good assistant manager, however due to a contagious illness was no longer able to work. The business's best interest was to replace me because the store was so small they could not allow a full time associate to be off. Completely understandable"
good,"The work was easy overall. The off loading of the truck was the hardest part of my job. Some of the cases were heavy, i stocked the shelves  and fronted them. Waited on customers. U could advance in this job."
good,The work in a typical day was fast-paced and enjoyable. I learned communication and customer service skills that will help in the future. I also developed an excellent work ethic.
good,Dollar general is over all a good company. They respected my family issues. Also I returned received adequate training with the ability to grow within the company.
good,"Dollar General is a strong thriving company, who gives their associates an opportunity to be successful by promoting within the company. They also have great healthcare benefits."
good,The customers made my day. Sometimes when it got busy they understood it was not my fault! The employees were nice! And overall was a awesome place to work!
good,"When I was employed there, it was a fun friendly atmosphere to work in. The co workers were really nice and the manager was nice and flexible to work with."
good,Fun work place and great experience to work at. Their training was very easy and informative. I enjoyed my time working with and for them. I would definitely recommend this job to my friends and family.
good,"In a typical day depending on how busy you are you would be required to run a register, put up stock, reset shelves, assist customers, do paperwork and clean."
good,"fasta paced but fun to work with people, there is a lot of work but managers are always willing to help. i liked the job at dollar general because it helps you build good communication and people skills"
good,"Dollar General was a good place to work.The job itself is demanding and no support from dm.I left this company because i was robbed two times in 3 months,last time at gun point."
good,A typical day for me would be running the register at the same time as unloading and loading the truck. My job is to make sure everyone is happy and to have everything on the shelf and neat and straightened. The hardest part of the job is probably working by myself and trying to run register at the same time as unloading the truck. the most enjoying part of the job is getting to interact with the customers on a daily basis. All the customers are nice and if you have been there for a while they will socialize with you and make you feel like family.
good,Great place to work with great employees who give great customer services. We love our job. I would recommend anyone to work here and I bet they love it . It is the best.
good,I enjoyed working for dollar general. A great learning experience working as a cashier and stock products. If I could work for them again I would. Fun
good,Great atmosphere we had great people working there fun place when we weren't to busy I loved working here. You get to see nascar stuff that was interesting.
good,The job teaches you alot about products being sold. You learn alot about couponing and how to do planograms. You have s chance to advance in the job. Hours are not set.
good,"Knowledgeable Sales Clerk able to adapt to new product."
good,"Plain and simple as the title suggests. If you bring to each shift, it does not go unrecognized. Advancement opportunity is there if you work hard. Great place to work!"
good,My experience with the company was short lived because they just stopped scheduling me they did not fire me but I was forced to look for another job because they would not put me on the schedule after I moved to a store closer to my home. Disappointed.
good,"The job was excellent. I have nothing bad to say about the work. Their wasn't very much chance for advancement even if you knew how to do everything in the store. As for a minimum wage job, I don't regret it one bit. It has been a pleasure overall."
good,I loved working with the customers and making the store look nice and well organized. Everyone worked well as a team and as individuals. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck.
good,"Basic retail job, lots of screaming customers, fast paced, but very good management. I seemingly enjoyed talking to the customers and making them smile with a happy purchase and helping them find what they need. Hardest part of the job is returns, so many returns. Customers will often buy something, realize they don't need it, and then try to return it without the receipt. Manager won't allow a return and the cashier is then blamed for all the trouble."
good,"As an employee of dollar general i would par take in adjusting price changes and items, storage of correct items in the correct loation."
good,I enjoyed working with my team at this store they always make you feel welcome even on bad days I was head cashier also cleaned bathrooms and made sure the front end was well taking care of
good,"Depending on the store, and management, this can be a very awesome place to work. Of course liking working in retail is key. The ""hardest"" part of the job would probably be putting away some of the truck. And that would be only because some things are pretty heavy. If you enjoy retail. Give DG a try."
good,"It was a good place to work at. But not enough hours because of being in college."
good,"Responsible for ordering, receiving, opening, storing and replenishing the supplies and merchandise of the store"
good,It was friendly and casual but I didn't get enough hours but the staff was very helpful if I needed a ride home the manager went out her way to help me
good,The hours were long. the stores were unorganized. i met alot of great people. the pay was ok but not enough to make a decent living. its an ok job if you like retail
good,"Decent place to work.  I f you go to work with a positive attitude"
good,"A typical work day would include greeting and waiting on customers and if you were not waiting on customers, you needed to be stocking."
good,I enjoyed working for the co. the customers where great. My hours where stable but did change at times. I learned a lot about Being a Manager on Duty which included closing the store making suree all was secure and safe.
good,It was a fun job . I learned alot. Training could of been better and more detailed. I would of liked to have more training before my store manager went on vacation. It was hard to do a good job because the training was rushed and there was alot that wasn't done before hand. Overall I did the best I could and it all worked out fine!
good,"Supervising entry-level employees, assisting in the hiring process, overseeing retail operations, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Answering telephones, setting schedules, and communicating with Dollar General corporate offices. Training, audio, visual, and verbal orientation."
good,"some times too many hours spent at work and not enough spent with family, but i knew what i was signing up for and suckling it up and moving on was the theme of the year, but extra time spent at the store made me a better and more well rounded individual"
good,Everyday seemed to be very stress free. There were always tasks to be done but the tasks were only considered to be time consuming rather than difficult.
good,"Good company. The manager is amazing. You enjoy life more, that's for sure. Relaxed environment. Returning customers; just we wish could catch those who rob the store blind, (which always happens during the busiest hours). Also, within only a 6 hour day, why do you have to take a 30 minute break? That's just stupid and taking advantage of the employees (from the district manager(s); it's selfish and wrong to do. Just because it makes your job better, doesn't make it any better for the employees; that basically get buried for such little pay"
good,"Ran the register "
good,Dollar General is a friendly workplace. There is room for growth and other opportunities. There are also good incentives and other benefits as well. The environment is nice.
good,"overall good place to work, would recommend for students, typically stock shelves and run cash register each day  manager will work with your schedule"
good,i learned dollar general is a good job for me and i would like to work here and im willing to help you guys out just looking for a job and need money in my pocket
good,i liked the stock work to get the product out.and nice benefits but not enough time to use them.i liked the customers and the stores.nice clen stores and atmosphere.
good,"Fun work environment. Need to pay store managers more money, the load of work is more than salary. Good culture in company. Hardest part of job was keeping store managers in place due to such low pay grade."
good,I loved working for this company. They offer many opportunities to advance if you chose retail for a career. I discovered my love for retail with this company.
good,"Dollar General is a great place to work, but only if you are fortunate enough to be in one of their few prime locations. These stores are built in some of the worst places possible."
good,I enjoyed my customers when I was having a bad day certain customers could get me out  of the bad mood and it was in a nice neighborhood liked what I did just
good,"Very friendly, employee and employer very useful and friendly location was great for business, not to stranious. Great company to work for good benefits."
good,"Dollar General is your run-of-the-mill, typical clerk position. The workload is light and simple work. The other team members are nice people to work with."
good,"This is the easiest job I have ever had, with the only possible exception being Rite Aid Pharmacy. Managers work very well with your schedule and are flexible."
good,Productive and fun workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see every customer leave my store happy. Customer satisfaction is very important.
good,I like working for this company because the guest had made my day good or bad. I disliked the location i was at other than that i did learn alot and it has helped to become a better manager and sales lead.
good,"The job was a good part time job with decent pay, good employees, and a great manager. A typical day at work was very calm and productive. I learned about time management and efficiency."
good,"Very consistent atmosphere, easy going, simple job, definitely a good job just to get by with.  Hours are flexible.  job is a steady paced job. Keeps you on your toes"
good,Go in early in the AM do the deposit and go over the paperwork from the previous day.  Get your team meeting out of the way and start putting out freight until the store opens. Then you take care of the store as you can in between customers.
good,really nice place to work. love the badge to get in...security. like working on computers so this was the place to be. the job was very easy and fast paced
good,"on a typical day I supervise 7 other clerks, work closely with customers, making sure they can get and find what they need."
good,"Ensure each customer receives outstanding service by mystery shop standards Execute the daily operational, day-to-day goals and priorities assigned by store management Uphold merchandising and store cleanliness standards Participate in the processing of new shipments and help the team to keep the receiving and back stock area clean and organized Responsive of safety issues Conscious of shoplifting activity."
good,come in clock in read the board and book see what's on the agenda for the day count the drawer and put it in the register start taking customers and when no customers recover
good,Work more on communication and team work. More lolly gagging then actual work. Work on straightening the store correctly and helping customer with their satisfaction.
good,The place is great but needs a bigger building. You can hardly get a cart through the aisle . And the staff is no one to be seen. The clothes section is a mess.
good,The workplace is clean. Depends on what store you work at you will have a good store managers and other stores you can get bad managers. But overall it's a good company to work for
good,"I liked the work and the experience with working with the public and the skills hat I learned there. I was able to experience money handling, cash register and stocking."
good,"Typical days at work consisted of helping and checking out customers, as well as cleaning the store. I learned how to work a cash register, being my first time as a cashier. I had a great and understandable manager. The hardest part of my job would of been replacing all the light fixtures on the ceiling. It was a great workplace and i was always meeting new people, as well as great staff members. The most enjoyable part of my job would be meeting the unique people that came into the store."
good,"Job is good but it's difficult to get everything finished before the end of your shift. (But,at least, the time goes by quickly). Coworkers are great people to work with."
good,"I take the deposit to the bank, and get change. Make the schedule by Tuesday evening. do the paperwork. Throw freight. On Mondays scan the store (ordering).  The most enjoyable part is my team."
good,i enjoyed working at dollar general it was pretty decent job i just quit too early thinking i was bout to get a better job its a good start up job for someone who just got out of high school looking for a job to pay bills with benefits.

good,"Good and hardworking employees. Customers satisfaction is top priority while working a Dollar General. As a sales floor associate, the mission is to ensure 100% customer satisfaction."
good,There are very busy work days I have learned to cope with stress from being under to much pressure. Management is very helpful the culture of the workplace is a friendly environment. The hardest part of the job is rush hour time but the most enjoyable part is making sure the customer always feel welcomed and continue coming.
good,While working at Dollar General I ha a hard time because of the work I had to do. At this time of my life I was a breast feeding mother and trying to stock selves and made sure my clothes weren't being ruined all at the same time was a lot of work. But once I got the hang of things it all worked out. I worked for this company while in Tennessee and once i left to move to Tulsa some of my regular customers and co workers threw me a huge going away party. Best Day Ever!
good,I learned a lot about customer appreciation and how to formally speak with a customer here. The environment was very calm and peaceful and made working easy.
good,Fun and easy job.  Lot of stocking and money handling.  Many opportunities to move up within the company.  Great starter job.
good,Was my first job and it was a proving ground. Rewarding at times. Grateful for management's patience with me. Consistent business. If I can make it there I can make it anywhere!
good,C great excellent customer service hours be on time customer service do know your products and items show the people where the product is

good,great company. enjoyed being their hope to return to that company one day. they are the best company I have worked with so far truly a great staff and management was great

The job includes stocking shelves, maintaining a clean, organized environment. Assisting customers in finding what they are looking for. Handling cash and credit/debit cards, The company policies have changed since I worked there. Currently there is no full time positions and no over time available."
good,The overall work environment was a wonderful place to work all employees are enjoyable. Management can be a little hectic but the job overall evens itself out.
good,"Completed daily paperwork, supervised employees, received deliveries, stocked shelves, operated a cash register, and made deposits. I loved getting to know the customers and enjoyed helping them."

good,"I worked here for almost a year, very cool and calm workplace. I learned more about being a sales associate and cashier. I enjoyed my job."
good,"Calm environment, good company to work for and not strenuous work. I enjoyed my time there. My bosses worked around my second job and they were kind people!"
good,This job requires very much patience with the customers. It stays fairly busy during both and night. You have to be on your feet constantly. Management is fairly good. Coworkers do a well enough job to maintain the cleanliness of the place. Hardest part is dealing with disrespectful customers. Enjoyable part would be working with outgoing coworkers.
good,I enjoyed working here. Everyone was nice. The only bad thing about the job was that sometimes we got really busy with not enough staffing. Management always went out of the way to help. I learned a lot about who I was as a person.
good,I had a great time at this job.  Working with fun people not only getting the job done but also making sure that our customers where first and happy.  There was always  something to do and it was easy to talk to management.
good,This was a busy store with many items. We had large amounts of inventory and a quick turn over rate of associates. The managers that where consistent and wonderful to work for.
good,"Unloaded trucks, stocked, cleaned, ran registers, daily paperwork, deposits, made task sheets, setup paln-o-grams,"
good,It's a great environment. It is a multitasked job. It is very laid back and you work at a fast pace as well. I would recommend to anyone. I just love doing cashier jobs and stocking.
good,I loved my job at DG would definitely do it again they really didn't give many hours at all the pay wasn't bad but not what I was use to you didn't get meals unless worked more than a 5 hour shift
good,"Dollar General is a great place to work, but it is hard work. There are many tasks you have to accomplish on a regular basis while giving 100% customer service."
good,nothing much went on in dollar general. very peaceful. I liked when it got busy so the time can go by faster because if not your going tobe super bored
good,"Get to meet lots of people ands regulars; not enough pay, minimum wage for hard wok; Key holders don't do as much hard stuff as the cashiers"
good,"Weird hours, but they treat you well.  You will be expected to do a lot of different tasks, as the stores are not as heavily staffed as big stores like HEB or Walmart.  It's relatively low stress, though.  You'll probably spend more time stocking shelves than anything else.  If you're on a closing shift, it's a little bit harder than opening, but that's to be expected."
good,every day is the same not that many changes other than technical changes which are easy to learn  customer are very diversified . Management I am part of very informative co workers works as a team to keep the flow of the day easy sometimes not enough time to perform all task of the day
good,i would open the store and close the store. i learned how to run stock counts and place orders. most enjoyable was meeting new people
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers making sure they are satisfied and making sure that the store was had a very clean and neat environment
good,"working at dg was a great experience, I loved my co-workers and the atmosphere, the hardest part of my job was I did work a lot of hours because we were short staffed, but I loved who I worked with"
good,Was my first job i got when I moved to Vegas and was great learning experience for me  meet new people learn things I never knew how to do and improve and the skills I had  the manager  he was great boss didn't judge me and gave me a chance
good,You stock a lot check in venders you would be very busy. You are always doing something. Helping a lot of people answering a lot of questions.
good,Customer service is a must while processing payroll. The ability to multi task is a must.  Had a great team work effort which made it more pleasant environment.
good,Fun workplace management was very helpful on the job. They answered any question I had on the job. And was helpful in training me on the job.
good,"I started my career in LA. I had worked with the company about 4 months,  when Hurricane Katrina came along and we had to evacuate.  We ended up in GA with my husband's family for a while, then we moved to Dothan AL where I went back to work.  The company put me back to work in a position of cashier due to the fact that I was a Manager.  Pleasantlyrics surprised to the GM. I was one of the Hardest workers he had come across in many years.  I was planning on going back to Ms. But I was offered a new store of my own.  I couldn't have been more excited for the opportunity to make my mark."
good,It was a worthwhile job. If I would of stayed there longer I could of been in management. Working with the customers really sparked my enthusiasm.
good,I always worked the floor as i put the merchandise on shelves and worked carrying boxes. it was always fun to work there and the mangers were great. The Co-workers were very helpful when I first started.
good,"I loved the manager-she was fair, friendly, and honest. My co-workers were also wonderful. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers. I loved seeing their smiles."
good,Working for Dollar General was always a challenge. There is always something new every day. There are some down times but there are also some very fast pace times(which I enjoy). I had a very intelligent manager that taught me the proper way to run the store and how to satisfy the customer the correct way and follow store guidelines. My co-workers were very efficient which helps make the work day more productive.  The hardest part of the job was being in a high volume store and only being one person tended to be the challenge but I made it.  I enjoyed helping the customers with issues they may have faced while in the store while I was on duty.
good,"I really enjoyed working with my co-worker's and seeing my customer's on a regular basis. I always had a good relationship with my manager's, assistant manager's, district manager's and the vendor's. I respected them and they respected me. Overall Dollar General was a pretty good place. But I moved and I did not want to work at the Dollar General near me."
good,"Helping customers and see them smile is great. The work team is great, very little drama. Security all over the place makes me feel like I'm being watched 24/7."
good,"I have not worked for Dollar General for some time but when I was working for them in my home town I knew most of the people who came to the store.  I learned that it is not only important to make a good impression on people you don't know but people you do know especially.  Being from a small town made great customer service very important.  Your friends and neighbors come in to the store and you even work there with some of them. You want to provide a clean,fun loving environment and be helpful to everyone."
good,hard work fun environment learn how to stock reset stores planagrams  cash register costumer service count down register management skills haveing to deal with intense costumers
good,"Nice place to work is all I can say, great people to be around an its a warehouse so there is always work to be done. I came to work on time, the managers are always interacting with everyone, they always had fun events to do outside of work involving the company, the benefits are good. ive learned a lot by working there"
good,Nice place to work. The people are friendly. Loved it cuz I got to help and talk to customers which was the best part. If I smile every one else did to.
good,"Great company to work for, has a fun friendly environment. The company gives back to the community and values its Employees."
