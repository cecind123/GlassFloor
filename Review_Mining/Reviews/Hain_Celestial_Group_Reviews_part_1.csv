bad,Poor senior management lack of control . business direction unknown with by staff and worker unable to launch products correctly. no employee engagement. Plant manager showed anger and disrepect quiet offend to staff.
bad,"It is very fast-paced and stressful as they want you to do more than 1 job at once, very hard on your body and will let you go in a minute. Management is very rude and they talk down to the staff even name-calling and swearing at the employees. The morell is not good at all."
bad,this was a really bad environment and although they handle multiple brands it was disorganized and a mess. the pay was below average and everyone is miserable
bad,"Cutting and juicing fruit for product. operating machines. Working with different cultures. managing time, people, product and money. I also worked on a production line, Where we shipped items. I learned to operate and fix machines.I loved the people that i worked for."
bad,"The worst place to work,   a manager who is a offender works there. Tried to abuse an employee and hr did nothing  , there roaches in cafeteria  dirty"
bad,A typical day at FreeBird Chicken.  Arrive at 4:30 a.m to do pre operational inspection.  Very dirty facility.  Understaffed and you run run run all day.  Not appreciated and have a management team that is not worthy.  QA department manager is terrible.   Do not work for this company if you want a life.
bad,You are expected to work 7 days a week and they hold the option to mandatory you to stay 16 hrs on a moments notice. The pay is not worth not seeing your family. Don't expect anything less than your life being run by this place! Employee moral here is incredibly low!
bad,Easy work but ended poorly. I felt shortchanged and unappreciated.I would not recommend this company to another person. No room for advancement and taken advantage of.
bad,"worst place I ever worked. back stabbing, finger pointing in maintenance dept. if you were not part off the old timer club you did not have a chance. you were an outsider"
bad,"It's Hot and you stay at on spot all day and  Management is so horrible, the 2nd shift manager hollers and screams at people! Days and hours are long."
bad,Maintenance is responsible for everything.  Always work work work.  Good pay but never time for yourself.  They expect you to work weekends all the time.  They love to work holidays as well.
bad,"I work 3rd shift, so when I get there usually no charged equipment! And get all leftover work, that nobody else wanted to do."
good,"Arrive to office; greet co-workers and clock in.  Then work all different systems and various computer applications for seven hours and be micromanaged by Management.  It creates an uncomfortable atmosphere and exhaustion.  When the work day is over and I can clock out, I sign a breathe of relief."
good,"Work was fairly easy, but was under staffed.  You could do your job with little or no supervision. You usually work alone depending on what needs to be done or as a team."
good,"a good place to work, although the whole management structure has nearly vanished due to loss of contracts, not much of a workforce left, hardest part of the job was very little resource left in the business. I only stayed a month on a short term contract."
good,Hain celestial was a fun place to work and management was very attentive to details and helpful with there knowledge on picking and packing and shipping.
good,"Thought I would retire working for this firm.  We were given 5 minutes of their time on a conference call and told some would be offered a position with the new firm, including me, for $20,000 less than what I had been receiving with an impossible territory and an extra day on the road.  Horrible end to what had been a rewarding position with what we all thought was a reputable company."
good,Daily inventory adjustments transactions were performed monitored and checked.  End of month inventory reconciliations were performed to assure accurate and timely transactions.
good,"Worked with a bunch of really nice people, that made work life a whole lot more enjoyable. I have worked at less desirable places."
good,"While the company isn't bad to work for they have a high turn over rate with many personality clashes. Can be disorganized most days, with a lot of rework of product as Production has been understaffed for awhile."
good,"This place was an excellent start as a QC Tech.  Shifts were 50 hours a week.  That would vary dramatically.  Co-workers were awesome.  Everyone tried to help out and communicate.  Management could improve.  They did not have much of a relationship with employees.  Great benefits, overtime available, and there is a lot to learn and gain skills."
good,"Very nice company to work for if you have better management"
good,"It was a ok place to work, and very cold and wet, employees were ok, and but management all over the place and very short staffed. Good vacations sometimes long hours."
good,- Learned a lot
good,I enjoyed working at Celestial Seasonings. It was a family culture and a fun place to work.  My responsibilities kept me busy and engaged. I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,"The culture is nice here. The people are very nice, The work is fast paced and busy, the day goes fast, The job is not boring. Management can provide more feedback and training but it is hard due to being very busy. The management is kind, very nice and respectable."
good,"You will have a typical retail day. Attend to customers, answer questions, restock the store as needed, enjoy conversations with coworkers, and be up to date on the teas being sold."
good,"Great place to work for, schedule gets busy during the winter time. A lot of Operators have been there 20-30yrs. Benefits are the best perks of the company."

good,I enjoy working for this company. I would stay long term if the pay was just a little more. Weekly pay and good hours for little pay. They are a company to take care of one another
good,"I was a contractor for them and I learned and advanced me excel, and SQL skills.  Management allowed me to seek solutions to solving problems.  The culture was good, however in the finance and accounting there was a feeling you had to stay late no matter what was going on.  The most difficult part was waiting for answers needed from other departments to complete your work.  Most enjoyable was the interaction with my coworkers"
good,"Its a great place to work at as an intern. The maintenance team are skilled and great people to work with. You can learn a lot from them and I enjoyed every minute with them as an intern. It just made me sad inside how my co-workers didn't get any days off when they needed too and drove them crazy. Its not for everyone, but as an intern, I guess if your young, motivated  with all the spare time in the world on your hands, and looking to make good money doing things you love as a technician, then go for it."
good,"I never felt like a contract worker.  Manager was really nice and always included me in meetings.  She was hoping I'd get a permanent offer, but it wasn't meant to be.  Learned a lot about the HBA and consumer goods industry.  Great benefits, training, people."
good,Reviewing and analyzing Quality Control documents.  Everyone had nice cubicles and just did their job.  Nice lunchroom.  Everyone was nice.
good,"I loved workin at Hain Celestial.  I enjoyed the work, the environment, and the many wonderful people that I was fortunate to work with from management on down the line."
good,"Although only employed as a temp, there is such a sense of community. Not only among the Research and Development group, but throughout the company.  The setting was quick-pace on occasion, but rather steady for the most part. Management varies by department, but in R&D, there is a very involved, cultivating leadership."

good,I honestly like Working for the company everyone is so friendly an the work is easy once you get the hang of it and every day I clock in I see friendly faces an positive attitudes
good,"Great company to work at. Having your work cut out for you, the time goes by really quick. Management is great, they make you feel welcomed and let you know if there are any questions you might have you should not hesitate and come see them."
good,team was not easy and team lead was very selective ... As I was not part of her selection but I kept my head down and did my work.  Work is busy overall it is a good to place work and lots of good people you will meet in other departments. Amazing products and store within the building which I miss much! I really would have stayed.
