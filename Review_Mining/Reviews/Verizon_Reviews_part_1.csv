rating,review
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Verizon is a great company.  Paging Zone, on the other hand, is utter trash and treats their employees as such.  I've worked for other Verizon retailers where made great money, had full benefits, and had great management and work atmosphere.  Don't let Paging Zone stop you from finding another Verizon Retailer."
bad,"If you have no soul you will thrive here."
bad,Company sucks. They think they are a bunch of know it all. They arent though. They dont listen to employees. If you have something to say to make the place better. Nope your fired or you have to quit.
bad,"Nothing else to really Say, I did not enjoy my time workingsnfor verizon wireless and I felt that they worked hard to get bounes instead of helping employees"
bad,"Horrible place to work.. Cellular Sales is a authorize seller for Verizon. Go to the corporate Verizon store and not the authorize seller.. Trust me! They have a lot of hidden fees that are not necessary. There is definitely no work, life, balance. No time for family, just work work work."
bad,"The culture was horrible, management was only into themselves, politics and females. The committees were horrible, the only way to be promoted was with who you knew not what you knew. People were very disrespectful"
bad,District Mangers and General Manager over work their employees. The company set unrealistic quotas for employees to meet. Which makes it hard for employees to move up in the company.  The company is  constantly finding way to pay employees less and over work them.
bad,"Verizon is a great company "
bad,"The place is a mess. Highly not recommended. Don't even bother applying if you're female, you'll just get harassed. I asked my new boss a question (after prev boss got fired for a number of things) and she just told me to google it."
bad,"It stated as an easy and accessible learning environment. then, it took a turn for the worst. "
bad,Working was the absolute worst part of there management was god awful couldn't get up to help a co-worker who was having a allergic reaction or even to go to the bathroom
bad,"I had a terrible experience when handling customers, my manager hardly trained me on how to do much of anything so when I had an actual customer I would stutter and stagger. She didn't bother to help me when handling customers so when I made a mistake she wrote it down and sent a report that I was disobeying when in reality I was just confused on some small things here and there. I did not enjoy my time working at Verizon under that employer at the time."
bad,"Supervisor was very rude, work/life balance stunk and don't ask too many questions, even if you don't get it..It seems as if they would almost prefer that you guess what to do."
bad,"After hired they take you into a room and literally say that the people there are now your family."
bad,This company does not follow its values or its mission at all. They force sales and take advantage of their customers. They preach integrity from the top down but the frontline and managers will do anything to reach quota. They will do ANYTHING to hit their targets and throw one person under the bus if their deceptive sales tactics backfire.
bad,not worth it..they want your life.you can be honored at a rally and given awards one day and written up the next because one quota number dropped. sales reps are cutthroat and dishonest. management fix is in for reps they favor as far as cherry picking the best customers for their favored reps
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"It wasn’t a place to work, only for people with no kids etc. very hard and I just can’t do it but to each it’s on....hits are way overdue and not enough money to pay bills"
bad,NA  This job had nothing to do with payroll and I have no comments at this time..hardest part of this job was dealing with all the unhappy customers every day
bad,"Nothing to white about , work is over stressing people ,  no body is happy their , they are under stressed all the time ,i thing if they can take some work off  from shoulder  people will be more happy and work harder"
bad,"Early start and late finish."
bad,Money hungry corrupt company that doesn't care about employees.  Senior leadership will close down any location on a whim if they can make an extra buck off shoring.
bad,they will lay you off. all about. no loyalty what so ever. 15 years as a manager and laid off without warning. Director for 29 years and laid off without warning. beware
bad,"This is a very backwards company.  Its really all about who you know and who you are sleeping with.  I reported to HR the actions of leadership with entry level employees, and I was the one that got written up for providing that information, and the entry level employees were promoted to general management."
bad,There is no culture in the call center and is very much a fend for yourself type of environment. Managers are never there and don't like to assist you.
bad,It was a very micromanaged and miserable workplace. I would not recommend anyone who wants job satisfaction to work in the call center. The Managment and clients make you feel small and worthless.
bad,"I recently had an interview scheduled via HireVue that was cancelled due to my inexperience with the process where I failed to recognize the access code at the bottom of the initial email. My assumption was that I would be prompted to join a video conference at the time of the appointment. Three minutes after the scheduled time I received a phone call from the interviewer reminding me I had an appointment to which I discussed with him very briefly and politely, found the code and was about to start the video call. Then in a very dismissive and disrespectful manner said he would be cancelling the appointment because he does not interview individuals who are late."
bad,"Very unorganized place to work "
bad,15 years. Built a very successful market. Position eliminated. Wouldn't want anyone I know wasting time working for a company like this. Work for an agent.
bad,"This is by far the worst company I ever worked for. Your just another number to them, doesn't matter what you do for them if your numbers aren't good or meet the goal they don't care. The owners care only about one thing there pockets being filled and taking money away from their employees. They'll look for any excuse to take your commission away and make it seem like your doing a bad job. And they're racist."
bad,"There is genuinely nothing good I can say about Verizon as a company. Any opportunity for advancement is met with constant new requirements. Promotions rarely include a compensation increase. I was promoted to the Operations Specialist (give access to the safe, store alarm codes, store locks, and other sensitive financial information). When I was promoted I was then told there was a $0.00 pay increase as the job didn't include additional responsibilities"
bad,didnt like the experience via alorica it was super unprofessional the staff didnt follow their own guidelines and they were prone to drama. all in all i did not like the working experience
bad,Don't work here they suck the life out of you. Unhealthy horribly managed company that cares nothing about its employees only the money you make them and if you don't you get let go.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"The GoWireless Indirect Retailer I worked for was atrocious. Upper Management, Area and Regional Management were so disconnected from the realities and struggles of selling product in a modern market."
bad,"The training was ok with decent hours.   The call floor was horrible. Staff says there is an open door policy. That is not true. Paid for insurance, then when needed to use it verizon said I had no coverage. Looking at my pay statement I realized verizon had been taking the money out for premiums, however the money was not going to to the insurance that was going back into Verizon. Sounded like embezzling to me."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"It was not transparent.Door to door selling.It’s not safe to be walking by yourself at night, knocking on strangers home, selling their product.No paid training."
bad,"Management was dishonest and not compliant. I didn't enjoy ""wrapping things in a deal"" and making everything seem included when the customer really had the option to not buy certain materials."
bad,its just a messed up system they fire you for not hitting a certain rating and the ratings are completely out of your control. you sometimes really cannot help a customer no matter how hard u try and they still give u bad ratings !!
bad,My position was eliminated and I was told to leave the premises via email. No one else ever told me what happened or why. It was not a good situation.
bad,The worst!!!! Run. The management is horrible. The manager is constantly switching up responsibilities for people and it makes no logical sense why. She plays people against each other. Favoritism to non-blacks. No room for growth. The work is very little some days you only do 10 to 15 minutes of work. Some days of the week you completely do nothing at all. I came to work for them as a contractor with a very impressive resume where I have work for several CEOs and department heads along with attorneys. There was not in the opportunity to show your worth. You basically do nothing or you do manual labor packing boxes for their new move. If you come from a fast-paced environment and accustomed to loving your work and taking pride in ownership of your work do not work for this place. You will question Your Existence there everyday
bad,Company is so money hungry. They need you to work overtime but then complain about you having overtime. They wonder why they can’t keep employees. Worst company to work for.
bad,"I was paid $8/hr [$3 below minimum] w/a commission opportunity. How the commission worked was never explained to me in any kind of detail, even after specifically asking."
bad,"This experience was completely horrible. I would never want to work for this company again. I actually did not even work directly for Verizon, but rather an authorized dealer. Perhaps if I would have worked for Verizon proper I might have liked it."
bad,"If you want a drama free job, this isn't it. Poor leadership. Training is horrible and they throw you under the bus. Not a friendly work environment. Would not recommend"
bad,"Would never work there again, even if offered $1,000,000.00.  The training is terrible,  and most of the time you can't help customers that come in.  They are told to call the 1-800 number."
bad,I was a contractor for GC Services. Was passed over for permanent positions that opened during the time I was there. Would NEVER consider working for this company after my experience here. They do not pay their invoices timely and ignore repeated requests from vendors who have not been paid. If you care about your professional reputation.....RUN for your life!
bad,"This job required 24/7 access. i was called out to stores over 100 miles away at all hours of the night due to a break in. when hired this was not part of my description, it became part when they offered a company ""optional"" vehicle. however it was required to take it."
bad,"Awful place to work, people are lazy, managers don't know what they're doing and the union is useless.  They treat their employees like garbage and nobody there cares."
bad,"I was not very happy with the way things worked out at this job at all. I wasn't working with Verizon directly through the company, but through another company that was also selling Verizon packages."
bad,Management sucks they don't care about you at all. They will tell you one thing one day and completely do the opposite the next and act like they never had the conversation with you. Alot of rumors about the management and what they say and do to employees. Personally i didn't have a bad time at Verizon but i saw all the flaws and so did everyone else the week i left i watched more then half the call center quit sp I took that as I sign to leave my self as we
bad,Terrible place to work at if your manager is a perverted pig at the Sebastopol store. Disgusting. Lazy. Horrible. Gross. Sexist. Rude. Pig. Narcissistic.
bad,The whole company is a joke. The company itself only money money money. They forgot where they came from and don’t care that you have family and the customers only want to pay their bill not purchase something...and then they wonder why the store had no foot traffic. Pretty much work 9-7 Monday -Saturday and 12-5 on Sunday and be expected to have to do everything bc your manager does nothing!
bad,I will leave a simple example of an employee who worked their. He had to quite because they would not allow him to have off for his daughters heart surgery. This among unreal goals. Terrible favoritism and dishonesty of how many things work before being hired make working at Cellular Sales a terrible place.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Limited opportunity for advancement long hours that equate to working for less than minimum wage after paying out of pocket expenses for medical, dental, life insurance."
bad,Ridiculously high inconsistent sales goal qualifier. Poor management. Horrible experience. Changed employees and managers often and managers where very dishonest and two faced. Very bad experience and treatment for a lot of loyal hard work.
bad,"Send work overseas. Management turned out to be low grade. Not recommended. Unless you would like to start working with a company, then be let go because the work was moved, then do NOT WORK FOR THEM."
bad,They cut employees to save money.experience be damned.  They expect you do satisfy the customer needs but will not spend any money and management leave you out to dry when customer complains.
bad,"Beware:  The supervisors are liars, sneaky, fake, uncaring, and unprofessional.  They talk a good talk but don't walk the walk.  A big turnover with employees recently occurred.  Also, they will only say hello and good night IF they feel like it."
bad,"i was hired as a store manager with them and i had 1 week of training with a class of regular sales employees and after i was on sales floor with the manager of the place i was taken. he did no manager training for me, lucky for me i had training from my past job. the distric manager was very sneaky. all employees r sneaky. they only care about them and no one else!"
bad,"Run. Do not apply. Absolute joke of a company starting from the top. Be prepared to be told everyday that your job is on the line.  If you dont take calls on your days off you will get wrote up or fired. Good luck trying to get to talk to anyone from payroll when they mess up a check which happens every single check. Hr will never answer calls and always back up the RD. They stress family is important which is a joke. Be prepared to work 7 days a week. Promotions are given to friends and family first. Visit the corporate office in Carmel to see that 1st hand. So many people related or ""Friends for years""  Do not apply to work here for any reason at all. When I went to training they played music in breaks that dropped the N word numerous times. Very unprofessional company all around"
bad,I have worked for many Fortune 500 companies and this is the worst company by far.  The negative culture comes from the top down and all of the managers are pressured so much and so much fear is created that they treat their staff like indentured servants with total respect disrespect.  Never apply to work there unless you are so desperate you are willing to sell your soul.
bad,"The work environment was awful they over worked me and made we work 9 hours a day with no break so that once a week the manager could have an off day."
bad,Verizon was great but Frontier Communications is the worst place I've ever worked at.  They hours are horrible and I know more and know how to work the systems better than the managers.
bad,You will be instructed to sell dirty. Expect to slam products on unsuspecting customers in order to meet your commission quota. This will be everyday for you.
bad,nearly 20 years with Verizon.  enjoyed working for a company who is on the pulse of technology! Big proponent of training!  Travel was awesome...……./.
bad,Verizon Wireless terminated me after 13 years because of a legal disability. I had enjoyed a long tenure with alot of career advancement until that point.
bad,"Managers will steal your sales and if you speak up about it and report them, they will lie to get you fired so that they can get away with it. Theres no sick days, no paid time off. Coworkers consistantly complain yet they are lazy and they dont work hard. Commission-based pay is a share system so the hard-workers make money for the lazy workers and the lazy workers ride the accomplishments and sales of the hard-workers while twiddling their thumbs. Corporate will charge you for a phone missing from inventory even if its someone elses fault. Very toxic and unprofessional work environment."
bad,"No Comment awful place to work. management messy. Unprofessional. Uncouth. Tacky, unprofessional team managers, need training and to not be dismissive,"
bad,"no real employee representation, uneducated leadership,  work life balance was very bad in they never seemed to care about anything unless you made your numbers."
bad,Very unlikly that i woukd tell someone to work for tgis company they where unprofessional unorganized and did not exceed the expectations of the consumer!
bad,It doesn't give value to vendors. Vendor works in night shifts only. Vendors will do more work than employees. No benfits for vendors. Managers are rude towards vendors
bad,"If you want to work for a company who micromanages and makes you feel like you're not good enough, this job is for you. Benefits are great but not worth your mental sanity."
bad,"It has been years since I worked for the company it would not be fair to give a review at this point. It was not a bad job, there was just little to no support from management,"
bad,Too many cutbacks in personnel to provide adequate customer service in wireless arena.  When I first started lots of opportunities for advancement now there is none.
bad,"I worked for Verizon for a very short time.  Training was almost non-existent about how to connect a new phone to a finicky system.  Sales training was given but not helpful when their communication lines fail.  I was given leads but always led to customers who couldn't continue their application due to non sufficient funds, inadmissible credit, problems with their SSN #'s etc. to which I had no control over.  Certain team members would ""steal"" leads and were never reprimanded.  Expected sales were impossibly high for the area and for how many reps were on the sales floor.  One can't sell five phones a day, with 5 reps on the floor and only 11 customers walking through the door and 3 of those customers are simply there to pay their bill."
bad,Your district managers are awful! They never wanted to hear what you have to say. The manager of the Nashville store was only willing to help herself for her money. NEVER the actual rep doing the work!
bad,Not happy with there management and work hours.  The company has a high turn over rate for contract employee.  After getting high evolutions was release from contract for being sick.
bad,"Several of us from entire Denver area locations got layed off so that they could hire employees that they could pay less. After working for them for 5 years."
bad,Poor management causes horrible turn over rate. Nobody respects each other and it’s a toxic environment that breeds horrible customer service.  Money is okay but not worth all the stress.
bad,You were expected to work from 60-70 per week. There were no given breaks in a day. The upper management always complained about the health of the store and nothing was done when suggestions were made.
bad,Very Stressful place to work. Not a good place to work for someone who has a family. People get burned out really really quickly. The pay doesn't compensate for the way they treat their employees
bad,"The job, once the newness wore off becomes repetitive and boring.  Co-workers are nice for the most part.  Upper management only cares about money and that the peons do their job and don't cost the company money.  They only value human life, so if a pet needs emergency surgery, don't count on them to understand.  The building is sick and mold has been found.  They don't care or laugh things off.  People are happy walking in, but once inside they become the walking dead as you deal with annoyed or angry customers.  At least in collections, the managers are willing to take escalated calls.  In fraud, the managers don't seem to want to help their workers this way. The hardest part is working for people that don't care about anything, but that you stay in your chair and work.  They have time requirements and limited bathroom breaks.  The most enjoyable are the co-workers."
bad,They went about day to day task with  no business ethics. I did not enjoy my time with them. I left after a year because their metrics where unrealistic. They managed my employment there poorly.
bad,"when working at this call center it was awful.  you couldn't even take a break if you needed to. relieve yourself,  you only had 20 mins for lunch, and if you needed a day off you had. to trade out with someone else or you couldn't take off"
bad,"Lay Off Company of the decade, lays offs every quarter. I was always looking over my shoulder worrying if I would have a job."
bad,They set people up all the time if you have computer errors they will not fix it. You have different trainers from a different state every week . Not!
bad,"very rushed, and a huge turnover rate with little to no training for sales personnel. Pushed to sell to people who could not afford the products. The scheduling was never accurate."
bad,"I was offered employment though the ""reccommendation"" of my sister. I wasn't even offered a service benefit in any form. It's funny how rate is the only factor when getting a job third party. Something to consider."
bad,Does not care about customers or employees.  Horrible internal systems.  Poor Pay. Poor support.  No training.  Just had a very large  layoff.   I would not recommend working here.
bad,"They do not care about their employees.  They laid off people over 60 and left people under 30 that does not know there job.   Their pay range in under the standards,"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Did not enjoy the work atmosphere. Low focus on the customer.  Sales commission was a negligible part of employee pay.  Not a recommended job for sales associates.
bad,"The company favors certain employees is not fair to all of its workers, very cut throat and back stabbing and doesn't support its employees at all.  Not a good company to work for"
bad,worse mistake I ever made they don't care about the employees.  they change the bonus structure when its helps the keep money and to ensure we don't make too much money the management asks how they can make it a better work place but doesn't really care horrible work like balance this company has absolutely disgusted me.
bad,"high turn over rate. management doesn't listen. unprofessional work environment. my customers could hear expletives in the background during calls. many in my training class quit. the system they have you use is outdated at best. and will give you a myriad of error messages. IT is not ran by the smartest people in the room. To be told that you have to clear cookies for IE every five minutes in order for your system to work clearly demonstrates that IT lacks ability and depth of understanding. If Verizon is a multibillion dollar company, but they are unwilling to invest a few hundred thousand to improve a system that would Improve the efficiency of their employees, then that speaks volumes. The one good thing was Senior Management. I really, really, really respected them."
bad,No help no leadership. Looked out for your own numbers. 15 mins late and you were fired. Constant complaints about you which weren’t true. Happy when they closed the plant
bad,Very little mentoring from leadership. Manager was very young and green himself.  Not a great employee culture. Very young team and not well organized.
bad,Don’t work  there they don’t care about you st all they just care about sales if you don’t make them your fires basically they are horrible and I wasted 6 months of my life there thinking it would change
bad,I worked for Verizon for a short period of time. They had did a lay off on their business side and decided to leave before i was let go. Did not want to have to look for a job when i did not have one.
bad,The training for good I learn a lot about call centers. Speaking to the customer and a good. Helping the customer was also a good experience. Will do it again.
bad,Force you to sell people things they do not need. For instance verizon is still a pain in my side because I am being forced to write more about the company before I can close this window.
bad,"they pay you bare minimum, tell you to sale things we don’t have in stock, make it hard for you to reach your goals no mater what so they don’t have to pay you your bonus"
bad,terrible place to work due to management is not good and training is a wait of time never learned anything and they are very unfair not a good place at all to work
bad,"Unfair management , poor pay, customers would be very upset for hidden fees, and bundling up deals. They only care about numbers not their customer's satisfaction."
bad,I will never work for that company again. Poor management. Played favorites. Low pay. False Promises of advancement. Training does not prepare for the position. When asked for help or more training it is denied. Obscene hours of operation.
bad,Total lack of leadership.  Stressful work environment.  Continuous restructuring wit h the mass firing of employees who worked there for 30 plus years being shown the door weeks before retirement.
bad,"They do not appreciate loyalty, they do make you get on your knees to get promotions, they have unreasonable goals, the commission structure gets worse and worse every year"
bad,Verizon may treat it's employees great but afni does not. Afni makes false claims and promises and is not as flexible or easy going as they claim. In short do not work for Afni
bad,Verizon is a place where they take advantage of any person who takes a leave of absence. Hard to move up in the company and they also do not let you get a raise after a certain amount is paid.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,I will never work for verizon again. They only care about the good ol boy system and if you are not in the click you won't go any where in this company
bad,"Call center Job, hundreds of calls a day. Irate customers. calls being monitored. Sales objectives. Emphasis on sales vs customer service. The job sucked the life out of me but the pay & benefits are bar none."
bad,I hate verizon. I feel like a slave. There are no opportunities to move up in the company and when you do you are positioned to make less money. There is nothing good about working for verizon other than benefits.
bad,"Verizon conduit, worst place ever worked, every day, no seat, different cubicle each day, not sanitized, terrible conversation very unprofessional SMH"
bad,There was no set work schedule including days off.  Changed on a weekly basis.  Very difficult to get days off that i requested.  Management was very poor.  Low morale.  An easy job is only reason why i stayed.  Small raise every year.
bad,Not a good company to work for. The manager set unrealisticand almost impossible hours for me to work. They also kept me overworked and underpaid. I also felt like there was too much personal drama going on through out the business work day.
bad,Verizon data services india has limited scope to grow when compared to Verizon USA. Long and long hours need to work. No late Hour compensations. But Health coverage/insurance is good.
bad,"My position does not provide adequate compensation nor vacation or paid time off so you aren't able to take time off without being penalized.  Turn over is so high that you don't know from month to month who is managing or who leadership is,"
bad,"They tell you its a job for professionals and want you to have a college degree however, its just a call center job.  You can't even go to the restroom without asking for permission."
bad,"Unless you feel like drinking the kool-aid, you should not work here. The culture is unsettling and more than anything resembles a cult. I was shocked at the way Verizon overtly taught their employees to lie to customers and was instructed to ""use complicated language to move a customer past any financial concerns."""
bad,"people were sold things they couldn't afford under false advertisements, my manager constantly hid on women and actually fired me when I didn't give into his advances"
bad,"due to outdated geographic pay band areas Verizon uses, which miscategorize the Orlando area as lowest possible cost of living, the base salary, which is not negotiable, is relatively low compared to what else is out there. There are politics like any place else, best to just not get worked up about it. Show up everyday doing your best, be genuine and respectful to everyone and you'll be fine."
bad,"horrible, people suck "
bad,"Would involve long work hours and little job security with layoffs occurring every quarter.  More folks left, same job responsibilities or more remained."
bad,"work life balance; sales, marketing, training, data, phones; customers; grit with the ability and capability to understand the domestic and global markets."
bad,"Lots of politics at the workplace, no process is followed, poor culture and poorer quality of work. Needs strong leadership, leadership that can guide the team to success."
bad,Being an employee at Verizon has given me a great sense of being a team player and delivering the best customer service. I got a good sense of what the telecom industry is. The workplace was always good and everyone willing to coach when in need.  They offer management employees and array of  training to keep you up to speed as new technology is always underway.  I left there will an experience that I can take to any industry.
bad,"One day, my manager called me and just told me to not come in. The customer care position was gone, over night, from all American verizons. They hardly ever promoted from within."
bad,"There where some Techs, working there who didn't share work information, preventing me from doing my job correctly. No one to report this oversite too"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"This company has us work and bring in business, then cut our commissions if we get them at all.  I surpassed my goal by over 600% and received 2/3 of my commission!  Happened all over!"
bad,Meets all day everyday for unrealistic goals. Directors have no idea how to connect with staff. District Managers only know how to agree with higher ups.
bad,"Retail sales at Verizon is horrible, terrifying experience. High pressure sales environment that forces you to siphon out personal information from every customer that walks through the door, so you can force feed them sales pitches for more useless gadgetry."
bad,"stressful workplace, never felt like I was part of a team, manager was not available and poor communication, learned the job from fellow contractors, virtually no training,  no future - you knew from day 1 that there was no future there"
bad,Store needs to be throw down is badly conditions. It's like working store full with high school kids. Managment likes to yell at her employies in front of costomers. Rush on are lunch break so managmemt can spend 2 hours pumping.
bad,"Commission sales with all the drawbacks and none of the perks.  Poor management style, high pressure sales with obfuscated goals.  Commission system was a strange mess of modifiers and multipliers.  $X dollars base times A if you get enough new lines times B if you sell enough accessories times C and so on."
bad,"Worked quite well with a great team implementing multimillion dollar highly complex projects and was assured of recognition and reward for hard work and dedication. "
bad,your hours are long and customers treat you poorly and management says they care but they don't. be prepared to work on all major holidays and when it snows.
bad,"If you up sell successfully you're golden. If not, you're tenure is short. Management only cares about up sell sales quotas and punishment methods for missing unreasonable monthly quota targets."
bad,The main issue with Verizon wireless is no job security. you can work them for ten years then they can let you go with no fault. The big cut they did in 2016 was shocking to many many employees.
bad,it was not worth the hours you have to put in for training. I worked for them when they were apart of alorica which was one of the worst experiences of my life.
bad,"This was not a positive or healthy work environment. Our team was not structured properly. "
bad,"The worst management ever. The Statesboro location is ran by a chauvinist pig that lies and cheats to get on top. Other locations may not be bad, but you will regret working at that place. Your accomplishments will be placed as theirs (management). If you want a life do not work there."
bad,I don not like have to give a review when i am filling out an application. The company made a lot of promises that it did not keep and when I asked about them I was terminated.
bad,"This was the worst job experience I've ever experienced. Micro management, weekly coaching. Extremely stressful environment because of customers, never know from day to day what you'll going to encounter. Ever changing environment, and you can't ever ever learn everything working there. Run for your frame of mind!!!"
bad,"Treats contractors as less than human.  No benefits, no consideration, no future."
bad,"network security, networking infrastructures, hardware and SaaS provisioning, issue troubles and resolutions, to management of users and customer secured data."
bad,i had a very great experience with this company.pay is very good ....people are very good people ...hours are great they understand you have a life out side of work
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Worked for Verizon during the height of the cell phone industry and Verizon's rise to fame.  As time progress it was more and more difficult  to stay at Verizon. Success made the Company loose its heart.
bad,"Started out as a nice place to work, upper management change and then the company started to change, has really gotten stressful and to many unfair changes"
bad,"Worst ran company in America. Compnesation was not fair, company paid outside hires more than long term employees. Bonuses were taken away and never fairly distributed. 0 stars for Verizon, horrible experience, horrible company that promotes harassment and bullying."
bad,was unprofessional and the manager was inexperienced and relied on me to save him all the time he did not get along with any of the employees.  The pay was not enough for my cost of living and the commission was extremely low and we had to sale triple the amount of products to make an ok commission
bad,"Working at Verizon was like working at the worst job I ever had. No, I take that back. It was much worse than any of the jobs I ever had. The management was poor, and the entire HR Staff quit a month after I was hired. Then we were given two months notice that they were closing down our site."
bad,"Fun environment "
bad,"Micro management, mandatory meetings on your days off, impossible sales goals, forced to stay for overtime that you didn't actually get paid for, all in a cut throat environment where if you make out of this place without developing some sort of anxiety issue, you are very lucky. VERY high turnover."
bad,"One touch direct was late with its commission for its employees. The commission structure was beneficial to all employees but in a sales environment, merit is everything."
bad,It was just an awful place to work.   That is all I can say.  I wish I never took the job.  Management expect you to lie.  Co workers take your sale.  I wish I never took the job.
bad,"I enjoy working with my co-workers it was fun working with them. "
bad,Horrible pay. Horrible training structure. Horrible supervisors. The benefits were not good at all. Stats nearly impossible to achieve. I would not recommend this job at all.
bad,"This job is a complete joke. The management makes you feel as you can never meet their standards. They always have a different answer for everything. They are never on the same page with one another. The typical day at work is when you first walk in you feel very overwhelmed. I felt as I was always being watched and corrected on every call I took. No help from management when needed. The hardest part of the job was actually taking back to back calls. Getting threatened by the customers as well as belittled like everything was your fault even though you just worked for Verizon wireless. If you over talked the customer that was a no, no In managements eyes. They treat the customers like gold and the employees like nothing. I came home very night crying that's how stressful the job was. It never felt like a career it felt like a jail."
bad,I was customer support and we were told that document everything and do what is right for the customer but I had seen and been a part of where that did not happen. I did no like the culture at all because it was supposedly pro customer but when I had to help them I had to deny there requests because of management. I was not able to help as many customers as needed. Many had issues with the phone plans. I had customers call in and saying they were offered something and I saw that in the notes but the management denied that so that was one of the hardest things to tell them no when the other person said yes and it was documented so I did not like that. There really was not anything I particular enjoyed about the job.
bad,"Working at this company has nothing to do with your skills, but who you know to protect you and your job-- that is what I learned at this company more than anything else, so keep this in mind."
bad,closed the site didn't give us job options or good severance. ppl who worked there for 25 years will get one months worth of pay. to stressful no bonus options for trainers
bad,"The training did not prepare me for the call center floor at all."
bad,I've learned that on a commission based job you can have a good day and a very bad day. I have also learned not to trust anything that that training class tell you because the job can be nothing like what they put it as.
bad,Hourly pay was low. Commission structure was poor which made it hard to earn a living wage. Management was not helpful in coaching/mentoring and only wanted you to push whatever the current marketing deal was regardless of customer needs. Customers did not like coming to the store which made your job of pleasing them/selling services much more difficult than it should have been. Overall it was a terrible place to work and I would not recommend it to anyone.
bad,Incredibly Underpaid.  There is absolutely no flex ability with your work schedule. Be prepared to work nights and weekends. Additionally promotions are hard to come by.
bad,Have to work more than 12 hr a day. Frequent night shifts and weekend work. No work/life balance. Management is consider employees as resource to exploit and climb ladder of success. They don't care about employees or their family.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,do not apply bad managers bad coworkers bad environment no support bad work schedule bad management bad compensation bad bad bad bad bad everything. do not apply for this job ever.
bad,"Very stressful environment, Union fighting with managment and the employees getting the brunt of it. I worked very hard and won many awards and prizes but it took a piece of my soul I wasnt willing to continue giving."
bad,Part of the job I had a problem with was the fact that they forced you to sell stuff to people that you knew were going to return the product after they found out that they didn't need it. District manager didn't seem to care.
bad,"worst place I worked for. its commission based too but they get on your case if you don't reach the sales of 7,500 dollars. and they have impossible tiers that restrict you from getting your full commission. managers don't care about employee only sales."
bad,"As much as I trained and given that job my all, when I needed them they let me fall through the cracks. Sadly this job will let you go even when you put in massive overtime and perform as expected."
bad,"greedy corporation. incompetent management. not family friendly, no consistency in schedule/hours , forced overtime, work holidays,  constant pressure to extort money from customers by selling them things they don't need."
bad,"Do not work here, bad management. The company does not care about employees in the least. Its only concern is company profits. Most employees are overworked. the company has poor work life balance. Most employees are underpaid."
bad,"Management treats employees as tissue paper and throws even any one worked for more than ten years also. say they have credo/standards and throw away the employees using security forces/bouncers."
bad,"Most stressful cut throat job and environment I have ever seen. Stress was unreal on all levels. All are at risk for their jobs at all times even management. "
bad,Poor service  i won’t recommend NOBDY to Verizon they don’t give you a change just poor everything they can do better either customer service and their management is poor
bad,its a job. you get your van and your tools. then ride a few weeks with someone . then take climbing aloft class for a few weeks. then your put into the group and answer trouble and service tickets . later you take some trouble shooting courses.
bad,I did not like working at Verizon. It was awful. Do not work for Verizon. The management is awful it is just an awful miserable place to be. do not work there
bad,"Managers changed rules and policies to fit situations. Customers called to yell and abuse the customer service rep, with little to no repercussions to the customer.  Hours were awful. No regard for employee's family life."
bad,"Verizon wasn't really a place for anyone who is trying to work as an Independent. The hours and amount of work you have to do isn't worth the time, gas or energy that you put into delivering their products to clients door to door. "
bad,"Incolum operator, typesetter , scanning artwork. typesetting small ads in yellow pages section of US phone book. Scanning artwork and reducing to size to fit small ads layout. Production Control inventory"
bad,My main complaint of this company was the fact that they took someone that didn’t have very much experience in the day today operations of the company and place them in a management position. There was an excessive amount of favoritism between management and friends. There was a lot of shady dealing when it came to commission and how your phones were dealt with. We were basically encouraged to miss lead our customers to drive sales. And not to mention the fact that there were many times when other associates took  advantage of my kindness and others. All of these issues on top of constantly  needing  to keep up with training on all the new devices and other personal issues I had with in the company I feel that this is a very  on professional workplace in my experience.
bad,"No processes for development"
bad,I wouldn't work here no more. its a horrible place to work. The people there has no respect for nobody they have toooo many people who work there. they do mandatory overtime and if you don't go they count it against you. they have a point system that they don't even understands.
bad,"I used to work for Verizon as a third company, Alorica for a while. I had never been more stressed in my life. Besides the fact we did not make enough, we had to deal with disrespectful customers and were told to deal with it. Often times a failed survey we were into able to dispute because of Verizon's stupid policy. Which makes the employee look bad on many levels they sometimes had nothing to do with. This is also an issue because it affects the bonuses and income of employees."
bad,"Overworked Underpaid and Poor Management. They do not recognize good employees. Pay is minimal and hours are ridiculous. I would not recommend this job for anyone,"
bad,"Unprofessional, unorganized, and not a great place to work. This job expects their employees to completely stop their lives and anything someone may have going on in their life just to work for them."
bad,I would come into to work to open the store. First I would disabled the alarm. Then check to see if I needed to make a deposit. Count the cash and inventory on phones.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work here. It is high stress, anxiety and panic attack driven. You come into work and you don't know if that day you will get fired or written up. When an incident is reported to HR anonymously the HR representative reveals your name to whoever the person is you reported. It's an environment of if, ""you're in the boys club you are untouchable."" Managers and directors turn a blind eye to fraud and stealing if you are a high performing representative."
bad,expect to work double the hours for what youre paid with no acknowledgment of your willingness to go above and beyond whether by choice or by accident.
bad,The work culture at Verizon was very stressful.  No matter how hard you worked it was never enough.  An early retirement program came along and I took it..
bad,Not a real verizon store management are sexist racist and they only care about screwing customers over for commission dont trust mobileguru they lie fake receipts and sell used iphone over priced.
bad,Checks delayed. No communication. Very poor training for entry level. Outdated policies and devices. They are always making excuses for their errors and employees suffer.
bad,Just an awful place. Everyone I worked with has left. Terrible environment. Little investment in management employees. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Run away.
bad,The managers were uncaring.  I had to eat lunch away because if I ate in the breakroom they would think nothing of making me come up to the floor to help with customers.
bad,"Just dont, I don't mean corporate I mean do not work for the franchise owned by a group of people that own the Miami Lakes, Broward Mall, Aventura, Sunny Isles and a couple other stores, their practices are ripping people off"
bad,"If you like having irate customers harrassing you on a daily basis because of other co-workers lying and cheating them, or if you dont mind doing the same, this the place for you."
bad,Change is good and training was excellent    The management was great all the A D s were out standing The benefits were great a great place to work .Cant
bad,"Verizon has the worst management on the earth. Nobody really knows what is going on and the only job that exists is placing blame. Full time employees do not work and never show up and contractors do all the work and then get blamed for all problems. It is stressful, priorities change from minute to minute and there is no clear direction on any work you do."
bad,I was happy to leave Verizon.  Work environment was very stressful.  Benefits were lacking.  Work hours were less than desirable.  No advancement guaranteed.
bad,VZW is too under staffed for the amount of work needed. Management does not know what is involved in what they are asking us to complete. There are not enough hours in a day to complete projects in the time frame they give us.
bad,every time they change the commission stricture.There goal less then 25% of reps gets commissions .We spook with top managements they don't care take it or leave it
bad,This is a very anti-union environment and so I did not feel protected and I felt that it declined after certain CEO's took over.  This was no longer a good job.
bad,Unless you are looking for something to do in the afternoon and want to get apartments doors shut in your face daily then I would apply for this job. It is a tough job.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Verizon is a life sucker.  Hours are terrible.  Working with the public sucks.  Definitely doesnt pay enough for the torture you have to live 9.5 hours per day.
bad,"Job was manageable, but there is very little room for growth. It is competitive and family oriented, but hours are long and work can go beyond the hours."
bad,Management has cut-throat tendencies. Verizon is slowing dipping in the marketplace in regards to wireless with T-Mobile and Sprint both taking share away from Verizon.
bad,"The engineers & management here are competent in what they do but have on foresight. They are probably amazing in the telecommunication industry but have no place in the tech industry. The strategy here seems to be: build every thing from scratch and pour money on an issue. Everyone is a drone here marching to the beat. Management cracks the whip and the engineers build it with no thought of integration. There are so many issues with the infrastructure, rather than an overhaul and fixing it, band-aids are used to get through the day. The only reason they are working is that no one else in silicon valley wants them."
bad,"This is a company that touts strong ethical values and integrity.  The leadership people are unethical, lack integrity and when it comes to employees they are left on the slaughtering table in order to keep the bottom line and board members happy and leadership and CEO's keep their high salary packages."
bad,"I love the free coffee, it was truly amazing.  I'm writing as much as I can about coffee because it is incredible.  Dont you love coffee too, its my favorite"
bad,"worked at the call center, closed now.  I was discriminated against by the company because of my medical condition. They are not good people to work with and want to cut you as soon as they can."
bad,My particular department had no room for growth and did not offer a conducive environment to grow.  Management at the company was a mess with nobody taking responsibility for project management.
bad,Not a fun place to work. Very stressful. No chance to advance. Pay is low. Industry is cut-throat. Not good for your psyche.  Would not recommend this job to a friend.
bad,"They failed to give me my check when the company went under. Leadership was unprofessional. In addition, the company lacked training and communication. This was not Verizon directly it was a subcontractor called AFNI."
bad,It is good management as far as District manger and higher. The store manager is very unprofessional. The pay is bad. They will sell you a dream to get you in.
bad,"New location, great place to work if you don't need a set schedule. "
bad,Verizon is so big that you dont know who your working for and they dont know you. you have a structured salary and job to do that's it you could be standing next to the guy in charge at the grocery store and he wouldn't know who you are. although you're required to know who he is. corporate work sucks
bad,Horrible strict company to work for. They give you only 2 weeks training and hawk you like crazy. It's a setup for failure and I thought it was my dream company to work for.
bad,Company is very picky hard to please you constantly had to learn the new up to date technology district manager was very hard to please. Did not like the job
bad,"High stress environment.  One needs to be in the union to have some protection.   "
bad,Couldn't keep a manager long enough. Stressful days and a lot of reprimands for not making any sales during the day only added to the stress. The whole team or individual had to write essays that were due the very next day. If I wanted to write essays I'd have stayed in school.
bad,"As a Front Desk Clerk/Night Auditor I performed all clerical duties including filing, typing, and answered phones.  I also made reservations via internet, fax and phone.  I checked guests in and out, took payments via cash and credit card.  I completed an audit report every night which consisted of processing credit card transactions, correcting billing errors, and I ensured that the money received matched the transaction totals, and I handled complaints."
bad,"Sales try to upsell to customers without telling them the real cost, not my thing, Items they don't need or want and are yelled at by management like children."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Verizon is a good place to work and learn. They have a wide exposure to technology and good work life balance. Would recommend anyone who wants to join this firm.
bad,Never worked for a company like this or been around people including management like this before;  No words to explain; it was like I was in another world.
bad,Working they is ok. But it hard to keep up since everything changes per week. Things changes weekly and it required that you know the late updates and be efficient.
bad,"Charged $40 ""fees"" on top of taxes for the phones which was extremely un ethical of the indirect dealer I work for. Horrible experience and was always on edge about losing my position for not abiding"
bad,Enjoyed working here and learning so much about technology and sales. Great work team work and support from everyone. They always work to make sure you get the training and support you need.
bad,"location bot to good looking compared to other call centers i worked at the training team is rude and disrespectful, never willing to help or will do so with an attitude"
bad,Verizon Wireless was great for me during the time I was there but we had zero work life balance with 7 days a week with variances in shifts. Opportunity.
bad,"My manager was a cut throat, steel money from you kind of guy who wanted nothing more than to fill his own pocket.  Cellular sales is a scam and doesn't deserve innocent peoples business."
bad,The company is too big. Too many redundant functions. Very little loyalty toward employees and contractors. Relies too heavily on contractors. Extremely low pay compared to similar companies.
bad,"This was the worst experience I ever had. Horrible people work there. Mean and miserable people..."
bad,"The Supervisors sat behind her every day and micromanaged her, they have employees trying to act like active duty military yelling at my wife , as a spouse poor place to work for if your going to yell at my wife join the military or go back and join the military don't yell at employees or run the company as if they were in the military"
bad,"was constantly threatened to be fired, constantly harassed by upper management, made me work seven days a week had no   time for family, constantly was threatened,"
bad,"This was the worst experience I have ever had working with any company. I was insulted on my appearance, chastised and treated as if I was not competent enough to do work that I have been doing for 10 plus years"
bad,Worked at another call center it was fantastic but the Murfreesboro center is the absolute worst and will continue to be until it decides to follow other call centers and the company decides to quit suffering from corporate greed
bad,"Work here, but don't plan to build a career here. "
bad,"The work is extremely fast paced, cut throat, stressful, promotions were made by who you knew not what you knew or how good you were at your job. However, excellent pay and benefits."
bad,This place was truly horrible to work I would never allow anybody to ever work there if it was up to me the conditions were completely horrible. There was no sense of customer service we were just asked to fly through calls like nothing they were more concerned with the call volume then customer service
bad,"in order to get promoted you either need to steal from the company, beat your wife, or endanger the lives of your children. unfair treatment of employees"
bad,This is the most micromanage company I've ever seen they treat you very very poorly everything is such a problem they fire you on a trumped-up lie you see that every day they do things that are illegal and nobody challenged ism challenge them you'll win they have a record get your lawyer when you're done cuz you're gonna need it and you don't want to live this type of life I recommend getting out while you can
bad,the telcom industry is not pay competitive. Different standards for salaried employee compared to non salaried employees. Not a very good place to work in my opinion
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,high turn around rate. micro managed and you will be over worked and never shown that your appreciated.  not a supportive place to work and that's why their closing
bad,Verizon is not a fun place to work because they are only about the business and they are out to cheat customers out of their money. Once you work behind the scenes you will not want to work or have Verizon wireless service
bad,"I came to Verizon Enterprise Solutions (wireline business) to sell their IT Services; however, they sold the business. I was an account manager (a.k.a., core sales representative).  Thus, sold network and related security management services, professional services, unified communications, digital media and content management.  ITS was my passion, however, so the sale left me less excited about the brand.  I knew VES was no longer a fit and negotiated my departure."
bad,Another company that put dollars above customer service. This position ended because I was not retrieving as much money as they required in a collections position
bad,Woodbridge Va was not a place a would ever recommend the Sr. Leadership was ineffective and incompetent. It is not a place I would recommend to anyone to work.
bad,"I worked in pre-production, as a contract employee. I was laid off due the bankruptcy.  This was a fine place to work, but I was not hired as full-time."
bad,"The management is  trash, the schedule is never consistent, the meetings are always last minute and  the employees are shady and are only after money."
bad,"The epitome of a government office being mismanaged, run by the good ol boys, poor pay, unsafe conditions, low pay and no respect. If you truly don't want to work for the people of the county you will not survive here."
bad,"i had fun here but i didnt learn anything to take to another place. the job was very one task- you answer phones, you transfer call. that was pretty much the gist off the day"
bad,telemarketing is the worst job too many people to loud every customer is mad and working this job 40 hours a week really sucked the hours are long and very boaring u sit all day!
bad,"Culture of lies and obstruction used to take money from customers is also used to take money from employees. "
bad,The pay is terrible and they expect you to work long hours with little breaks. The supervisors are not professional and they are not fair with their employees.
bad,this job was 100% commission and if you did not meet your sales goal you only go paid 1000 a month. this was not a good company to move up for.
bad,much of the work involves repetitive and mindless tasks.  there are one or 2 decent managers and you can succeed here if you go with the flow and just wait for someone to retire.
bad,Working at Verizon Call center was a horrible experience. The toxic environment and clientele made coming to work a chore. The hardest part was reporting to supervisors who did not care about your overall success or well being.
bad,"you only got paid $300/every 3 WEEKS! that is insane and worked crazy long hours on your feet. comissions were always late, workers were nasty. a very hard job to obtain when rent is due."
bad,A typical day would be visiting sites in and around London and observing the engineering that was taking place. I would then sometimes return to the office and would generally help with errands and office work.
bad,Verizon is a company that does not have a consistent schedule and you must work nights and weekends. Sales goals are demanding and force pressure upon employees.
bad,"this was a third party vendor hole in the wall, it was not safe here. IT as not a Verizon building, rather it was called TMC in Sanford Fl. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,always short staffed......loyalty means nothing.....tenure and work ethic doesnt mean sh@t!  I wasted many many years with a company that did nothing but brainwash you into believing that they were the best.
bad,I worked for Verizon for almost nine years in the Basking Ridge office. Just like any company there are positives and negatives.
bad,I would not suggest being a part of this team. I would prefer to not write anything in regards to this company due to the overwhelming amount of negativity.
bad,Discounted phone service is good. Leadership is fair. Management is  poor. Work schedules are subject to change. The call centers are closing in the USA and being outsourced.
bad,They were a bad company. They didn't help anyone. The trainers were so mean and rude. They treated certain people good and the rest were treated like garbage.
bad,I worked for this company for many years to be let go without any concern. Would not recommend working for this company. I am not a cheerleader for this company their only concern is for the bottom line.
bad,"Get a degree in ""butt kissing"". Then you may have a good shot at success. There is no support in this role, just someone to blame for issues management loves to overlook. In order to move up you have to drive sales and be unethical. Those hired in Management positions have the education level of advanced toddlers. Including the DM ...... :/"
bad,Worked here doing my senior project. The guy incharge of the company was terrible and basically told us to steal information from other sites.
bad,"people constantly coming in sick and no regards to other employees, poor management and no action taken when reporting misconduct"
bad,"A typical day began with a brief team meeting to coordinate and schedule work to be assigned to my team members.  As always, safety was discussed to insure everyone worked their scheduled workload towards a successful completion."
bad,"Inbound & Outbound phone calls from customers and assessed needs to assist customer with billing"
bad,Outsourcing and selling data-centers as well as ALL their wire-line business to the lowest bidder.  They only care about short term investment options and have imploded the business.
bad,"I very much enjoyed all my years at Verizon, but was not interested in following my position to Tulsa, OK"
bad,"Did not receive training for 90 days, which created poor student experience and placed students behind in debt due to lack of ability to serve student base. Managers were unsupportive. 50% of day spent in meetings learning the newest motivation book, which would be fine if it were occasional or monthly. This was literally every day."
bad,"There isn't much to say about this company because they were simply awful. The pay was atrocious, the hours were long, there were no good benefit packages, and management had no integrity."
bad,"A typical day at work was helping customers with their payments, questions about phones, making phone calls to non-Verizon customers to get them to switch carriers."
bad,"This place was not a good experience, 2 weeks training and then hit the floors. If you did not particularly know something, ask a friend. They would be able to steal your sale. SO rather than losing money to provide for my family. I decided to go and do it without help. I figured it out after 3 months working there. The manager also steals a percentage of your sales. So HE makes money not you."
bad,"DON'T BE A SCAB!!!! "
bad,Trouble shooting copper to fiber.  Modems router and wireless.  Maintaining Verizon plant and trouble shooting the plant  running coax lines or Ethernet and voice  hands on with customer everyday
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"- Team builds"
bad,"This Verizon is not at all good for contractor ."
bad,"Verizon has give ownership to the team to develop application proactively and get the ultimate outcome."
bad,"Verizon gives atmost priority to WorkLife Balance"
bad,Not a recommended company due to a unique and unbalanced company culture.  This company lacks diversity.  The sales practices relating to customers strives to maximize commission income and company revenue at the expense of long term client satisfaction.
bad,I would go into there main office locate on ave M for quick morning meeting which started at 11:00am and then they would give a list of house numbers called lead sheets. I would go to this neighborhood to try to sell Verizon Fios to people who already had it.
bad,"worst job ive ever held, they completely rip off customers talking them into things they dont need along with the capability of making items as much as they like. we work of commission but the company makes it so hard to meet quota it's pointless."
bad,"Management was incompetent, the company ships positions overseas to reduce American workforce. Would not work for this company again, would never purchase any of their products."
bad,"They will work you until you are about to drop dead. The comp plan is awful, gives the big guys all the money, and is almost impossible to achieve."
bad,long hours didn't get home till later not very good pay would be working for 2 weeks for not much at all wouldn't ever work there again
bad,"I can say so much about VerizonWireless great company to work for believe in taking care of their employees all the over time you like, we always received bonus"
bad,"Not a good place to work. Retail is a stressful, numbers only environment. No work life balance, decreasing commissions, yelling, getting fired over small offenses.  Verizon has NO experienced customers left. All the good have gone.  The next revolution of employees having more power will not put up with the work environment and then what? Good luck to ALL wireless retailers."
bad,"the company outsources everything and has no order or structure, management lacks management skills. none of the departments correlate with each other."
bad,"This company only cares about what you can do for the company. It doesn't care about your family or their customers. Verizon is robbing their customers on a daily bass, and they train Reps not to apologize for the pricing because it is what it is."
bad,The supervisors are not very friendly and they treat you like you are in elementary school. They micro manage you all day through monitoring you and then have favorites that they allow to do things that others are not allowed to do.
bad,"Co-workers and teams work well together.  Ability to strategize and work together as one team."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"12 Shifts"
bad,"Seating customers, talking with customers. Running register. Helping out when needed in other departments.Keeping front of restaurant clean."
bad,You have to give and give and give.  You have to be driven to learn and grow.  You don't have any family time or personal life.  24/7 it will be Verizon.  When they are done with you they will drive you out on a freight train.  The managers say and do whatever they want and the upper management team & human resources support it all.  They really NEED to get the UNION in there ASAP!
bad,Many issues with management - they are incompetent and insulting to employees.  Work/life balance is non-existent.  Most customers are nice but the few rotten apples do have their way and badger employees endlessly.
bad,Typical day is answering the customer concerns and assisting with  their issues. Each day was different but dealing with the customer was  an experience I will never forget.
bad,"Answering High calls, biling, equipment issues, issuing and making adjustments, inbound and outbound call center; monitoring calls, taking escalations; monitoring adherence reports"
bad,"•	Manage Application Specialist"
bad,Verizon Wireless is an amazing company to work for. They have a broad spectrum of job titles and requirements as well as impressive salary and benefit packages. They assist with and promote career progression and their training department (the personnel and the content) is impeccable.
bad,"Horrible place to work.  No advancement, low pay.  Left after a couple of weeks.  Inconsistent scheduling, horrible atmosphere."
bad,I was a greeter for customers who came in through the door I didnt enjoy the people there they were not friendly at all very igorant  etc It was a part time seasonal job
bad,Take inbound calls to assist with technical problems. Inconsistent hours because of system issues. Easy to get to and from work.
bad,"Z Wireless is focused on profit dollars not the customer or employee. They advertise great principles as a company however they don't deliver on their promises. There is virtually no training outside of product learning provided by Verizon. Management pushes very hard, micro managing, ridiculous hourly expectations, zero recognition for personal achievement or compensation for success. They promote/hire from outside and often promise advancement, training, and support and do not deliver. I am however grateful for the silver linings, my team was amazing. The hardest part of this position was contending with management to create a positive successful work environment for my team. Work life balance was impossible given their expectations. The most enjoyable part of this employer was the experience with Verizon and its customers."
bad,"this was one of the worst jobs i had. sever weather sirens going off, was to seek shelter and they refused to shut down while we had a funnel over head."
bad,"Call center not fit for the average person. Customer very difficult to please, managers not helpful at all, managers were told to micro-manage employees at all times. Everything was recorded from bathroom breaks to lunch breaks. Very stressful environment. Not friendly at all."
bad,Great company to work for with lots of opportunities for its employers.
bad,"The drive is really terrible daily, going to work and leaving."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"If you are ready for a sales position that is MICRO MANAGED, and no freedom this is the job for you. At the end of each day you need to email your manager how many calls you made, how many appointments were set, who are you meeting with, what is the purpose of the meeting.  The salary is terrible and commission is by far the worst it is capped every month.  This company has so much money and don't give respect to any of their employees to turnover is so high I see people come and go on a monthly basis.  "
bad,"run while you can. look for a better job. weak management"
bad,"Not a good company to work for. They make you believe that it is a nice company to work for when you started but it is not. Thinking of applying with them, don't do it"
bad,a typical day at work is hearing constant nagging & putting with BS with customers that wasn't even your fault. the management sucks you can never call in even when you are sick. you have no life its always Verizon Verizon verizon  my coworkers have been fun this job changes people especially if you work for a retailer. the hardest part is having to lie to the customer In order to sale most enjoyable part wiukd be the laughs we have.
bad,Top down management structure.  Responsibility for day to day operations removed from local management.
bad,"I did not enjoy my experience with Verizon, the company's culture and work environment did not meet my expectations."
bad,"Inbound call center, where we help prepay customers with all their need with their devices."
bad,"Long hours and hard to move in the company."
bad,my job was to assist customers with their phones and any issues they might have with their phone they also didn't train you well enough
bad,"VZW is only in it for profit. When I worked there, all they wanted was for me to work, work, work with no breaks. They drive employees with constant meetings about data and devices with zero incentives and constant guerilla tactics and fear of being fired. Horrible place to work."
bad,it was a great place to work.and the promotions was great.and making the customers happy.
bad,meeting customers needs and going over customers accounts and shipping out products and receiving new ones
bad,Negative Environment. Limited growth opportunities and pay is little.
bad,I did not like working for Verizon. They treat their employees like their customers. Like a number.
bad,It was a call center as a temporary position when I was younger and first started working. My youth added with a high stress job and having bosses who lie made this a horrible experience.
bad,worst job i ever had. too much to tell. glad the call center closed
bad,"Excellent company to work for, If I wasn't a consulant and is the only reason i am looking for a permanent position."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"I've enjoyed my job because it brought on new challeneges each day.  You never know what's going to happen and how to dealt with each situation.  Keeping your cool, remaining calm and keeping the job done makes me feel that I've accomplished something."
bad,Management was terrible and co-workers were worse.  Everyone gossiped and back stabbed each other.
bad,I did not agree with the immature sales people that were hired and the very un professional managment style.
bad,I learned alot from my peers but the higher up managment are too focused on the stock value of the company and the big fat salary of their exectives they try to squeez of you the employee with constant lay offs and stagnant salaries.
bad,This is a classic example of karma. A company who doesn't care about its employees gets what it deserved.
bad,I basically was a sales rep for the company. They shut down the store that I was in and I was one of the only newer employees so I got the cut. Very unfortunate
bad,"A day on the phone dealing with irate customers can take a toll on anyone. Dealing with people all day is nice, if they are nice. The management for this company is a joke and I would never recommend anyone to work there."
bad,Their moto is great place to work. I would rate it worst place to work.
bad,"Abuse of employees, Never pay of the hours you worked for, bad business , no lunch breaks , never pay commission"
bad,Great place to work if customer service and sales is your thing.  Management is great and highly promote growth within the company.
bad,"micro management, if you were a regular employee you got all the benefits in the world.  Contractors got none."
bad,I would not recommend it to anyone. The management was not what it was suppose to be and the previous employee was stealing from the customers. It was a disaster.
bad,no comment the managment staff the owners the work conditions the bouns structure getting paid on time  being paid correctly
bad,"Managed RACF security for data set access.Processed   code migration using Endevor. "
bad,Company went through a merger and as a result employees lost all benefits
bad,"Good company and benefits, however bad management no loyalty to employees"
bad,A fun place to work. Flex times are allowed and food and snacks are readily available
bad,"Clean up after people and help the bartenders. Fill beer and liquer,"
bad,"High expectations, outcome not very promising if not producing."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Lied about the job from day one. Said it was B2B when in fact it was door to door. All I did was drive to a strip mall, park my car, and walk from one store to the next, making cold calls to sell our Verizon Fios Software Suite."
bad,You won't be anything to the corporate Verizon. They claim they want good leaders for employees but all they make you are mindless corporate puppets. Corporations are no different than joining the military. They train you to obey and take orders. This is a great place to start if you have no mind of your own. Also they look for people who have GEDs and a GPA of 3.0 but wont accept those who have a higher education. They want leaders remember that people.
bad,good place to work and learn how to be a manger and customer service
bad,If you didn't make the cut you were severanced with Alltel/Verizon at 40% tax rate. Most who didn't transfer over were either written up prior and could not move to Verizon or just didn't want to go.
bad,Abusive and hostile work environment.  They just look for ways to get rid of people.
bad,"This company has a tolerance for ethically unacceptable behavior."
bad,"always room for movement in the company, fast pace. Great benefits and work environment. "
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company. Was a one owner store. The owner was very rude and didnt not treat his employees with respect. The store was shut down for his actions.
bad,"Answer calls.  Get yelled at for not adhering to AHT and then take more calls.  Do a rotation on a corporate team for switch work but then have all rotations cancelled due to a sudden expansion. The best part of the job was leaving work, the worst part was coming back.  The best day ever was when I quit."
bad,Diverse fast paced call center. Objective to exceed customer satisfaction level. Learned how to be efficient at multi-tasking. Very competitive work environment. Working at Verizon prepares you to deal with many facets of customer service. This company prides itself on delivering excellence. 
bad,good place too work.great work environment great workers that will help you
bad,it was fun working for the company 20 20 communication until they was bought out an cut us out the picture
bad,"great support from colleagues and managers"
bad,"a lot of phone calls, working with customer about cell phone issues"
bad,"Split shifts are very difficult, work enviorment not very pleasent."
bad,This was done already
bad,I would like to have stayed longer but my position at Verizon is about to come to end. I will miss the friends that I have made over the last two years.
bad,APAC gave me the customer service experience I needed to get my foot in the door with other companies but their values and leadership need a lot of work.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Help customers, do everything sales people would do for 3 dollars less per hour."
bad,Its a huge scheme dooooo notttttt waste your time. If you want to work at verizon go to the real corporate office.
bad,Training is too long. You dont get all the benefits unless you pass training and actually talk on the phones. Very strict company.
bad,"There is terrible management. No work/home balance. They say you can advancet within the company, but you really cant. I am a senior customer service representative who has been with the company for over 2 years. I have yet to meet someone who says they like the company. People are miserable and everyone who I have come in contact with are looking for another job. If you have a family, children, or like to have any type of personal life this job is not for you."
bad,"This company treats its employees terrible, everything is about ridiculous unrealistic goals to be met, and if you dont reach their daily goals, which 9 times out of 10, you wont, they will replace you with someone else quickly"
bad,Managment needs to value their employees more. Great work enviroment and great benefits. The hardest part of the job is getting compensated for your sales.
bad,"Verizon is a tough place to work. It is a haven for could of beens and single mothers. The management is horrible and they are forced to ""push people out of the business"". It's all about discipline. Most managers, I'd say 98% are people who couldn't do the rep job in the first place and who now try to tell us how easy it is. There is constant monitoring. Almost all our calls as well as our entire screens showing every move we make are recorded. The company will say this is for quality assurance but it's only used to catch reps not offering another stupid product that the customer doesn't need. Then you have your manager listening to you. Then you have the 2nd level sending out emails and instant messages saying they'll be listening. Then you have the 3rd levels saying they'll be listening. Then you have once a week when they'll pick one call and them every single manager on the northeast region will listen to your call and then tear it apart!!! Every manager trying to throw their two cents in saying how bad the call was. Sound fun yet? Then there's the force room. They are pure evil. They will ruin your life and you will soon grow to hate them. They are truly heartless and cold miserable people who hate reps and have no appreciation for what we go through. They will force mandatory overtime constantly. You may think great money, but once you have to do this job you will not want to work an extra minute. It's just more of a chance of getting fired. When you work at Verizon you have no set schedule. So if you have children when you kiss them good morning you will need to kiss"
bad,Not a reflection on Verizon as a company since this location was a franchise which no longer exists due to poor management.
bad,"Horrible job. Management was abusive. I had to go to work a lot of times in the middle of the night, and the security guard for the parking lot was usually asleep. No one cared. People were unfriendly and/or backstaers. What I learned was to never, ever work for them again. There was nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,"I have worked as a call center telecommunication and wireless device technician. Working with and under senior level certified Database Administrators and Network Engineers dealing with LAN, WAN and Translation support, I became involved in both first-line and back-end troubleshooting. The project management skills I have amassed while working on network outages and software conflicts enables me to work well in a team environment as well as independently."
bad,Worked daily with Business and residential customers in various environments for copper and fiber telephony.
bad,Good location but no traffic.. Wasn't happy there.. Independatly owned & called 2bmobile
bad,"These telecoms are all alike, you can interchange one name with the others and you would be unable to tell the difference. They know this and is why they are so crooked and get away with treating people the way they do. I have too many examples to list here to defend my claim - just be forewarned. Verizon is just as bad as any of them - stay away, DO NOT get sucked in their web of lies."
bad,It (Ryla)was a very unprofessional company and the employees were not a priority.
bad,"They work their employees to death. If you're not willing to work overnight, you're fired."
bad,There the worst people  to work for they are racist company and and back stabbing losers DON'T WORK HERE! Employees will cut ur throat so they will survive! The worst un manged place to work for there liars
bad,"Not a company i would refer anyone. To many plan to work with something is always changing. The supervisor were rude and unprofessional, they were more concern in being workers friends"
bad,not very good management. they are not ones that actually care about their employees or what they may need for their families. people always calling out sick and you are stuck covering not the management.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,No growth potential unless you know someone in Lake Mary.  If you are in Accounting or a CPA you are set for life there.  Disappointing regarding the lack of opportunities to grow
bad,"Strange policies, bad work experience, bad management. Engineers were expected to perform a specialist job but were treated as low level class citizen forced to work in a factory."
bad,"Bad upper management. Bad environment. Toxic attitudes all around. I wasted 7 years doing a great job for nothing really. Had a few great managers and coworkers,  but then other managers made it unbelievably bad. Sad place. No benefits. No PTO. Favoritism is a big thing here! Major turnover.."
bad,"Fraudulent company, try to changr the atores commision monthly so its not paid and then when they know they owe it takes 2 months for them to pay you. Really shady HR department.  Make aure you enjoy hanging and drinking if you want to go anywhere with this company."
bad,"management style is negative and to intimidate you. Very stressful, you are just a number there.  No room to grow too much politics. Is all about who you know. No appreciation No work-balance. Not a positive work environment. Huge turn over due to management and their unrealistic goals."
bad,"This position vwould great for you if like"
bad,"Lousy place to work. Lousy place to work. Managers are very rude, unfriendly, work culture terrible. Compensation is bad. Upper management is all Indian and they have very mean attitude"
bad,"Great benefits and decent discounts, that’s about all that’s good. "
bad,They promise all new hires a management spot and then make them compete for it but they never properly train and play favorites and treat people horribly.
bad,"You are just a number."
bad,"Deceive customers, sleazy sales tactics, horrible biased pay, no benefits other than discount to verizon phone plan. Horrible management and constant revolving door for employees. Unless desperate for a quick buck, DO NOT WORK FOR MOBVITEL!"
bad,"The pay wasn’t enough especially the commission part. The hours weren’t enough either, you can’t work any overtime. You would only have 3 employees in the store if you’re lucky, making it hard to have a life outside of work. There is no room to move up in the company."
bad,Training is AWFUL and very hard to follow. You are docked points if you use the bathroom too many times or for too long. You can get sent home for being a few minutes late. You don't sit in the same spots daily so sometimes you can't even start working fof almost an hour after your shift
bad,"Low pay, horrible management, no room for advancement,  no option for overtime. just an all around horrible experience. Don't apply there if your life depends upon it"
bad,"At the VZW owned retail stores (and resellers) the company’s only concern is to oversell service plans and sell unnecessary accessories.  Staff is required to add new lines and increase service plans, as well as oversell the number of accessories per handset.  No care is given to existing customers.  If you have morals, & integrity, only consider call centers"
bad,"Verizon only advances people with great sales records. Most of these people have terrible people skills. They consistently lie to hit unrealistic sales goals and create ghost lines. Management doesn't care as long as they get paid. You don't get recognition for working hard, just selling and nothing more."
bad,"the management is very aloof. employees are expected to meet sales quotas by 90 days of employment. I was fired for not meeting quota after three weeks of employment. the company's mission is solely to make money, and they make it very clear that they couldn't care less about their employees. although i was fired after 3 weeks for not yet meeting sales quota, multiple other employees who were known to the management to come to work high, or to get drunk while at work, were kept on because they made good sales. It did not concern managers when intoxicated employees proceeded to indulge throughout the day and then get into their cars and drive home at the end of the day."
bad,Very stressful.  No work balance or supervisory support.  You are paid well for a customer service rep but the stress and threat of losing your job is not worth the extra pay.  The company policy is the customer can say anything to you with no repercussions.  They can curse at you and call you racist names and you have to stay happy on the call.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"*Very toxic environment"
bad,work life balance is the worst I have ever experienced! Managers are money hungry jerks. All anyone cared about is meeting quotas and not what the customer really wanted!
bad,Company and management do not appreciate their employees. Works everyone hard and minimal compensation of appreciation. Work life balance is non existent and stress has made working for this company u bearable especially for the salary they pay the lower employees (non management level)
bad,Customers were treated poorly.  Workers were treated worse.  Everyone and everything is expendable because the upper management makes so much money they are completely distanced from the common workers.
bad,"Verizon wireless or rather conduent/xerox was the worst place I have ever worked. The turn over rate is at least double that of a normal call center and its no wonder with managers that call you stupid and worse in front of your whole team. The mandatory overtime ranged anywhere from 5-10 hours on top of my already 40 minimum hour shifts because the center itself had booked for more hours than they had at the end of the year."
bad,I did not like this job. I felt constantly disrespected and I simply could not work like that. I am all about equality and I simply didn't feel equal at this job.
bad,"Verizon lacks vision, the company doesnt know what direction it wants to go in.  Management does not know how to run stores.  Employees are forced to sell products under false pretences to customers."
bad,"The job itself is stressful, management is even more stressful.  Your position is always threatened with write-ups, suspensions or termination.  It is not a satisfying job at all."
bad,"Overall, Management was awful, lack of communication. There is no consideration for the fact that you are a human in this place of work. They do not allow time off for FRIEND's deaths. They will only allow time off for the death of immediate family, and you will be forced to work no matter how how many times you request a day off."
bad,"I did not like working at this particular call center because everything about it was unprofessional and disorganized. The management was awful. I did not like the fact that the work hours varied and were not consistent. I also did not like the fact that we had to do mandatory overtime because I thought overtime was optional. If there was ever a dyer need in my life to make money, Alorica would be my last option."
bad,The place is in chaos and losing money. There is constant lay offs and whoever is left gets the extra work. It is very stressful and there is no direction.
bad,about money not morals. find every reason to deny compensation and benefits. no personal life to include family and holiday time as well. horrible experience.
bad,"Management is horrible.  They promote those that are incapable, have no people skills and no education.  They also treat their employees very poorly because managers end up being bullys."
bad,"The business as a whole isn't bad as a whole but the lack of attention to detail is alarming for a 4k company, workers that don't have respect for business ethics is one thing but when management turns the other cheek then its an issue."
bad,"Unless upper leadership changes the management on the business side (B2B) of Verizon Wireless in Irving Texas, I would not recommend anyone to consider a job in the B2B sales channel.  It is a sweat shop with NO appreciation of any work one does.  They have the chosen people and they will expect loyalty but it will not help you in the long run.  It is a revolving door and they will put you on the PIP process if you do not make your numbers TWO months in a row.  They write you up the first time you do not make quota.  Not a healthy environment to work in."
bad,"There is no good culture, no growth advancement and people are out for themselves. Nobody cares about fellow work employees. Management terribly cut throat."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Used to be a good place to work but as competition has overtaken them management frantically squeezed employees and customers for profit instead of improving services to keep up. Negative outlook.
bad,"The company is like so many others in that it values the bottom line before its employees and will fabricate its own version of reality to determine how and when to fire its workforce. Though it maintains the illusion that it believes in ""Employees First"", the truth is the opposite."
bad,"I have been with Verizon for 16 years. In those years I have gained knowledge and training in many different areas of work. I also had close coworkers and management who all worked good together in any situation. Also, last but not least Verizon had a great tuition assistance plan. This plan paid %100 of all fees and gave me an opportunity to receive my Bachelor degree without worrying about paying a tuition. "
bad,"Sales office that requires you to be completely focused on sales, too much sales pressure.  Not easy to balance family/work life."
bad,the commision is not work the long hours and people that work there fake sales and will make more money then you and your working the 10-12 hour shift that they say is recommended but its required
bad,"Fun work place, great management teams. Sales environment, customer focused, great contests and promotional packages available. The most important part of job was being customer focused and sales driven. The company relocated to another city and commute was no longer working for me ."
bad,The way you are trained is not how you will be expected to do your job . The president in this region was just forced out or he would have been fired due to letting an entire  garage go after posting the best production for three years straight . Safety is not a priority with this company despite their supposed creed of it being of the utmost importance. Cant make as much money if you are doing your job safely now can you . In summary this company is a joke and hides behind high wages and good benefits but will turn on you quicker than a venomous snake . STAY AWAY .
bad,this is a great job to work if you are a college student and need a job to work around your schedule.
bad,"My review will not be so positive so I choose not to write one, I'll let the ratings tell it all, all I have to say is even if you have a doctors note which I did, this company still spied on me even though I had a doctors note and fired me because I went out to eat with my mom, because I had a broken nose."
bad,"Complacent employees, management watching its back and ample of politics. "
bad,"Multi changing in schedules, and target.  A fast pace retail environment that you learn as you go along."
bad,Some Management lack in support and overall company does nothing to support you.
bad,"After Cellular Sales of Knoxville Incorporated transitioned from contractor to employee for their Retail Sales Representatives, they are still treated as such. No paid time off or really any benefits to speak of. If the market you're working in is a low door swing market, you basically have to work thirty shifts per month to keep your head above the water."
bad,"No consideration whatsoever to the employees, a culture of RIF is pervasive - typically at least twice a year."
bad,"-Typical day at work: Take tech support calls, which were mostly pretty simple, take two 15 minute and one 10 minute break with a half hour lunch during a 10 hour shift, then go home. Had to keep stats at a perfect level, and come in to work worrying if I had a failed survey (if so, better hope it's not your 3rd in the same month)."
bad,I worked in a retail store location and I was the worse Job I ever had. Management was very unprofessional and quotas are pushed very hard. The work environment was bad. Lots of angry customers. Think twice before you apply for this job. No amount of money us worth sacrificing your wellness.
bad,management is not good they do not treat their employees good. not a good place to start or build a career
bad,I had bad experiences as customer and sub contractor working for them. I wish to not discuss.
bad,"I can't imagine a worse work environment than a Verizon Wireless corporate retail store. The product is complicated and confusing. As an employee you are making just a couple of dollars more than minimum wage but are expected to commit yourself to learning and maintaining knowledge of the constantly changing billing/contract stipulations as well as a full menu of increasingly complicated handheld devices. As this is not what Verizon is primarily paying their employees to do, the company offers minimal, if any, scheduled work time in which to do this. Verizon is only concerned with the numbers of signed two year service contracts a retail store can process. This is to the detriment of the employees and customers."
bad,A typical day at work for me: Focused on my customers and helping them and going overboard to satisfy and make them happy with me and the company.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,If you work for this company be prepared for a RIF (Reduction In Work Force) each year. I work there for 23.5 years before being RIF'ed 1/2 a year away from early retirement. Each of the 23 years there was a RIF. The corporate culture is terrible. The only employees that are happy are those that haven't been there long or are in another country.
bad,"With no loyalty to their employees Verizon is one of the worst Corporate Citizens in the work world. Perfect attendance, creating 7 digit revenue and absolute loyalty doesn't protect one from being cheated out of their livelihood."
bad,"Verizon Wireless only cares about sales. Everything else falls by the wayside. Even when I was in a non sales oriented job, I was still expected to sell and was given sales goals. And when I left, I was told that I should have joined sales and tried to make my mark in the company that way. Even though I saved the company tens of thousands of dollars a month by running a tight ship and making sure I found and corrected every error possible, it was never good enough."
bad,Find another job because this one really is going to take all the time you have. They take every single day of the week. And there is no way to get promoted.
bad,"Didn't like the hours that are forced on you. Constantly degraded, crushed, and yelled at by customers. Called racial slurs, management wants you to just deal with it."
bad,"The company has made so many changes that it seems its now meant for young people, and intentionally making veteran reps leave due to commission changes. It is no where the company it was. The management was some of the worst I've ever experienced."
bad,"No comment, I will just say that I would not work at that specific store again.  It was a bully mentality with very little management or structure.  The store was in a remote location and prospecting for your own clients was a must.  I did not like that it was commission based only."
bad,"Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for IF you don't want to work in their Retail sector. If you do want to work retail, you should not apply if you have a family, friends, or personal life. "
bad,"Management is rude, condescending and only cares to push you to reach your ridiculous sales quota in order for them to get paid themselves. Every detail of each sale is micromanaged and you are forced to push unnecessary items onto the customer. All that matters is selling, not customer service."
bad,If you want to work for the devil this is the place for you. Horrible senior leadership. Quota is impossible to make real money. That's of being fired happen daily.
bad,"Overall, I would NOT recommend Verizon as a place to work for a friend or family member, that is, if you want any kind of work/life balance. They say they offer ""schedule accommodations"" but in all actuality they end up being trash and they only consider their point of view. They encourage you to continue your education, but the minute you want to go to an actual nationally accredited university it's an issue. They also make it very difficult for you to work and go to school at the same time, which ultimately I was forced by my Senior Manager to make a decision. They also explicitly state in the employee handbook that they offer part-time employment without any note of what conditions would permit it. I was flat out denied part-time employment when I expressed my interest to continue my education, which I found to be very shady.  The same people that have been there forever keep the same shifts, so you almost always get stuck working nights and weekends as if you're at some retail or restaurant job. You typically have to be there at least 3-5 years before you have any hope of getting a somewhat decent schedule. Upon resigning, they did not accurately pay me my vacation time and they also failed to conduct an exit interview, which is standard business practice for them."
bad,"Horrible entrapment as a manager with no backing from executive management. Union runs company while employees steal time, disability cases been open and paid for 15 years on some cases. No one to save company millions on staff stealing time, safety violations, disability claims cost company millions, target managers if you don't fall in line with old managers ways"
bad,Upper management will get rid of you like it’s no big deal. They will smile in your face. But will fire you the next day. You can be doing everything right and they still find a way to be shady.
bad,"Senior Managers were crazy with power and having affairs with staff. Everyone was always afraid they would be fired even the supervisors. Insane place. People actually died from stress working there."
bad,"Verizon was an awful place to work. The supervisors were very unprofessional. They were young, for example 25 or 28 and therefore they did not know how to be a leader."
bad,"Having dental, health, and vision insurance was the best part about the job. Pay was inconsistent. You do get overtime so that’s nice, but they changed the pay structure, so over time is virtually eliminated. The managers pride themselves on being transparent, but are not transparent with employees. I had high hopes for Verizon and it was a disappointing experience. I hope others can receive a much better experience than I did."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,high sales goals and will write you up if you aren't pushy or shady. Company doesn't seem to care about their employees and will fire or replace you in a heartbeat if it means they will do better.
bad,You expected to work long hours. You will be called will on vacation and late at night. Managers will belittle and berate you during conference calls.
bad,Tech support is a hard and demanding job that they give NO proper support for from the supervisors and upper management. It’s all about the title and who you know and yes I know it’s a call center and it’s like going back to high school but for a company like VERIZON it’s a shame.
bad,"Stressful, management never around to assist with calls, you have to deal with verbal abuse from customers, When asked a direct question, management always finds a way to misdirect the question and provide an answer that has nothing to do with the question asked in the first place."
bad,Not to sound bitter but I had a friend who got their CCIE on their own time and dime. You guessed it. He left because management didn't recognize him as a brand new minted CCIE. Verizon is too big to recognize their own talent from within. I'm glad I left too.
bad,"This company favors and values kids out of school. I'm a mature employee with over 20 plus years of sales experience and felt like I was back in high school. Management would pal around with the younger set ostensibly ostracizing those who weren't part of the cool kids. Leads were given to the preferred employees as others struggled to meet sales quotas. Since the cellular market is saturated, emphasis is on selling overpriced accessories to help add to the company's bottom line. Because sales numbers are oftentimes unattainable, management would play games by having us tell customers that accessories would be free if they allowed us to charge it to their accounts and we would later credit it. Those credits were never given and irate customers would come back screaming about their bills. I have never worked for such a duplicitous, greedy organization. I cant tell you how I hate this company. I'm glad I got out when the first opportunity became available."
bad,They treat their employees horribly and make it clear every day you are replaceable. If you make too much money they try to find a reason to get rid of you so they can hire someone with a much lower salary.  Management is super unhelpful and don't assist in employee development in any way. Everyone feels so unsecure in their positions that it creates a toxic work environment as everyone is doing everything they can to ensure they aren't in the next set of layoffs.
bad,"Verizon is a very agressive, stressful place of employment"
bad,"Verizon was fair the first ten years of employment. The next five years were very difficult, I experienced a lot of hardship and pain along with depression. You will get compensated well but the price you pay physically and mentally is very high."
bad,"The one star is for the benefits ie: medical, dental and vision. They are far superior to any I’ve ever had. The company on the other hand is a different story. My main reason for leaving was the commission structure change. After 5 years with the company I lost over 20k per year with the most recent restructure. Some colleagues lost more depending on their prior performance. "
bad,"You are judged, solely, by how much you sell. If there is a slow season when no customers come in, then its your fault and your job will be in jeopardy."
bad,"Toxic work environment- Employees are being replaced by contractors, no promotions, older workers being replaced with younger, less skilled workers. Layoffs every year. Not much job security."
bad,The management (upper and direct superiors) make you scam customers into devices they do not want nor need in order to hit your monthly targets. It is extremely dishonest and does not do right by the customer.
bad,"-Typical work dad was extremely stressful"
bad,"The culture at Verizon was toxic.  Too many crabby, overworked, stressed out people who couldn't make decisions and suffered in a non-functional, bureaucratic environment. Top down management didn't understand what was possible and no regard for employees who made things happen.  NO advancement opportunities, Little job security. Very impersonal atmosphere, no comraderie or team focus.  No attempt to bring people together or help each other.  YUK!  Horrible place to work"
bad,"Everyone here from the minute I started training was miserable and told me to find another job. It was very disheartening to see how unhappy the employees here were. Training was good and extensive I will say that but once you were on the floor taking customer calls, everyone was stressed and unhappy trying to meet the statistic requirements of the company and please the customers. Would not recommend to anyone."
bad,"High racial tension aggravated by new manager.  Unfair late policy where some people were consistently late but never stepped, that is a probationary period, others were recorded daily for lateness, eventually fired.  I was not fired but left due to the overwhelming hostility encouraged by the new manager who should be fired."
bad,Supervisors aren’t always helpful. Customers are rude and impossible to work with. HR is never around to speak to when it comes to working with schedule changes. No paid time off or unpaid time off.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Management is subpar and not very knowledgeable. Nepotism is rampant in the company and unless you have connections high up in the company,  the chances of any advancement is slim to none."
bad,Not allowed to provide customer service or help with phone issues... but required to sell to every customer regardless of their need. Customer reviews are included in metrics. Unhappy customers = low commission.
bad,"Horrible KPIs that constantly change, poor management, ridiculous expectations and bad bonuses for performance. Absolutely terrible work/life balance."
bad,dose not care how employees are treated by hostile customers verry stressful enviroment saw several ppl wheeled out in an ambulence around once a week
bad,"I worked for Terremark when Verizon bought the company. Lets first start with Terremark, so we can get a feeling of the change. We worked cohesively in a team environment. We knew our job and enjoyed the atmosphere. We worked long hours, but work/life balance was good. Coffee and basic snacks were provided at no cost, and holidays were generally catered for people who were required to be in the office. Generally the skeleton crew (Support, CSR, managers, etc). We were afforded a replacement day off as well. "
bad,The atmosphere was stressful and uncomfortable and made me feel miserable. They didn't treat the employees fairly and there was no a lot of room for advancement.
bad,Verizon india has been plagued by worst leadership teams ..SPM /DH and above . Who indulge in saving their skin rather than compete with others on winning techically . Never put their foot down on the right things for their teams at any point in time
bad,"Unfortunately my experience was a combination of poor management, long hours, and low pay. With the amount of gross revenue that this company reports you would think that they would pay employees more."
bad,Immature manger and very unorganized.  Long work hours and minimal compensation.  I would definitely not recommend this company to anyone looking for work.
bad,A typical day at work was stressful. I am glad that I no longer work for them. The beneits and pay were good but not good enough to refer someone else
bad,I would not recommend verizon for employment. the culture is extremely competitive and management is always unsatisfied with what you do no matter what. the general message I got from my superiors is that no matter how hard you work it is never enough and thats how they make you feel everyday. They pressure you to work overtime and then scold you when you're stressed at work because of unrealistic customer expectations.
bad,"Abusive customers, rigid corporatist culture with misguided management and poor compensation for the stress the job demands you take on. All told, the amount of work and stress is terrible for the pay, and the psychological strain shows in the faces of every employee lower than middle management."
bad,"Who Telecom industry is changing. Verizon cares little for its long time employees that help build the company. "
bad,I only left because my team and position was eliminated.   I would love to work back at Verizon and have applied directly to some positions on their website.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Corporate culture is two-faced.  Supposedly customer focused but really just get the customer in, grab their wallet and get them out.  Absolutely no integrity anymore.  From Director level down the only focus is NUMBERS.  All retail level customer service/operations reps were disposed of as were hundreds of call center reps.  Way to show the customer how appreciated they are.   But Verizon has a nasty history of just dumping entire departments at the drop of a hat. They do it on a regular basis.   Too many cronies at the top sucking all the money out of the company."
bad,Verizon is hiring but you better come in already knowing the job or they will string you along for a couple months and fire you.  you are in competition with everyone else and management is poor at best.  Employees for fios techs are paid anywhere from $15 to $38 per hour.  New guys who are paid $15 are expected to have the same numbers of productivity as new guys making $30 because they have had prior experience at other companies.  All they are looking at are numbers and if you aren't in the top then they say goodbye.  managers  are either incompetent or overwhelmed and provide no additional training to new employees
bad,"High call volume, high pressure to push products and sell, long hours and very stressful, very little break time for amount of time you were working a shift"
bad,"As is typical for a large organization, they became short sighted and blew up most of the environment for nothing.  Got let go along with 75% of the other people in our division, including an entire building, so they could ship our jobs to Eastern Europe and India."
bad,"30% of the people do the work here while the rest watch."
bad,"do not work here. unfair treatment, low wages. turn over rate is high. conduit global was a 3rd party call center that I worked for. no regard for employees"
bad,It is a highly stressful job. You will have incompetent management on a daily basis. There is a lot of back stabbing and under handed things going on. The call center runs rampant with gossip and infidelity. They suck you in by giving decent pay and benefits but expect you to do slave labor.
bad,"issues with my checks. issues with management and retaliation from management after reporting issues to HR. the issue with my pay never being resolved as a direct result of poor management. It was no pleasant, very drama orientated, it felt like high school instead of the work place."
bad,"Constant job cutting and moving to FL & OK for the accounting & Finance, No consideration of experienced employees. Good benefits and annual increase if you are performing."
bad,"Toxic environment, constant downsizing, bad management. Through almost 20 years the best I can say is the check was always deposited on time. Non Unionized work force is forced to give up benefits for lazy union do-nothings."
bad,It seemed that they would re-invent the wheel every day. They would go through the same issues and problems that they had the day before. Very strange work environment.
bad,"Overworked, well underpaid, management doesn't care. Training is very good and motivates you until you get to the floor. Events are fun but that doesn't fix management"
bad,"They cut our pay and never even told us. I was printing out my pay stub and noticed it was $0.60/hr less than it should've been, and it had been changed for a couple of pay periods before I noticed. I confronted management who said nothing on it."
bad,"Blue collar work culture."
bad,"Like all Major Telecoms it's you vs the customer vs the company. Will throw you under the bus to save face. If you want to be happy with this company I recommend not working Customer Service, or Technical Support."
bad,Verizon is not what it used to be.  They are having a hard time staying competitive and we were loosing customers to competitors.  The customer laid a lot of people off.
bad,"GTE/Verizon were a cohesive group who worked well together to further the companies success.  Since Frontier took over many things have changed but I don't see how it can be for the betterment of the company, but I hope I am wrong.  There are still some really great people who work there who deserve a stable future."
bad,Quotas are too high to meet goals causing employees to bring home less commission. Laying off employees causing the employees left to have to carry more work load.
bad,The hours are long. Not enough employees to work at a store with too many tasks to complete. Very high stress place to work. Pay was not enough for the amount of years I was there.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,people with seniority were given special perks not attainable by everyone. A lot of favoritism in this job and the company was not understanding to newer employees with illness or family emergencies
bad,"very competitive, all sales. They will delete your position and fire you without any notice. Have had coworkers who were employed for 10+ years who got laid off without any notice"
bad,Verizon is management heavy and will use all of its resources to monitor employees. The company hates its workers but keep some because they are a necessary evil. The workplace culture is full of hatred. Managers hate employees and use GPS to monitor every move. If they cant get you on something they make it up. It seems the company does everything in its power to make you hate your job.
bad,"Poor culture, low career advancement opportunities. Would not recommend verizon wireless as a place to work on a permanent basis. Customers aren't that bad but the culture and career advancement opportunities are poor."
bad,"Company didn't care about what you knew and what you could produce.  Always played a numbers game.  Management was poor and not helpful at all.  Company was great to work for in the beginning, however, went downhill very fast."
bad,"Low pay compared to industry standards. Lack of any company culture at all. High chance of layoffs. Hardest part of the job is being 120% allocated and then having another 75% or more added to your plate after layoffs. Strike duty was stressful. If you're not in a Union at Vz, you will not make any money."
bad,Scary culture. Lost sense of purpose while there.  Found it hard to feel job security. Great work facility though. Hard to get advancement.
bad,The transition to Frontier was not smooth and it doesn't seem to be getting better.  Legacy Frontier execs did not seem to have a grasp of what the issues were during transition or how to fix them. Their leadership style is militaristic and they weren't interested in implementing others' ideas.
bad,"For a non gun policy workplace. that was violated. Parking lot during clocking in or out was bumper cars with accidents daily. Upper management was too busy in meeting about why they was having so many meetings. No pen policy meant that the only thing you had was a shelf, not even a desk. Left shortly after due to safety. 3 training classes 25 per class with a simple rule of keep your cellphone in your pocket dropped to 22 grand total in less than 2 weeks."
bad,Verizon hides behind glitter and slogans. They don't fully train their employees. A very stressful job if under the wrong supervisor. No union which means they can treat you what ever way they choose and your word against them and regardless they stick together
bad,"Verizon made it loud and clear from the outset - the company was at the center of the universe. I felt as if I was living through George Orwell's novel ""1984"" - I was in the perfect TOTALITARIAN STATE and Big Brother was always watching! In short I did my job and just went home."
bad,"A typical day was riddled with stress from abusive customers and management. The company forces you to deal with highly abusive customers on the phones and then reprimand you for ridiculous things. For example, if you use the bathroom outside of scheduled break times, you are in big trouble for being out of adherence and may be written up as a result. You are only allowed so much sick time and vacation and once you are out of that time, you are expected to be at work regardless if you've experienced a traumatizing family emergency, life threatening illness, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we were given time off the phones for various activities.While you do get a lengthy training before going on the phones, the training was poorly done, making you constantly question everything you do for customers after training is complete. A few coworkers that I talked to at the time, myself included, ended up having to go to the doctors due to stress induced anxiety (caused by the conditions of the job) that caused us to go on medication. When speaking to local doctors, once they hear about where you work, they refer your stress and anxiety as ""verizon syndrome"". My doctor has said they have several other patients that work there with the same issues. Due to the multitude of medical problems that were being caused from the abusive and poor management conditions, I left within four months of working there. Talking to people who currently work there, things have not changed.  I would not wish this job on anyone! Having panic attacks in your car before you walk in the building"
bad,"generally, a fast paced work environment,Tons of positive learning and excellent customer interaction.A typical day would consist of installation and maintenance of customers networks.Co- were highly motivated to complete jobs in a timely manner.Inclement weater was always a challenge,but the smile and satisfaction of a customer made a feeling of accomplishment.i basically made the transformation from bassi to fios"
bad,Worst call center in the Sacramento Region.. Expectations don't match the scope of the job. Management clueless and don't care about the moral of the employees.
bad,"Many layoffs with poor communication on company goals.  No job security or benefit of contributing to the company.  Due to many organizational changes, there are many unanswered questions."
bad,a typical day would involve me greeting numerous customers and entering them into a que fixing minor phone issues and complaints
bad,the verizon located in green cove springs is a reseller of tcc wireless. They dont tell you your pay or that you dont get any benifits untill you start your first day and your traped there. There comp plan is a joke you will never make comission in this store because you are seeing 4 to 5 customers a day if you are lucky.  The manager and area manager are a joke you will get no help and if you do something wrong that you werent taught they get angry like little kids and hang up on you or call and bother you all day. Your pay is 8.00 an hour and thats not including your not getting 40 hours your lucky if you get 30. What ever you do stay away from this verizon it is a big mistake with children running the store. They make alot of promises but dont keep any. Go to corprate or cellular sales stay away from here
bad,"Verizon used to have great benefits.  Management are like hovering helicopters over your shoulders waiting for you to step out of line so they can find an excuse to put you on a discipline program.  Don't ever get a cold or any sickness that is not FMLA approved. Pay is good considering where you live, being that most of your money will be spent on the commute to and from work."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Tuition reimbursement is best benefit but unfortunately once you obtain degree you are more educated than your average Manager.
bad,On a typical day I browse the internet looking for ways to innovate that will never get funded.  The managers don't care about you and the work is pointless.
bad,"horrible place to work, if you dont kiss but you go no where , management is the worse  , save your time go work somewhere else"
bad,"Providing great  customer service , talking with customers to see which phone is most suitable for them , having class workshops in case someone doesn't know how to work there device, going over technical issues with customers."
bad,Company does not care about employees at all. They have strict requirements and not adequate training. Management claims to care but they really don't.
bad,"If you take a job in the call center on the phones, this is the worse job you'll ever have! Consider it a paycheck, but keep looking for something else.  I have never worked in such a negative environment where every second had to be accounted for.  If you came back from break or lunch so much as a few seconds late, you would have a supervisor at your desk the next day threatening you to watch it or else.  "
bad,"the general manager would edit my time clock punches taking hours away from my pay checks, i have screen shots of sales recipts and internal documents to prove said accusations"
bad,"I did not work long for this company due to it being 100% commission and no room for advancement. This was a sales gig and a typical day would be to go in the field around the area to promote sales for local business owners. Many business owners were extremely busy dealing with clients, maintaining daily functions of the business, and did not have much time to hear from a sales representative. De-escalated angry customers, mitigated their needs to make sure they were happy with the service. I enjoyed most being able to talk to the customer and carry out strategies to make them more happy to be with our company."
bad,"corporate only cares about how much money they make, customers and employees are dismissed"
bad,"Good things about Verizon is there is a secure work environment, the benefits are okay."
bad,Things have changed and the expectations of management are above and beyond what a single representative can do.  Yes the pay is wonderful but definitely not worth the stress
bad,"Bad culture, management and will literally cause health issues!!!!"
bad,"A day at Verizon consists of daily sales, but more and more the company wants you to sell more but pay you for less of the sales. Half my sales don't actually count as sales. They then added other responsibilities such as conducting workshops for customers and doing tech support none of which gets compensated.  They don't train you to do these things either just expect you improvise.  Base salaries have gone from 60 to 70k down to 50k while responsibilities and expectations keep rising.  The job does not have a lot of advancement either. On a positive note the benefits are great."
bad,"My professional experience with Verizon Wireless began in their call center in Dublin, Ohio and I was promoted in 6 months to a consumer sales position and promoted 6 months later to Business Sales Associate, Hilliard, Ohio  I found the leadership and management to be very positive and they encouraged growth and professional development.  I accepted a promotion to Business Sales Executive with Verizon Wireless in 2006.  I moved to Schaumburg, IL and worked at the Verizon Wireless Corporate Headquarters.  I only left Ohio because my only sibling was diagnosed with breast cancer and she had lived in Illinois for over 30 years. My professional experience at the Verizon Wireless Corporate Headquarters was very disappointing.  I did not find it to be a positive experience, as the management style was anything but nurturing.  I felt leaving Verizon Wireless to join DeVry University was one of the best career moves I had made."
bad,"unfortunately this company is going through numerous Re-Orgs that is causing far too many problems for contractors. one minute you are confirmed that your contract is good for a year and the next you're Re-Org'ed and because the direction is different, you are no longer needed."
bad,"Pros will be the health benefits,401 k, dental, bonus, vusion etc."
bad,"The above is far from the truth. Your job is far from secure. Your on the job learning is actually your way out the door. (They call this ODD for ""Out Da Door"", and yes, they actually say this) They do not care about you as an individual, only as the sales you bring in and a host of statistics."
bad,This work place is stressful all they want is numbers numbers numbers and if you do not deliver you will be written up and then fired.
bad,good network but no so great company.  Never really knew what was going to happen next.   Management and policies changed weekly.   Felt like you were stuck in your position and never given chance to move or improve.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Answered a variety of incoming calls from customers regarding their wireless accounts. Responsible for researching and resolving complaints to ensure customer retention and satisfaction.  Provided technical troubleshooting, billing and general solutions.  Promoted the organization’s products and services.  Ensured timely and accurate problem resolution during the initial call.  Demonstrated knowledge of commonly used concepts, practices, and procedures within the field"
bad,"Typical day at work very busy, diverse and interesting. I learned how to input payroll, process budget expenses, manage budgetary departmental expenses, operate accounting software. My co-workers for the most part were awesome, could get assistance anytime with any issues, most difficult part of the job, the transition from GTE to Verizons work culture. GTE was a very employee friendly, warm environment, positive cultured company enjoyed working for them.  However, Verizon very management focused, rigid, nose to the grind stone, gather bricks with no straw type of company.  Hated to leave at the end of the day when it was GTE, but when it was Verizon, could not wait to go home."
bad,"Management is very professional and makes the position enjoyable. The job security is quite high, however there is not alot of room for job advancement for an individual to use a technical degree. "
bad,"Typically as Store Manager I would open the store, check the inventory and cash register and get our systems and equipment operational. I learned how to maintain my own team of 2 employees and troubleshoot errors with equipment belonging to customers, while also mantaining store integrity for previous issues or other store complications."
bad,While Verizon works hard for its stockholders it is not good to it employees. There was no time in my 17 years with Verizon that I felt valued as a person.
bad,"Managers at certain stores do absolutely nothing for you, they micro manage, they take credit away from you to advance themselves, they create there own rules and do not follow the core values that Verizon has in place. Eden Prairie Store is the worst place to work, as they have lost over 40 employees in one and a half years. Go to Minnetonka or Bloomington store if you want to be treated fairly and like a person. Eden Prairie is a sinking ship."
bad,"A typical day included being assigned multiple time consuming tasks, and be expected to complete them while on back to back conference calls. During and between, manager would message and call each staff member demanding an update. Employees often refused to be promoted due to abusive manager."
bad,I think Verizon is a great company as a whole but needs to keep a closer eye on their management
bad,"keeping all balance sheets, ledgers information up to date on monthly and quarterly basis."
bad,"Verizon has a long way to go to redeem itself before its customers. Unfortunately, they believe automating everything will solve customers' complaints for poor service. It won't. So if you're in Sales, much falls on your shoulders to fix, while being pounded to make your numbers. The stress makes life miserable."
bad,Have supervisors that are very unprofessional. Management team pick and choose employees that they work with. Very deceitful. They're always looking for ways to find things wrong with your work.
bad,"A dead end job. they will ask the world of you and continually put you down and tell you our efforts are barely worthy of maintaining your employment. high turnover, and bureacracy laden. the only way to advance is by politicing, as results are not valued. It may look enticing, but look elsewhere unless you like being treated like a child, and forced to ""drink the Koolaid"""
bad,"Union and company work together instead of the union working for the employees(all politics) . Management would force employees to rip customers off by tricking them into a contract when the pricing was incorrect due to system issues and never would fix them  they’ve been sued multiple times but just figure out new ways to rip more customers off since they have big corporate lawyers! There’s no job stability, you go to work everyday wondering if today will be your day that the management call you in the back for a suspension or to fire you. Management constantly bully’s you, harass you daily, threaten you , there’s been management that sexually harassed employees and never got in trouble for it"
bad,"If you want a job where the compensation plan gets cut every six months go to Verizon. Secondly, you will hear a lot about how much money reps make. Understand that they are talking about two years ago."
bad,"Under the direction of new CEO there is a GREAT, new vision for Verizon. It’s a shame with all the exciting plans that he has - and will accomplish - that the employees don’t come in fully pumped to do their jobs."
bad,"awful management, high stress, always changing the rules to make it more difficult than necessary, high turn over, sales teams are "" boys club"", very politically motivated and favoritism always being shown"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,They only promote if it is good for certain yearly numbers not based on who is best for the job. They make examples out of people even if they didn't do anything wrong. I've never worked somewhere that is so bias based on certain aspects of an individual.
bad,"Working for Verizon was the worst experience I have ever had as an adult. Management is focused on one thing, advancing themselves, and employee health, wellness and happiness are given no second thought. Employees are well compensated and receive excellent benefits, but they are treated as chattel, just a number in some executive spreadsheet."
bad,Verizon pays you about 6 dollars more for the job title of customer service as its related to the job market BUT... the workload you do is for 5 people  so really your vastly underpaid  the customers are disgruntled from long hold times and yet you’re responsible for rebranding when the customers hated the experience long before you came along  the technology rarely works and before they solidify the old tools they’re making changes to new tools  find a company that appreciates you enough to TRULY compensate you for all that you do
bad,"This company got me on board with the promise of integrity, flexibility, open door policies to speak freely.. "
bad,"high stress"
bad,Run away.  I experienced so many good sales professionals leave the company after making their numbers for so many years.  The company has been sued so many times by former employees.  They have sold so many business units they couldn't manage well.
bad,Not a place for growth and advancement. Job compensation is a very slow climb. Company benefits are not the greatest at all. The overall work atmosphere is laid back.
bad,"If you are a woman and ever have any plans of starting a family or prioritizing your family THIS IS NOT THE COMPANY FOR YOU! As long as you’re able to be “one of the guys”, you’re good but the second you show an ounce of femininity, your days are numbered."
bad,Seemingly random write-ups and conflicting instructions to the point where you can't do your job without fear.  Management is unable to give advice on not getting disciplinary action after multiple questions on the subject.
bad,This company was good for the experience but in my personal preference not for the long run. They tend to expect more rather than appreciating your hard work and dedication as you are already improving. it was indeed a good learning expierience while it lasted.
bad,"Your life it Verizon is really determine on what position you have. It can be great for travel if that’s what you’re into. What can be terrible when you’re stuck at a store for 10 to 12 hours with bad leadership and lazy employees. They are always on board with the latest trends, as far  as if it’s women’s work rights, if it’s a minority group they’re all on board. Verizon tends to favor women and minorities for promotions for advancement even though they are not qualified."
bad,"If u wanna grow in Verizon vdsi, u have to do something to ur manager. If not u will retire as an agent. Performance doesn't matter in Verizon. Better don't choose Verizon"
bad,"Verizon pays very well, but does not treat its employees very well.  The culture is in need of an overhaul.  What is portrayed in the media and what really goes on, is a totally different story.  I met many great people along the way."
bad,"Verizon Telematics as a whole is a complete and utter mess. The original software developers, who created the software that every single customer of theirs relies on, were released once the software was created. They then brought in new devs who had to start working on figuring everything out, but the time I was laid off the place was no better than when I started. There is zero job security regardless if you were a contractor or an actual employee. If you need a paycheck then go ahead and work there, but keep looking for a better job."
bad,"Working at Verizon you are merely just a number. They do not care about you. You can’t take days off or use any personal time. If you try to take time off management is constantly calling you having you deal with customers to meet/exceed quota. Quota continuously increases making work/life balance impossible. They will move you wherever they want without notice, even hundreds of miles from your home and expect you to just make the commute."
bad,It’s not a good place to work. Lots of drama and if you don’t click with the team they will take you out. It was very stressful working there specially the last year and a half
bad,The management team failed to recognize their core competency.  The Verizon product team failed to deliver a competitive product that worked.  Data center technology was overpriced and underwhelming from a capability standpoint
bad,I have been with the company almost 3 years for the second time and they used to be much better. They have some issues with diversity and their employee to management ratio does not match when it comes to race.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Their loyalty to long term employees is dismal. Advancement is nearly impossible. They would rather hire new to the company so they can find people they can mold into the image they want.
bad,Aggressive and not customer driven. Sell even if it's against the customers best interest. No culture. You are literally just a number to the company. Extremely corporate.
bad,"The call center is demoralizing, stressful and draining. The pay is why people for as long as they do. If you enjoy being put down for your mistakes as everyday as soon as you come into work then working in this call center would be okay."
bad,It could be a good job if not for the management. The money and benefits are good. The job and micro-management are the worst. I never worked for a company I had zero respect for.
bad,"Almost everyone is seeing a counselor for depression and stress.  Horrible management micromanaged ie how many times you go to bathroom, calls per day, sales revenue per call, they hold after call surveys over your head, performance effects what schedules you work...  I have been working here for over 15 years. It used to be an ok place to work,  now I hate going to work. I pray every day to get thru my day hour by hour. We deal we rude ungrateful customers that back you in a corner and management is not  supportive at all. Verizon is not a company that has your back. Management will do what they can to save their the job. Dealing with screaming ungrateful spoiled customers really takes a toll on your health.  Management doesn't care about reps. The moral is ruined beyond repair.  No job security they have been down sizing for years now. Hiring outsources and getting rid of intern employees.  I don't recommend VZ it will destroy you mental health and wellbeing.  Run as fast as you can"
bad,"If you work hard and don't upset anyone you'll be fine. People who are okay with nepotism, cliques and but-kissing will move up the ladder the fastest. Pays great, though."
bad,Will not work for company again or recommend to others. Started great but over time commissions decreased. Some GMs do nothing but act like a GM and have no accountability. Many HR issues that don’t get resolved.
bad,If you’re not liked by management you’re labeled as a “problem child” whether you are or aren’t one. They want you to act like robots and not express any emotion. They’re very  judgmental.
bad,"When I started working for Bell Atlantic the job was secure and I felt appreciated for my work. I would be given assignments or work orders through the dispatch department and I would go and complete them whenever possible. If I weren't able to complete a job then I would refer any unresolved issues back to dispatch after explaining the situation to my immediate supervisor or foreman and getting the go-ahead from them. I learned a lot about running large cabling in various places as well as participating in the construction side of the telephone systems throughout the city. I installed and maintained both fiber optic and copper line wiring and connections and I had almost daily contact with a variety of customers both residential and commercial in nature. Over the years these interactions have helped me grow a great deal as well. However, since Verizon had taken over the job has gone from bad to worse. They deliberately made our lives difficult in many petty and unnecessary ways. Even though they are making more profits now than at any time since the company began, they felt the need to reduce our benefits and overtime hours. The work itself was great and I loved the technical work and being at the forefront of modern communications technology. However, because of the constant harassment by upper management and inconsistent availability to work overtime hours, I am not sad to leave. In the end, it's a bad sign when the most enjoyable part of the job is signing out and going home."
bad,The pay was great at Verizon but the company puts a lot of stress on you.  The benefits offered were some of the best I have ever had.  The management was horrible at my location in Irving TX at the telesales center call center.  You were rewarded and praised if you were a great sales rep but sold fraud to fraudsters calling in for service.  Monthly sales goals were based on selling fraud.  Just like any big corporation its all about politics and if your liked or you kiss butt then they are on your side and will take care of you.
bad,Verizon is not a god organization at all to work . Very nasty work culture . No work life balance. Poor management . Lack diversity .no innovation. Unhealthy work culture.
bad,Verizon is nothing more than another steam shop number pushing call ctr that no longer appreciates great customer service or the ability of individuals.
bad,matrix was out of control too confusing  some of the Management should never be in that authoritarian position. Some don't have the knowledge nor the business to be in front of the customer base.
bad,"I worked at Verizon for three years. I have no idea how I made it that long. I’ll start with the good. The insurance is amazing. "
bad,"Terrible management, changing schedule multiple times throughout my year of employment, mostly contractors who's job security was numbered at best. Everything is moving to India. Good luck getting hired to full - time / non-contract position"
bad,"In order to meet cost reduction targets, voluntary separation is now in effect for FY2018 through FY2019.  The company is focusing their primary business toward initiation of 5G service by FY2020."
bad,"The company says they reward management for performance but unless you are friends with someone who is looking out for you (obviously not based on your skill or performance) this is not true at all.  This company is filled with nepotism. "
bad,"Fast paced position however training was long and dull and does not prepare you for half of the situations on the phones you will incounter. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Very bad company to work for.  Work/life balance is atrocious.  For those on the front lines, staffing is so low that the paid time off that you accrue over years is impossible to take.  For those higher up, you are expected to drop everything to travel no matter how it affects your family.  The feeling you get is that the company uses the pay and benefits as a way to justify terrible treatment of employees.  I've been in the company for 12 years and leadership here is seen as the use of intimidation and tyranny over employees rather than true teamwork and collaboration.  The concept of what constitutes leadership is quite frankly lost on this company.  Positions are left open for months while people who interview sit in limbo.  It's quite obvious why this company is floundering and having to lay off employees.  What is left out of the news is the large number of people who are leaving on their own accord due to the culture and work environment."
bad,"Terrible work life balance, very corporate atmosphere, stuck in there way of doing things, leadership does not have proper direction at times. Our corporate bosses that saw over us remotely from New Jersey and California were not good people."
bad,"typically work starts at 12 pm and ends at 9 pm. telecom domain and all the projects are realted to telecom and retail ."
bad,"Not a good commission plan, no benefits, and need to work long hrs to hit commission goals. The people that you work with are the only things that make the job bearable."
bad,"When they took over my cellular company, the only way I could continue to work for them was if I relocated away from my family. All they cared about was making money at the expense of the customer.  All the customer was to them was a $ and nothing more.  I would not ever work for Verizon again and I got out of cellular because of them."
bad,"Not a great job to advance your career. Management was run for poorly. It seriously depended on who you know. I think for a sales agent starting in your career, you may be fine, but do not stay longer than 6 months."
bad,"Company is not what it use to be. Many riffs. Struggling to keep up with being a ""modern"" company and adapting. Old school vibe and out of touch executive leadership."
bad,"It's great if you have no life and are willing to give your whole self to Verizon. They want someone who will constantly drink the ""kool-aid"" and if you don't they will replace you with someone who will. Management would routinely cuss out their employees and were so unprofessional. Just full of self-absorbed pricks."
bad,A typical day is spent from start to finish trying to answer the hundreds of calls waiting in queue. There is no down time in this position and will cancel any meeting/training put on the schedule.
bad,Lack of follow up on promotions. too many movements required of employees even when employees cant move locations due to complications. lack of empathy
bad,verizon is a very stressful company to work for and the supervisors and manager never on the same page stressful meeting the quota sales every 3 month the paid is fair good but very stressful and manager and supervisors they contradict themselves upper management is not coordinated managers and supervisors need to get organize get in the same page  poor communication on what supervisor  is telling you to do then manager tells you something different
bad,"Infighting between the Technology and Product sides of the company is constant.  There is no consolidated roadmap or unified vision as to what the company wants to accomplish.  Communications within the company are horrible and those that have ideas as to how to remedy such issues are ignored and eventually released.  Resource managers do not support the practices and processes that the business states it wants in place.  Verizon Telematics is a subsidiary of Verizon Wireless, however there is little to no support from VZW to the point where VZT is considered the red-headed step child.  In addition, VZT is very quick to replace qualified American workers with low skill, offshore contractors.  Due to these issue, among many others, their core product, HUM, is of low quality and provides no value to the consumer."
bad,"I prefer to just forget my time working there.  It was too stressful, your were recorded, monitored, and disciplined so much that it got to a point you wanted to give up.  During reviews, they always would point out what you did wrong, never a positive experience, and never told you what you did right."
bad,"Verizon is horribly mismanaged. A very, VERY negative workplace culture. Common sense is not welcome here. I highly recommend not wasting your time with Verizon."
bad,"Undependable system tools. lockouts, system freezing and crashes. unacceptable for a so called technology company. "
bad,There is nothing good to say about this company. I only filled this in because the website made me. I would not apply for a position with them ever again.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,The environment is not employee-friendly. There are no group gatherings or social events (even around the holidays) and most employees were not especially friendly. I think this is because the company is not doing well due to overpriced services and therefore not hiring enough staff which in turn causes people to be overworked (and grumpy!).
bad,"If you can work 72 hours a week and wait to get paid for a whole month go for it. Its very competitive, and there are favorites. You work long hours with little to no work life balance."
bad,"this job was a primary part of my life. "
bad,"Verizon has changed and based on poor leadership decisions, they reduced our compensation drastically over the last year. We're paying for those poor acquisitions and it's unfortunate. I used to love my job."
bad,If you have an education do yourself a favor and try to find a job somewhere else.  This job sucked the life out of me for 4 years and then decided to relocate and I was either forced to make my family move out of state or find another job.
bad,TCC used to be a place I was proud to work for and had a culture I believed in. Recently everything has changed and you have to be unethical to keep your job.
bad,90% of time working on politics and 10% of time on actual works.
bad,Stressful job with misinformation at the forefront.  Helping customers took a distinct backseat to selling products with a poor performance track record.
bad,This company is constantly cutting positions and closing corporate stores and opening authorized dealers. They only care about there bottom line and no matter how long you've worked for them won't change the fact that you are only a number to them.
bad,very hostile environment. Where management was non existent but were always around whenever they found something to nit pick on.  There were many managers who had no clue how to do any of the employees job.  Thus resulting in poor customer support and long delays to resolve issues that needed upper management to authorize or  address with other management.
bad,"Upper management showed favoritism. No room for advancement, Positions given to agents below performance level. Building covered in black mold inside. Minimal parking."
bad,"commission goals that are unrealistic and no information on why they are what they are. ex- bigger busier stores with less goals. If you do well they love you today, tomorrow its do more, be better, and you are noone."
bad,Productive but could use more friendly environment. Verizon provides a good work environment but could use a more friendly environment. The threat of lay offs is always looming over your head.
bad,"Verizon is by far one of the most bureaucratic organizations I came across during my time there. If you are part of the network team you will be overwhelmed with the workload. The work culture is result oriented but negative in terms of how you need to deliver to survive your daily job. New employees don't get any type of mentoring or support to deliver their projects. Apart from your intellect you also have to play company politics to get the job done. Once they take every ounce of energy out of you, you will unfortunately be let go."
bad,"Don't work for Verizon. Low pay, mediocre benefits, poor organization, complete chaos. They are well below the industry standards for pay, across the board. You can give your life to them and they will lay you off without a second thought. Very poor company culture and severely lacking in employee appreciation."
bad,"verizon is following in the footsteps of sprint. they are making horrible business decisions that are costing employees jobs. employees use to come first at verizon, the culture now is layoffs, more work, more responsibility, high pressure, and poor leadership."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"They spend too much time kissing each other's butts and no real development of people.   You can be a hard worker, loyal to the end, willing to help out whenever needed...and it doesn't matter.  If someone doesn't like you, you won't get anywhere."
bad,it is hard enough trying to help customers over the phone that are abusive and disrespectful but on top of that you have management that micromanages and are always setting the reps up for failure.
bad,"This is a party place for friends, you have to be friends with the managers and/or supervisors to advance. No one is on one accord. They need better work standards, progress reports."
bad,Verizon Wireless is a Toxic Work Environment. It alleges it promotes diversity but does not there is a serious under belly of intimidation and constant hostile workplace setting if you do not fit in  or take the unwarranted remarks you will encounter problems.
bad,"Best part of the job is everyday is a new day. Every customer interaction is completely different from the last. I handled everything from customer service, technical troubleshooting, sales, to ordering office supplies. I enjoyed the overall job, and the duties of my job.  I did not care for upper management, and how they handled work place complaints. I also did not enjoy how employees are treated. I did not feel as if they valued. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is fixing the customers issues no matter the size."
bad,"Complete disconnect in channel communication. No advancement opportunity unless you want to relocate to only 3 states. Constant changes in pay structure with no explanation, and no understanding of how we get paid."
bad,"love the work...being outside and not in one place all day...the company does not value it's employees at all. it seems upper management's focus is to catch techs doing something wrong, not solving problems to help us."
bad,no job stability verizon hires and fires whoever they want for no reason. changes everything everyday no stabiity whatsoever
bad,"Positives - Training and Education"
bad,Management in the call center was horrible..  They were not trained in how to effectively develop teams and were continually harrassing staff...
bad,Directors and Vice-Presidents didn't have a clue how to implement a large system.  Several Vice-presidents were requested to do the project and had very little success.  Contractor ran the project and it required the company to spend several millions of dollars to implement.
bad,This company clearly puts itself above it's employees. Management merely uses the employees to further their own needs.
bad,"•	As an employee I provided superior customer service and sales experience. My responsibilities included answering and directing calls, resolving discrepancies, meeting or exceeding sales goals, tending to customers phone inquiries, recommended products for customers based on their needs, and providing accurate and extensive information on Verizon Fios products."
bad,"As a former employee in South Burlington, Vermont location, I can tell you, its a dead end road. There is no room for advancement anywhere and the management staff will cram metrics down your throat on a daily basis until you scream.  Most employees have gone out on Short Term mental disability at some point in there career at this location. As an employee for 6 years, I can tell you, I have seen over 60 + employees come and go from this position, all leaving Verizon because of work environment and lack of support in this location."
bad,"-Door-to-door sales"
bad,Management is cutthroat and unrealistic. They set ridiculous goals for you the employees and want you to exceed your targets. Always feel like you are in trouble or going to get fired. District managers are clueless. It's all numbers numbers numbers. Pay plans will change when too many people are hitting numbers and getting multipliers...the higher ups will change pay plan on you so you don't get the $ next time around. You accept the new pay plan or you don't work there anymore. Too much BS.
bad,Poor values from management for the retail section of this company.
bad,"pay and benefits are great. However organizational culture, management, job security/ advancement, and work-life balance options are low."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"good benefits.... that is the ONLY plus...... if you want a stressful job, not knowing from one day to the next who will be terminated- you will LOVE VZW"
bad,"Terrible, don't do it, unless you enjoy having no personal life, and being treated like dirt."
bad,Answer incoming calls from customer in call center concerning everything from troubleshooting phones to bill questions.
bad,first 14 years was great . last two were pretty rough. company wanted to close our location and instead of firing you or laying you off they would write you up repeatdly over small stuff that made no difference n hopes you would quit. Then they would suspend you for a week in the middlle of a week so you would be shorted two weeks of pay instead of one just another tactic hoping you quit
bad,"Advancement is only for management. The call center shuffles you around from entry level position to entry level position, 10 years later and you're still on the phones. Management shows favortism and they micro-manage to the point the job becomes difficult. I loved the cafe and training opportunities but I have such a sour taste in my mouth from this job. I excelled and was successful in my job and often lead my team but hated every minute. The Verizon call center is a glorified prison. I advise if one is to go into a VZW call center, enter in a position that is not on the phones and you may have some success. But seeing as even managers right off the phones have been in their position 5years plus, it's a long road to get nowhere. Oh yes, don't expect to have weekends off unless you work the late evening shift or overnight."
bad,Overall not a great company to work for. Good old boy network of managers. Promises of advancement without follow through. Sub par personnel in key positions because of race. Must drink the company's kool aid in every aspect or you're out. Ridiculous quotas. Constant at will restructuring of pay plan so you don't get bonuses. What used to be $80 to over $100k job now pays $40-$45k/yr. Stay away if you can help it.
bad,"If you have a general lack of integrity, don't mind being worked to the grindstone, and enjoying worrying about a quota that includes lots of little micromanaged things, then be a sales rep at Verizon! You can be a great employee but if you're about to get your 401k vested, they WILL find an excuse to terminate you. The managers are puppets for a horrible corporate structure, and you're encouraged to be as scummy as possible to shill phones upon the public, regardless of their needs. If you don't believe me head into any store and ask the staff how long they've been working there, because it's most likely under a year or two. If you're a woman or a minority, you have a better Chance of staying longer."
bad,horrible place to work
bad,Learned excellent customer service skills; Worked as collection rep handling delinquent accounts. Instructed customers as to what method of payment could be used to restore services or set payment arrangements. Traced lost payments and handled final accounts needing payment/payment arrangements.
bad,"It all depends on your Supervisor and their boss(es). They expect you to ""own"" your work, but they don't ""own"" theirs, unless it helps them to look good. All work is based on the numbers, but management uses bad judgement, so your stats wind up looking bad when they are really good and excellent. If a customer fails you on a survey (less than an 8) and the call was fine (supervisor's review of it) management doesn't remove it. If you get 3 for the month, you're screwed. They don't care that you took 820-1,000 calls that month that were great and all the upselling and happy customers you kept. Then you don't get yearly bonuses, can't apply for other jobs, they hang your job over your head everyday. Total greed. Work hours unhealthy. But, you get great benefits. You'll need them for the weight gain and illnesses you'll get from all the stress. I left before they killed me."
bad,"Verizon was at one time a good place to work. The job itself isnt overly difficult, even though there are many days you are frustrated. The worst part of Verizon is its heavy handed and abusive management. You will be watched, criticized, manipulated and scrutinized constantly to the point of abuse. You will eventually wish you had taken a job anywhere else and hopefully havn't wasted too many years there. There is no enjoyable aspect of the job and most employees are constantly miserable."
bad,They don't give enough hours.
bad,The environment was stressful at times. Our managers were under a great deal of pressure to meet the store's monthly targets. I loved learning new wireless technology informantion and updates. I left the job bacause I moved to another city.
bad,Verizon Wireless does not care about their employees. They only care about numbers instead of thinking about customers or employees
bad,"Benefits and pay are great but the overall company morale along with these unrealistic expectations of their employees, are draining mentally and emotionally. Very poor work-life balance."
bad,"I worked for Verizon at a smart store for 3 years. I was a top performer in sales every year I was an employee. I achieved all of my sales goals and even trained new employees to do so as well. Verizon isn’t somewhere I would recommend working long term. In fact, I recommend taking advantage of tuition reimbursement to attain a degree or two and then finding greater opportunity elsewhere.  Leadership is dishonest."
bad,"I felt like a car salesman. I was being told to lie to my customers while simultaneously help them, which is simply not possible. People in my community needed my help, and I was basically punished for trying to do that."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"No work life balance, great pay. Management is not supportive, there is absolutely no job security. People are let go left and right. Not much roo for growth."
bad,Best thing about Verizon are the benefits. There is absolutely no loyalty to employees except to the Yankees who relocated to Wilm nd/or management family.
bad,"Have you seen Office Space? It's just like that except in 2019. "
bad,"good place to work, very laid back and competitive place to work. Strong work environment. very productive place to work . nice to meet different people"
bad,I feel this company needs to be secret shopped for their Practices. I was an employee who took care of the customers while selling. When others used methods to caused guest issues financially. I was let go while continued with company.
bad,"To be honest I was very disappointed day one of training with Verizon. With that being said I feel like people should know this before going into this job. It took over two months to officially get the job. I spoke with the recruiter many times about the job description, the benefits, the schedule just to find out that everything I was told was not the whole truth once training started. I decided to leave "
bad,They closed for a reason.When the company merged with general telephone and southwestern bell to become Verizon a lot of management left and I should have heeded their warnings.
bad,"Thousands of employees demoted or asked to leave to save money meanwhile the CEO makes millions annually. The supervisors are accountable for little and do not understand the job function.  There is a lot of work for little reward. It is difficult to even smile as there is no team interaction as everyone is tied to a phone all day. You are constantly asked to do more job functions so there is no need to hire anyone else. While the benefits are great, the emotional and mental stress is not worth it in the end."
bad,"Room for growth if you are liked or part of the click. Bad management , too many project and not enough communication. They never pay attention to the talent they have working there already"
bad,"A typical day at work consists of overlapping meetings and calls, of which are often interrupted by other ""priority"" meetings/calls that are scheduled the last minute. Management is indecisive and unwilling to genuinely get to know each of their employees. The most difficult aspect of the culture there is attending meetings to arrive at decisions and then having meetings after those meetings to inform the smaller teams how the decisions made will need to be revisited. Hence, lower management is too afraid to be transparent with senior management. There are tons of live messages aired through webcasts, month over month, quarterly and of course yearly- the messaging is regurgitated and recycled. More emphasis on power point templates than getting work done.Overall, I learned a great deal about managing managers, team members, navigating highly matrixed environments and managing politics within various layers of management. I've become a pro at managing time conflicting schedules.  Internal hiring is cumbersome. You will get called for an interview for the purpose of checking the box indicating the hiring manager has interviewed the required number of candidates for a particular job requisition.  In actuality, the candidate for the position was already decided upon during a happy hour a few weeks prior to the job posting. Internal interviews are more complicated than they should be, further demotivating employees. Also, beware of being encouraged to take a job with the premise of being groomed for the next level. The next level is reserved for those in the chosen circle. You will"
bad,The job was stressful enough without Management looming over you constantly.  Their thought process is that you never do a good job because you always could have done better  so nothing you may do is good enough.
bad,"Most of the sales managers were often insecure due to their lack of education. One could clearly see the unfairness that they inflicted upon team members due to their own jealousy and incompetence. The call center was pretty much run like a prison, for good employees included. There was constant harassment, even regarding something as simple as making a quick restroom trip. I’m really not sure to whom this type of environment would even be suitable. Good pay and good benefits mean nothing to me beneath poor, unpleasant work conditions."
bad,"Sales goals are ridiculous. Don’t get paid for pretty much anything you sell except tablets, watches, hotspots. Never shut up about selling tracking devices/crash detection devices. Overload customer’s bills. Never happy with your performance even after achieving goals. Overachieving is greeted with them reducing your commission. Talk a lot about integrity but their best sales reps have none. Play favoritism a lot. Will offer you the world but after six months their true intentions are revealed if not before then. You will feel something is wrong until you understand their true agenda. Top heavy company and reps are treated with disrespect and ridicule. People work their 10-15 years and never move up. Half the people that were there day 1 left because of the all the problems they have to deal with. Worst cellphone company to work for by far. They do challenge you and train you to start off with but it's because you need to sell a lot and know alot to be good at this job because you won't get paid for over half the products you will sale. Management are people who have no desire to help employees or customers. Moral is always down and the pressure is very high to sale things people don't want. They talk about integrity but have none when it comes to employees. Long hours, and helping them out in situations will never benefit you. Will never go back and would not recommend."
bad,"Long story short I was fired over $37 when my MPOS accepted a credit card that wasn’t supposed to go through in the first place. I begged our tech team for months to fix my MPOS since I was having all sorts of problems, nothing was solved. Anyways the entire payment bounced back on me, Meanwhile my first manager stole $7,000 from the company and all he got was a demotion from a manager to a rep (with the same pay!) and moved stores. After being fired my district manager asked me to apply again in 3 months which I thought was odd and said absolutely not. I worked for Wireless Nation. I’m not sure how TCC is but I can’t imagine it’s much better."
bad,"everyone at the company had been there for 30+ years and everyone was so complacent at their job that nothing was done. I was told ""keep your head down"" and ""don't work so hard"""
bad,"When I started working for Verizon Wireless the company was about the customer and a very good company to work for. Granted times change and that was 18 years ago, but now the company has gone a completely different direction. The quotas keep raising and the payouts keep lowering. When we used to make a sales reps 70+k per year, most people now are lucky to hit 50k."
bad,they have taken quality to such an extreme for a job in which you are dealing with other people on the phone that are many times irrational.  Their quality programs do not address this
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Working for Verizon is like being a well paid inmate. I would never go back there again. I would try robbing a bank before working at a Verizon call center ever again.
bad,"The company is totally corrupt and only focuses on profits instead of treating people fairly (employees and customers). Horrible work life balance as they schedules are constantly changing even the day of. Management leads with fear. Employees are worried that making any mistake, big or small, can cost their jobs. Managers harass and abuse employees while the union stands by idol. There is no accountability from the management on down to the front line employees."
bad,I left this job due to management. She was very immature. I didn’t like this job due to that reason. Everything else was okay. That is all I have to say.
bad,Working in the Verizon call center was horrible. Mentally exhausting you spend the majority of your day being yelled at by customers.   Supervisors had little to no knowledge of the system they mostly just sat at their desks.
bad,"On-call is fine but when the calls consistently happen when not on-call, its time to move on.  Management expects this and will often look down on the individual when something is said."
bad,Not knowing if I would be made full-time and being pressured into joining the union. We also went on strike before I was laid off. The 911 calls were hard sometimes.
bad,"I started in the company at a retail store, moved up a bit, the company got greedy, placed lots of high metrics and employees stated to be unethical. didn't value management."
bad,the environment at Verizon is very stressful and I spent more time on leave than at work. There is no work/life balance at that job. they only care about production and they have no consideration as to how we are talked to when handling calls.
bad,"Unfortunately, this is one of the worse workplace cultures I have ever experienced. Very juvenile, petty, and disorganized. The attrition rate is dismal at best because they do no take care of their employees. There is no sense of job security."
bad,"Sales goals were unattainable, constant micro-managing and being taken off the sales floor as punishment for not attaining goals. Toxic environment all around. From around 07-13 pay structure was good but when it was changed in 14 most employees I started with left for other companies as we were seeing 20-30k per year reductions in our salary despite maintaining or in some cases beating last year's sales totals - they just moved the goalposts."
bad,"Management talks endlessly about the current software technologies (Microservices, Containers, ML/AI, etc.) with little understanding about them. Management dictates schedules with no regard for the level effort need to complete the project. As a consequence,  projects either fail to deliver or do not deliver on time. There does not appear to be any accountability. There is little or no desire for software quality other than speed of delivery. There are no code walkthroughs."
bad,The culture in the B2B channel is toxic. Unethical and illegal practices are known to the organization and they allow (blindly encourage) the activity. Considering Verizon just laid off 1/3 of its workforce and is downsizing at least once a year....stability is dismal.
bad,"The pay is great, however you are not able to be personable with the customers and treat people as individual, must follow a script , mandatory OT is required."
bad,"Company is in loses, so selling it to Infosys. Try to fire people without reason. "
bad,"If you have a family , this isn’t the job to be in.  theirs no flexibility. they don’t care if u have an emergency. They listen to your calls to try and suspend u."
bad,"Verizon looks great on paper but once you're in it, you start to see through the bs. The company has made some bad financial moves and are trying to make the money back by cutting jobs and commissions. District managers make up store percentage goals that aren't even followed nation wide and are extremely unrealistic. New managers want the stores percentage to look amazing even if that means you not making a commission check. The company was great five years ago but has taken a turn for the worst. Don't waste your time with this company."
bad,I do not want to fill this out. Verizon was a good job and built some great leadership tools. But it’s is a very unhealthy work place to be in. Not worth the stress
bad,"I worked at the call center as a Customer Service Representative in Columbia, SC. The reason an ambulance shows up weekly is largely attributed to stress! It is not okay to have as many heart attacks and anxiety attacks as this place has; Boot Camp (military) was less stressful!  The company has undergone severe budget cuts; this means MORE work, LESS Pay and LESS training! They have a good benefits package and a decent starting salary,  but honestly they do not pay nearly enough for what they expect an individual to do. As long as there are people that need jobs, and as long as they are allowed to get away with doing what they are doing they will. It's not the same company as it was even two years ago; what was once a solid company is now a circus."
bad,They need ethics training both workers and managers. To many problems with managers giving lots of overtime to their favorites. If managers don’t like you then you won’t get overtime and the managers love workers who can drink so after work you can treat the boss with all the overtime money you made from him...........................I would never recommend working there. Very sad.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Verizon is a great place to work at if you have the gift to gab on the telephone and have sales experience. They offer a great salary and benefits package and you don't have to a college degree to work in customer service. The company is very diverse and the work environment is good just a very stressful job because they do expect you to meet sales quotas every month. They do give lots of training on integrity, sales, customer service and host of other materials to help you meet your goals while working for the company."
bad,"If you like doing support work and helping people, this could be a great place to work, especially with amazing advanced tuition assistance (they pay up front and you only pay back if you fail, so no needing to wait to save up money for classes) and decent health insurance. However, I cannot recommend avoiding Verizon enough. First, due to a huge amount of field techs that can't be laid off and have been shoved into call centers and are now miserably doing remote support instead of being outside like they'd like, emotional morale is awful. Also, since it's a union job, if you're new and actually do your job compared to everyone else doing their bear minimum, you make enemies of everyone, but since you're new you need to do well or management will come down on you. Combine this with the union being a old boys club that claims to want to protect everyone, but actively ignores or pushes away requests from newer members, and you have a recipe for a job that pays great but will send you to the hospital for the emotional stress it will give you."
bad,"No support from management from team leaders to call center upper management- consistent suspensions and write ups instead of working to make employee an asset to Verizon.  Terrible communication across the board and favoritism runs rampid at the Pittsburgh call center.  To say its a stressful environment is an understatement!  I have worked in a few other call centers but NOTHING compared to this.  Its a union environment which I believe is a part of the problems that occur there daily."
bad,Great place to work for advancement opportunities. Great pay and wonderful benefits. Extremely stressful sales environment and can be very overwhelming.
bad,"was laid-off when company went on strike,stuck on 2nd shift,no training no company help no help from other employees no map or gps for other locations to pick up other vehicles"
bad,"Awful company and work culture. I highly recommend working anywhere but here. The pay is decent but the culture, employees, and management are horrible."
bad,"No opportunity for growth"
bad,"I heard many great things about Verizon wireless so I applied and got the job. the only good thing about the job is the small amount of friends I've made there and the benefits... medical, dental, 401k. everything else, it sucks the life out of you... to get constantly verbally abused on the phone almost all day is not healthy there are managers there that shouldn't be managers. its a horrible place to work."
bad,Poor management. Treated you very unfairly. No opportunity to advance. Not able to have a personal life. Constantly failed to pay you your wages on time if at all.
bad,Stressful. Upper management are useless and do not care about their customers only money. They want you at work whether you are sick or dead. Only concern about bodies not about employees
bad,"Used to be a great place to work. High up management has, over the past few years, made decisions that have negatively impacted the business thus causing job losses."
bad,"While my immediate supervisors were great, I feel that 400+ of us were stabbed in the back with the 2014 layoff in the Wallingford facility. We were promised that ""we are not going anywhere"", ""Record number of new customers"", ""Wait until you see your next bonus""!!! ""Verizon never has layoffs'!! We were carted off to an offsite restaurant and given the axe. They sacrificed experienced. loyal employees for short-term profits."
bad,Company runs on poor management team.  Managers who are unethical & do the least are promoted. Those who work & are ethical aren't.  Shameful display.
bad,.nothing much to say each person that works at Verizon is aware that advancement is very far and between. We work like slaves it’s very stressful and no motivation. So many people are taking leaves because of he job and so many people that have left the company are so relieved
bad,"Leadership is terrible and work life balance is not good. The only upside is the benefits. 401k, Health 5 weeks paid vacation (working in retail you can't take it all because you can't be out of your store that long)"
bad,Told one thing in training but once you hit the call center floor it all changes.  If you need a job it may work out short time but would not plan on being at company more than 6-12 months.
bad,Constant reorgs.  Consistent redirectives from executives as Wireline and Wireless battle it out.  Overstressed Management. People with no knowledge or proper training of technical assignments (Mostly Agile) managing....
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Extremely poor management in the Rolling Meadows Call Center. Job provides great benefits and pay, however, the center is ran by the wrong people. Its very cut throat because older generations are fearful of being replaced by younger generation."
bad,"This company is what is wrong with corporate america, Their selection of District managers is beyond low.  Im still in shock 6 months after leaving company of what awful decisions they make and how they can take a good sales employee and turn them into complete robots."
bad,worst job ever poor management staff the shifts bids occur to often and they will change your shift when its not time for a shift bid.  Within my two years of employment was had 9 different shifts under 9 different supervisors and they all worked with different expectations I do no recommend this poe to anyone
bad,"The workplace is compensated well in both pay and benefits, but money isn't everything.  There is no ability to advance your career.  The positions for change or advancement are picked in advance by poor management who will place someone in the role who will be a yes man.  If you won't drink the kool aid, you won't get the job."
bad,The call center had unreasonable demands and goals with a Director that was all about numbers and not the staff. She had no compassion for personal life's outside of work.
bad,"Verizon pays well however,  you get shifts based on senority and you have vacation but never get to take any. Sales staff lie to customers and they expect you to wave a wand and make customers change their mind about the company. Managers will throw you under the bus to save themselves and if you dont produce at a high level 100%  all the time then you are out the door that's why they are always hiring because people get burnt out."
bad,"Projects consistently cancelled over and over again made it super difficult to retain talent, leading to a lot of overall frustration and an air of mismanagement. Layoffs were always around the corner even though higher management consistently said they weren't, making me and others feel a bit distrustful after a few rounds of layoffs occurred."
bad,"Work environment/culture leaves a lot to be desired for one of the top-rated wireless companies.  Customers often at a disadvantage, without even knowing.  While there, there was a lot of dishonesty in some of the practices with helping customers, which is not reflective of good customer service,"
bad,"Long hours, minimal management, good culture, reasonably good salary, chance to move around. Top heavy with management.  Good canteen. Big company.  Entities globally."
bad,"Poor management practices, no development for advancement. Managers are promoted based on numbers not management skills. This company does not value employees or customers."
bad,"I had high hopes coming into Verizon.  After a few weeks, it became very clear that this was not the place I thought it was.  People in positions who shouldn't be in them.  People in positions who should be in other positions.  Lack of accountability and even basic competence was missing.   People were promoted simply because they were ""there"" with zero experience in the role they were being transitioned to.  If you were in good graces with your manager, you were fine, no matter how bad of a job you did.  Cliques everywhere.  "
bad,don't care about customer. preach about providing great customer service yet nickel and dime them anyway they can to line their own pocket. all about the almighty dollar.
bad,"Verizon treats you like a replaceable tool. When it comes to scheduling, they have you work days, nights, weekends, and holidays. Inclimate weather? Verizon doesn't care and you better not be late for your shift or they will write you up. "
bad,I do not have anything bad to say about my previous employer.  I am grateful to be looking or a new job!  The benefits were above and beyond.  My salary was great.  I would not do it again however!
bad,"terrible. do not work here"
bad,I was warned not to work there... started when they had been bell atlantic... union is very week and company is going all wireless... I would not let a friend work there
bad,I worked there over a year being the only remaining member of my team who slowly was picked off and let go. The constant changes of policy and management made it impossible to stay on top of the changes. In the end they changed my schedule without notifying me and was able to fire me after perfect attendance since day one.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"I have very few good things to say about my time with this morphing telecommunications giant. WorldCom helped wreck the economy, MCI's business plan was antiquated, and Verizon had acquired a second-class citizen withe merger."
bad,"A nice company to work with,strikes a proper work life balance.Growth is limited,learning is in ample amount."
bad,"Managers on the floor are amazing, but the managers in the building suck! if they came over to you we knew someone was gonna get it. They told everyone they were going to be laid off with no expression on their face and expected everyone to stay until the last day."
bad,"With a large network, Others in the company would call at all hours. Turning off company cell phone was frowned upon. The work is challenging but satisfying."
bad,"work life balance is difficult."
bad,One Verizon manager does the work of at least 3 people.  The company has downsized so significantly that processes do not exist.  You fly by the seat of your pants and work over 60 hours (uncompensated overtime) per week.  There is no focus on landline employees anymore.  Your not given proper training or tools to do your job.   It's a horrible environment and the HR department does nothing to lighten the day to day burdens of the employees.   There is absolutely no work/life balance whatsoever.
bad,"I loved the company up until the last year when we inherited two female supervisors and a manager that were all nightmares. If you voice concerns to HR, you're black listed.  If you ask your supervisor to distribute the work out instead of doing it to get kudos, you're black listed and they retaliate.  If you're over 50, you're out eventually.  If you have an opinion about process improvements, you're ignored then eventually management makes the recommendations and takes the credit.  If you have over 20-25 years, your days are numbered and its a matter of when.  Used to be a great company and would have been happy to die working there - ended up feeling like I'd rather die than work there."
bad,"The healthcare is very good and you will need it because working here will make you very sick. You will work very  long shifts. When you are stressed out and ready to go home you will find out you have to stay because store is always busy with customer complaints, people who want you to miraculously make their old banged up smart phones new, save and transfer 5000+ pictures etc. This job has a high burn out rate. If you need a paycheck, you are in excellent health and you can make being there 10/12 hours each shift your priority, go for it."
bad,Managers do not know how to teach representatives to serve clients.  Reps were forced to sell products to customers that did not want them.  Managers only care about matrix rather than clients
bad,A poor work environment with little to no chance for advancement (unless you play golf) Hard work and success were not rewarded. Jealousy from fellow co-workers made the work environment vey difficuly and unfriendly.
bad,"worst company I have ever worked for. Verizon cares about nothing but money. not family friendly at all, no consistency in work hours or days off. also the programs they use are very glitchy and fail frequently and they treat customers like garbage."
bad,No matter how career driven they want you to be.  There is still the chance that even after 2 plus years of dedication they will let you go.  General Manager was terrible and didn't know how to communicate with employees.
bad,"At Verizon I was an independent worker,   I interacted with Technical and Customer Service as a Liaison for large business accounts.  I required very little supervision at Verizon as I worked on my own.   Great company.   They are professional and provide a positive working environment."
bad,"Plain and simple they are horrible to employees and supervisors are consistently unavailable and leave early, no help whatsoever AD never available"
bad,"Overall good company, just many layoffs going on all the time.  So its kinda scary for job security as folks get cut all the time due to layoffs.  Also lots of travel so work life is tought.  They change it on you all the time without notice."
bad,"needs improvement or a new company to take over ( Metro PCS) Additionally a lot of fraud would occur in this premium retailer Verizon all the while management would ignore any and all complications.,"
bad,Only wants to hire and promote young kids who know nothing about the business. Your schedule and raise are based on customer's surveys
bad,I hated my time at Verizon there was no room for advancement they promoted the wrong people into management there was no kind of encouragement
bad,"I heard many great things in the past about working for Bell Atlantic (predecessor of Verizon) so I jumped at the chance when offered. Boy was this a mistake. Not only was the management oppressive (unrealistic metrics, resolve with no dispatch or face a ""coaching session"", timed restroom breaks) but there was little to zero room for advancement. Those that did advance to 1st level management were either RIF'd (reduction in force aka laid off) or quit within a year or two."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Are you good at meeting rising sales metrics? Do you enjoy being micromanaged, getting the job done, and then going home without having to worry about where your next paycheck will come from? All while getting occasional snacks and lunches for exceptional performance? If so, Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. However, be prepared to have all of your flaws spotlighted incessantly while exceptional performance gets a mild pat on the back once in a blue moon. Oh, and by the way, you work on THEIR schedule. Wanted to go to that concert, or travel out of town to visit your distant relatives for the holidays? Nope. Black Friday is a mandatory work day for ALL employees (you will lose your Thanksgiving pay if you fail to attend work), and nearly all customer service call centers are open on Christmas Day. It takes more than two years after initial training before you will see weekends off again, and even longer before you'll leave work prior to 8pm. This is a great starting job, especially for a recent high school or college graduate who enjoys difficult problem solving and interacting with people on a daily basis. But prepare for your entire life to revolve around work, and your entire job to revolve around fixing that one minor imperfection that you never seem to get right. Oh, and by the way, even if your job description doesn't explicitly mention sales, you WILL be selling something, so get used to it, and be ready to teach yourself how, since their trainings are so vague and repetitive."
bad,The benefits at Verizon was great. Overall the company was not good. It's not good when you have to feel like walking on egg shells when coming to work.
bad,"I worked for Verizon for 5 years got injured on the job I did, filed WC , then got black balled by management Filed ADA , here I sit without a job , Basking Ridge is run by people who don't have compassion"
bad,I worked in a tough area and it was very complicating to sale cellular phone.
bad,"I endured a ten month stint with Verizon as a sales representative in Hawaii: Overall found the experience to be extremely unpleasant and not one I would wish upon another.  Unreasonable stress and micromanagement.  Sales reps are held accountable for metrics which are beyond their control.  Basic labor laws are not regarded such as breaks and lunch.  Never ending erratic scheduling and often unreasonable requirements, such a a requirement to arrive at the store for a 6:30 a.m sales meeting, when one's schedule for that day might be noon till 9 P.M.  "
bad,"Ensure retail area storefront, merchandise and literature is in conformance with the merchandising plan."
bad,I worked here until I was a few months away from being eligible to retire with full benefits when they got rid of me. I was told that my job had been eliminated. A month later two young hispanic women were hired to replace me. I was screwed out of at least 250K in money and future benefits. This company does not appreciate loyal employees and if you're over 50 you have NO job security at all.
bad,The culture is very one sided. Promotion is based upon how well someone likes you. After 10 yr's working there I can say without a doubt that they look for one person out of 100 to move on as an employee. The turn around is very high. As an outside rep you must work from 6:am to 10pm to finish your work.
bad,The management treated hourly employees as disposable assets. The management employees were also continually being let go. The supervisors did not really care about the customers or employees. The only reason a majority of people stuck around was because of the benefits.
bad, Diagnose and resolve cellular technical issues.
bad,"The major job responsibilities for this position include responding to inbound calls or making outbound calls to the current customer base. The objective for each call will depend on where the customer is in their life cycle: new, nearing the end of contract or completely out of contract. Customer contact is made using several vehicles, which could include short message (SMS), virtual dial or letter. The main goal will be to either upsell the customer or renew their contract, and you must meet sales objectives in order to perform well. You will spend *ALL* 40 hours of your week doing this, more than likely, which will lead to a rather rapid feeling of burnout. The job is repetitive; there will be an occasional meeting or training you are required to attend, but for the most part, you are hooked up to a phone day in and day out."
bad,"I worked in Missouri, on FiOS and loved the job at first. Then they moved us all around and I sat next to people that were the rudest people I ever heard to customers. It wore me down. I was one of the best reps in the center but couldn't deal with the negative work environment and became one of them. Which was unfortunate I loved the job up until then."
bad,"Verizon is a huge corporation who expects nothing less than full access to you life and soul. You can make a lot of money, but the atmosphere is stressful and the work life balance is poor."
bad,"I worked at this company 15 years got 2 degrees and they did not promote me everytime i applied they would select a person that management was friends with they had less experience. But they were friends with the hiring manager! So I was very smart they paid for 2 degrees when they closed our office it was the Best Day of my life, they pay and promote school but the entire management staff was filled with s bunch of rude uneducated staff! Thats why the office closed it had gotten so bad the Supervisors were doing like the employees taking Medical leave because they were unhappy! I learned a lot but I would never recommend this company not even to a person I dont like it was the worse job I ever had"
bad,Managing multiple locations meant an early start on conference calls. That was followed by going to one of the stores (sometimes several in a day). There was continuous training and motivating. The management was incompetent. They wanted 70 or 80 hours a week and didn't care about any type of work/family balance. They encouraged dishonesty or whatever the sale took.
bad,I was rated ER=exceeds requirements the highest rating you can attain. I missed one day in 17 years and I was selected to go to Ground Zero following the attacks of 9-11-2001 because I was the best of the best so I am not some bottom of the rung disgruntled employee but there inept security and I do mean inept they make Barney Fife look like a brilliant officer followed me all day they found nothing but they still got rid of me. If you want to know more please ask me.
bad,"Once I saw the Manager of the store sell a customer a Blackberry after taking out the travel adapters & leather case & resell them back to the customer, I starrted looking for a new job."
bad,Extremely fast paced call center with main goal being revenue. Sales quota unrealistic. No regard for customer's genuine needs just sell them everything you can to meet your objective. Manipulate numerous and complicated proprietary data systems. Your calls are monitored and evaluated by management on a constant basis. Must code your phone in order to go to restroom so they know where you are every minute of the day. Management is verbally abusive and condescending and they set a double standard for those who make their sales quota and those who do not. Dealing with the Office Manager was hardest part of job. If Verizon did not compensate the employees as well as they do they would have a difficult time finding people to work for them. Verizon's only goal is revenue lacking interest with customer service!
bad,I've worked for vzw for 15 years THIS COMPANY WILL SET you up for FAILURE....over the past 3 years there has been so much changes position were deleted and they just throw you in SALES the worst postion where you could easily get Fired....I was sooo glad when they let me go you just dont know I HATED SALES!!!!!!!!
bad,This company has great pay and excellent benefits but other than that IT SUCKS..... REALLY REALLY SUCKS!!!
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"At first this job seemed to be THE job. Then the upper management changed. The place I worked became a place where if you were disabled, or older, or pregnant then you had to watch your back. Their call review system was purely subjective. If you did not conform precisely to your current supervisor, your calls were down graded. Then when you took their ""advice"" your were still downgraded. The favoritism was palatable. And if you had a relative who was well liked then you could write your own ticket. If you were older, there was little or no chance for advancement. And once you hit the 5 year mark they actively look for ways to legally get rid of you."
bad,"I have never been in such a ruthless cut throat environment. Why do you think they pay so well? Do yourself a favor and don't let the paycheck buy your piece of mind. That is exactly what they do to employees. You will worry every day after the glow wears off. There is nothing like loyalty, fairness or kindness anywhere in this company. If it's to their financial advantage people come in a distant last! They haven't paid income tax for years. Itt's all about the money. Yes a corporation should want to make money..but their absolute obsession to get every penny is almost satanic!"
bad,Unrealistic Sales Goals. Managers zero help. No one knows promotions. Ten ways to do anything only 1 is right and no 2 people know which one is
bad,The company does not care a hoot about their employees. Your best bet would be to find a different company that actually values employee contribution.
bad,"I worked in the old GTE offices at the Hidden Ridge location. Verizon has great benefits, but the management of the company is poor. They still act like a telephone company with the same metrics they measured a telephone company, yet tout themselves as an ""entertainment"" company. They don't really know how to compete in that space. Proof of that is they sold their FiOS Fiber Optic backbone in the Midwest where they were not profitable. Still have the telephone company mindset and that causes anyone with a ""new"" thought or opinion to be an outsider. The company is more interested lately in diversity of workforce vs. qualified workforce."
bad,Absolutely no support from management. pitting team members against each other for the sake of completing the job. Constantly getting calls after hours to check on job status.
bad,Unreasonable expectations set by AI models.  You get three months and you’re on an improvement plan.  Low producing territories churn people over and over.
bad,You as an employee do not matter to the company. All they care about are the numbers. They will toss you to the curb for no reason! I was never properly trained. I had to learn everything on my own and with my coworker who was also BRAND NEW. I was let go because they felt I never wanted to be there. NOT THE CASE. I feltblike spent my life in that store.
bad,Ahdbd sjjx disks six. E xjd dbxb sets up the best part is a good way of getting a pump and I don't think you should have a good day at the end and it seems like the best thing you could have
bad,"1. Inconsistent management makes trying to plan ahead for business objectives impossible as management can change their mind some times three times in one day on major initiatives."
bad,"GREAT PAY.!!!"
bad,"Company says they are customer obsessed, but are only concerned with charging them more, they don't care if someone needs the service or not, they want us to sell it to them"
bad,Verizon is a big name company that doesn't treat their employees well.You have supervisors sleeping with their subordinates.Managers mistreating folks
bad,"Verizon benefits are great pay for school from day one plus 401k"
bad,"They don't offer any benefits what so ever to non official verizon employees and only allow 1 per facility. Management is awful, they have a system in place that has no structure or proper organization. Basically it's like trying to direct a classroom with no curriculum and you don't have to listen to the teacher at all."
bad,"We had to relocate to different state due to my spouse's job and rather than looking to hire within they decided to hire someone else outside even though I applied for the same position already as Verizon employee."
bad,"If you are on the phones you are pretty much stuck. They will cross train you IF your supervisor likes you. Because it's a call center its a very petty environment and if your manager/supervisor doesn't like you they can and will find any reason to write you and get you terminated. You pretty much have to wish and pray you get a good supervisor or pretty much take abuse from any person that is ""over you""."
bad,"I repeat Stressful, micro managed, no job security, no worklife balance, favoritism, and did i say stressful work environment. Not only is the call center stressful, knowing they are firing people for anything every week makes it worse. They way your scores is set up for you to fail. Also every year they make you watch a 15 min vid on the code of conduct and then you sign saying you understand. TRAP that code of conduct is a novel and you are never able to go over the entire document. But you sign saying you understand. There way of firing you whenever they feel like it. Could say much more but I'll leave it at that...."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"This company rules with an iron fist. After Dan Mead took over as CEO in 2007 the company chopped annual raises by 70%. Took away long term investment bonuses. "
bad,"PLEASE DON'T APPLY HERE!!!!! The company tries to pride themselves on being a great work/life balance company but they are not. It's all about numbers, numbers, numbers. Your schedule changes every 6 months and you have to bid on your schedule. Supervisor are all inconsistent every 6 months you get a new supervisor and your new supervisor will tell you the exact opposite of what your previous supervisor said. Please think again about applying. Even though the benefits are great it's not work the headache. Very very stressful. People have had breakdowns on the floor to the point that 911 had to be called. And if you don't have the time to cover you being off the phone you get written up. And don't fail a survey. You will get all the feedback in the world letting you know what you did so wrong on that call and the customer might have said that they failed you based off of a policy that you had to uphold. And the survey will stay."
bad,"After Verizon Wireless merged with Verizon Telecom the company took a turn for the worse. The culture changed & everyone was over worked & miserable. Then the lay offs started. That made things worse. No job security, no training etc"
bad,Not the best place to work. People are okay. Pay is okay. My commute was also terrible I drove every night Freeport to Rockford. And working 330 to midnight through drive home was terrible.
bad,"Verizon sucks it's employees (at least at their call centers) in with a higher than usual pay/benefits package. Once there, they treat the employees horribly, micro (and macro) manage, and force you to do any job they can get away with making you do. When employees there tried to unionize, they did everything they could (and succeeded) at stopping it."
bad,Use to be a great company.  Now they have cut so many jobs there are not enough people to do the work.  Good pay and can work at home on occasion.  RIF reduction in force every year pretty much since 1994.  Never know when your time is up
bad,"I worked for them for almost 10 years. always early, stayed late, never took sick time.  I was proud to work for them.  I held my head high, and loved discussing what I did.  Then I received a call on my day off telling me my services were no longer needed with no real reason why.  A decade of my life, and it didn't mean anything to them.  In the end I realized that they DO NOT care about their employees, families, or loyalty.  Anything to put a few more bucks in the pockets of the higher ups."
bad,"Management sets standards that are hard to meet such as doing a call in less than 20 seconds.  The standards are very regimented with no room for individuality.  When doing observations, management does not criticize constructively instead, they nitpick and micromanage."
bad,"This company was not bad. My problem when I was promoted the manager that supervised me, wanted me to do practices that are unethical. I did not feel comfortable and therefor it let to a disagreement with my manager which led to my ultimate departure from the company."
bad,I changed companies for this position as tired of 3rd shift and company I was with was setting up to sell out.  This was a billing help/sales line.  I stayed on phones only 6 months before moving to internal help desk due to experience.  I did well at the job and made quotas however come on it is a call center.
bad,"•Verizon has poor selection in management as some supervisors do not know job or job functions"
bad,good company but micromanaged to distraction.  so many aspects of company were covered from billing to tech support but job performance was based strictly on sales not customer service
bad,"I plea the 5th, very stress full trying to keep job by reaching there high numbers for production. That is why I would not recomend to friend or family"
bad,"No comment. I simply have no comment."
bad,ever gone to work and saw coworker pass out or have a stroke? that's literally what its like in the call centers. I hated it and they allow the customers to verbally assault you
bad,"Told daily that you suck at your job, the goals set forth by corporate are based on their desire not actual numbers or figures, you will be blamed if they are not met. Threatened daily with corrective action plans/termination. Constantly told you are replaceable. Business is down 35% from last year, quota is up 135%, told if you don't like it to leave."
bad,"The cell phone industry is has become very competitive and profits are going down. The only way to improve share holder profits is to cut expenses, and Verizon has had several rounds of lay-offs. While the company has good benefits, job security is now at a historical low. I would not recommend someone new to the workforce try to get a job in this industry."
bad,"No clear leadership."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"A typical day at Verizon is a day in hades.  Every day you are worried that you will lose your job, and most days someone does.  There are at least two RIFs per year.  The workplace culture is the most backward of any I've ever seen, and the upper management is a joke.  The most enjoyable part of the job is driving out of the parking garage at the end o the day.  The benefits are all right, but nothing to write home about."
bad,Poor management. Didn't really care about employees. Moved people into manager roles that never should have been. Poor coaching and training in the stores.
bad,Verizon is a company That does not care about its employees or its customers. The upper management only cares about its stock price and its wireless division. it has a great product in Fios but wont give it the resources to make it available to everyone in NY and NJ.
bad,"Not verizon but ""Go Wireless"" is who i had problems with. Very poor management. They demand too much between the constant meetings before work which often occurred on my days off, and left me with no days off for the 10.00 per hour they paid me. Work/Life balance is not balanced at all. Way too demanding for little pay. Also they scam innocent customers, tricking people into buying ""free tablets"" that in the end cost the customer $240. I am an honest person so i want nothing to do with companies with bad business practices."
bad,"We were constantly monitered, timed on restroom breaks, micro managing, lots of judgement, very stressful environment, they expect you to kiss butt robot"
bad,"I found that you had to push products regardless of the want or need for then by the customer.  You would only get help.from management when a customer was on the ""hook"" for a particular product."
bad,"Constantly set up to fail, metrics change all the time, making it more competitive & hard to meet demands when you factor in the constant system issues and job function changes.  Lots of changing department roles and functions.  Horrible customers who have been promised false things, transferred around the world or just can't seem to complete what should be a simple task on the website.  Customer service is supposed to be our #1 priority, but the stats we need to meet make that difficult.  Horrible work/life balance with shift bids every 6 months.  Weekends, late nights and holidays will be normal when you work here.  Kiss your life and sanity goodbye!"
bad,"Large Corporation"
bad,it was very cut throat.  the favorites got away with whatever they wanted to do. others were held to a higher standard than the favorites.  who was favored changed almost daily.  they were always looking for way to fire you and fired a couple people every day. they eventually closed down due to their reputation.
bad,"Verizon proclaims to be a good company to work for, they purchased XO and told us initially we would be fine, to find out 2 weeks later, we are all losing our jobs."
bad,"Generating sales / talking to customer , light cleaning  duties / handling in and outbound calls. inventory counts , back office paperwork. hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers."
bad,"My managers were great and the benefits were awesome! The pay was not so good, but I managed to do decent. I would not work there with a family because the schedules are not mon-fri."
bad,"Very stressful workplace, No job security.  Company constantly changes expectations for employees, causing confusion and job dissatisfaction."
bad,One of our managers was abused by a regional manager Sanat Palia and was released from the company for speaking up for herself as was I for speaking up for her also. Awful ownership and management including the standing DSM Adam Worthington.
bad,Company was good when I first started. As time progressed the sales tactics became manipulative. My managers were very stressed. Only to be trickled down to sales people.
bad,Verizon was a good job at first and I worked hard to get in my position 6-7 days a week. The biggest problem with this job was the disorganization of the back office they had in place and the owner of the 3rd party company i worked for would never change it. After some time of basically putting up with all this chaos that the back office created was the downfall of the company and it shutting down because of the result of this back office and Verizon corporate not wanting to deal with it any longer and them being bought out by Frontier.
bad,Management focused on Wireless and Internet of Things business unit. Work environment within VES or Wireline very difficult with not much executive support.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,They are not very good with work/life balance. They also are not very good with growth and promotion at all. Working on the phones 8 hours a day is also very depressing
bad,Lack of direction and strategy. No vision for the company. They really need to figure out how they want to position in their company where they can provide true value to their customers and try gain a competitive advantage.
bad,The company overall is not bad just working for different departments that may hold their own title. Hiring is based on likes not who's best fit for the position. qualification changes per AD. This is not a stable or solid work place.
bad,Verizon does not believe in work/life balance. Many times you are required to work 10+ hours/day and 6 days a week. Not a place to work if you have a family/life outside of work. Many other options out there
bad,"Very busy work environment. Not a very pleasant place to work."
bad,The pay is competitive but that is the only good thing about the company. You are just a number to the company and god forbid the supervisors have to work. I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy! The place is a cult and i wouldn't recommend Verizon to my worst enemy. Who knows it could have just been the location i was at but it was terrible!!!
bad,"Because this was a call center environmet a typical day at work involved taking calls.  All calls are carefully monitored.  We had to be open to criticizm and willing to improve.  No one knew everything, there was always an oportunity to learn."
bad,"Working in a call center for Verizon is a horrible experience if you have a mind of your own or a life outside of Verizon. The hours are unmanageable and the pay is not worth the constant berating and attacks by unsatisfied customers. To make it worse, managers make it worse by constant big brother supervision and forcing the proverbial Kool aide down the throats of the employee."
bad,"This job was very boring. The first day I started, I hit the weeks quota within 2 days. It was a very easy job. I didn't like that you didn't have to use any brain power. I actually took another job for $3 less an hour because the job was so lame."
bad,"Not so great for new employees. New contract is horrible. Hard for you to take a day off when you need it. If all you care about is money then Verizon is the place for you, but not for people looking for balance."
bad,"I worked with Verizon Wireless and rapidly moved from a Customer Service Representative in a call center to a Business Sales Associate and finally Business Account Executive.  I was very happy with management style (not micro-managed) until I worked for 3 years at the corporate Verizon Wireless in Schaumburg, IL.  Disorganized, poor management (micro-managed), sales territory was non-existent. HR was ineffective regarding major management issues, i.e. manager consistently had issues with alcoholism on the job, unwanted personal interaction or attempt at personal interaction. Verizon Wireless, lost many excellent business account executives who left due to lack of management and HR did not respect the employees."
bad,A miserable place to work in the last five years of my career. Fellow workers were the best. Hardest part was being harassed by management. Best part was repairing customer phone lines and how thankful the customers were towards my efforts.
bad,"The company is a good opportunity, but there is little growth potential under management."
bad,would never work there again not an open communication between the employees and consultants
bad,"The compensation is fair but no room for advancement. Management does not care about the customers which is a problem for me. I am asked to do unethical practices to make money for the company which I have not engaged in. I am proud to say, I have made a great deal of commission, as well as won sales awards while maintaining integrity, and never commiting any unethical or illegal acts. I enjoy helping the customers but would like to work in a more professional, ethical environment."
bad,Verizon has reduced the number of management people. I was doing the job of 4 people when I was let go.
bad,"The job had great benefits but poor communications and management. Unable to keep employees due to scheduling properly. I made it work for me as long as I could. For three years, I worked twelve hours Monday - Friday! I did learn the longer you would work overtime, it did not effect your reviews. Customers are always right, it required doing what it took to keep customers happy and that it is how it should be. Required not to spend over 2 minutes per call per hour. I did'nt get the pay I deserved, I was required to take escalations because supervisors were never available yyytake them, You were to drop into their voicemails and never returned calls. Making sure customer is happy is the best part of the job at the end of the day!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"the busiest job ever worked at, phone calls NEVER stop coming through"
bad,Verizon is too big a company to work efficiently and the majority of the work is now being outsourced overseas. It is very difficult to work with folks that are overseas. The majority of the folks in my division that have not been RIF'd handle government projects that can not be outsourced.
bad,"If you want to be threatened and bullied by upper management, this is the place to work. Verizon Wireless has ruthless, uncaring, callous and many piranhas in upper management. It has a revolving door. They hire and before the training is done, they have lost more than half of the class. They go from being cheerleaders to threatening bullies in a day. They system they have for sick days, short term benefits needs a complete overall...The only good thing about the job are the people you work with, the reps that have been able to get through the patronizing uncaring management and go in every day...are the best people and they stick together. The folks that work in the call centers all over the US, are terrified of losing their jobs and the upper management take advantage of it. Most of them are under a doctors care for stress. If you can find another job, please take it."
bad,Magement is horrible.... Pay is good and bonuses... Don't waste your time..
bad,Your happiness depends on the environment that you are majority of the time. Not much advancement in the environment that I worked in. I wouldn't recommend this company at all.
bad,Growth depends on your customers and they use surveys as a means of revenge when they don’t get what they want. So I didn’t find the career path promising at all
bad,"The job itself wasn’t hard to do, but all the extra b.s. you have to deal with makes it unbearable.  Schedules change every six months and you’re lucky if you get a weekend day off.  Little to no work/life balance when you’re working every Saturday & Sunday & don’t get home until after 8 pm.  There’s opportunities for advancement if you like sucking up.  Temps would come in and get better shifts than people who had been at the company for years.  Overall, not a great place to work...but you have to eat somehow...."
bad,"Verizon does not care about their employs. It's merely a numbers driven company. Yes, I understand numbers is what keeps the business a float but that does not make it ok to completely disregard your employees. Supervisors are unfamiliar with systems and policies. Moving up is contingent on politics. Majority of the business is out on STD or FMLA. Employee engagement is at an all time low, as well as integrity."
bad,this company doesn't tolerate any instability in there workers life. the work is overall easy but not well supported. expect to be tossed to the wolves and left to fend for yourself.
bad,"was a great place to work till the new CEO wanted all cs associates to work like dogs day in day out , back to back calls , never time to do anything , if you can handle the back to back calls , all day everyday 8 hours a day and customers are always yelling then go for it, just remember to hit your metrics, that is all management cares about , i pretty much lied and did whatever to customers accts for 4 years. HOW YOU ASK? JUST HIT THOSE NUMBERS THEY LOOK FOR AND THEY WILL TURN A BLIND EYE hahahahahhahah , get a degree and get out kids ...."
bad,"This was by far the worst job I ever had.  The position advertised was ""customer contact representative,"" but it was a sales job.  Customers would call in for a variety of reasons, most frequently wanting to lower their bill or save money.  A required duty of the CCR was to push DirecTV and other services they don't necessarily even need.  Failure to push products leads to job terminations, and there is a lot of pressure from management to meet rather unethical sales goals.  These goals are usually achieved through tricky wording and other means, such as exploiting the elderly.  You're responsible for Average Handling Time, or AHT.  Failure to get your handling time down can result in termination.  It's luck of the draw which types of calls one receives, and CCR's frequently cold-transfer back to their own department as a way to push lengthy or problematic customers off the line.  This is a very, very stressful and frequently unethical job.  If you don't absolutely love sales, this isn't a job for you."
bad,Terrible working environments no time for family around the holidays. Management micromanages everything.can never leave at your time that you are supposed to leave work.
bad,High expectations for customers when management are not advocates of employees.  Vacation availability is always full because company doesn't allow many open hours for employees to even schedule time.  Sick time is minimal for any major illness or family illnesses.
bad,A typical work day consisted of answering phone calls and talking with customers. Customers would call in for questions about their bills and adding features on their accounts.
bad,"Overworked, No work life balance, Unealatic metrics, I enjoyed nothing about working for Verizon. However, I'm grateful for the opportunity. "
bad,The company keeps changing it’s commission structure to the better of the company while promising promotions but before that you must bow down to any hiring manager and district manager with action plans while over looking your work experience.
bad,"Working for Verizon is VERY STRESSFUL. They pay well, but its STRESSFUL and NOT  worth it to me. They have a REPORT for everything. You can't go to the bathroom without them knowing. Verizon only care about numbers. Verizon doesn't care about its employees or customers. I wouldn't recommend Verizon customer service to anyone."
bad,the position was through a temp agency and I was there long so my review is pretty much null and void I worked at the call center so I actually like what I did when I was there but I wasn't there long enough to give a real review but I would work there again
bad,Vz used to be a great place to work. Then the corporate culture changed. It used to be you were empowered to do what’s right for the customers. Now its driven by corporate greed and you’re actually punished gor making decisions. Think the beatings will continue until the morale improves. They only care about the cell side of the house not the land lines. It’s why you see so many areas with double poles and no fios. If you wanted to do better and “move up” into mgt your reward is being laid off because senior mgt says to cut numbers lol. Place is a joke
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Verizon has wonderful pay and benefits but when it comes to day to day interactions it is not very well.  They produce unachievable quotas for their employees and if you do not meet those requirements you get yelled at by management.  Verizon tells you they are a family orientated company but when it comes to needing flexibility to be able to do family things it does not work.  Individual managers at the store level do everything within power to accommodate but the company itself makes rules difficult to be able to do anything.
bad,"I worked at least 60 hours a week for these guys and never made anywhere near above my hourly. But at another store not even 5 miles from mine people there were pulling in 2 to 3 grand a week. This place has a really cool culture and depending on what team you end up with, it can be really fun but it's a very corporate scene and how much money you make entirely depends on location."
bad,"Right now Verizon is drastically downsizing about 1/3 of the workforce through a voluntary severance program. This is an overall symptom of the organization having no idea about which direction they want to proceed in."
bad,it felt like being n high school but no one had any discipline. From scandals and to people trying to sabotage others success. Everyone was in therapy and many people suffered from depression due to work environment.
bad,"No job is secure at Verizon. The company has really went down hill in the past 3 years.  Not only for people that work for them, but in their wireless service and customer service.  Just give us your money, here is your phone, go home and figure it out!  They tell you that they have great things in store for you and how much your job is needed and appreciated, and 5 weeks later get rid of everyone in the US that is in that position to totally eliminate it.  So much for how valuable our position was.  I don't talk to anyone still working there that is happy, its just that Verizon pays well so they can't afford to go anywhere else!  Management only cares about their paycheck and making you do whatever it takes for them to get it!  I remember when integrity at Verizon meant something but has not for the past 3-5 years"
bad,"When I first started worked at Verizon Wireless, three years ago, it seemed like an ideal job, they pay was great, the hours were awesome and the culture of the workplace made it almost enjoyable to to work. In the past two years, VZW has shifted to obsessive micromanaging, forcing sales quotas on employees who do not work in sales, taking a way paid personal hours from employees who have irregular schedules to benefit those who work a M-F 9-5 schedule, creating poor schedules for hourly employees (SMTFS 1PM- 10PM) so that employees can not spend time with their families or pursue personal interest. Many of the employees are use FMLA  to deal with the  anxiety, depression and stressed caused by working for Verizon. The compensation and benefits are great, but not worth the decline in personal happiness."
bad,Very good pay however company does not care for employees all is dinne for company and company only. Recent changes of closing centers cutting vacation days options etc makes it seem company is struggling financially.
bad,job is great. the pay is great. the trade off is management are constantly harassing you. you're not compensated for the many hats you have to wear. always telling you how to do your job when they have never performed the task. upper tier are just as bad
bad,"Working at Verizon was not a great experience. The managers were lacking knowledge and they expected more out of you than humanly possible...they wanted great customer service, but also wanted your calls to stay under a certain amount of minutes...they wanted the customer treated wonderfully but then would monitor everything you did to help make the customer happy. "
bad,"I have been working here for 8 years. This past year has been awful. They are cleaning house. Replacing all of the veterans with new cheap labor. They are removing a lot of the benefits for employees and quota is ridiculous, also micromanaging is at it's finest now. You are lucky if you get a 0.9 nowadays. I have already put in my 2 weeks now."
bad,"It’s all about numbers, and making your quota in upgrades, calls per day, good surveys. Managers micro manage you to death. The company knit picks every aspect of what you do. Can’t even use the bathroom  without your manager giving you stink eye"
bad,From an employee perspective this isn't the greatest place to work unless you love sales and stepping on whoever you need to to get to the top. If you're good at playing the political game then you'll be fine. Also they tend to close stores down with only 2 days notice to their employees.
bad,This is the only job where the management will walk right passed you and don't even speak like they don't even see you.  I have never experienced this type of behavior at any other job in my like.
bad,"Verizon was originally a great place to work, but no more.  The long time culture of do-the-right-thing was tossed out the window and replaced with get-as-much-money-as-you-can, and pass-the-buck"
bad,"At Verizon your just a number. The hours are terrible and work/life balance isn't the concern of anyone else but you. While they do pay well, they hire the wrong people into leadership. This causes strife within stores, districts, and regions. It's like being back in High School at times with he behind the back talking that managers do about their reps. I was in management for a long time and my reps loved and respected me because I was real with them."
bad,"If you are non Indian then you dont get a good raise and you will never get promoted no matter what you do.  dont waste your time here  dont waste your time here  Stay away"
bad,The pressure frim work and customers and all the stress and getting yelled at all day was aweful. I cried on my way to work daily. Leadership was nOT helpful. Seemed like you youwere set up for failure.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Customer service personnel are required to handle calls as quickly as possible without any regard for the clientele.  If you received a call that was escalated and tried to calm down the person you had to do it within a required amount of time and I felt that each call had to be handled according to the needs of the customer.  "
bad,"A lot of broken promises. They suck you in with a bunch of promises of career advancement, a fun environment and lots of pay raises. None of it actually happens once you're hired. The metrics they grade you on are unreasonable and the stress is second to none."
bad,Great benefits and people.  Good leadership skills can be learned from this company. They are very diligent about ensuring you are fully trained on all products and services.
bad,Verizon turned into a very greedy company that doesn't care for their employees.  Constant stress due to many yearly layoffs.  It is very focused on Off-shore work.  They should keep their dedicated US employees.
bad,"You will get ran out as soon as your numbers slide, they do NOT care about individuals, only numbers. As soon as someone younger or peppier than you comes along, you are gone."
bad,I loaded technicians with work orders.   I assisted technicians with equipment.   I led conference calls with management.  I did administrative work like giving technicians PTO.
bad,"Verizons was one of the worst places I worked for.  You could not take a day off or be sick for a year or you where fired.  The union did not help at all.  It was very fast pace.  I worked in the retain part of household which was very stressful, because customers calling you wanted to leave the company.  Though I had a very high save rate didn't matter to them when I ended up sick.  Even with doctors notes, they didn't care I was fired."
bad,Management was very hard to deal with. For the amount of work we had to do the pay was horrible. I did enjoy not having a phone bill. There is not much room for advancement either. Its all about who you know.
bad,"People that work there are great.  Pay and benefits are also great.  Use to be a great company to work for but over the years as they are getting bigger its less about customers and employees and more about dollars and cents with taking out the human factor or compassion for people.  They do train you for success but you will find failure with different supervisors.  Like any place you have your great supervisors and others that don't care.  The company use to be family friendly and try to keep the stress level down for employees.  However, over the years that has been slipping.   Company is also seeing a high turn over rate for employees as people just don't stay there anymore.  Sad because it didn't use to be like that."
bad,"Verizon is a great company to work for that offers great benefits. However, with me being a media professional, I wasn't able to grow in the direction of media with the company that I begged to do. I wasn't allowed nor pushed to get to the division of the company that I was interested in even tho I explained my interest. I want to grow with a company, not only work there."
bad,"Any day you can be cut. Not even a month after Christmas, then entire staff at the Ontario Mills Mall kiosk was cut and replaced. Commission is terrible because we only make a good amount off of who ever has a promotion which is never Samsung or Apple."
bad,"What can I say about this place, without coming out negative..."
bad,"The retail stores have more access to business accounts than the actual account managers. You are not provided with the adequate tools to get things done correctly so as is 9/10 people in the office are forced to take shortcuts that are deemed ""lacking integrity"" just to be able to ""manage their accounts."" Be careful because they look for reasons to get rid of you. Doesn't matter the long hours, work ethic, tenure, & care for your customers that you put into your work. They will let you go in a heartbeat, and the HR department has a complete disregard for recommendations given to them or give you any benefit of the doubt when you try to go the extra mile for your customers. They treat you like trash when it's the other way around. Verizon corporate lacks integrity by how they take care of their loyal employees by letting them go at a drop of a hat without proper employee representation to defend oneself. It's a complete slap in the face."
bad,"No real career growth, just a job, and the minimum growth that they have  is only for the few and the chosen. The way they divide the work feel like an high school graduate can do it"
bad,"The call center was a very difficult job, with having customers calling in very upset you would have thought the company would have more ways to be helpful and or have a better system to grade the employees on or not grade them at all. As a customer advocate you had 7 minutes to fix a customers problem and when you didn't you basically were told that this could get you fired for bad performance. It was stress for 8 hours a day 5 days a week. The medical benefits were amazing, but they had to be due to the amount of mental issues many had. The job took a mental and emotional effect on you."
bad,would have been better if they operated as a corporate store. it was a indirect store not so organized with system & management
bad,"management has become disassociated with the work force. This company does not respect its workers or its customers. "
bad,Good place to work for anyone that is tech savvy. Work place can get hectic at times but is worth it. You must dress to impress for this job.
bad,"I lured in by all of the wonderful benefits, but the stress level was very high!! Managers constantly on you about your numbers and regardless of how well you did, it was never enough!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"I'll try to keep it simple."
bad,I worked in the call center. I literally had to go in drunk everyday before my shift because Verizon Wireless customers are stupid..that's number 1 and you don't get recognized for your talents. And the 30 minute lunches were wack!!  Glad I left that place.
bad,No room for advancement. No leadership for company advancement practices in place.
bad,"I have worked for Verizon Wireless for many years and have always been considered among the best at what I do. Within the past 5 years leadership has continued promoting sub-par managers to very critical positions to insulate themselves from dynamic personalities that would challenge their approach. The telecommunications industry has evolved so quickly that our revenue source continues to change, creating unrealistic expectations, less autonomy, more micro-manegerial styles and suspect customer policies. This company's business practices no longer represent my ethical standards. I believe any company is only as good as they value their employees & customers. Sadly Verizon no longer recognizes the contribution of either."
bad,"After years of being a dedicated employee, I was laid off, because of Verizon's quest to increase their profits. Our jobs were outsourced to non-union workers in a foreign country. This company does not care about it's employees."
bad,"Management outright LIED to me about refresher training after I was off on disability for over 6 weeks after surgery, and also whether or not I would continue to be employed there."
bad,Mobile phones and employee concession phone accounts
bad,"So I won't say much at all. Verizon Wireless is a good company to work for, except if you live in the NE US - then it isn't. There has been a massive turn over at the locations I worked at, and everyone who left was happy that they did."
bad,Verizon is a fast paced work environment. You are required to meet the metrics every month and they change every month. They work on not building you up but rather pointing out your weakness.
bad,Worst call center to work at. You are not empowered as an employee to help customers. They do not pay you enough for the soul-draining “job” you end up doing.
bad,"Was a great place to work until corporate started paying tenured employees less and less."
bad,"They try to brainwash you in training with the superiority of the Verizon culture. They tell you that no one is an introvert. If you handle customer service inquiries quickly and efficiently, you are treated as if you're doing something wrong, because they want you to try to befriend all customers. The benefits were great, but if you're not drinking the Verizon Kool-Aid you won't fit in or excel."
bad,"I loved this job when i first got there. however, it was just a job. I wanted an actual career. somewhere i could retire from with great benefits. unless you were higher up(which was hard to do) you would be stuck at the bottom within this company."
bad,"Verizon was by far the worst company I ever worked for.  The Manager let her employees dictate the culture, and the team was not helpful at all.  Outside issues permeated the team.  I would NEVER work for them again."
bad,Ridiculously high-paying job at a ridiculously  mismanaged company. I was just a number. For 30 years. Family takes a back seat when one works for Verizon.
bad,"Quality boss,bad pay, culture at Verizon is tainted,lose more sales then I care to count due to poor culture at corporate phone center.  People come into the store often upset due to talking with Verizon on the phone beforehand."
bad,"The Fiber Solution Center had an amazing culture of collaboration and upward mobility in the beginning, but now it has cultivated the employees to be cut throat and vultures."
bad,"Stressful environment, poor leadership, slow advancement, favoritism, poor communication for an actual communication company. Push more and more that I had to get into each call I took. Including sales and scripted verbiage. No personal connection to customers or team members. Treated like a number. No compassion. Loud on the floor. Poor equipment to do job suck as outdated computers and headsets. Had flat screen TV's in break room. Had work out center in building for 15.00 a month."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"hated everything about verizon. the goal promoted isnt the goal you follow through with in practice. Your job is to get people off the phose as soon as possible. The focus isnt on the customer and retaining them, its about how many people you can get to upgrade even when its not appropriate for the customer or even needed."
bad,had to walk all day an sell the product to the customers . make sure they are happy with the service and the products thatys offer to them. At the end of the day make all sales complete
bad,"very stressful"
bad,"When I was at Verizon, there was a lot people working there around my age. They relocated and screwed a lot of people over. Did not want to move and it was impossible to find anything internal. Managers were mixed, some were really good, some were terrible. The Director of my department played favorites. It also seems there are certain people who miraculously find internal jobs. Some serious politics. It's not a place I would ever want to work for again. I did like the bonuses though."
bad,"I'll give Verizon Wireless this. They pay well and give great benefits for a job where the only skills required are people/sales skills. You can literally know nothing about the product they are selling and that's ok. They don't care. Because they don't care HOW you surpass sales numbers. They only care that you were able to do it. If you don't mind feeling dirty after how much they congratulate you over sucking every last penny out of an only lady's bank account. And you enjoy being scolded day in and day out when your customer either has no money to buy the things Verizon wants you to ""recommend"" or is uninterested in the product then this is the job for you. The pay is good. But every day for the two years I worked there I became more and more depressed because of the environment fostered and nurtured in Verizon wireless. It eats away at your soul."
bad,"Work environment flexibility and mobility at work is a plus in most channels, work/life balance is hard to achieve if looking for advancement opportunities, constant lay-off pressures regardless of title or performance increases employee stress. benefits and salary are high end, frequent management changes and re-orgs,"
bad,Employees were always fighting. Conflict of interest. If you new someone/ manager you would advance faster than if you didn't. Hours constantly changed without notice or you would get written and or fired.
bad,"Great first job.  but, don't get complacent.  Working retail is hard.. And the manager micro manage you in a hounding way.   They don't assist they badger."
bad,"I was a help desk technician for 9+ years. In that time, I was witness to GTE becoming Verizon. I watched as management become worse every month. I watched them fire people, then turn around and rehire them (as contractors at higher wages) because no one else could do the job. It will take a very large compensation package for me to ever work for them again."
bad,"zero family work life balance, company breeds non trust between employees, managers do not help like they used to in the early years, has become a ""every man for himself"" company"
bad,"I would not reccommend this job to my worst enemy. Micro managing and bad business practices. ""Supervisors"" don't give credit when due and brush everything off or back to you. No ownership taken from management. Only focused on numbers and adherence. Beware!"
bad,"Huge quotas, long hours, no time off, over-time every week, no weekends off, pushy environment, co-workers were awful"
bad,"Do not recommend for anyone requring any flexibility. This is not a job for people with a family. Not flexible,"
bad,"Call center work. If you can stand people screaming obscenities at you over the phone for a full shift, go for it. Everything at the call center is monitored and security is oppressive. Everything is timed, even a restroom break and heaven forbid you are accused of call avoidance."
bad,"Pay and benefits were great but the environment is toxic.  Leaving that job was the best thing I ever did for myself.  The work life balance was preached,  but nor allowed."
bad,I wouldn't go back if they asked me. They're were favorites super stressful they didn't understand when you got sick or needed to use fmla. Very clickish only cared about what the customers opinion was.
bad,"I enjoy their services and their culture, but their customers are outrageous. It would've went better for me if management was open to change, but some people can only see things their way. You're pumped up to compete with each other (rep against rep) by your sup. You would think with this type of bond, they would have your back through anything, until it's about a complaining customer, that's trying to cheat the system."
bad,i am currently living in a hotel with my 4 kids and i have had got the flu and i was unable to go back to work they said that i could come back in 6 months and so i lost my job but my customer service score were high and i was at the top of my training class i was so good at work that they allowed me to pick my own schedual and from my understanding you gotta be good at work and i was at the top of the training.
bad,"Leadership bullies and discriminates their employees."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Working for a company for a very long time, and no they do not want to promote you. They want to hire someone off the street. The employees worked hard and were great! But do not call out sick, or if you need fmla god forbid, you will be either denied, or after a long time approved, but you will get fired anyway for being approved, one way or the other, or you will get accused of stealing for time card fraud? but you never seen a time card their the whole time you worked their? Ive seen some of their top reps fired for nothing, they just did not want to pay their retirement benefits. But the good thing is you can have a job for 18 or 19 yrs just no retirement or unemployment benefits because they fired you? And do not waste your money on union dues, when you need help they are no where to be found. They send a random person that does not even know you. The employees are great, the money is good, the stress from the upper management is cut throat, you work with these people for years and you think you know someone well you don't watch your back they can smile at you hand you awards everyday for your great sells, tell you how great your doing, then next day take your badge walk you out the door."
bad,"Met some good people and made some good money."
bad,Verizon is a great company to embrace change and hone different skill sets. The company has excellent benefits and is very competitive In that market.
bad,Verizon was an interesting place to work.  It was a diverse environment.  I learned the back end of legal information dealing with cell phones.  I also learned how to interpret court documents.
bad,Was an outstanding co to work for in the early stages of my career but I cannot say this was the same ending my career there. I do not wish to elaborate more at this time.
bad,Verizon has truly went down as a company. We stopped being focused on the core values and became focused on sales goals and product pushing. The customer focus stopped being a win win for the customer and company but a win for the company
bad,"But don't let that fool you. If you need help, and you go to management, you get the ""Don't worry we will help you."" You think everything is okay, until..nothing happens, the management that said they would, forgot, and when you go back to ask for help, you are a burden. Or completely forgotten about. While the benefits were amazing, the job security and management help was very lacking."
bad,Commission based environment. Learning all the new technology and exploring it with customers was fun however I did not have a positive work experience here so left the company.
bad,"Terrible place to work, the customers are very rude and you are expected to take all the profanity they use and names they call you. Schedule is based on performance and seniority, which is fair, but the schedule you get may not work with your life and they will not work with you on it. Management is ok, supportive for the most part, but we are told not to transfer calls to management and that there is no management. So glad I'm out of that place."
bad,"Good position, not so good job security. Client at any time may terminate agents without warning or notice. Working with the company is great as long as compliance is the main focus."
bad,I worked at this very location and caught my fellow employees bribing each other for sales metrics at the expense of those employees not involved. They also add features to your plan as it counts toward commission without the customers consent because of the obscure billing practices. I blew the whistle and was retaliated against to no avail of mine. They crushed me like a bug.
bad,"Absolutely Loved my job and did more work daily than was required. Had a perfect attendance record, Was a Union Steward and was told after 4 1/2 years to take a buyout or i would be released without anything. My local Managers were good people who looked out for their team but upper level Mgmt. only knew you by a number."
bad,"The managers weren't helpful, They were rude and very disrespectful. The higher up staff I loved however they need to work on the managers that are supposed to be there for their employees."
bad,This is the most stressful job I have ever worked in my career. Most people quit or go on FMLA. This could be a great place to work because the benefits are amazing and the pay is wonderful. Management is giving you unrealistic goals for you to reach and are more after.
bad,"I enjoyed this as my first job out of college. Management made promises they couldn't keep. Wouldn't reccommend working here as a career."
bad,"Long hours attempting to keep the ship aloft.  There seems to be no long term plan, just putting out fires day to day."
bad,I was proud to be a part of Verizon Wireless.  It was often challenging and interesting work. My achievements were above standards and I was recognized for winning the largest commercial deal in Upstate NY along with identifying other large opportunities.
bad,It was an alright enviorment. I had to work for commission more than anything. The p.o.s training was farley different from the job requirments and duties. It took alot of on hands training to understand the concept of how to make people open lines and have their upgrades
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"The job itself was what it was, Technical Support...issues came with management, hiding behind policy. Wanted the employee to be advocate for the customer, but management was not an advocate for the employee."
bad,"Higher management takes irrelevant decisions and takes decisions according to their convenience. "
bad,"Technology was cool, trainings were well taught. Good money, benefits, vacation. Worst job I've ever had."
bad,Management is disorganized and in constant fire drill mode.
bad,Management sole purpose is to try to find a reason to get you out the door. They won’t offer help or teach you “ the correct way to do things.” It becomes a constant battle between Union and Company and Verizon continues to win that battle.
bad,"It's commission sales so there is never a shortage of co workers willing to lie to make a sale.  No effort from management to stem deceptive and lying sales talk.  "
bad,"The job is. very stressful to the point co-workers are having strokes and the ambulance is at the job on a weekly basis, You only move up in the company if you are buddy buddy with the hiring manager not on sure merit alone.  You are hired to do one job and then they continuously pile on more responsibilities without more pay. The benefits are good but not at a cost of your health/life"
bad,"I worked with Verizon for 7 years in financial service and was severed so they could save themselves money."
bad,I did not like working at Verizon. There is a lack of true company culture and the work was limiting. Most employees would complain about the hours and traveling to NJ. Paying for commute added up. It was not creative.
bad,Verizon has really gone downhill. It used to be great and they used to value employees. Now it is constantly under some sort of layoff and reorg. It is not great anymore.
bad,"schedule changes every 6 months and is bidded by your rating in regards to performance and seniority,"
bad,"A competitive environment where all sales representatives are striving to achieve sales quotas. Fun at times, stressful during offseason. Work-life balance was nonexistent, at times one had to work 50+ hours a week for multiple weeks in a row because of the turn over rate."
bad,"The benefits were great and the pay was consistent with other types of jobs. I however do not like the method for surveys, the higher management never backed the employees for when it comes down to surveys."
bad,"Verizon business in Highlands Ranch Colorado is not a fun place to work.  like going to work in a prison, the management all had delusions of granduer and were not very helpful.  They don't tell you this but, this segment used to be the Failed company MCI, your sitting around all day on the phone trying to sell IT.  The job would not be bad but management only cares for themselves and had inner circles that they would funnel leads to, their old colleagues from other firms.  It was actually comical how they acted and the culture was very low class and NOT conducive to career development and growth"
bad,"You would think a great salary and benefits is all you could ever want, not true.  The union stands in the way of its own members and creates a really lousy work environment. Complacency and doing nothing all day may be fine for some people, but others like me are prevented from moving up or even around in the company."
bad,I worked as a door to door salesman. I didn't really like it because I wasn't trained properly. I made commission only.
bad,This company did not care about work life balance.  They set goals that were unrealistic.
bad,"Management didn’t have good morals. i had to sell things that people didn’t either 1, want or 2 need. i want to customer to trust in me and make them return"
bad,I hated the way coworkers made you feel and the fact of the matter is if you sacrifice to go away for the month for the training you are losing a lot more money than what you gain
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Great place if you play the politic and favoritism game. Some employees are amazing and make it worth working however, leadership is lazy, inept and want robots and not leaders with diversity of thought. Comp plan is great if your are in the upper tier of Mgmt."
bad,Being a customer service agent at Verizon wireless is not one of my favorite jobs the communication was not at its all time high and the scheduling process was horrible.
bad,I worked in 4 different call centers for Verizon. 2 in New York  1 in Wallingford  Ct. and 1 in Alpharetta Ga.  They all had different  cultures.  They all had one thing in common .At Verizon its who you know its a clique mentality. I experienced racism while work in Wallingford. I experienced racism and age discrimination while in Alpharetta.  If you fall out of favor with management you're done.
bad,"Horrible only care about customers, office politics, favoritism, worst center ever in Charlotte. Staff is more concerned with who likes who rather than making sure there team is not stressed out. It’s like getting elected for the White House!"
bad,"I've worked at quite a few corporate companies doing customer service, this experience was by far the worst. The company has lost complete sight of their culture and how to treat their customers. As customer service reps we are not empowered to make decisions that we feel will benefits the customers. You are obscenely micro-managed and it is a high level stressful toxic environment. You receive a different supervisor every six months and it's very rare you have a decent supervisor. The training is a joke and they barely give you any time to train or ask questions. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"During my time at Verizon it was very helpful for my situation. When I first started working there alot of the staff left either because  personal conflict with managment about scheduling or they were afraid of being fired for not hitting their unrealistic goals. "
bad,"We had to be at our desk at all times, and we had to get notes to use the restroom outside of our break times. We had a lot of micromanaging and were being watched and judged all the time."
bad,No review needed because this position was not directly tied to the corporate entity Verizon.  I worked for a franchise location that handled inside sales
bad,"no regard to employee mental health, and expectations are far too high.... not flexible for family time and are quick to punish you for putting family first."
bad,The particular place I worked had horrible management and sometimes no manager at all . We would work off the clock because we weren’t allowed to get overtime.
bad,Verizon has a lot of perks and would be a great 👍 place to work if they had good management. They do not hire properly and HR is not for the people and they do not resolve issues. If you go to HR about an issue they will look to remove you from the company.
bad,"Horrible managers, always said one thing and never was true. No room to grow or do anything different. Always question management and never got straight answers back."
bad,"The job was stressful constantly being threatened by management often went home crying, management only wanted perfection on every call or you were pulled of and verbally brutalized"
bad,Verizon was a great place to work until i suffered a career ending injury. I retired after 18 yrs of employment. I was disappointed that they didn't offer me modified duty.
bad,Company restructured and told people they had jobs and then laid them off. Management didn't know how they wanted to restructure and everything was disorganized.
bad,"None of the employees even tried to get along, and if you got in their way you best get out. Tried learning as much as i could, very indirect and pushy managment and staff. Hardest thing was lying to people flat out and having people get mad at you when you didn't lie they way they wanted you too, frustrating and scandalous place to work,"
bad,"When I first started working for Verizon I enjoyed it."
bad,"I have nothing to add in regards to Verizon Wireless. They are a large company, I enjoyed working the time I did. I thank them for the opportunity to live in Alaska."
bad,Organization goals met by uneducated and noncaring leaders. No work life balance if you were not in the group of popular people. Hours worked were for the benefit of the organization.
bad,Poor work environment - point to dreading showing up.  Great people if management was better.  Talked down to; lack of training; poor structure; lacks leadership; constant layoffs restructuring
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Verizon is ruthless.   Don't work there.  They want you to tell the customers half truths and intentionally leave out information about contracts.  I would not do business with them.
bad,"As a military spouse I chose Verizon to have a solid career and allow room for advancement. Along with room for growth my thought was to stay with the company as my husband is an active duty member in the Army and the company would provide me potential job security as we relocate at least every 3 years. Upon coming to our new location I was told I was unqualified by the hiring manager in the position I worked in for the past  three years in one of the only growth markets left for the company. After putting the time into the company and dedication in launching the most remote location, I felt betrayed and disappointed especially as my relocation came a couple months after their claims for being so supportive of military families."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at this particular location. Management wasn't the greatest, and made days unenjoyable. biggest benefit was sales experience.."
bad,A typical workplace culture. Verizon has unions in some areas of the business.  You need to be prepared to fill a union post if there is a strike.  This will require travel to another area of the country to work for weeks or months at a time.
bad,While i worked at Verizon Fios it was a very productive place but also very stressful because i was not teach the way a new employer should be taught to work at a company on their first day of work.
bad,"Nothing to add"
bad,"They care about the stock price of the company, period. They almost actively dislike their employees and are happy to reprimand and denigrate employees. They put a lot of time, money, and manpower into firing people."
bad,"On paper, Verizon is a great company. The benefits and pay is very good. However, my position was not a great fit for me and this is a company that I never want to work for again. Management is poor and Verizon doesn't care about their customers. After the initial training for the customer specialist role, training for new products and policies are insufficient."
bad,It is terrifying to discover all of the businesses that Verizon is quietly scooping up so that they will have enough leverage to affect the course of history.
bad,"Verizon Wireless, specifically, TCC, lacks qualities to be considered a organization. They have no empathy for the employees, asks us to cheat the customers, so they gain profit."
bad,"It's just a small Verizon authorized company, named ""strategic management consultant"", no base salary, every bill you made got some money, no any beneficial things."
bad,"A Door to Door job, in which you worked your own hours. It was a commission based job. There was not much help which led me to walking to different areas."
bad,"Verizon acquired and shut down our company in less than a year. They laid off 164 employees in the Cleveland, Ohio office. Every single person in the building lost their job."
bad,"No matter how much I got done, or how well I did it, it was never enough. Required to work on Sundays even though I made it clear in the interview that I couldn't because of family reasons."
bad,Management takes advantage of you. Management doesn't respect the representatives. Would not recommended to work here. Work atmosphere is very depressing.
bad,"Non stop call logs, working in 10 different programs to ensure proper working order of landline service. limit amount of time to reach customer about phone issues."
bad,worked at afnir call center. not for long before i got offered another job so i had to quit that job. i di like it but it was just not for me. not enough pay either.
bad,"Worst Company to work for. No Onsite , Most of the times you need to stay in office late nights. onsite calls starts from night after 9 or ten pm,. which is bad"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,I am not sure what it is like now but it was commission only when I was there. It was a joke. Paid once a month. Everyone fought for sales. Never again.
bad,"They are very unprofessional, and do not take care of their representatives, they also pay them below minimum wage. Some representatives are very rude and only compete with you."
bad,Verizon does not treat there outside supervisors well.They froze my pention and medical in 2006 after 26 years in company.In 2015 they apparently had a down sizing and I was let go after 35 years of great service.One month later Verizon was hiring more supervisors at less money.
bad,"The company I worked for only cared for one thing, that is the bottom dollar profit.  As I understand businesses work off profit, this business would stop at nothing, including lying to the customers to generate more sales."
bad,"They sell you something that sound really good, but then when you start working for them it just goes down hill from there."
bad,Company targets employees who don't run behind them or out shines higher management. Company is cutting back on all aspects
bad,"I enjoyed working at Verizon.  Everything was done by the book, which I liked.  I miss working there.  I learned how to find phone numbers quickly.  The management had nice people.  My coworkers were nice also.  The hardest part of the job was getting up real early sometimes.  The most enjoyable part of the job was figuring out how to spell names and places."
bad,I was doing extrodanary amounts of grunt work and treated like garbage. I don't mind working hard but I feel that I deserve respect. I use it as a learning experience
bad,"Over work you low incentives, verbal abuse. they take advantage of their employees. you will be bringing in millions withing a couple months but your paycheck will be 200-300 a week and if you want 500 or more you have to work a million hours of overtime"
bad,A typical day was enjoyable while working at Verizon.  I was taken under the wing of my direct leadership to learn multiple skill sets to carry with my own knowledge to be an employee to become a leader in my own rights and have the thinking capabilities of being a competitive team member.
bad,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
bad,"This is a no sympathy company. They have no compassion for human nature. They only care about work and forget that everyone is human, They shown no remorse or sympathy for my brother's death."
bad,"Typical corporate job...the best thing about the job was the people.  Not the finest place to work. It is very sterile, and they do not treat employees well"
bad,"The company is a very stressful place to work for and they over work you, with little appreciation. Not saying that the red carpet needs to be rolled out, but at the end of the day your employees need to know that you appreciate them. Majority of the supervisors don't know what they are doing, they promote from within the company but it isn't based on skills, it's based on favoritism. Most of the times, the systems didn't work so you weren't able to work and with that being said they would send you home. The HR department was never there to assist with any questions, if you called you got the voicemail and they wouldn't return calls. The atmosphere of the company is very unprofessional, it is too laid back. I understand and am all for a relaxed place to be able to work and be comfortable, but there is a fine line. They would definitely cross that line quite a bit. As far as coaching, the coaching's weren't providing you any valuable information that you could use to better your skills, it was more so as if they were talking down to you instead of helping you understand the problems and finding a solution to fix it."
bad,"Verion itself is an awesome company to work for, meanwhile the training staff is very poor and one with awesome sales techniques is the perfect candidate...if you are going in to this job without experience in the work field, good luck"
bad,"Sold Verizon wireless service and multiple brands and types of mobile phones. I set up net accounts, processed upgrades, installed screen protectors, cases, configured bluetooth for smart watches, speakers, cars and head sets. Took payments for customers bills and did account analysis to guarantee customers satisfaction."
bad,"A great place to work.  Work with a great team of engineers.  Verizon as a company is a great place to work,  Work/Life balance is encouraged."
bad,a typical day at verizon is standing for 8 hours greeting customers. at this job some of the co-workers are not very friendly and some of the managment is horrible. the hardest part is standing in one spot all day the enjoyable part was makng customers happy leaving with a smile on there face.
bad,"this was a very hectic and very stressful job. they do offer great benefits and the pay is good however because the center is so big, i didn't really get to have that one on one feel with my manager."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"commission based, door to door selling. had door slammed in face several times and its a whole day thing"
bad,Not a healthy working environment. Not a productive place to work.
bad,Took customer service calls and angry customer calls. Worked under a supervisor at the call center and also trained new hires.
bad,"n/a; I prefer not to answer. Verizon is a good company and takes care of their employees, I choose not to comment further"
bad,Work place wasn't clean (got warts from working there). Co-Workers aren't the best people ever. Hours were ridiculous.
bad,"Harsh Leadership, changing expectations, and no support.  Because they pay well they think they can treat you like badly. Employee turnover is VERY high."
bad,"Typical day was answering calls about bill, plans, problems with their cell phone. I learned a great deal while working for them. Managmenet was nice, co-workers nice and friendly also."
bad,"day spent trying to find equipment to complete your job "
bad,A typical day involved handling technical calls and escalated calls from other groups.
bad,"Everyday would be a packed day of inbound calls resolving customer issues. Typically had something new come up every day. The health insurance was amazing, but everything else lacked. I think they are too big of a business to show their appreciation for their employees."
bad,Manage teams from 12-15 reps that handles about 3000 calls a day. The enviroment is fast pace and the company focus on delivering world class customer service.
bad,working at the location i was placed in was like going back to high school. i would never go back.
bad,verizon is a large company. Verizon cares about itself. I learned you cant always believe what is put in front of you.
bad,"Verizon does not want you to print a copy of your application when you submit; there is no option for you to print, so I suggest copying and pasting into a new document if you are like me and want top keep a record of submitted job applications. I got a weird vibe from the recruiter; the company seems to weigh heavily on fear (""You will be dismissed if any information provided on your application is found to be untrue"") and whether or not you can remember specific dates from 17 years ago. They aren't nearly as concerned with your sales experience as the job description leads you to believe, if the recruiter is any indicator. All in all, you've heard about the labor troubles at Verizon and many of you out there are Verizon customers, so you know what the Verizon culture for problem solving involves. Bottom line, there are better workplaces than Verizon out there, even in this economy."
bad,"I worked for the company for 1 year and 4 months , this job is for somebody who has no outside life and a excellent support system , the first few months was ok  however the bid schedule is a waste the director loves to say for the needs of the business , forced into different roles . Rude and demanding customers if you have a high tolerance for over grown adults then this job may be for you After a while missing out on family functions and being denied requested time off because of tenure it takes a toll on you and then you start looking else where"
bad,The customers are a handful and you have a lot of metrics that have to be met. It can be overwhelming at times. There is a lot of pressure to meet these metrics.
bad,"Great pay, benefits okay, I learned to own up to my mistakes ,actions, respect and team work and communication is the key. And following the total job proess is a must along with caring and hearing customer issues and fix them and letting the customer know we are here to help and we care"
bad,I have an extreme anxiety disorder and bipolar type 2. I cannot accurately judge anything about verizon and their work culture because it was far to stressful in my mind to handle any form of analysis that wasnt going through my own head....i apologize....managment was wonderful to me and very understanding.
bad,The job is extremely fast paced and stressful. You are suppose to talk to customers in a certain way and get lots of angry customers. Money is nice tho and they do give a hour lunch and quite rooms to help with stress.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"I help customers with questions about their devices, billing questions, and show customers how to fully connect their devices together! I have learned a lot from working on the side of corporate and indirect, that teaches me how to help customers with variety questions."
bad,"My drive to and from work was 75+ minutes each way. I became sick (dizzy and blacking out). I requested a lateral transfer to the office that was 10 minutes from me and got denied and eventually fired because it wasn't their ""concern"" how I got to work. They told me to have someone else get me to and from work (5 hours out of their day). They didn't care about their employees or customers. All they cared about was making $."
bad,Most days were okay but some werer just terrible knowing that you had to lie to people to get a sale or else you wont meet requirements and would be fired for so.
bad,"Verizon honestly wasn't a terrible company to work for. They offered paid time off; quite a bit compared to other places, and they did offer great benefits. However, call center work is super stressful, I would not recommend it to anyone, you will be eaten alive!"
bad,"Worked for this company for 10 1/2 years and was let go.  No warning. They told me my job was eliminated.  Hired someone from another store,  just renamed the job.They dont care about employees. Your just a number"
bad,Management horrible to their employees.  No room for advancement due to being their number 1 producer Nationwide on the phones. I was overlooked for advancement due to my production on upgrades and add ons
bad,"A typical day at work was a stressful day at work. Customers don't call to compliment the service. They call because they're upset about something either with the service, prices, or their phones. Management never wanted to take t an escalated call even if the customer requested them. I learned more patience, but overall the job is not enjoyable at all. Rarely you get a customer who is in an ok mood to be on the phone with you."
bad,"My day was always busy.Working at the telephone company I learned many jobs functions.What it took to complete calls and make connections to overseas calls.Troubling shooting was the most interesting job of all. Coworkers was a pleasure,I have many long lasting friends of many years.The hardest part of the job was many different shifts that I worked.The telephone company is a good company for benefits,lots of careers advantages. My years at the telephone company was great."
bad,"Good company to learn agressive sales and make good costumer relationships."
bad,"Good benefits, nice company.  But if you get sick, or get in a traffic jam, or your family has issues that prevent you from coming to work..then this is NOT the job for you.  If you are 30 seconds late, you will get a write up.  If you do NOT have a doctors letter along with a 4-5 page documents filled out by the doc to be turned in within days of your 1st day of being absent, you WILL be suspended and placed on probation for 6 months..if another incident happens within those six months, you will get suspended again for a longer duration.  And forget explaining your reasoning to management..they will NOT listen. But Verizon is a good company."
bad,"Verizon Wireless consisted of me answering calls from borrowers, helping with troubleshooting and going over bills.  I worked in the actual call center and I learned very good customer service skills. Verizon Wireless will instill customer service in you. The management overall is horrible.  Some managers don't care about your personal issues and if you have a kid(s) or not.  The co workers that I worked with were always nice and was willing to help you. The hardest part of my job was dealing with customers that used racial words. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting the bonus in February.  I got to the point where I didn't enjoy my job because I was away from home and my daughter was getting to the point where she didn't want me to go to work."
bad,Verizon is GREAT place to work.  A typical day at work as a Pricing Consultant was fast-paced and full of challenges.  This was a plus for me because it taught me how to effectively meet challenges. It gave me the flexibility and skills necessary to handle a challenging job. I learned how to work well with other employees and with management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being a part of a team that truly supported one another.
bad,"Great vacation policy, medical, and 401k.  Company was relocated to Tulsa.  Very smart people to work with. It qas very beneficial to be able to learn different areas of the company"
bad,After working at Verizon happily for 4 years one day they laid off thousands of people. My manager was amazing. He made sure to treat the customer service staff just as well as the sales staff. The company is cold and brutal
bad,"I love Challenges and throughout my carrier I have initiated and introduced new ideas which I implemented successfully and created jobs for the people."
bad,The work environment was busy and pleaseant. I was able to learn a lot about research to aid in possible fraud cases. I was also able to help victims of fraud and clear up their Verizon accounts.
bad,"Telecommunications management professional with over 15 years of comprehensive experience in a multi-site, multi-host, networked environment. Has extensive knowledge of network technologies, business principles, and processes.  An understanding, innovative individual who has an excellent sense of team work to get results by instilling commitment, trust, fairness, and loyalty.  Effective leader follow directives, and company policies to accomplish tasks and work assignments. Key strengths include: "
bad,I would interact customers and help the process payments for their phone service.
bad,"OS SURVEY WORKING  on arc map  software  mnc company "
bad,This was for One Touch Direct that was contracted to work with Verizon. I do not have the time to go back in memory for every detail. I know it wasn't a great experience. I never looked back since.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Where do I begin... when you can't tell some managers from the direct reports, what does that tell you. When a manager walks by you and doesn't speak, what does that say about the professionalism of the place. HR is a joke. This place is not at all what it seems after you make it out of training and the bow comes off. These people are SOOOO fake! Its actually funny. They (management) talks ALOT about moving around, they make it seem so easy to do...its not. The people here are clicked up, managers and direct reports and they hang together around the job and during the events and gossip like high schoolers. Micromanagement at its finest, you must sell and make no commision. Customers take surveys and lie. You get 1 bad survey and the 900 good or decent calls you had before mean nothing! 1 bad survey puts you in development. Its crazy, unfair to allow 1 customer survey overshadow a persons months of hard work. You won't be happy here, but goodluck anyway."
bad,"Job security was an issue here - constant layoffs and threats of layoffs.   No room for advancement unless you were willing to move to another state - NJ, FL, etc.."
bad,Not at all a great experience working with this company. Very stressful. Long shifts with limited very policed breaks and inconsistent management. Had to clock out to use the restroom. Otherwise it was considered time theft by company.
bad,I have nothing to say So is the day you can get the free one and get a better free app if ya have to wait to buy more levels then it is a good app to use to the free version
bad,"Decline to answer this question. formerly employed there and do not want to risk a negative retaliatory response. "
bad,I worked for Verizon through many cycles. Verizon is a highly competitive job that requires you to take on more roles then you expect. To save money they force representatives to handle all of the above type calls.
bad,"All about the numbers company you can never do enough to make the number they set for the bosses which in turn trickles down to the technician in the field who is a tech, a boss, an engineer and truble shooter ""ETC"", could keep going never appreciated for it ever!!!!!"
bad,"This company is the worst!"
bad,"Very slow not many customers came in so it was very hard to make money and do the job properly, Management and the CEO always said it was our fault but the mall we were in was practically abandoned therefore there was not much we could do."
bad,"Dead end job with no advancement opportunities. Folding clothes all day. left work really late. Not a very pleasant experience,"
bad,Excellent company if you're looking to get a well rounded skill set. Great benefits with access to plenty of resources. Company is not stable due to frequent downsizing.
bad,a typical day at work checking inventory making sure everything is accounted for talking to customers  to find out there needs to maximize every opportunity that is available i learned a great part of the sell phone industry and have great co-workers that i helped lead to maintain a positive attitude on a day to day basis. the hardest part of the job was keeping inventory up and the most enjoyable part was selling to the customers and making goal every month and hiting number
bad,"This company is unethical at every level.  The company hires anyone with a ""pulse"" and they all try to cheat each other.  This is a constant happening and nobody is willing to assist you to learn even your daily job."
bad,"Dishonest Trainers, Discrimination from Team Leaders, Dishonest Management, Lack of Intergrity and Values/Morals were left at the front door."
bad,"If a customer breaks their contract the company takes the commission and the cost of the phone out of your paycheck.  It's a hard job and mostly customer service, which you do not get compensated for.   It's 100% commission."
bad,"3rd paycheck was missing six hours, that was supposed to be added onto the next one. Suddenly, it happened again, I worked for a total of 70ish hours, only to get paid 35 of them."
bad,"Cold calling customers, how to sale products, was not available,enjoyed working with co workers, the hardest part of the job was cold calling customers, the most enjoyable was earning amx"
bad,"Too much stress from Internal co-workers. No follow through from other segments of the buisness. Billing issues, poor customer service."
bad,Promised to be hired as company employees but fell short in everything management said. Contingent employment was false hope for all who fell for it and ended up being one big lie!
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"I work for a Verizon agent store and I do not enjoy it because of the management. There is a lot of favoritism and bullying. It has not been a pleasant experience. The management does not listen to the employees even when they are right. There is no set rules for all employees and everyone does whatever they wish to do. One thing that may be allowed to one employee is not allowed to another. My district manager cursed at me because I tried to explain a situation related to a customer. Also, the commission is set in a way where it almost seems like they do not want employees to get commission. I did not enjoy working here and I am glad that I chose to leave after the cursing incident because it was about self-respect. The agent company is called Your Wireless Inc. I hope this may help someone."
bad,"worked 8-10 hr days"
bad,I was hired as a contractor in 2017 August for a migration but the work never got started. I ended up doing work that wasnt originally hired for in week 6 of getting hired. The work we were hired to do never panned out until I left.
bad,"ill say some positives first: 401k match healthcare is great best of all they pay for tuition $8000 a year to go to school (approved courses/majors)"
bad,"No longer a good place to work.  Lack of positive management, lack of respect for all employees, lack of recognition, appreciation and a lack of everything that motivates employees to be productive, honest, dedicated, proud and driven for the success of the company has destroyed what was once a great place to work.  A suicide, a death by heart attack while working in the office, resignations and terminations are signs of a place  not to work.  Best to avoid working in this broken culture.  It's not worth it.."
bad,"While the work could be challenging and fun at times, their was very little training, constant mistakes by IT in updating and creating programs. Cumbersome systems and no room for advancement. While there were a few women who were extremely helpful most people were not. A woman dominated office in which they let you know as a man that you were not to speak up and your opinion was NOT important!!"
bad,This job is ok but your schedule is all over the place and you have no work life balance. if you plan on having a set schedule also you can throw that out the window as well
bad,"1 word horrible poor pay , nothing was ever good enuff lack of respect for their employees,would always find away to cheat you out of your commission checks,if you put in for your vacation they would only approve you for 1 or 2 days at a time instead of a full week at a time, family and work life if you are a manager is never good because you are consistantly taken advantage of because you are salary...."
bad,"Management is rude and not there to help you succeed. They have zero morals. They don't care about the customers, only about the sale. They teach you how to lie and trick customers into products and services that they don't need."
bad,Verizon only cares about money. the workers do not matter taking calls until you drop is what matters. They give you begrudgingly 30 secondes between calls we used to get 2 minutes. It's all lie to the customer to get off the phone as fast as you can. If they call back it's your fault. No way to advance. Not a good place to work 14 years of it.
bad,Not the greatest work environment. Was required to drive a personal vehicle to do business development without mileage. Commission was capped on higher dollar accessory sales.
bad,"A typical day is spent on the phone handling various customer concerns. I learned new technology with computers and wireless devices. One on one meetings were occasionally canceled as I was told my performance was where it needed to be. However, I observed others in need of coaching and development go without one on one meetings for weeks. The most enjoyable time I had was when I was able to have breakthrough moments with my teammates to elevate their performance. Over the course of my time, the focus on employee satisfaction shifted downward. The first 10 years with this company was fine. The last 5-7 years I was there I had hoped for it to improve however it did not."
bad,"It was all good until the wrong people get put into places of power, the current district managers don’t respect your time and they are horribly disrespectful."
bad,"I worked for VERIZON for 7 years and have experienced every dynamic possible. In the past the compensation was worth the stress but now that the sales are saturated and stores are frequently closing it became evident that VERIZON does not care about their people. Hardwork and sacrifice is required to be successful but not appreciated. As a manager you have no defense or support, any day can be your last. With VERIZON there are a ton of work malpractice that go unaddressed. This company is so focused on not being unionized that they forgot what is important. Retail days are numbered so be cautious in your pursuits."
bad,At first was great until changes in bonus structure and favortism being shown for promotions instead of being recognized for your performance in leadership.
bad,"Look elsewhere, lots of stress with agents, no hands on, and is an overall stressful environment. Very little good things to say.  Employees self support each other while the supervisors are worrying about job security. They are unwilling to change anything about the work ethic and do not care about the employee."
bad,"Verizon, is basically is a place where only people from one country can flourish. Management is very biased, they promotes only their kind of people while rest of the people from other other countries has no chance to flourish in ranks."
bad,"Enjoyed being with the company before family, but not after creating a life. The company requires retail hours and has a lot of black out dates. They change commission structures too often making goals impossible to reach. The management is not the best."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"I joined the wireless world few months ago. Since working for Verizon I'm noticing I work so much harder than I've worked in my entire life with less pay. It's so depressing because the company doesn't value their employees from what I see and what I've heard. The commission structure is capped like no other. All of their competition gives higher base salaries with an uncapped commission structure. But, Verizon is number one?! Hmm, I see why because they don't pay their employees nothing. They keep changing the commission structure knowing their employees are not happy. I've noticed a lot of prejudice with some of the solution managers and with some of Verizon's wireless customer as well. Also, the pay is not for anyone in their mid 30's if you have a family you will struggle.  Get out and stop pretending you're happy when you know you're not."
bad,Verizon was a very hard company to work for.  They did not care about the workers.  The store management played favorites in the Orlando store.  The Sarasota store is where I originally worked.  The manager there was very good.  She trained us and helped us on the sales floor.
bad,"June 18 comp plan changes are hurting the company.  The retail stores have tough sales goals, but the pay doesn’t match up to the expectations. Zero incentive and no budget. Verizon will spend zero on you and ask you to do any and everything you can to make them more profitable. Very greedy company. 12 year employee."
bad,"work/life balance is non- existent but worth it if you are a young career driven individual with no free time- you can make a ton of money if you work the system and the comp plan that is always changing as soon as you figure it out and make money- then they change the way you are paid and how you are paid,"
bad,"Good morning was everyday no matter how your day or night went, dispatch jobs took attendance always fun part load trucks nd off to install or repair."
bad,"I was a contract employee.  You were treated like an outcast right from the beginning.  There was hardly any training, you were limited as to with whom you could ask for help from, manager wasn't available and when approached would tell you to seek another employee for assistance"
bad,When I worked for Verizon it was a lot different. A lot has changed since then. When I worked for them we were barely selling the iPhone 4s. Verizon..
bad,"No work life balance or room for advancement based on merit, I have worked there for over 6 years and I have seen very little advancement opportunities, those that are advanced are not through merit."
bad,not enough accountability beyond the point of sale. No support for field employees. Not comfortable with biannual price increases with no explanation to consumer such as improved service or more content. It was just a bit more than I was personally willing to scarifice.
bad,"this was the only job i've ever work that was commission base and with that being said, Ive never worked a company that the employees would do anything to make a sale even if it didn't benefited the customer."
bad,"In my three long months with Verizon, I was treated very poorly by management and also by customers. The work environment was very stressful and I was always under pressure to handle and take care of more customers than I was able to. At any given point in time there were over 500 customers to be helped, and management continuously pushed them onto us regardless of quality."
bad,"not  really  a  pleasant place  to  work, need more   help   from  supervisor in  order  to be more  efficient."
bad,"VES for sale, no strategy. Indeed.com is an American worldwide employment-related search engine for job listings launched in November 2004.[2] As a single-topic search engine, it is also an example of vertical search. Indeed is currently available in over 60 countries and 28 languages."
bad,"Currently I am involved in a labor dispute with Verizon Communications, I seek temporary employment until this dispute is resolved. "
bad,all we did was go door to go signing people up for verizon fios . deffently a job i wouldnt do again. theres no more to say about this company
bad,They underpay you for the work you do. Advancement is based on who you know and who likes you. They change your schedule whenever they want to and if you have kids you can not get the schedule you need. For school however this is a good job to work because they work with your schedule and they re open 24 hours. You work every weekend and holiday unless your off days fall on that day. If you call in or are late they take away from your PTO that you accrue after 90 days on the production floor. You accrue 4 PTO hours every pay period.
bad,The pay is not a steady pay. Straight commission no base pay. You will spend more money on the job than earning it. Still have to work outdoors in bad weather.
bad,The worst part of this job was dealing with the customers. Maybe it was the location but I have never been cursed out so many times in my life.
bad,verizon was a good place to work at until it changed to at&t and apple from there it went all down hill. new site directors didnt know how a call center should be ran
bad,"No leadership, people were stealing and no one worked...just a por culture that lacked any professionalism. NO opportunity to progress or get promoted, everythng was deadend...I got an offer for a 35% raise and ran...you should stay away too!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,The NMC had a culture of a large separation between the royalty and the peasants. Tier 1 folks were treated like peasants and Tier 2 acted like royalty. They didn’t even sit together for lunch. Tier 2 acted like they were gods and Tier I were like the worker bees. It was sad to observe the best Tier 1  people continually striving to prove to Tier 2 that they knew what they were doing.  And then there was the dreaded conference room where the manager would pull you in every couple of weeks to tell you how you were doing.  Open office environment so everybody can see everything you did and hear everything you said. An extremely toxic environment. Not good.
bad,Verizon wants to get out of retail. Necessary changes are currently being implemented to push the current customer base to ordering devices and accessories with less reliance on visiting a retail location. Retail Management is forced to micro-manage sales reps as a result of unrealistic quotas and KPI attainment metrics. The writing is on the wall regardless of what the majority of management believe.
bad,Verizon is okay company to work for if you're ready to be stuck in your misleading current position for 5-10 years. The work is very mentally stressful and has caused several of my former coworkers to quit or cause self harm to them selves.
bad,"Verizon expects you to memorize an entire volume of information to use when speaking with customers. Don't expect to go to the bathroom when you need to. You can go only during a break or lunch, any other time is unacceptable and will get you fired. All your calls are monitored and will be examined during conference time with your manager. If you cannot achieve these things, and your goals,, your days will be short at Verizon."
bad,"A Indian shop, I was the only US Born Technical in my group of roughly 70 Telegu technicals.  They hired within their Indian subculture.  There was one Tamil, one persian, and one pakistani, and me.   Verizon is supporting a Racist (anti other) environment by their hiring practices."
bad,"Not a good job long term, I would not want to have a family while working here. The bosses were hit or miss to get along with, most seemed unqualified but the turnover at the position caused unqualified workers to fill the position."
bad,Verizon is a top notch company. They will make money by selling everything they can. The problem with working for a company like Verizon is that everything is micro managed. They want you to sell so much that they may sway the truth from promotions oftenly and every rep has a different story when selling a service because it changes quickly due to their methods of selling.
bad,Company lacks the ability to provide adequate work life balance as well as opportunities to move up. Would not recommend this as a workplace if you have a family.
bad,They wouldn't allow me to have time off for my wedding due to the iPhone being launched. I had to fight to have time off approved for a surgery I needed to have as well.
bad,The people that you work with a new retail center are very friendly and are the biggest asset to Verizon.  The management culture is one that needs to be very closely looked at.  The coaching and development that is provided to you by the retail leadership is minimal and it seems that the only coaches you have our goals to hold you accountable for not meeting the key performance indicator.  The ability to progress in the company as a leader are extremely minimal and you have to move out of town in order to be considered for leadership.  You have people that have been working as a retail employee for an average of five years plus without ever seeing a promotion or the likelihood of one which makes some people very irritable to work with.
bad,"The position itself can be very stressful. Between the mismanagement, escalated callers, constant changes, and mandatory overtime,  you would imagine that the management would be a lot more eager to assist their employees considering how much they constantly have to deal with"
bad,"What I learned at Verizon is to take care of the customer but I also learned what not to do when conflict arises. Great learning experience overall, but the hours and never good enough work environment is not healthy for long periods of time."
bad,"**What I Learned:  The pay and benefits have to be relatively good because the environment that employees are subjected to is not conducive to positive morale. "
bad,Verizon is not a life long career position. It is a good stepping stone. Management is not present. Does not hold team accountable. There is hardly any individual growth. It took me a year to have a decent conversation with my manager. Pay is not guaranteed. Every paycheck is a battle to get what I've earned in previous months.
bad,good benefits and overtime available shift bids were not fair based on tenure also one bad survey can have you lose your job. Ability to move up in the company was very hard.
bad,"Good place to start off and get some work experience and get paid. not a good place to advance in if you work in the call center, especially tech support. Management is always looking for a reason to get you on something and the union is a little too close with managment. it pays well and people can definitely handle their bills, but there is little regard for the workers work life balance and little is cared for about the personal situations and there is little flexibility toward the workers."
bad,There is not room for advancement.  They would rather hire outside personnel than to hire qualified individuals that already know the daily duties of the job.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Great pay however thats only because it is a Union job. Schedule is crazy, overtime is out of control because its mandatory. Stressful environment and management is ruthless. I would never recommend anyone to work for Verizon Communications"
bad,"Upper Management is full of egotistical male chauvinists. One manager randomly asked who hired me, and if I had gone to college. In addition to other things the overall toxicity of the call center drove some employees to need medication in order to come to work. This poor working experience changed my outlook on Verizon."
bad,I was only a contractor and do not feel qualified to give a rating.  My ratings were based on what regular employees told me while I was working as a contractor.
bad,A challenging account. Will definitely stretch you and improve you in all aspects. Verizon gives too much on your plate that will make you stronger and knowldgable on how you will handle the business
bad,"DId not enjoy working at Verizon, only stayed about 6 months, went through 3 store managers, promised competitive pay and advancement, they did not follow through."
bad,A typical day at work can be shifted throughout the week. I've learned patience. It is friendly we all get along pretty fairly. the most enjoyable parts are the difficult ones.
bad,Verizon has nice pay and benefits but required to much from their employees without any added benefit. Things would change daily and employees would not be told until a month or two later.
bad,The whole job is about how much you sell and put into customers shopping bag.  What ever happened to actually helping people and getting them the best product for their lifestyle?  Not at VZW
bad,don't work here. no benefits. they want you to sell and iy doesn't pay anyting. the commission is terrible. you wont make any miney here. I love my store manager and coworkers though.
bad,"You are graded on EVERYTHING.  How long it took you to answer a question, did you mention that you could do that online?  Even if the customer is wrong - the customer is ALWAYS right.  I always felt like i needed a psychiatrist after every shift since all the customer service calls were essentially people that took their bad day out on you."
bad,Very little communication or sharing of information. The location was difficult to find and the surrounding area had no nearby stores to shop at. Everything was far and difficult to get to.
bad,Well I generally was hired for a commission job only but was upgraded to an hourly which I thought sound good until it came down to getting paid for the actual hours and days I worked it was like pulling teeth trying to get my money that was owed to me then when I finally talked to some one in HR she was very rude and nasty and made me wait no once but a few times for my check that was supposed to have been paid weeks prior
bad,"If you're looking for an entry level position, this is the place to be. For experienced professional like myself, they make a lot of promises and don't fulfill them. The organizational structure is consistently changing and difficult to move up unless you know someone up the ranks. Politics drives your career if you want to stay here."
bad,"very low pay, no room for advancement in a company that is consistently changing ownership and business model. Difficult management structure. Not a growth industry"
bad,This a contract position with no room for growth into another better paying position. People were only given 30 days to find another position once the contract ended.
bad,"shift balance work to life isn't good and trying to work with isn't good. shift bid should not once a year. only good thing is discount and pay, able to do felix schedule"
bad,"Never know when the next layoff will come, no job security at all. Bad upper management that cause the down fall of once a good company to work for.  Good benefits if you can stay employed."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,The historic adversarial and acrimonious cultural attitudes and behavior between management and labor union members is toxic for employees + customers
bad,"I learned a lot from working there, How to be a good customer service rep, how to listen and review, solve problems and resolve issues for special requests."
bad,the amount of times that management will switch goals and quota while ignoring your personal life makes it the worst job.  if  you need a life line get the job other than that run away .
bad,The pay was really good and the commissions were nice. Unfortunately it was back to back calls of angry customers screaming at you as your manager is asking why you arent selling to them. They can route the good sales calls to whoever they want.
bad,"Cellular sales only industry the longer you work, the less you get paid. Revamping of quota and constant metric changes doesn't help in sustaining a profitable quarter."
bad,"I worked for a third party vender for Verizon, KGB, and it was a horrible experience. Everything and everyone was very unorganized. For everything you have to deal with the pay was horrible."
bad,"very unstable, one day you may have a job one day you may not. Feels like management need to have an overhaul, you can be ranked top 30 in the nation and still threatened to be fired."
bad,"The current Retailer I work for expects you to work 60 hours a week, for minimal pay, they do some really shady things. I sell with integrity and have always taken care of my customers, yet they want to threaten peoples jobs when they wont do things a certain way. I won't state the retailer, however I can not continue to work for them with the way things are going."
bad,"Focus on working the customer over with packages they don't want and services they don't need.  It's a sales organization so that is to be expected.  Beware, they turn on people on a dime."
bad,This call center was purchased by another company. This was a very restrictive and threatening environment. They threaten to fire for every small infraction.
bad,"good place the layoff was not good at all, many people lost the job due company transfer to another state instead keeping the job here where we doing well"
bad,"They have a good portfolio of products to Sell/Present to Potential Customers, but they pay very low commission for how much work you put in for each sales opportunity. I like their benefits, but your pay will very drastically. If youre looking for a stable or a more consistent sales opportunity then look elsewhere. Also, Management is cut throat and careless about your work/life balance."
bad,"hours kept changing, policies were presented then rejected, company lied about chances for advancement, incentive plans & managers were disrespectful."
bad,This has been the most difficult position. The training is poor and the management is worse. There expectations are for you to give 200% while they lay you off for years of service.
bad,"I worked for Verizon Wireless for 6 years.  Company culture is very political. Don't trust upper management, most of the them does not know their team members and do know where to find them because work is sent to India. Verizon has opened VDSI in India and are getting rid of people onshore to send the jobs outside the country. IT management is very good to cover up all the bad decision they made."
bad,"Difficult to adhere to the guidelines because the quality was based on the opinion of one person.   The scale for quality calls varied between one QA person to another.  By that, one QA person would accept a call as good and hit all the marks where another would not.  No consistency."
bad,Decent place to work if you are looking for a job in sales in a pinch.  Potential to make a lot of money if you dont want to have a family life
bad,"Less than educated managers managing highly educated teams."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"long hours, undervalued and forced to meet unrealistic expectations. constantly told by management to lie to customers in order to sell products they dont want."
bad,"The fair pay and benefits are the best thing about the position and that makes it hard to leave. Those, however, have fallen off over the years. Things like a profit sharing bonus being replaced by an arbitrary store satisfaction survey bonus that is designed to fail. This in addition to the daily duress of making quota which has become like trying to hit a moving target, with the threat of management writing those up who do not meet those standards. Ethically, there is a very fine line between what we are trained to do here and what is known as the best thing to do for the consumer. I can no longer sacrifice my integrity to satisfy these requirements. Shifts are a minimum of 10 hours and most often we cannot get a break for lunch if management deems it to be too busy, which it always is. It's gotten to the point in which you literally see a manager's shadow looming with every transaction done to ensure requirements have been met. No matter the age or the situation the customer may have, the robotic sales process and threatening management style makes this place difficult to work at. This company does not see that it is there to assist people rather force them into products without full disclosure to encourage the company's growth. I see it becoming the next ""Wells Fargo"" in the near future unless they change their sales tactics."
bad,"I have worked in technology sales for several years, and I can say that Verizon is my least favorite by far! Pay is ok. Definitely not what it use to be. The hourly is low in comparison to other mobile companies and the commission is low and difficult to hit quota. You must have an open schedule and no life plans/ vacation or family time wanted. They will not accommodate you schedule wise. Verizon might seem like a great place to work in theory, but personally i do not enjoy it. Management is harsh no matter if you are hitting your numbers or not. I would choose another company to work for that pays a little more per hour, but doesn't have these high standards that are never good enough."
bad,"Very unstable work place.Higher management was awful and inefficient. District managers barely had any selling experience in the stores, so if there was an issue with a customer or a question about a product, you were on your own. Pay rate constantly changes and NOT for the better. At one point, I made between $1,200 - $1,600 every 2 weeks and after the pay change, I made about $550 - $700 (if I was lucky). Personal life will not exist because of the long hours you are given."
bad,the job was fun and the customers were great but the company as a whole wasnt all that great. Some of the managers were disrespectful to the employees and customers and some of the sales people were very lazy at the job and not will to help the customers.
bad,"EPS is the outsourced company Verizon has hired to represent their company. The job itself is not a bad position, but the leadership is to be desired. EPS is disorganized and a lot of personal environment is brought into the work place. The ""do as I say and not do as I do"" is a standard functionality. Employees are in a low moral culture that does not seem to get better. "
bad,"A  typical day at work was for our office to sale to customers. I learned how to talk to people more effectively. The managers were too strict and unpleasant to work with, and the co-workers were not so faithful. The hardest part of the job was to convince new customers to buy our products, but the most enjoyable part of the job was traveling."
bad,"Quota was impossible to hit in my location with the clientele that was provided.  If you want a job Monday- Friday this isnt the job either.  To make money, you had to work weekends."
bad,"You'll be micromanaged and won't receive adequate training; however, the benefits are really good and the base salary is decent."
bad,This company is not family oriented as they claim. The stress is not worth the pay. The constant changing environment causes so much stress physically and mentally that I had to be hospitalized twice.
bad,"This is a good company to learn but leave asap. "
bad,"Kiosk at the mall. Sales; cellphone, services and accessories. Environment was great but management was not very helpful. Enjoyed meeting new people. Everyone was pretty much on their own trying to sell as much as possible with little to no compensation/ bonus structure."
bad,no oppurtunity to move up in the company.....none none none none none none
bad,"Management is so disconnected from reality. As a sales rep you will be expected to hit your impossible goals every month. If you don't, your pay will suffer and you have to go to mandatory meetings on your days off (much like detention in grade school.) The only reps who meet their goals are those who lie and cheat customers which management encourages."
bad,"This was a very unique situation, due to accepting a position and agreeing to assist with the launch of a new store. The typical day at work was very slow, and had very little traffic, and the opportunity to meet goals was limited. I did learn to use different computer systems and more about inventory control. The management was very volatile, and the store manager resigned with 30 days. This made the job even more difficult without proper leadership. The environment was fast paced sales, resulting in a high turnover ratio. The hardest part of the job was meeting very high goal with very little traffic. This resulted in resigning due to this position being based on commission. The company was Go Wireless, an authorized retailer for Verizon."
bad,"No proper work."
bad,"Your shifts are based on how long you have been with the company and your amount of sales. So of course just coming on board with this company it is very difficult to get good profitable shifts. There is no true leadership. They put sales reps who do not truly have the best interest of the company in a mentoring position who not only do not teach you the must knows, but teach you barely enough so that they can be the actual succeeder."
bad,A typical day would be when a customer comes in I would check there account to see if they are eligible to upgrade and what I could do to help them get a new plan that lowered my monthly bill. Asked them if I could take care of transferring info from my old phone to new phone which is always important and get them in and out in no time.
bad,Verizon Wireless is a company that I choose not to review as somethings are best kept silent.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Great place to work at first. Corporate greed takes precedent over core values.
bad,not very organize and never have time to talk when there was a problem.
bad,"There is lack of advancement in many of the offices. The management is established in a way to lead by fear. The pay is good compared to the job. Not a career I would recommend for parents who which to have a fixed work schedule. The company would rather you work like a robot but they do not provide a high moral in the office. The consultants position is a fast paced, high stressed environment."
bad,"bad retail hours, have to work on holidays. managers are yes men and district managers are even worse. May have the worse people in management than any company in america."
bad,"I think that wds is horrible, they dont care about you or your life. All they care about is whether or not you are getting your stats. the company will promote people who dont deserve it. They passed me up for promotion multiple times."
bad,the people i worked with were great but the management sucked
bad,COO is an absolute nightmare and many of the VPs are on power trips. Culture is very back-stabby and full of sycophants.
bad,"If you like the cutthroat/used car sales environment than the Turkey Creek store in Knoxville is for you. The management is terrible, at times they run around and scream like idiots. The expectations are through the roof and you basically have to rob people to meet your numbers hints the used car sales environment! Not all but a lot of associates are cutthroat and only care about hitting their numbers not taking care of the customer. Lots of associates will hide and act too busy so they don't have to help the next customer because of an issue. It all comes down to the management and no one is held accountable, All they care is that you're blowing your numbers out of the water."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of opening the store, checking inventory, assist customer inquiries and sales. I've learned that the higher management need to make improvements to provide accurate information so the store manager to do their job. Most of the people I've worked with shared a positive attitude and we did the best we could with what was given to us. The hardest part was giving customers inaccurate information. The most enjoyable part was selling a product a customer really enjoyed and helped show them how to use it."
bad,Typical Work Day - customer service and sales
bad,"Typical retail environment, Hard work often goes unnoticed, numbers driven and hard working. Once management ran thru performance, now is just run thru the motions. Not a professional atmosphere, ran like a college frat house, alot of college and high school graduates, very few make this a career."
bad,login to system
bad,"You are constantly under pressure to hurry up and take more and more calls. The pressure gets even bigger to keep your calls under a certain amount of time. If your time is over what it's supposed to be, you get into trouble. If your time is way too fast, you get into trouble. If you send too many calls over to an SA (Service Assistant), you get into trouble. It's absolutely ridiculous at what they want."
bad,"I hated working for vzw. 90 % of all of their employees wish they could find another job with same pay. They do not value their employees at all work schedules suck the only way you will get weekends off is working until 1115pm, unless you have been with the company for 15 years. No consistency among the sup or anyone of management. And they are all about numbers if you don't make your numbers for one month they write you up and threaten your job regardless if you met every month prior."
bad,"Management didn't work well. Before starting the job you are advised about the issues between logistics and techs. Made it very hard to work there. No matter if you filled their orders 100% right, they found a way to say it was wrong."
bad,"Shallow company with no flexibility   Run away   Seriously, run away   Not worth the blow to your ego   Truly vapid and racist    Absurd management, terrible work/life balance and completely “backwards” in terms of education, quality of employees, and efficiency"
bad,"I don't believe in speaking negatively about companies, but my time spent here was short-lived due to the unethical actions of employees and management."
bad,"Working for a Telephone Company can be rewarding or stressful depending on tolerance. You have a quota to meet or how many phone lines to sale, if you don't make that quota then it will be frustrating."
bad,There were constant layoffs at Verizon which made it very stressful to work there.   Good benefits and reasonable pay.   Some people great to work with and some a nightmare.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,The time I was working there it was really hard to make commission. We have to sell 30 tablets every month and if we dont we get money taken out. It was real bad back then.
bad,"No career advancement, company typically does not hire. Position hired for was temporary position that extended over years with no benefits as a temp employee. No permanent position was offered."
bad,"Verizon wireless has few Pros compared to cons. The pros of working at Verizon are the pay offered a full time position can make around 70,000 per year while a part-time position can make up to 35,000 a year. The 401k provided through fidelity is matched up to 6 percent. At Verizon you are required to know products and promotions in order to position the best recommendation to customers. If you aren't getting yelled at by a customer about their bill then you are probably getting talked to by management about what you discovered and positioned to your last guest. Constant system errors while you are trying to ring out items are enough alone to drive you crazy. Goodluck you'll need patience."
bad,I would not recommend any person seek employment with Verizon; they really do not care about their employees. the workplace was very toxic. the management is staff is not inclusive and the only enjoyment is the pay check.
bad,They did not care about the employee. They are only concerned with the customer's point of view. They believed the customer over the employee and would the employee at any opportunity
bad,"Honestly sales was a fall back job for me and it is really cut throat at Verizon. When you do well like I do other people become threatened and begin a ""witch hunt"" to push you out."
bad,"All I can say is I was literally told if family is my number one priority then it probably wasn't the place for me to work. Would be a great place to work for someone single, or a couple with no children."
bad,"Verizon used to be a great place to work but it has changed drastically over the last few years. They've lost much of their identity. Most of IT is now outsourced or offshored, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just the way they were doing it didn't make sense."
bad,"The pay wasn't balanced for the type of requirements they set for us. Management was poor, very pushy, almost made me feel like I had to be dishonest to get products out the door."
bad,"Verizon really tried to make it good work place.  But the fun ideas devised at the corporate level were not realistic at the front line.  Ultimately, the most important things to the supervisors were your metrics -- and they all had to be perfect.  Customer reviews of service were rarely, if ever, overturned - even if there was overwhelming evidence the customer was lying about their experience.  Very stressful place to work -- i couldn't move to another job fast enough"
bad,"In my time at Verizon, the company culture went from top of its industry to floundering with no direction. Grasping at every possible thing that could potentially grow revenue with out having a clear path forward."
bad,"Good hourly, commission structure has changed making it harder to make a commission check. Great benefits. Verizon is very numbers driven which is fine but not when the new structure makes it twice as hard to earn a commission. Because moral and traffic is down management resorts to micromanaging and shame management making it stressful to make it through the day."
bad,"I’ve come from other call centers but this one is horrible. Training was very inefficient for what i would actually be doing when I got on the floor, some managers  are super unprofessional, I had two good ones but that is out of the 5 managers i had in only 6 months. One of them is trying to switch departments. They are always changing what the metrics mean so it’s hard to keep up with them. For instance, a sales metric was initially for upgrades on phones, then suddenly it changed it only plan upgrades, two weeks after that it changed to only “certain plan” upgrades... so u really have to do a lot of self educating and research to be able to stay on top of things and make sure u are performing. Half the center abuses “Fmla/leave of absence” because you really need it to be mentally healthy."
bad,There was little room for advancement and my manager blocked several transfer opportunities.  He cited the department was low on resources.  My manager had to attend several training courses because of his poor leadership skills and verbally abusive behavior.
bad,Verizon does not make strategic decisions on behalf of it's employee base. Verizon is stuck in a reactionary space of cost reduction and self preservation.
bad,"Poor management, poor commission setup. If you need anything to get done around there you have to figure out how to do it yourself if it's a managers job to do. And poor communication"
bad,"The  work itself was highly technical. However, there was very poor work life balance. Quarterly layoffs took a toll on the  staff. In addition, our  unit was outsourced to another company."
bad,If you are new to the company you dont know any better . but the teniored employees are miserable. For good reason. All of commissioned reps are losing out to non commissioned reps. all under the guise of cutting down handling times.
bad,My manager does not know how to be an actual manager. The company doesn’t seem to care much about their smaller stores and their pay structure only benefits the bigger locations
bad,Typical day was spend in meetings putting out other peoples fires. Management had poor understanding of the project and did poor job communicating to employees what was required and what was expected.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,I am employed by Alorica but my work assignment is with Verizon BGCO . Upper management is horrible. Unprofessional as well as dysfunctional. The location is in Greensboro  NC location. Human Resources do not care for the employees and like to sweep concerns under the rug
bad,When I started with Verizon the benefits and compensation were incredible.  Recently they have raised commission goals to unattainable levels while decreasing the amount of money we get paid out for hitting those goals.  I had colleagues who were making six figures only able to make half of that this last year.   With the CEO change Verizon stopped caring about its employees and only started caring about profits.  They mask this by saying they care about the customers more but recent policy changes have been detrimental for the customer experience as well.
bad,"During the period i was there the management was not working closely with hr and preoccupied with getting ignorant people hired so that they did not contribute and were taught to take advantage of customers,  then expected to take responsibility when the managers manipulated them into doing the wrong thing for the customers.  Millions of customers have been sold items and features that they never needed and will never use and almost all of them are unaware of what they are paying for on a monthly basis.  Really no integrity at this company"
bad,"Verizon cares more about saving money, being green and promoting the ""right mix"" of cultures rather than using the best employees for the task at hand."
bad,"Working Verizon was fun for the first 3 months, then sweeping changes occurred, less about employee more about numbers, coworkers act nice and then snake sales from underneath you, great outside illusion of a company that cares and takes care of employees but really doesn't in the slightest"
bad,"The Verizon I speak about is a Third Party retailer aka Franchise.  And in all honesty, it was a Horrible experience due to the Upper Management also, the don't pay Hours Plus Commission, Just commission and the Over time hours you work Only."
bad,"A typical day at work was forcing unto people things they don't need and can't afford. "
bad,"Verizon Wireless is a good employer, they offer great benefits and the pay is decent. I would strongly steer away from certain departments i.e the care umbrella because the leadership for these departments is very very poor."
bad,I wasted 10 years of my life there. I tried so much to be promoted into a position that I actually would’ve enjoyed. But it seemed like the way to get promoted was that you had to give a little something to climb the corporate latter if you know what I mean.
bad,"hard to keep employees. onboarding process was not good when I work there, sales driven work force. If you do not like to sales this is not the job for you."
bad,"The job is a difficult job, you are handling over 40 to 60 calls per day dealing with irate customers. Some of the mangers are helpful and some are just there to give you codes and exceptions, none of theme come from a sales background. There are variety of products to sell, too many and are expected to hit unrealistic quota expectations.  You can make money and if you put in a lot of work, and do overtime. If you do not like to be micromanaged this job is not for you. You are constantly being call monitored, being reviewed and critiqued daily. This is a high pressure sales job with really high expectations. You have managers that are required to sit next to you and listen to your every word, and rate you, on top of that there's a whole separate team that just does quality control on a daily basis listing to calls. If you are hungry, a natural salesmen and can are good on the phones then this job might be for you. But honestly if you are that good you are probably better off somewhere else and would make more money."
bad,RF design Team was the most stupidest team I have ever worked with. The manager never gave a chance to grow. Very selfish and cold blooded. My manager was not worthy of being a manager.
bad,"Pros: paid sick and vacation days, decent co-workers."
bad,"Managers were misguided"
bad,All craft jobs were under union control.  The only way to advance was by seniority and knowing someone to help you get in.  There is a lot of politics and nepotism at Verizon.
bad,"It is a culture of management knows everything, and you're nothing but a number. You're often reminded that you can be replaced. Many of the employees have been there too long, with no outside experience to speak of, and are part of the stagnant culture."
bad,its the most micromanaged job that Ive ever had. high pressure sales environment. No opportunities for advancement. Leadership out of touch with their customers
bad,I worked them on a contract position.. but the environment there was  ok at the time. I would never be interested in working there fulltime. The competition is to much
bad,Verizon pushes sales and has turned it's back on customer service.  You are encouraged to make to push sales hard core.  If you aren't as aggressive as management sees appropriate then you are disciplined for it.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Typical day started 5:30am pacific. Learned about mobile operating systems, troubleshooting telemetry devices, machine to machine communication and technical writing. Culture at work is toxic with the constant fear of being layoff or being without a job it's hard to be a happy go lucky camper. The hardest part about the job was fearing when you're getting moved or you're getting laid off. The only enjoyable things I could think of are my co-workers and getting a paycheck every 2 weeks while it lasts."
bad,It's an ok work place. Often you have to find your way to motivate your reps considering the lack of consistency on pay structure. Also micromanaging which disregard work life balance.
bad,"Great place to work from a health benefits and 401k standpoint.  Much of your advancement is not based on skill or hard work though, it's based on networking instead.  Areas for advancement are few and very selective. Company is very customer focused and not employee driven at all.  There is no structured mentoring or advancement programs available above sales rep."
bad,The work is continuous there are always upset people to help. The quotas they give makes you want to turn down customers that only want the basics. If the sales arent fully loaded you get taken aside and coached.
bad,Verizon was a great company when I started in 2011 but declined rapidly over the years. Poor acquisitions on top of the leading officials being out of touch with the market and consumers. the company went to leading the pack to follow others trends.
bad,"Intense, emotionally draining, and poorly compensated.  Benefits were great, but that was the only positive. If you are a compassionate human being, this job will crush your soul."
bad,Verizon Business had major layoffs each year before the earnings were released.  They showed a profit to the stockholders by laying off hundreds of people
bad,Work life balance was a struggle here. Seems like they would rather spend money on bandaids rather than do something right. Getting help was a struggle
bad,upper management has to much control need to let lower management do their job need more help in areas need to cut down on wasteful decisions make our job fun again
bad,"Too much corporate bureaucracy, its not what you know its who you know. When you have success, people view that as a threat. Everyone is stressed. We need to sell more than what customers need."
bad,It's a nice job to start at but do not expect support from team leaders really.  There are a few good ones their but the bad outweighs the good.  Just go do your job and do not try to make friends.  Theirs a lot of friends and family working there.  Be careful who you speak your business with and just go to work to work.
bad,"Teams function differently. Certain managers push excessively towards stretching working hours. "
bad,"A typical (9 hour day) day at work would entail about 4 different customer interactions all day long. I would typically be working my shift alone, so when I am done with all of my operational duties, I am left to my own devices. "
bad,"The job is easy; however, the site is a hostile work environment. If the worksite offered a secure safe work environment I would still be employed with the company."
bad,A call center environment is very stressful. You take calls after calls after call and can not pause for a second. Breaks and lunches were strictly enforced. You were graded by how many calls you took and disgruntle customers can determine your ability to make quotas.
bad,"I was never trained properly to do the big projects I was assigned and  I was not given any type of support system. I was set up to fail from day 1 and the commute was draining, as it was over 3 hours daily."
bad,Company has potential but would first need to address and remove some pretty bad mangers. Legacy people unwilling to listen to new ideas and only seem to promote their friends
bad,New Management does not have a clue on what it takes to be a manager and help employees grow instead they ask advise from senior techs and then blame them for their actions.
bad,"Being my 1st call center I didn't know what to expect.  The metrics weren't hard to meet but being in the technology industry they changed often. Not having a fixed schedule it was extremely hard to have another job, attend school or do certain things with your family. Fun culture but not many opportunities for advancement which was discouraging."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"I liked meeting new people and offering them with new products. But the company's management was managed really poorly."
bad,Fired for discrimination and resentment. Denied yearly bonus after being relieved of my post for no apparent reason. Manager hated me from the first day of work. Never really worked with or involved me when she became in charge. When the director retired she quickly moved to get rid of me when the new director was hired.
bad,"You get paid for your time and energy, the minimum they can get by with.  No personal relationship / when they want to slash costs / you may be the first to go no matter time in grade or experience level / no camaraderie, no trust, everyday is spent significant amounts of time covering your own butt, you will be required to do what once was multiple employees jobs (because those employee were let go)."
bad,I thought that working here was going to make my life better but I was dead wrong. You are constantly under pressure to get things done. I should have done my research well.
bad,"Management is stuck n the buddy network.  Poor management skills, all out for themselves, bonuses, take little time to understand what is actually going on.  No f0cus on the customer as far as fleet management goes."
bad,"Overall, they plan in the minute, and this results in poor results and just more work to perform; Of course, the deadline is not moved.  Very poor culture overall and a chop-shop with only lip service to progressive QA culture.  Understandable the business is very competitive and low ROI now, not the tech lead it once was."
bad,I was the assistant retail sales manager at one of the busiest corporate Verizon Wireless stores in metro east St. Louis.  There was another assistant manager and a store manager that would constantly come in late or call off.  I would pull double shifts constantly and at that time there was not overtime until 2 years after I started.
bad,"VZW used to be a good work place which valued qualitiy of work ."
bad,"Work life balance is not ideal for this position or company. Compensation is not structured well at all, you can bust your butt and not see great rewards."
bad,"Between the low pay, and inability to move up not a great place to work. The management if extremely ridged and among the older workers there is always a palpable fear of being laid off."
bad,Very decentralized environment. Not a team focused culture. Not friendly. Hoteling is problematic. Little training. High workload. No management support.
bad,"My stay at Verizon lasted 9 years. During that time the job I was doing stayed roughly the same, but staffing declined every year. Policy was to rarely replace anyone who left the department. Workload increased while worker headcount declined."
bad,Verizon is a good job. As long as you stay focused you can achieve your monthly quota however this is not a work/life balance job. It will definitely take you away from your family.
bad,"Verizon is not sure what and where they are heading to. * to 5 typical day. Learned they are totally confused. Management has no clue, Work culture sucks. Hardest part is multitasking."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,You can work here if you can tolerate customer service. You can work here if you can tolerate management that is overburdened and thus not able to develop you to a point where you can advance. It's pretty much a typical call center in all aspects. Some are cut out for this type of customer service and those people can make a career out of this position. I am not one of those people.
bad,"Verizon has no loyalty to their employees and make it very difficult to move into different groups, especially from wireline to wireless.   It is an environment of constant layoffs."
bad,management sucks they don't know how to work with their employees. co workers  and managers discriminate a lot. very stressful environment.
bad,If you are ok selling with shady tactics or doing whatever it takes to say yes even lying then this job is for you. If you have a soul look elsewhere than verizon unless you are not going to be in retail
bad,Cellular Sales is not the company for everyone. 100% commission based not any thing more. If someone steals anything you pay for it out of your check.
bad,Entire workplace unprofessional with no benefits for stress relief care for employees or professionalism. Its high stress low benefit workplace. Mainly high school grads and college students.
bad,"Working in sales is great for me because I have a lot of energy and potential in sales and closing sales with confidence comes naturally to me . I learned communication skills , negotiating skills and selling skills. The hardest part of my job is nothing , I love what I do , it is easy , I meet my goals and requirements every month . My co workers are excellent and we get along just fine ."
bad,Verizon Wireless used to be a good company to work but then Verizon Telecom started to taking over control of the company and it has been down hill ever since. Verizon Telecom has become failing company since people started to move away from landline phones. When a failing company starts to push their ways onto a successfully company there is only one way for that company to go...
bad,"Working with Verizon requires being able to quickly adapt to change and go with the flow. As soon as you learn a process it changes, making it difficult to get into any sort of flow."
bad,Questionable management practices and nearly impossible goals measured by a flawed system. I scored 88% against a goal of 93% measured solely by after-encounter assessment from customers who only contacted us with a problem. Expected to deal with 10 customers per hour.
bad,"Pay and benefits reduced but remain fair. Lots of changes past three years, including large reductions in staff."
bad,"Communication is not where it should be for a company of this nature.  Information is always delayed, incorrect or never released."
bad,General manager & district manager ran store in ground!!! I left as the # 1 rep in store... But I was told I wasn't good enough!!! Gm had terrible communication with reps!!! Worst thing about store. Myself and two others reps pulled the store out of a bad spot in  week doing everything our way and not listening to management and finished in the top 3 stores in the district.
bad,"Working at VZW has become very difficult. At one time, moving up was not that bad. Moving up now has become very difficult and meeting goals is getting more and more difficult to achieve, even for tenured representatives."
bad,"When you look for a company, you seek growth and not being held back from what you are trying to achieve. It is slowly declining as a company."
bad,"My store in particular had little to no management, the only good manager was the district manager, The SM and TM were garbage. And by this I mean there is no sensitivity training. Everyday we had to check our email and most of the time the employees expect to find a rant from managers about how our scores are doing. Not in an uplifting fashion but a very condescending way. The commission set up is next to impossible even for our best sellers at an A store. This company is the worst employer I have had but the pay is nice."
bad,"It is a demanding job with poor leadership. There is no such thing as a ""work life balance"" there. The people like to gossip, like any retail store. Do not take a position unless you have to."
bad,A typical day at work included back to back in bound calls. Processing door-to-door sales orders. Multi-tasking was a big part of the job. My co-workers were a very mixed group of people from varied back grounds. the Hardest part of working for TRG was the unprofessional behavior exhibited by management. The most enjoyable part  of the job was the interaction of fellow co-workers.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,WORK LIFE BALANCE IS HORRIBLE. if you like working weekends and holidays and having every day you work ruined because you work part of 1st 2nd and 3rd shift then work here. makes your days off personal work days because you get nothing accomplished but work on days you have to work. tough quotas and hard to make any money. taxed heavily and money looks OK on paper but you don't bring home much of it at all
bad,If I were a full time employee it could have been a better experience.  I learned an huge amount of information regarding the telecom industry in my time with this company.  I would work for them again for the educational aspect alone.
bad,"When i started working here i was told i would be getting paid just like my last wireless job. And now being promoted as an assistant manager i was so excited to be there at 4g. But getting to talk and network more with more workers, i found out how much even my top reps will only get paid not even close enough to what i got paid before. Huge disappointment, also was the way the reps are taught to deceive customer and not properly trained which creates high return rate and a horrible customer service experience."
bad,Great benefits great fellow co workers but the hardest part of the job is dealing with mis management. Too many chiefs with a number of indians that are mislead.
bad,"90% of the calls I took were people angry with their service, pricing, being unable to pay their bill, having their service disconnected because of non-payment, charges that they claimed they did not make, problems with equipment because of lack of knowledge of how it works, among other problems for which I had no way of correcting the issue. As a customer representative, my pay was impacted by surveys that callers completed. The survey questions were things like ""Are you happy with your Verizon Wireless service?"". If the person answered no, my pay was cut. I think this is entirely an unjust way of treating employees that work extremely hard to maintain a calm and friendly demeanor despite the daily abuse."
bad,"The customers made the place exciting."
bad,"Great hours and co workers "
bad,Call center type work. No raises are provided since the job is thru a third party you seem to make the least possible. No room for advancement and if you do take on a better position no more money is provided.
bad,"I thought the Job was excellent, while I was in Training and working in the seattle area. When I Transferred to the Olympia area. I noticed a lack of diversity and poor quality of treatment from senior employees and other peers. this was a waste of time and I feel like I Made a bad decision over other job opportunities as a prior service vet and a college graduate I was few years past a lot of my peers and was grateful for the opportunity but it very much is a cut throat, micro managed, long hours no time off ever and not family or current like other business minded agencies in America. The Olympia Location was one rascist organization and I should of never taking the opportunity."
bad,Benefits and Pay and great overall environment and treatment from upper management is terrible. I have gained a lot from Verizon in the technical and customer service fields. Technology is constantly growing and one thing Verizon has taught me is that Change is always constant. Co-workers are wonderful. Management is horrible. The hardest part of my job is going to it and the best part is leaving.
bad,"Mornings are almost always hectic- in a bad way. People always like to yell first thing in the morning because they have somehow broken or forgotten how to use their smartphone."
bad,"-inconsistent hours"
bad,"Verizon used to be a great place to devote yourself to. Now it is strictly a machine, and has created a culture that makes its employees feel disposable."
bad,"Verizon continues to change commission structure where they only benefit, unqualified managers its all about who you know to move up not how hard you work it was a great company 4 years ago it was fun  now its only about the numbers no balance at all"
bad,"You are paid minimum wage or commission which ever is higher. I worked there for 13 months and only made commission four months not because I was a bad salesperson but because the store is slow. I do not know how they deserve to be called a ""premium"" retailer because they are far from it. They overcharge customers and lie to them to get sales. I was unable to work for such a company based purely on moral views."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"The company was going through lost of changes and people were very stresful.  Because of changes people did not work together as a team, they worked as an unit."
bad,Not much room for growth within the company. technical issues and how to address
bad,"Verizon has quickly taken a fun, lighthearted sales environment and made it exhausting and stressful. Commission has been cut in half and hourly wages have not gone up."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,I learned that I should not always look at compensation only when exploring an opportunity.
bad,"I sell a variety of communications and smart devices to general public, troubleshoot devices.  I learned the sales process all over again with emphasis on closing and overcoming objections.  My co-workers are the best part of the job for me, as well as meeting the customers.  The hardest part of the job is selling the number of devices needed to make commission.  My quota this month is 68 devices before I start making commission.  The comp plan changed since I started working here.  With things as they are now, I wouldn't have taken the job.  The hiring manager assured me I'd make $3,500 commission checks, but after I accepted the position I found out from my colleagues this is almost unheard of."
bad,"Working in a call center for Verizon Wireless is not rewarding. It's not fair that we are asked to in essence lie to customers and take a hard line when it comes to what they are owed. Everything is micro-managed. On a scale of 1 - 10, the stress level is 11+. The metrics that we are measured by are an absolute joke. While there are a few that are reasonable, the surveys are not. It is important to know how the customer feels. But when it comes to those customers that use it as a weapon because they didn't get what they want, management and the company do the same thing and use it as a weapon to prevent you from getting a raise and promoted out of the call center."
bad,It's a good place to start out. It's a stepping stone to a better job. Good learning environment.
bad,"One Tuch Direct has the highes turnover rate in Tampa Fl. Compensation always changes for the worst, pay checks are always wrong. If anyone is applying  for OneTouch Direct...... its not worth the stress."
bad,"If a spouse gets sick and in the hospital for a month and you're in your first year and you have kids, they force you to resign. It's good if you're single with no responsibilities."
bad,"Verizon has the old culture of Ma Bell, Management are queens of the company. Looking for a quick buck, no long term goals."
bad,Management is unresponsive to employee request for further training or one-on-one coaching to improve performance.
bad,I did not like working here so much because there was alot of unfair and in your face wrong goin to with lower and upper management
bad,"Worked there for 9 years and management was horrible. Pay was not all that great for the amount of work they require. Moral was horrible, Management was horrible."
bad,"If you start in Customer Service, growth is limited. Better to come in via a different position. They pay for your education, but then do not acknowledge your degrees nor offer a promotion. You are treated like a robo and H.R. is unsympathetic. Each center is like a new company with their own rules and policies. They are changing so many policies for the customer, its impacting their image inside and out. Highly beaurocratic and they do not care about employee satisfaction. Management is fake, micro management is an issue, very limited growth."
bad,Poor work/ life balance. 60+ hrs a week with meetings and you basically live there. Lots of turn over. It's ALL about the numbers. Very high pressure and the compensation decreases.
bad,"Company at a corporate level promotes work/life balance. The management in the stores go against any work/life balance. The training is great, but the sales goals and quotas can be very challenging."
bad,"ok place to start but go to school and get a degree,verizon do pay for an education"
bad,"I wish I could say the money was enough, but honestly they treat you like an indentured servant. I was fired after missing ONE day out sick WITH a doctor's note. I was told I would be fine as long as I had the note and they went against their word. When I filed a grievance against Verizon, management hid behind the advantage of the fact I was employed less than six months there, so they didn't have to validate their reasoning behind firing despite the stated fact I gave them no issues and had no previous attendance issues. DO NOT APPLY HERE."
bad,They laid me off because of downsizing issues. little job security.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,It was not a friendly environment and the pay sucked. You were not provided the equipment needed to perform an efficient detail. It took an hour before support would arrive to provide assistance.
bad,"I held on to working there because of the bonus we got every year. It was a mentally unstable environment. The supervisors/management didn't care about you and put you down constantly. Little to no praise on the things you did well and more attention on putting you down. A lot of people suffered from anxiety after working here, myself included."
bad,"If you love dealing with whiny customers about cell bill while your customer determines your ability to gave great numbers this job is for you.  Metrics are fine, but the company focuses on ones not even on your PA like Net Promoter Score.  Great pay, great benefits, but your health with suffer after a few years.  I'm leaving for a $600 paycut to not deal with the customer only company.  worked in"
bad,"Verizon has become a toxic place to work. The training and compensation has been in a downward spiral for several years now, job security is a thing of the past with all of the sweeping cuts they keep doing, and no one seems to care about selling with integrity or treating customers with respect anymore. Deceitful selling is rewarded, and everyone is on edge wondering if they'll be the next group to be let go"
bad,Started with call backs. Did learn a sells pitch and how to upsell. The management could use some work. They can come off as if they are belittling you instead of helping you... The hardest part is having and getting people to buy a phone contract
bad,Base pay was $9 an hour. Lots of hoops to jump through to actually recieve your commission. Hours are inconsistent and the management was a joke. Job was fun if the crew you worked with was good.
bad,"This was just a job, there is no room for career advancement, management holds you back from anything fun. The environment was all call center based and meeting numbers was all anyone was worried about. If a manager did not like you, you were excluded from employee events, moving to specialty teams and eventually booted out the door."
bad,It's a huge organization and often the individual gets lost in the churn. There is a big divide between upper management and the people who get the work done.
bad,"If you asked for help, was very difficult to get.  One gets yelled at all day long with only two breaks and then when you were honest with a customer you were punished for it."
bad,"In the beginning, your trainers really hype up the idea of the company, but the more you are in the front lines, the more you realize that it is all a load of BS. They do not care about you as an employee, and the pay has only gone down through the years (employed for 5 years)"
bad,They are not in touch with the current generation and think their name is enough to win people over. I didn't enjoy it here as their was zero mentorship and zero diversity. I hope they get some younger executives in and listen to younger employees wants in a workplace.
bad,didnt enjoy management and the over pressured micro management. didnt enjoy working there nor did i enjoy the retail environment in general. Would not recommend.
bad,"I was treated like scum and was forced to do management work with no manager for over 4 months of working there with only 2 employees total(including me) at my location, I was given impossible tasks with zero help and usually worked open to close shifts every day because of lack of coworkers and management at my location."
bad,Good luck. They constantly replace qualified onshore developers with unqualified offshore developers in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend working for Verizon if you are looking for a healthily career-oriented environment.
bad,"Poor management and disorganization pretty sums up Verizon behind the scene. The constant churn of new projects meant that the higher ups had chance & opportunities while their screwups meant layoffs to the contracted work. I went through 5 different contract companies during my 4 years at Verizon. There is bitter in fighting among the management here, and just about the only positive thing I can mention was the pay and some of the coworkers I met during my time there."
bad,Worked for the company for right at 6 years and the amount of change in the company has only been negative.The first four years the goals were realistic and incentives were put in place to drive growth and keep the employee happy. Now a majority of the reps in retail are not happy with quotas being unrealistic since they changed the commission structure.The company no longer cares about the employee or customer.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Good money, but how much is your soul worth?  No room for a logical mind or curious appetite.   But, if it is all about $$$, got get it, just don't expect to be more than a number."
bad,"The job is very stressful. The customers are very demanding and will disrespect you if you don't give them what they want. The company treats you as data they only want to be the best and will do anything and train you to give customers whatever they want, lie to them, and sell false hopes to keep customers to remain number 1! The job will sell you false hopes of getting a different job role when there are over 700 employees in one call center and there are only 5 roles annually open for positions off the phone and everyone are like crabs in a barrel trying to apply just to get off the phone. They promote people to supervisors and demote you within months if your team does not produce the numbers they want. If you are a person of true integrity this job is not for you. The company is very demanding will force other job roles into your job description without warning and no pay increase to take on extra roles. Supervisors are micromanaging and are there to baby sit and report all of the negative things your are doing."
bad,Ok job. Just a normal sales job. The pay is decent. Representatives are terribly micromanaged by management with little to zero work life balance. Other than that decent job.
bad,"most leadership is primarily interested in doing whatever they believe will help them the most, not what works best for the company or its employees. They simply recycle the same leaders and expect better results. Downsizing continues to be the drive to save money. This has created a toxic culture of people just trying to either not get fired or actually get a severance. Many employees have decided they want to leave but not without their severance."
bad,"Conduent was a subsidiary, and the management was terrible and refused to assist with customers. They only wanted to get paid to chitchat. I was regularly threatened by customers, and would have very little help from any form of management, but never from my direct management. This job caused me to have severe stress and anxiety handling any phone calls and severe depression. My office refused to let me have any bereavement time when my Grandfather passed away just a week before Christmas and explicitly told me that if I missed any days for the month of December, that I would be fired. I left that January due to depression."
bad,"Verizon misleads  you from the beginning! They tell you that you will have a weekend off a Month? A big fat lie. The managers always on your back.  I worked there for many years and never took my two 15 minute breaks.  Money is the name of the game: You must produce numbers, they don't care about you."
bad,"Been with the company for 4 years. Lots of turn over and management changes. Most upper management (above the GM) has an agenda for themselves. Not a lot of room for advancement locally in my area. Sales quotas are higher than ever and foot traffic is down. Also they want you to pitch certain products to every customer. If you miss a product or an action you receive a coaching. After so many coaching, your own corrective action. You must stay on top of your commitments to avoid coachings. Micromanagement at its finest. Very Un-motivating. Dealing with unhappy customers or needy customers. The stress is unreal. Wouldn’t recommend working retail to anyone looking for a job. Not really learning or obtaining any other skills to advance my own career."
bad,"While Verizon did have good benefits, the environment in which we worked was toxic to our health. At least once per day, an ambulance would arrive to take an employee to the hospital. Unfortunately, the EMT's knew our building as well as or better than we did. Management did little to support you in the event of a problem."
bad,"This position was too long ago. I left due to poor management, no availability of upward movement. Compensation was well below the national average, and raises were non existent."
bad,"The local office is poorly managed, There are too few experienced people and too little training,They have a great phone network but, a truly substandard management."
bad,"Employees screwed each other over for game and glory, problems always fell back on those trying to truly help customers, dinosaur of a company. Software difficult to use and did not interface with other apps very well. Supervisors always listening not picking about everything"
bad,"Benefits have decreased while demands have increased. Managers are overworked with tedious tasks that have no value added to production. Focus is on bean counters frivolous imaginary productivity metrics that mean absolutely nothing to customer service, care or quality."
bad,"Victra has over 1000 stores and has become the largest indirect reseller of Verizon Wireless service in the country. As such, there is always opportunities to work for them and make some money. But, as they are always looking to purchase other, smaller indirect resellers, there are many periods of ""belt tightening"" during which they clamp down on hours available to work and set the sales commision tiers higher to increase their profitability while reducing the amount they have to pay out. This inevitably leads to a high turnover ratio, and the last time I heard a number they were averaging having to replace an employee once every 7 months. It is not a place for a long term future unless you want to work your way up the management chain of command, and you can expect that path to be highly stressful."
bad,"What I learned from working at Verizon is that an employee is only as good as there best sale day.  "
bad,Scheduling was not flexible.  Management was unreasonable.  Sales goals continuously changed making it more and more rare for sales associates to meet or exceed goals. Management hovered over sales associates while they were on the sales floor creating an uncomfortable working environment.
bad,You are really required to sell products that people don’t need or want. I’ve seen a lot of reps just lie to customers about their bills in order to gain a sale. Lots of unethical people promoted to management.
bad,Highly stressful call center job.  Calls are ba9ck to back with no pause in between to call back on dropped calls or to take notes.  Job performance based entirely on broad metrics like survey results with no ability to override surveys based on customer being angry/rude or company policy preventing ideal service.
bad,"Cellular sales could be an amazing job for some. "
bad,good place to work.  It was a fun atmosphere to in.  Enjoyed my time there as a retail sales associate.  The wages were fair and competitive.  Sales goals were attainable.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Typical day will includes sales and customer service. You will be harassed by ""solution managers"" to drive sales and unrealistic goals. The culture in my store was horrible as you never knew how the management would squeeze you in order to hit there goals."
bad,"Lots of favoritism, segregated and most of the people i knew there were fired or let go. Dont trust Verizon. They hire who they want and will go to great lengths to get rid of who they dont like. Theyll figure it out."
bad,No other comments. Verizon left due to closing the center. I think there was a big work life balance issue. The Benefits were on par with my personal needs........
bad,Verizon management cares about reducing costs at all costs to the determent of the business.  RIF's common. Personnel that are RIF'ed are replaced by either entry level positions or consultants.  Much of the time you get the speech- 'You can do this too- It will only take you an hour or 2 a day.'  - What you want to say was the person doing that job in 10-12 hours a day. Do not expect any stability.  Do not expect any favors.  Personally over the last month I have had lunch 3 times.  The rest of the time you eat while a meeting is going on.  Oh and forget a desk.  You get shared spaces- you need to carry everything with you in and out of the building.  Additionally working remotely is frowned upon- no matter what public policy is.
bad,"Questionnaire focused on if the employee was able to resolve the callers issue. This is not a fair assessment of the caller because not call issues can be solved to the caller satisfaction. The main questions the employee should be judge on is their grade of whether the caller felt the employee was helpful, polite, and did their best to resolve the problem and if they were unable to do so explained why and gave the caller other options."
bad,Used to be a great organization. Focus was on being the best and having the best talent. The company has lost its focus on employees and frankly customers. Very bureaucratic and old school management styles. Not enough movement of Director level and above leadership leads to stagnancy and little opportunity for vertical movement.
bad,"Verizon has become a big, cocky, company where the senior leadership has little idea as to what actually goes on at the front lines.  At the end of the day, each employee is just a number to drive a different number, just to make books look decent for the shareholders."
bad,"Verizon absolutely detests its employees.  They feel as though you should always feel fortunate that they haven't fired you yet. If you want to feel as though your work is valued and appreciated, look elsewhere."
bad,"I felt that the work was too busy due to being understaffed. Every time things started to look better, something else would come up to add an additional challenge. Also, there's no company loyalty, they are constantly having workforce reductions and changing people's careers that they depend on."
bad,"This job can be fun at times, but it’s also the most stressful work environment I’ve ever been a part of.  Made pretty decent money until the changed how you got paid.  You have to sell specific items to make a pay check now, and if you don’t, you aren’t getting paid.  Sounds easy in theory,  but not when you actually get on the phones.  Prepare to live there if you want to make any serious money."
bad,Not the job experience I intended to acquire when I applied. The people and management will tell you something and turn around and tell someone something else that goes against what was told to you in the first place.
bad,The culture at Verizon is very autocratic and suffers from organizational silos.  There are multiple reorganizations every year which disrupts organizational improvements.  Verizon lacks innovative thinking and is very reactive to the market place.  It does what it does well and reacts otherwise.
bad,"Honestly working for this company has been the worst, over worked is an understatement, schedules change all the time nothing is permanent, constant disrespect, and all you do is work so someone else can get paid, commission structure is impossible unless you screw customers over and are a shady salesman 10/10 will never work for a phone company again."
bad,Verizon has a poor work culture that is fixated on making more at all costs.  They have little concern for their customers or employees and have forgotten that the largest asset that any company has is their people.
bad,Forces you to sell without integrity. They push items on people that are not needed. It would be a great job if you are not micromanaged to death. Pay was the only reason I stayed long until I wanted to become a manager and it was blocked in every way
bad,"very stressful work environment, dishonest reps in the store, HARD sales numbers which are checked EVERY SINGLE DAY, so stressful I barely slept some nights"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"The company is all about the money.  They don't care about the plant, employees or its customers.  2:00 - hey, mandatory overtime tonight!  Have plans, or a dr's appointment?  Too bad.  It rained?  Oh, you have to work Saturday.  Kid's game or reservations to go out of town?  Too bad, can't go."
bad,"Pays their employees well, however lately there has been no job security and lack of promotions.  A typical day as of lately has been very slow with a focus being made on outbound calls to customers. There has been more focus on customer doing things on their own from home, which in turn means they won't need sales people any more. Hardest part of the job is trying to meet their many requirements that they want us to do during transactions without trying to seem as if we are overselling the customers."
bad,"I was there during the Alltel / Verizon merger and in our market we blew the doors off of Verizon, but they were the bigger company and bought us out. We lost a lot of good people as Verizon let a lot of people go in the first wave. I was able to stay around till the they had there second wave of let go's,"
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of handling escalated customer calls directed from the control floor. The typical customer is upset about their bill and don't understand the way billing works."
bad,"As a manager I was expected to get in before my shift and leave well after my shift. You get no overtime at all, and it was also expected that you work a weekend day while still being paid for only 40 hours. RIF's (reduction in force),or firings happened several times per year, up to 5000 managers at a time. They constantly change policies, as well as senior management. The labor/union environment is hostile. The cost for health coverage for management goes up each year, and the raises and bonuses get lowered each year."
bad,"I have nothing bad to say about Verizon except that they 100% care about the almighty dollar and don't give a hoot about their employees.  Doesn't matter if you've worked their 1 month of 35 years, no one will even shake your hand good bye as you exit from being 'reduced in force'."
bad,"that place is stressful, cut throat and really unfair. I had a doctors note and was still required to take phone calls with a 102 degree temp. They don't honor doctors notes at all only want bodies in the chair to answer phones. The only reason people stay is cause the pay is excellent."
bad,"Upper management took pride in the fact that families were willing to give up family time and outings to remain ""connected"" (pay for their VZ services). Too much focus on short-term gain."
bad,"Verizon B2B sales is contracted out to multiple companies.  There are no established territories.  Leads are given to multiple contracted companies. Often competing with Verizon ""800"" number.  Terrible order execution once an order is submitted."
bad,This company is fast paced which I enjoy i love fast pace but it is also chaotic. When i say chaotic you can learn something today and tomorrow its changed and its 50/50 whether your informed it was changed. The shifts are about 30% good the rest are less than favorable doesnt matter if you have 3 school age kids to care for or a elderly sick parent  guess what your schedule just changed from something like  8am -4pm to 6pm to 3am go figure it out.Very stressful unnecessarily at times people literally fall out in there from stress related issues. Employee moral is low also this centers windows don't open so its a germ breeding ground people are constantly sick.
bad,poor management. All decisions based on what is happening on that week. General moral was usually poor. Employees were for the most part of a high caliber as far as potential. Upper management were unaware of this. Unfortunately an atmosphere of distrust between both existed.
bad,"I was not the only one with complaints and this supervisor was allowed to continue to act out. Also, after expressing valid concerns for how it would affect the team, not just me, they placed me on her team again. That lasted 7 days."
bad,Too many people and too many personalities.  Managers didnt focus on those who needed help with low metrics. In stead they just went through the motions with everyone.  If there are people struggling with low metrics I would expect they focus on them and not associates that are leading their team.
bad,Alorica manages services for Verizon customers. Very high volume calls and turnover rate. I was not there long enough to be placed with a manager however my supervisors during training were great. The hardest part were the environment and shift. Best part was the location.
bad,"Sales reps were treated poorly at best and the job was very cut throat.  Culture was such that although one was never told to lie or cheat directly, it was understood that this was the only way to make money."
bad,"Management was lacking experience and motivation. We're very cut throat and treated you like a number. Needs to be unionized to protect workers."
bad,"Very stressful place to work and quota was awful,. Everyone was so stressed out to make commissions, it was really hard to make money when more than half the customers needed Troubleshooting. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"They do pay good but the management and policies are very messed. You can't have your individuality. Lot of internal politics that is worst than anywhere else."
bad,Mostly chaotic work environment with no clear vision. Management issues. People are stressed as there is no clear direction and are expected to complete tasks without clear requirements in place.
bad,Verizon was a very toxic work environment. I didn't feel like upper level management cared at all about their employees. work life balance was horrendous. work tours and overtime based on seniority. forced overtime.
bad,"Verizon has good pay, but the lack of concern for it's employees is hard to take. There is room for growth and is a large company to move around in. from an I.T. perspective. If you are not generating a substantial amount of revenue for the company you are over looked on skills you have, that may benefit the company. If you should work for Verizon, definitely try to move up and around quickly. The metrics put into place for call centers are very stressful."
bad,Management demands excellence in customer service and then ties you to metrics that force you to cut corners on service.  They enforce a template/software overlay that you must use to do basic job functions on the computer that is very time consuming and cumbersome and removes any learning or decision making from the job.
bad,When I began my career at Verizon they were known as Bell Atlantic.  The work environment was stressful and unfulfilling.  It was hard to advance within the company and management wasn't helpful in doing so.  I assume things are different now and have changed since I was laid off in 2006.  Good luck to those seeking employment with this company.
bad,"Stressful, the company did it's best to make the job fun and easy, but trouble-shooting equipment via phone or dealing with billing issues is NOT fun or easy."
bad,It was a racist place to work and my manager knew I had the best results but sold me down the river for a kkk man. I would never recommend Verizon to anyone I care about
bad,Management was horrible in the stores I worked at. They didn't care about family. Was very unfair when treating the employee's they didn't like. Very unfair practices were going on and HR was of no help. Pay was great and benefits were wonderful.
bad,"The typical day of verizon has changed drastically over the years. It is with great sadness that a company that once envisioned retiring with is now a company that I'm actively looking to escape from. "
bad,"Pay was below standard, hourly and commission was cut significantly from years before, products were harder to sell being that online offers included waived installation fees of Verizon Fios services and the store charged $100.00 dollars for installation. The service charges for customers were significantly higher in store then online where customers were often charged 20-30 dollars less per MONTH! However, I also worked in a store with Verizon wireless and while they were paid well they were exceptionally stressed and many people who had spent years of their lives 10-15 yrs, were cut without second thought to increase profit. The already overworked wireless team or those that remained employed were forced to pick up the slack."
bad,"Only south Indians last long there in IT as the top management is mostly south Indians. The managers and lead still follow the work culture from their back home. Treat other people working under them as their slaves. If they don't like you, no matter how hard working you are, you'll be kicked out for sure."
bad,"Typical day starts with a wake-up call early in the morning even if you are needed or not, you need to be attending the call without asking questions. It's the management from top-to-bottom that has changed the work culture so much that no one will be happy and productive as the day progresses.  It's apt to say that you live to work at this place."
bad,They treat union employees as if they were step children at the company.  Management completely does not have your back and you work under so much strain.  Hard to feel like you are working towards a common goal and are part of a team.
bad,"The location made it slow on business which was okay because we had several videos of training. The new location was faster, but unfortunately the management was the same."
bad,"The ownership at the Brooksville Wireless Zone I worked at was terrible and verbally abusive and extremely rude to staff and customers, and very angry"
bad,"Racial discrimination, racial profiling including targeting and harassing Muslim employees, ongoing harassment, inappropriate behavior - the department director was well known for her inappropriate relationship with a married man who lost his job because of her. This was only the beginning. It paid well, but not well enough."
bad,They put sales people in a specialty market.  Politics within the sales management reflected on which accounts a rep was able to work and keep.  There was no consistency
bad,The amount of work and the time the management wanted you to complete it was almost impossible to do. I learned that Verizon doesn't care if their supervisors have knowledge of the job they are overseeing which makes it hard on the technician. I also learned that they don't put customer or quality first. They will lie and expect the technician to lie and deceive the customer. It starts from the top and the area with management. At the top expectations is high which they pass on to lower level managers. All of that stress is passed on to the technicians. Being able to put a smile on a customers face was the best part of the day
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,The sales and care reps did not have the tools to assist and resolve issues on a regular basis. Which lead to customer retention issues as well as workplace culture knowing that you have no control most of the time on resolving.
bad,"Extremely cut throats environment, no job security. Commissions structure constantly hanging only to better the compannnot the employees wallet. Sell to much to get paid to little."
bad,"I started working for Verizon Wireless in 2008 at the age of 18.  The company was thriving and growing at an incredible rate.  I loved my job and made great money and continued to make more money each year.  Until recently this past year or so, the company cut and changed the commission structure drastically more than ever before.  Commission structures constantly change with as the needs of the business change.  This time we are making thousands less per month, we are unable to live the lifestyle we have been accustomed to for years.  Co workers are struggling to provide for their family and make the payments they're used to making.  I used to love working for this company, until they stopped caring about those at the front line."
bad,"Company is changing for the future too fast. Decisions are aggressive and company is not doing well right now financially. The Motto is ""Do more with less"" and folks are feeling it."
bad,"Verizon is a great company, but the 3rd party Cellular Sales is horrible. The Manager is a certified jerk who only cares about pushing sales no matter what. He does not thrive on customer service or what's best for the customers."
bad,Learn to multitask quickly.  Company is absolutely terrible to there employees. Must log out of your phone for breaks and bathroom.  Only allowed a certain amount of bathroom time a day.
bad,Learn the skills and get out and find something better. Worked at this company 7 years and was recently laid off with a low severance package.        Do yourself a favor and don't get comfortable
bad,"A typical day at work was productive and fun.  My job consisted of getting the store ready from cash management to pulling productivity reports, within the district to greeting guests at the door as they walked in.  Depending on the day of the week, a box count would be preformed the counts had to be accurate.  The technology world is constantly changing, therefore, the learning was on a daily basis. Work Culture has to do a lot with the attitude of the employees as well as the attitude of management.  Retail is, at times, difficult and stressful.  The culture, overall, was good as long as the store was pulling good numbers.   The hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done within a days work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with the guests and learning about them as well as  working besides a good positive team."
bad,"Good company, long hours, terrible customers, unpredictable schedule, results driven, 6 managers and mandatory after hours team building activities. Basically, its a good job but you have to dedicate your whole life to it and like being micromanaged."
bad,"Make phone calls and provide the best customer service "
bad,"Had to wake up at 4 in the morning and got home at 7 in the evening M through F. Received very little training and was expected to do many tasks that I did not feel safe nor confident doing. Culture was very irresponsible. I did not like my bosses, I had two, and they were always hovering over me on every job. The only thing enjoyable was I got paid."
bad,"Laid off because I did my job but sales people who didn't hit there goals keep there jobs. Managers are lazy don't do anything, the company is very really doesn't have an idea of what needs to happen to be successful.  However, if you are lazy and have no pride then Verizon is a great place to work"
bad,Company has made bad decisions and investments causing thousands of layoffs in the US. Not much focus and money spent on creative advertising and has fell behind competitors
bad,Company made me take all kinds of tests and interviews and all along management and employees knew that store may not make it through the year. Disappointing! Store closed as they moved into wireless. Big companies don't really care about little people! Just the bottom line!
bad,"Although Verizon pays well, the newest management from Boston has come down and made every decent person sitting in a managers position either a puppet or they were driven out of the company.  Many first level managers were either out on disability and the nice guys were driven and set up for failure and eventually forced to leave."
bad,"Very disorganized, management doesnt have a clue what they are doing. Barely get lunch breaks, barely get your scheduled 15 mins breaks. Fast pace hospital setting"
bad,"If you work in sales, Verizon does have amazing work incentives and prizes if you meet your quota. You also have to be willing to be scrutinized by sales managers and receive harsh criticism and threats of losing your job if you don't meet quota or display what they deem to be customer mistreat."
bad,"Verizon prides itself in appearing to be a place with great advancement which is false. There is plenty of room for parallel movement, which often leaves you performing the exact same job duties you thought you were leaving behind. Known processes and software are constantly being changed internally for employees and customers as well yet neither is usually informed of said changes.  Management's ideals of how each position should work is grossly skewed to statistics and numbers and not actual practice. Work life balance is near non existent unless you've been in the company for over a decade."
bad,"Terrible place to work, toxic work environment. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,This is a directionless company that really only cares about its wireless division. It is a company on the decline and the company culture has steadily declined.
bad,"As a security officer contracted to work in a Verizon facility you are given the shortend of the stick. No raises, horrible benefits, no overtime unless there is contact work being done in the facility, horrible communication between managers."
bad,"In less than a year I've seen several tenured employees demote themselves or quit because of a newly promoted District Manager. I've witnessed relocation packages ($10,000) be placed on positions they knew they were hiring their friends for. This person made exceptions to the ""time in title"" rule to promote an employee (a friend) that was with the company less than a year to a management position. All but one of the open management positions (because the managers quit or demoted themselves) went to people that were from the district this manager is from. Sadly, the employees from this district who have been waiting for the opportunity, completing leadership programs, training and doing more than they have to were not considered serious candidates for the positions. This is due to the District Manager coming to the district with the pre conceived notion that the employees in this district are not up to their standards. There is so much more I could write...I have worked for this company for a while now and this is the worst it has ever been. Very sad. Very, very sad."
bad,"The overall cultures is counter productive to assisting the customer and employees. The majority of  issues stem from personal feelings of the HR department whose main focus  is to protect the bias of upper management . It is a very unhealthy place to work I survived because I have been going to therapy while still dealing with the trauma of their day to day practices. If you like firing people, or making their lives miserable with no regard to consequences  I recommend this company for you ."
bad,Company is a revolving door. Company requires employees to use misleading sales tactics to upgrade customers to internet phone and TV. They inform everyone its a sales position but routes sales calls to specific reps making it impossible to meet quota. Disciplines are targeted and unwarranted. Management is very incompetent and coaching is a chance to incriminate to add a ongoing file they keep on Reps. Avoid at all cost.
bad,The company is a sweatshop environment with toxic high stress work conditions in the call center.  Not family friendly.
bad,"The pay is top notch for retail sales however there is no work life balance and the leadership is polluted with pseudo-intellectual toxic individuals who usually promote friends or ex-all-tell employees. Be prepared to receive no support if you have any issues in your personal life also, deaths of extended family etc.."
bad,like the work and my fellow techs. good to work with a daily basis. management needs to communicate better with the techs.
bad,"no leadership, no support from management, very little interact among team members. low morale, pay was excellent compare to market, training opportunities were there but no time to train. Very difficult to balance work-life and home-life."
bad,"Pay is great, best in the industry!  "
bad,"Horrible work environment. Stuck in the 70's. Perpetual budget cuts... to the point where they stopped getting the windows cleaned. So you'd spend the day in the office not being able to see out the windows because they were murky."
bad,"Verizon laid me off for their own GREEDY purposes. They are very greedy and sneaky. If you choose to take a job with them, DO NOT  engage in ANY verbal agreements. Get it all in writing and be prepared to get screwed. They ALWAYS find a way to re-interpret what they previously agreed to. "
bad,"I feel I need a change, being with the same company on and off for the last 21 years, it is time for something new. Micromanaging is taking over and the office politics are far from fair. Looking to advance myself in another line of business that has a better appreciation of their employees. I enjoy my co-workers but the hardest part of the job is the constant ridicule of performance on a daily basis, fear of being suspended for making an educated decision based on a customers true needs. It is all about the numbers and profit for the business, not true customer service. There is no room for advancement unless you know the right person."
bad,It's retail. It's hectic and unrewarding. It's for people who want to micromanaged to within an inch of their lives! The pay is good if you land at a busy well managed store location but expect to have all decisions made for you especially if you have a real tasky and micromanaging boss(es). Awful experience good for young students or people with no sense of worth.
bad,"I enjoyed working in a small office. We became family there and still keep in contact with each other. The management was no very personal though. They did not work in our office and did not get involved or care about family life. I did learn how to use many computer systems, customer service, and the telco business."
bad,Mentally exhausting and constant changes in director caused major confusion and angst among representatives.
bad,"It was an internship that lasted 3 months, I was paid very well.  However, I feel as though this internship was to use up funds by end of year for budgetary reasons.  No room to get a position at all."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Helping customers on the phone eight hours a day."
bad,"It was a fun place to work early on.  Now it is a huge bureaucracy.  One is punished for honesty.  Everyone is afraid to ""tell the Emperor he has no clothes""."
bad,"Office is in Rye Brook, NY a very difficult and treacherous commute from many locales. I spent 3-4 hours a day driving to the office or on location per day. Poorly organized management structure."
bad,They hire get you to talk your friends and family into contracts and then when you can no longer hit sales goals for 2-3 weeks in a row so long see ya
bad,Company shows no loyalty to existing employees. Been working for verizon for 12 years and barely any room for advancement unless you are part of someones clique or you are sleeping with your boss.
bad,"Decent place to work. Wasn't a match for me, I stuck it out, but small things turned to big problems. Didn't have much job security and there were no benefits."
bad,"The most important part of my job is internal customer experience. I find it important to make sure that we are taking care of our employees and giving them work life balance. "
bad,"The typical day at work is taking inbound calls from customers for billing and technical issues. Verizon Wireless is heavily focused on metrics and surveys instead of doing what is fair and right for the customer. The employees are stressed because of constant threats of losing their jobs, handed down by management.If you fall short in any metric, you will be micromanaged daily. It is a very political environment. To move up, it's all about who you know, not what you know. The favoritism toward a few select employees is more than obvious. There are talented employees, but they are not valued or appreciated. At one time, Verizon Wireless may have been a decent company, but now, it has changed, and not for the better."
bad,"Since I heard that 86% of people are actually influenced by these reviews, I think I have a duty to tell the whole truth. Let me get this out of the way firstly. Verizon Wireless has GREAT pay. Verizon Wireless has OKAY medical benefits, that is medical benefits that you still pay for. I worked in a call center which meant that a typical day for me was signing into my computer and phone taking about 100-150 calls per day, and selling and assisting customers. The nice part is that Verizon gave you a 5 minute window to sign in without getting penalized, depending on who your supervisor was. The thing you should most understand about Verizon is that when you work in a call center everything is monitored and I mean EVERYTHING, but not only that they are VERY goals oriented so they have quotas and very tough ones that grow every single year. Change is the only thing that is certain in that place. It changes everyday but not in a good way, one day you'll be doing abc and the next day you be doing xyz. They would introduce most things in what I would call the belly flop method, meaning sending you straight into the water and then ask questions later. While there I learned a lot about the corporate world and how much I didn't like it and it wasn't for me. So that's what I took away."
bad,I like the fact of free devices and phone bill. I learned how to manage time.  My costumers were the best part of the job. I loved the comp package and the ability to control my money.
bad,"Decent starting job to get some experience but that's it. Cut throat employees, ruthless management that only care about selling, and TERRIBLE upper management. They don't care about their employees and will fire anyone who isn't good enough. STAY AWAY"
bad,no longer interested in landline infrastructure. Moving more toward wireless segment. Core is heavily micro managed.
bad,"A lot of turnover in management. Empty promises made. Didn't seem to care about employees."
bad,Company is slow to react.  Poor customer service. Not competitive in many markets.
bad,Great place to begin your career and build a good work ethic.
bad,"Selling technology is a lot of fun, but management is unrealistic in believing that you can sell a $600 ipad to every customer and complains when you don't or $100 worth of accessories with every phone. Commissions are constantly going down with each annual compensation plan change."
bad,"Typical work day was fairly miserable. management has suspended technicians for not taking bowel movements in a customers house and choosing instead to go a Central Office without first asking permission.  People have also gotten time off for not turning their steering wheel towards, or away, from a curb.  I kid you not when I say that good managers, that had productive relationships with the workers under them, were let go for not having a heavy enough hand when it comes to discipline. "
bad,"Receive your workload over computer or phone and head out and complete your jobs."
bad,"management didn't care about employees,  only focused on themselves."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Family oriented environment. Draw system was pretty horrible. Co workers pretty ok. Management not very prepared. Cellular Sales wouldn’t recommend. That is all
bad,Working with Visible was exciting as it added various technologies to my tech stack. The assignment is productive but maintaining work life balance may be an issue.
bad,Working at verizon was an okay job. Not very much security unless your a rockstar salesman. I wouldnt recommend verizon to any of my friends or family.
bad,"Plan and direct activities such as sales promotions, coordinating with other department heads as required Team player and being the top sales person and leader to achieve my monthly goals."
bad,I found the management to be homophobic and racist. They seemed to lie with an ease that left me speechless. Many of the supervisors were incompetent at providing customer service and wanted little to do with problem solving. The focus was on getting customers off the line to take the next call and not on solving problems and building relationships based on trust and service.
bad,I didn't like working for them. There was no kind of work stability and and constant change and the Superiors were rude. The training was initially easy but they put you on the floor to soon.
bad,Verizon seems to have more focus on their employees upskilling. Their education benefits are some of the best that I have come across. Going to a conference just about every year really helped me to increase my knowledge must faster in a week than a month.
bad,Aside from the amazing benefits working at Verizon as a solution specialist will consume you. Unless you exceed the unrealistic sales goals you will go no where with the company.
bad,"Management goals are different by location "
bad,Started out to be one of the best jobs I worked for. After about 6 yrs it turned into a toxic environment. Some managers /coaches had no business being coaches. Stress level for all became unbearable. To the point many had to do outpatient stress management programs.
bad,The culture within the company is very business driven without any concern for the customer. The main goal is sales growth regardless of unfair or unethical practices.
bad,Verizon pays you enough to become their slave and forget your dreams. This could possibly be one of the most unfair places to work in regards to career advancements and appreciation for your work.
bad,Verizon was a great company to work for in the early 2000s but over the last several years compensation and benefits were reduced while expectations and responsibilities increased.
bad,Individuals seemed to work 12-18 hour days with no consideration of work-life balance.  Lower level management appeared to have no authority but maybe this was just my manager and not the company as a whole.
bad,If you are older they drive you out to aq good place for older people.  Hey are you people;e forcing me to write about Verizon.  I don't want to do this
bad,"With the past 3 years of layoffs not a fun place to work anymore."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"There is no work/life Balance at all. There is a ton of micro managing. It is super hard to ever get time off. You have so many little tasks and things to achieve each day, yet they expect you to reach your sales goals each day. The only enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. But if you talked to your coworkers to much, they separate you. I made good money but it wasn’t worth it for me."
bad,"The employees is amazing. they usually last for 2 to 3 years"
bad,"Much information is accumulated in the information database making it difficult to be proficient.  Information database should be condensed and more centralized."
bad,"I constantly became sick due to the stress of the job. They no longer wanted to accommodate me on my absences due to my illness. I got to the point where I took a pay cut at another job, just to get better and be happy."
bad,If you want easy money and don’t have any career plans this is the place for you  don’t come to Verizon looking for the best environment or management experience
bad,I did enjoy working for this company the training was no good it had nothing to do with what we had to do once we got out on the floor. It was a very unprofessional environment at the time that I worked there
bad,"Verizon is a place to work for you if all you want to do is work, and point our all your weakness, nevermind all the success you have had prior to that incident."
bad,"Coached after EVERY transaction.  Extremely micromanaged. Very toxic work environment. Unrealistic goals. Cold calls etc. Managers would pull you aside and coach you in FRONT of customers. When it wasn't in front of customers, you'd go to the back to get the customer their phone and get stopped for several minutes for a ""pow wow"", and grilled on ""what did you learn about your customer"".  Pay cuts due to commission changes. Extremely toxic work environment."
bad,"Im sure that verizon locations in larger cities do exceptionally well, but this was in a small rural area. Its hard for someone to make a solid living with very slow foot traffic."
bad,No work life balance. Toxic culture. Management is not genuine or transparent. There is no room for upward movement. They treat their workers like they are just a number.
bad,"Great beneifits, great pay. People in management lacking the skills needed to do their job.. Should not be in those positions. In some cases very unprofessional."
bad,They want you to push products onto customers that they don't need. The largest company in the industry and their main focus was growth instead of customer retention. I was very uncomfortable with the leadership and commission structure. It was very hard to have integrity and make money with their commission schedule at the time.
bad,You have to sell everything to everybody each customer you speak with you have to sell them something to make money so if a 90 year old female walks in she better walk out with a the newest iphone which makes no sense but ok
bad,"Cellular days are over... Everybody has a smart phone. The market is full... Jobs are real specialized. If your over 30 your too old."
bad,"Working at Verizon I found challenging for the following reasons: "
bad,"Unrealistic sales expectations, extremely long lines, constant managers over your shoulder making sure you were offering people things whether they needed them or not. Manadatory overtime (when I was there) with a required weekly Friday morning meeting. It may have changed since then but I hated every minute of working there. The pay was too good to leave until I hit my breaking point."
bad,"Fairly typical large corporation environment. Top management is disconnected from anything or persons below them. Your experience will depend on you immediate manager. If your immediate manager is good to/for you, then you are solid."
bad,"Your performance is minimal part of the job,  it's all about how quickly you can get the call completed, all while trying to make the client happy,  ensuring that your resolving their issue and that they don't call back in 3 days. Then there's the 5 day callback you get hit with too. You have very little to no guidance from your team leaders,  there are a few,  and very fe that actually care enough to help you, then when you don't perform to their satisfaction they ding you on your weekly evaluations, and if you don't have good evaluatons, you can't go anywhere and you're stuck.  It's a venus fly trap, the sweet promise of a great career and advancement is all an illusion, there is god pay and health care benefits,  but trust me you're going to need them,  it's a lot of stress you're under and in the 2 years I was there I'd seen at least 70 people go out on medical due to stress related illnesses."
bad,For the IT department I had no idea but the Indian members are paying the senior management for being able to be in the country.  The Irvine location is targeted for closing and they want to consolidate to the New Jersey location
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Ok company to work for.  Culture is not the best. Management shows lack of compassion.  Training for success does not exist. The work makes the day go by fast as their is no down time ever.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of troubleshooting phones and sending digital leads.  I learned that without foot traffic it is difficult to meet quota.  The management plays favorites.  The workplace culture is toxic, theft of sales are rampant.  Hardest part of the job was being treated like I had no sales experience.  The enjoyable part was the compensation."
bad,I feel that they do not care for the customer's best interest. They take advantage of employees and customers alike. They incentivize selling inferior phone. I make dissection based on customer's best interest not mine.
bad,the company uses their workers as slaves never get a raise when a worker deserves one. too much work for not enough money. you should work at at&t if looking for a familiar job.
bad,"somedays were good, some not so good. management communication was lacking. employee moral wasn't the best. team work was talked about rarely followed."
bad,The glory days are clearly over at Verizon.  Morale was spiraling downward when I was there.  Approximately two years later the entire call center was closed.
bad,Just really a not a fulfilling job you scam old lady out of money to hit goals and its just really a bad environment. you have to slam accounts to hit numbers they charge fees that corporate doesn't so there is no reason to go to any location except a corporate store.
bad,No comment. I dont recommend working there as they dont value their good employees enough. The commute was way too long. Do not offer remote positions as this job could easily be done at home. The is no room for upward mobility there either unless you or chosen out of the select brown nosing few.
bad,management just follows the upper Managers. waste lots of money focusing on unwanted projects and nothing gets done. all the pressure is transferred  to the lower level and in wrong directions
bad,"Most of the people I worked with are very knowledgeable and workaholic, but at the same time, they expect you to work for more number of hours. More than 60% of the time spent on meetings. Workplace culture is not that great. There are many team politics and favoritism. The hardest part of the job is work-life balance."
bad,"The truth is, despite the low rating for the company, I have had a good time for the most part at Verizon. The sales targets were always a little higher than realistic, and now exponentially so, but for most of the time with the company I was allowed to have fun at work. The overwhelming expectations and lack of understanding that the cell phone market is 90% saturated has lead Verizon to push goals beyond reasonably obtainable measures, and in some ways this is intentional to gut out top commission performers across the board as Verizon attempts to trim work force costs."
bad,"A typical day at work, on a good day, was agonizing. "
bad,"As a contractor, it is hard to get in the door. I was able to due to knowing the Executive Director. Now that he has moved on due to our division being sold to IBM, and my contract has ended, it is hard to get in the door. Once in, then as an employee, I hear it is awesome. "
bad,Learned job security was nonexistent. Typical day was spent driving to stores. Most enjoyable part of the job was the amount of independence I was granted in order to do my job.
bad,"no room to change jobs, eliminated job bidding process. Thank God for the UNION. Management ruled by intimidation. Company only cares about time spent on job, need to move along. Verizon is entering cable tv 25 years too late. All newer tvs out in last 5 years are smart tvs. Fios/ cable are overpriced, everyones looking to cut the cord."
bad,Not able to reach full capacity till you reach an unsurmountable goal. Competitive. Other employees took my sales as their own. Micro managing. Manager was after ladies who came into store not interested in sales or performance.
bad,"Regardless of what is posted in the internal HR guidelines and told to our front line employees, work/life balance is non-existent once you enter a management position within the company.  24x7 regardless of vacation or out of office."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"If you're looking to get your foot in the door with tech-based work, it's a decent entry point. But this is definitely not a career for anyone. Build the skills you need through working here and find something else ASAP."
bad,"After ten years of service to verizon we were told everyone is to be laid off with a buyout package.  After weighing my options with a financial adviser I opted to take the buyout rather than face unemployment.  The day after my buyout acceptance was sent in, the company announced no layoffs were coming and all who did not send in the buyout acceptance will not lose their jobs."
bad,Fast paced days with a lot of drive time repairing cell site equipment and preparing for upgrades and new builds and projects. You get to work on the latest technology in the industry.
bad,"The managers were Very young, they were very un professional. "
bad,"This job was HORRIBLE on my family, which is why I did not stay there very long. The manager pushes you to be dishonest with customers in order to hit your target sales. You would retail hours, which are rough, and it is very performance-driven. They don't care about you - they care about your numbers."
bad,Watch your back with your employees because they will steal your sale. I am only writing this review because indeed.com is making it a requirement. I did not like the competitiveness. The commission was great.
bad,"I was able to improve my negotiation skills, communication skills, and management skills within Verizon Wireless. I also trained in compliance and sales."
bad,"Team had plenty of opportunities to grow big. But, team was put down  by poor, incapable leaders. Not a surprise that the team is only going downwards."
bad,No work life balance.   Job upward mobility is limited.  The pay is not great.  Benefits are okay but could be better.  Schedules is always bound to change.
bad,"The company is entirely revenue driven.  Any idea that they cared about their employee is false."
bad,Had to move or be promoted in this very bureaucratic organization. The company is not reflective of a work and life balance and constantly focus on it bottom line.
bad,"I really don't have much to say but the management needs to improve. Instead of trying to be a supervisor, be leaders. Leaders lead by example. thanks"
bad,Company transitioning due to industry changes and saturation. Emphasis on cost reduction. Lots of layoffs. Consumer services to be self serve only. Network and IT to transition to contract workers.
bad,My job involved assisting customers with any billing and technical concerns regarding their cell phone or service.  I promptly resolved any billing concerns.
bad,"I was hired on as what they used to call an ""Experience Specialist"" whose job was to maintain the store, help customers, and do the technical work. I was promised at the start of my hire that I would be moved to sales within a few months. That never happened, nor did I appreciate my hard work benefiting sales commissions while I received a flat pay rate."
bad,"Some team culture are ok and other bad. "
bad,"I was with VZW for half a decade. I worked hard and achieved a lot. A couple of employees started rumors like high school drama. Unfortunately, I made a couple of mistakes and those employees capitalized on it. HR sided with the employees even though they couldn't validate many of the allegations. They didn't protect me from the other employees nor did they allow me the opportunity to move to another department. They ultimately let me go. A decision which many of my fellow peers (the non-backstabbing ones), my supervisor, and his supervisor, disagreed with."
bad,"not for everyone, lack of good supervisors.  low pay. talked down to and cant go off script. didnt enjoy my time there and felt i was just there to fill a seat."
bad,"Wasn't there too long and the pay was really, really weak compared to other jobs i've held in this field.  Work conditions could have been better, especially the equipment we used."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Another company that I once worked for. I left them almost 20 years ago so any opinions that I might have had are no longer applicable or useful. I met my wife there.
bad,"Verizon has been around for a long time. They have a great compensation package for their employees. Working in their Fios call center is a tough job. Their customers aren't the most happiest of people. Verizon has strict compliance rules you have to follow making it difficult to do your job. It's an extremely stressful place to work but if you love money, it's the place to be."
bad,It felt like working for the government. So many have been there over 30 years and (as some freely admit) just waiting for retirement.   Decisions based on personal concerns and their own status versus what is best.  Not a place for the young and talented.
bad,Work-life balance is not the best. The customers are great. I worked part-time so didn't have to deal with to much from management. The industry is really competitive.
bad,Meet at the Office around 12PM.  Go out to a area in New Jersey and walk home to home trying to sale Verizon Fios.  Hardest part of the job was always dealing with police because people just see u walking and wonder why you on there street.
bad,"Lot of stress, high burnout rate. Leadership does not support the rnak and file worker. Little possibility for advancement. You will be expected to defend policies that make little sense."
bad,I personally did not like the sitting for 8 hours straight however i did enjoy helping customers with the issues and help make their issues go away i like the customer service interactions.
bad,"My manager was not qualified to manage professionals. He micromanaged his entire team, and treated us like grade-schoolers. He has since left, and much of the other legacy Hughes Telematics management has turned over, so it may be better now."
bad,"Other than be a data entry, there is not much you can do and this place specially when there's no work to do and sometimes you have to go back home and cant get paid."
bad,"The pay and benefit are the only reason I haven't left. A lot of favoritism, if you are liked then you have more chances of having a day off, and being helped. Pressure at all times which comes with any job that is based on commission but don't expect the whole if you try that is what matters ordeal."
bad,"Lack of advancement and Verizon closed the 2 warehouses I worked at. I transferred from the Suwanee facility to Westfield, In because of the closing in Georgia in 2005."
bad,"Upper management is flailing to find new revenue sources, and layoffs have become an annual inevitability."
bad,It was the strangest place I ever worked.  They spend a lot of time and money to make sre your fully trained.  Then the spend the rest of your career trying to fire you.  Terrible work environment.
bad,"Fast pace environment.  Must keep up with the latest and greatest trends in the area in which you work. For example, I worked in IT, and since Wireless began laying off IT personnel.  There was a desire for Project Managers"
bad,They are a typical corporate giant.  You can train the person in another country who will one day replace you.  That is never hidden.  The bottom line of profitability takes precedence over everything else and there is no support from upper management.  Extremely high pressure and stressful environment.
bad,"they were great. to much stress for very little money, commission based but they will take that commision as quick as they can for a simple mistake. to get paid minimum wage not worth it. the manager was great couldnt ask for better"
bad,Worked for verizon business and the union. The pay and benefits were excellent but the job absolutely sucked. Computer systems and programs were 25 years old and you were encouraged to outright lie to our customers. Hated every part of this job.
bad,"so many changes in a short time with additional requirements being loaded without any being removed. Environmental has become stressful, compensation is harder to achieve."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Hours are short and the drive for core products are quite high.Core products consist of selling things such as tablets,hot spots,and HUM(car program). Not a very high pay out on these products but nonetheless they strongly emphasize selling them to everyone.Management believes in stressing these metrics for a bigger kick back on their end if you were to ask me.The hardest part of the job would be the amount of stress they put on their employees compared to the amount they pay out.For instance,lets say its a slow pay period(2 weeks) and the employee has sold everything they could but they have not sold 75% for the box target given,the employee does not get paid out for anything they've sold and the company pockets all the profits.These employees have families and financial obligations to be met.Corporate greed has blindsided a company that once stood with integrity and compassion for their employees.I remember coming to work with a strong sense of pride for my job,now things are very different. I've learned many things from working for Victra that has made me a strong sales rep."
bad,"Became proficient with the use of visio, 3gis and smart sheet.  management did not micro managed. great working experience and excellent learning environment."
bad,"When Verizon Wireless was first created in 2000, it was a fantastic company.  Slowly, over the years, the focus changed from its employees and customers to it's profit margins setting new records.  Once Vodafone was bought out by Verizon Communications a few years back and the ""Wireless"" was absorbed by the borg-like mentality of an old Ma Bell reincarnation, everything went to downhill.  It was still a good job to have overall, but what made it special, what made it the company I had hoped to retire with was gone.  Now instead of making the best network, the company shaves off pennies to make an accountant look good for his or her fiscal quarter numbers, at the loss of the reliability the wireless was built upon.  Indeed (hehe), the entire foundation for the company's success was being eroded in the hunt for the next 16 billion in profits for a quarter.  It is a shame, but this is what late stage capitalism has come to, and I can only hope to find another company which still has that focus that I had come to love about the old VZW."
bad,"Bad Managers which results in bad employesss"
bad,"Seual with an x  harassment it’s a big thing at Verizon, or just harassing you in general. It’s fun to work there at times, but then other days it feels absolutely horrible. Management doesn’t know what they’re doing half the time. They place people with great sales experience in management. Note this Verizon to yourself: not everyone in sales is  equipped to be a manager or even remotely have the intelligence to be one. They’re not leaders."
bad,"Fleet machanic responsible for everything! Parts inventory, fleet metrics at my garage, Repair of cars to line trucks, inspection station, and much much more! The job was great but only contract.... receiving half the pay and no benefits compared to company employees! But you are allowed to work extra hours to make up for the loss of holiday pay. Verizon management team are running scared for their jobs and you can see them sweat! I really like the mechanic job but Verizon mgmt. lead me along for 3 years then nothing.. contract ended no job. They expect you to have every license and ASE certification and  maintain a Class A CDL also have a  Master degree in underwater basket weaving. The worst part was learing their pm scheduling and part ordering system.. all in vein because they cut you loose in the end.. good by!  "
bad,Verizon demands that its employees meet unreasonable performance objectives which promotes a competitive culture rather than a cooperative environment.  Ethical behavior is preached by senior management but unethical behavior is only addressed if the company is forced to.
bad,"if you work in the Huntsville market, you would have to sell a lot more and harder to get paid decent. In birmingham, the traffic is higher and more opportunities to sell. Huntsville the traffic is less and have to try to sell to every customer or else you may not get paid anything. Too many changes in the commission structure. If you already have the mindset to sell the full menu, you can make money but you cannot be a casual seller or wait until someone tells you want they want. You will starve. Also, this is not Verizon corporate, this is Verizon Indirect, so all of traffic goes to the corporate side and their employees tell customers not to go to the indirect stores. Too many factors working against you."
bad,"Confused self identity when it comes to company's culture. The uppers seem to have a 'your lucky that you even have a job' mentality. Tons of group merging that causes an overload of work, and lack of product knowledge. There is also high turnaround / frequent layoffs each quarter."
bad,interview was fine Enjoyed my boss I would work for them again in the future. There are chances to grow with the company Very good training process thanks
bad,"Simply, Verizon outsources its customer support lines to call centers like Teleperformance, USA. They provide no support for handling troubleshooting and assisting customers with problems. No access to customer information that could aid call center operatives to aid customers. All in all, Verizon and Teleperformance were all about dollars and _NOTHING_ about customers."
bad,Poor Management makes the work culture unnecessarily difficult. Advancement in departments proved very difficult and was too dependent on the departments manager.
bad,"Verizon Wireless mask their cut throat, lack of supportive environment behind its brand, benefits and pay. They are not true to core values nor do they value employees."
bad,"no advancement opportunities unless willing to relocate.  no recognition.  Management short staffed, often located in different city with poor time management skills"
bad,"This company was good to work for at the beginning, but when WorldCom bought MCI, things went bad.  It became a place that was difficult to work for because we didn't know what the plans were for the company."
bad,"I came into Verizon through a merger and while their expressed intention was integrate us we were instead treated like mushrooms. Kept in the dark and fed - well you know the expression.  Worked at the Ashburn VA location.  Huge building - hope you like to walk - miles.  No free coffee!!  Shared workspaces that employees frequently laid claim to leading to difficulties finding a cube for the day.  Some are assigned cubes IF you're getting a desktop computer.  For a phone company - they have very few land lines - voice communications are VOIP - good luck finding a headset.  If you are acquired by Verizon get a Verizon manager quickly otherwise they will look to lay you off within your first year.  Layoffs abound at this behemoth. If they look like they're going to miss numbers, even internal ones, a layoff is coming QUICK.  The workforce is aging at this company average age of workers appeared to be early 50's.  Innovation is lacking.  Work silos abound - very tough to get any collaboration often within your own team.  Benefits are excellent and pay is competitive - many choices on the healthcare front.  The best company to work for is the Verizon Wireless - they treat them much better.  Wireline employees are 2nd class citizens.  The joke was if there was a fire drill  - wireless employees were supposed to leave the building first.   Typical day - they start early there but most work bankers hours.  After 5PM its a bit of a ghost town.  To move ahead I had always heard you needed to be working at the Basking Ridge NJ HQ."
bad,"The pay and benefits cannot be beat but you are basically giving up your life for it, You cannot miss a day your first six months no matter what happens , if your kid is sick oh well, you need to have a back up for your back up. Once you are  on the floor they monitor your calls diligently and will interrupt to tell you are taking too long. If you call out sick you can not leave your home except to go to the doctor and yes they do have someone who can  come to the  home and spotcheck. I can only speak for the sales division. I know a few people who were able to go to other divisions and have a totally different experience. They lavish you with gifts and food while you are working especially if you are selling, you can win trips no expense spared but at the end of the day you spend so much time effort and energy there,you will realize you have missed out on so much of life that it is not worth it."
bad,"Waking up at 9:00am to go to an office to practice our craft in how to close sales when we are out in the field, to leave and walk around neighborhoods for several hours to close sales. i wouldnt have minded working commission only if the hours were more flexible."
bad,"Individual store management is good, however, the company as a whole gives very little authority to store managers and upper management likes to micro manage everything. Very little freedom"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"The pay is decent and benefits are great, however the company culture and employee morale is substandard.    Intimidation and retaliation are the cornerstone of management and coaching practices with this company.  You owe it to yourself and your family do something else with your life."
bad,I worked d2d there. I got to really make my own hours . I learned so much because I was always meeting new people and learned how to over come people.
bad,Verizon was a great company to work for at one time.  Verizon has management layoffs every 3-6 months and offers of early retirement to union members.  New positions open in other parts of the country where there isn't a union and the pay is less.
bad,"Fun place.. productive with ping pong tables, "
bad,The company use to be a great place when we were bell Atlantic. It has  become a stressfull place. Very little chance of mobility. With degrees its who you know.
bad,"All about saving your job and positioning. Accomplishment is not overly valued. Management is playing chess, if you're playing checkers, you won't last long."
bad,"It was a good experience.  I worked selling real estate on paper.  In other words I managed revenue accounts that advertised their business in the yellow pages of NY.  I also had to replenish advertising business for lost or decreased revenue accounts. "
bad,Verizon is  good  company once  you moveupward in to  management   good pay  and  relxes  atomsophere  verizon has great  beenefits   an  dbonus program  just that managemnt  seems not  to care  because they are  a  huge company
bad,The management staff was unsupportive and only cared about themselves. Employees were yelled at by customers and had little they could do about it.  No support
bad,You have to work a lot of hours and sacrifice a lot of your life in order to get ahead in the company.  You also have to be willing to work 60-70 hours a week as a manager
bad,I was with Verizon wireless for 6 1/2 yrs. the first 4 years was stressful but worth it. The culture changed and upper management and corporate  continue to keep hurting its foundation of workers. This is why i wouldn't recommend working for them any longer.
bad,"Working here was the ultimate corporate oppressive environment. The service works well, but the company rips off the public and our job was to defend the company."
bad,This division used to be an advertisement company for companies to advertise in the yellow pages which is now obsolete. Verizon Communications is different entity still doing business in the telecommunications area.
bad,"No sense of humour: Never a time or place to laugh, normally focused on companies objective."
bad,Moral went downhill as soon as the call center went from Elgin to Rolling Meadows. Management only cared about numbers and not employees as individuals and rarely spent ant one on one time developing skills or abilities in employees for advancement
bad,Customers have unrealistic expectations about their plans and devices.   They do not take responsibility for their device content or the condition of their devices.
bad,Super cut throat and purely sales driven which warrants them to push you to lower your ethics if you let them.  Few stay longer than a few years so don't be surprise about the turn over rate.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,but all the managers really care about is money. they dont care about anything else and dont believe in slow seasons. expecting an employee to have the same numbers in the middle of summer as they do during christmas is outrageous. i would never work there again.
bad,The job started off as being really fun and everybody was all for a team environment then my boss became sick and had to leave bringing in another manager from a different location this manager played favorites as he brought in his top sales person from a different store however being the top guy at my store I was able to stay ahead of everyone else because I was the main guy there but everything was so cut-throat that people will lose leads and literally not get paid for some accounts and other people get paid for once if they didn't
bad,I did not have a good experience working for Verizon as I was pressured to work extra hard and hardly any training to better myself. Upper management was clueless to what happened under their organizations.
bad,"Cut throat company as company is downsizing, allot of good managers let go, Used to be a career company but land line side is downsizing severely wireless technology is taking over"
bad,"The environment was pushy, unethical, and grimy. Nothing seemed to be done about employees hacking accounts and the manager had favorites who were given new lines (new lines are put onto the account that effects your commission checks). Verizon took up way too much of my time."
bad,"I feel like there is a bit of brainwashing and cult mentality at this company.  The benefits are good, job security is so-so, the customer service training is wonderful.  They do extensive training, which you will use in future jobs, but I can honestly say that I would never recommend this company for employment.  The retail stores often are short-staffed, so they work reps all day without breaks and make you ""eat on the run"", plus do overtime.  Vacation time is rarely given on the days you request.  Call center employees are practically chained to a desk and headset.  You can't even leave to go to the bathroom when you need to.  It's impossible to get relocated or promoted.  Really, they just want worker bees."
bad,"A place that might make ""management -level"" employees want to unionize.  The pay and benefits were very good, but did not compensate for the stress and the hours."
bad,"Management was truly horrible, never got trained on the information I was suppose to know and when I made a sale my employer would make me put that sale in one of the 3 employees names, So essentially my money I was making was being stolen from me."
bad,This is a very busy place and a lot of stress is pushed onto the individual contributors.  The management - employee relationship in most areas is contentious and not friendly.  This is supported by upper management.
bad,"Great benefits, good pay, if you are willing to relocate, there is some room for advancement. Long hours, ego oriented upper management, never enough. YOU WORK HARD FOR THE MONEY"
bad,team leader and loved other employees communication with management was not good  the environment had different cultures that where also mistreated leaving was the best thing for me to do.
bad,"The first 10 years were great, but they changed. All you are is a number and nothing more. They actually want you to practice dishonest tactics with customers. They have zero loyalty to anyone, and believe me if they do now they won't later down the line."
bad,"Co-workers were rewarded for shady sales and would pass off issues to lees experienced sales personnel. Training stops once you're actually in the store, your manager can not be bothered. Very cut throat, and you are expected to be very pushy."
bad,Fair chance for stability and advancement.  Stable option financially with decent benefits.  Stressful culture and a lack of work/life balance makes this a potential burnout type of job situation long term.
bad,This was an ok place to work.. it is no longer running which is too bad.  The pace for the work was not too bad.  The cost for running a call center was too high which it seems like the reason that it closed
bad,Motivated and willing to learn new ways of doing things. Always ready and willing to listen to fellow employees. Staying focused to the mission at hand is my outmost goal.
bad,"The only thing that mattered were the metrics for the call center.  Personal illness, unless severe, was no excuse for not being at work.  Additional info unavailable"
bad,"You really have to enjoy the job and take all the views and lack of patients the customers have and just get the job done. The job is hard and you have to deal with bad management, your better off working for Verizon corporate."
bad,"I worked there for 2 1/2 years and it was not a good experience at all. The hourly pay/compensation was decent, but if you wanted a good commission check, you had to trick and bully customers into taking things they don't need. Managers would ""encourage"" us to over sell customers, and basically lie to get the sale. When the customers found out they were conned, the manager would ""persuade"" the customer to keep what they bought by forcing them to pay restocking fees and line termination fees. After working there, I will never shop or allow my family to shop at any of their stores again."
bad,the managers were not organized at all. I didnt learn anything. The hardest part of the job was actually walking in and sitting down to work. the culture was not welcoming. Horrible place.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,This was a contract position with very little room for advancement. the hours were not steady and there were frequent changes in the company that they did not prepare you for
bad,"For new college graduates this place is great because it has an excellent starting pay for the area and gives you a chance to get experience on your resume but don't plan on staying here long term. The managers will tell you that they want your help to improve processes but if you make suggestions then you'll be retaliated against. There isn't any internal job bidding process and so you can expect to be moved to whatever job they see fit without a raise. They promised that we could work from home but that is not an option even during inclement weather. If you have to take a position for experience this is the place for you, otherwise run away from this place like the plague. When I interviewed I noticed how unhappy everyone seemed and now that I work here I can see why."
bad,Verizon Technical support call center. Work was a full time day. Customer service was a huge skill to have while talking with customers. Mediocre work environment.
bad,"Typical Sales job, push new lines to customers and upgrades. Management isn't the best. Customers can sometimes be very rude. Very fast paced environment."
bad,"I worked on their Financial services, you are expected to talk and write at the same time, be extremely accurate and your calls had to average 3 min."
bad,"I really could not leave that place fast enough. It was just biding time until I got something else, very boring work. Online meeting were ridiculous"
bad,"Typical day 8-5 with admin work in the evening generally"
bad,"If you love constant layoffs and  reorganizations, Verizon Professional Services might be the perfect place for you.  In every position I held in my numerous years at Verizon the incentive structure was either completely outside of your ability to control, or if it was in your control, it didnt actually measure anything that seemed to be valued by your management.  Layoffs seemed to be dictated more by some arcane financial calculation with more senior and higher paid people likely to be let go, while lower performers with fewer years of service were retained."
bad,"When, I first started I was very excited about the advancement opportunities. But, after almost 10 years in the same position that just did not happen. They, have their favorites of who they want to promote."
bad,"They brainwash you that they are not a bureaucracy, but that's exactly who they are!  If you dont become buddy buddy with your managers, you get no where!  Not a good company to work for,"
bad,Constantly felt underappreciated. Managers constantly talked down to us and told us that we did not do anything. Then almost everyone in my position got laid off.
bad,Working with people daily has it benefits and down falls. I enjoy helping people understand their devices better and assist with trying to lower their bill. A lot of what my job entails is fixing other representatives mistakes or helping a customer that was scammed into buying something they do not need or want. The sales goals are high and your numbers rule your entire existence when you work for Verizon. They care more about the money than they do the customer service even though they require everyone to attend training sessions on integrity and good service.
bad,A typical day at work was your typical call center job including making inbound and outbound calls about customers Verizon accounts. I learned in some cases the customer is always right. The management needed some improvement with the way they handled some situations and always changing Verizon policies and not updating there employees about the changes. The hardest part about the job was having an angry customer that we could not help because of certain company policies. The most enjoyable part of the day was meeting anonymous people.
bad,Working there was very time consuming and mentally straining but the co-workers and boss was always nice. Hardest part of the job was opening all applications on a 3 minute call with the customer. Most enjoyable was interacting with the customers on the phone and computer and making them happy with their phone call. I learned a lot of different of computer programs and to multi- task even more than i did before.
bad,Building great customer service skills.  Great training on the products and services they offer.  Great supervisors that will try to do what they can to make your experience better.
bad,"A typical day would include activating as many new line of service customers as possible and sell everything."
bad,chaotic work culture and tight bureaucracy obstructing the information flow across layers and hence creating friction in the operation of organization.
bad,Provided tech support for the mobile office connecting device through cell phone to make internet connection. I also was responsible to 7 billing systems for credit and updating documenting. Responsible to application for main hub to trouble shoot connection issues and making sure all equipment available for learning.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Horrible hate working here dont care about the customers or the employees  pay was good benefits good union sucks    go to school on vz terms
bad,upon arrival to work review the days work load then call the customer see if they are home and ready for you appointment. review the job requirements and make sure i have the necessary tools and supplies on my vehicle. Proceed to the customers home greet them and review the work to be done. Determine the best way to install the fiber optic equipment the proceed with the installation. Upon completing the install review all of the installation with the customer make sure all set top boxes are working and they know how to access the product actions ordered. Verify the internet is routing correctly and the customer is able to browse. verify dial tone.
bad,"It is a job, not a lot of promotional opportunities. Not a lot to say, management is sub par  and working in call center is not enjoyable"
bad,"greet customers, sign them into the kiosk, cross trained to answer customer service questions, direct them to the proper department"
bad,"Verizon Telematics is a small division..Recent leadership is not well versed on the product or strategy.  New senior leadership was hired in (IT organization) and all are of Indian decent.  Massive layoffs in the same department and the majority of people left are of Indian decent."
bad,"Its a very big company.  Members of one department have no idea what members of other departments do. (The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing).  Company only cars about its profits.  Pretends to care about cust's, but does everything they can to take advantage of them, only truly focusing on money.  Diversity often just for the sake of it.  Another corporation in American circa 2016 that really needs to be reminded there are still Middle class, English speaking (as a first language), Americans in this country.  Management can often be quite clueless, useless, and severely lacking in people skills.  Good pay and bonuses, but you are on your own as far as training and the job itself.  Can also be quite political.  The company will consistently posture as if it is out for the employees best interests, but its really just out for itself and its profit margin.  Very greedy company and stockholders.  Very miserly when spending on its employees, will only invest in itself in the form of a very sure thing for the sole purpose of expanding its profit margin.  Very cut throat and political as far as career advancement as well.  As a company, management, as well as many of its employees are definitely contributing to the dumbing down of vzw and corporate America in general."
bad,"typical work day consists of you working on your a/r aging and collections"
bad,company has  cafeteria and workout facility. great 401k. benefits are good. the  job is  very stressful. Most supervisor are unavailable to assist when you need them. some room for advancement not alike like they  claim. Hardest part of the  job is being  yelled at all day long. you need thick skin.
bad,"This used to be a good company.  Now, it has very poor leadership at the executive and front line levels.  Executives strip money out of the company to pad their own salaries & bonuses while laying off employees.  Front line management is incompetent.  There is a lot of favoritism.  Hiring practices and promotions are based on who you know."
bad,The company culture has changed a lot throughout the 4 years that I've worked there. Individual experience varies depending on management.
bad,There are a LOT of Cons and more than I can and want to write here but the Pros are that the compensation is good and benefits are great.
bad,Huge call center with great supervisors who was supportive. High turnover as people with different shifts everyday making it hard to build relationships with your co-workers. Learned how to listen to customers on the phone intently and make sure their questions and problems were being answered.
bad,"Customers will yell at you 80% of the calls, sometimes cursed out over the phone for something you didn't do. Management was pretty decent barely any complaints. The company itself placed too many quotas that they wanted us to meet with such horrible customers. working here I was able to build my communication skills and also learned how to keep my composure much better. Co - Workers were excellent felt like a family always helped each other out. Hardest part of the job was to satisfy angry customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was that there was no manual labor involved, but did seem to get boring after a while."
bad,Management/HR could not keep confidentiality. Gossiping of employees to other employees out loud. Did not assist with any employee concerns of the workplace and poorly trained.
bad,"Besides the pay, this company tells your in the training that family comes 1st and that they balance work/family.  Far from the truth. working 6 days a week and having your manager call you on your day off to come in.  I lost my sister who was a single parent and trying to work through that situation was a nightmare. I would say that this is a great job if your fresh out of college and wanting to make good money then this is the place.  Benefits are great as well"
bad,"The staff were very nice to work with and we enjoyed each day together as a family. The management was dictated by those that weren't on the front lines and didn't understand the complexities of the floor, and this led to them setting unreasonable expectations for the markets that the stores were in and constantly changing these standards at least monthly, quite often sooner. It was very difficult to try to schedule family functions never knowing your changing schedule or whether or not your vacation days would be approved even when asked for months in advance. They promote family/life balance, but do not live by it and when compounded by the pressures of front-line sales with ever increasing goals it led to a very stressful work environment."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,didn't make it anywhere in the company.. it was time to go. nothing more to say. Verizon has a lot of shadiness going on in the company that they ARE aware of but refuse to recognize it.
bad,"Verizon is currently doing major reduction in force (eliminating positions) in most departments, or outsourcing most of the jobs from the US."
bad,"Discipline is the word of the day.  Nothing will be explained by management without the threat of the discipline of non-conformance explained.  Very low moral among all employees including management.  Your employment is always held against you, being reminded they will find someone else. Intentional unobtainable demands on results.  Forced overtime daily and weekly without any regard to family life.  Poor company to work for.  If not for the compensation, they would not have an employee base."
bad,I didn't particularly like working here.  It was stressful and you are not able to speak up for yourself when customers yell at you.
bad,"Sales are driven so hard it feels like a cheap car lot, they dont take no for an answer. I got tired of being cussed out while I worked here. Management only cares about the numbers you produce, nothing else.."
bad,Overall good company to work for in terms of benefits.  As for actual job responsibilities; the demand/scope are well outside of the 8 hour day. Any over-time requires high level approval.
bad,"handle customer billing concerns, upsell, troubleshoot wireless devices. Had great co workers. The leadership is horrible at this location. The goals are unreasonable. Very stressful job which makes it unhealthy. Angry customers are apart of the job and that is expected but management makes it more stressful than it should be."
bad,Command and Control Culture makes it very difficult to operate humanly in this enviroment - as well as the constant layoffs.
bad,"Company talks about it ""credo"" supporting workers with one mouth and with other mouth cuts workers and send contract to cheapest overseas labor company, usually India, after management fails to meet goals and is moved onto new project.  It is very top heavy management wise with many layers of management with some managers only managing 2-3 sub-managers."
bad,"not much to say apply for cooperate store. no commission. learn as you go training. Not many benefits poor pay. micromanagement , not many incentives either to sell. impossible goals."
bad,"Great employees/coworkers.  Everyone tries to motivate one another.  You learn every aspect of customer service you can think of, time management skills, and how to deal with different personalities.  The hardest part of the job is the micromanagement and the most enjoyable part of the job is the pay and benefits."
bad,"Verizon FiOS is an excellent company to work for. Great benefits, great compensation, a lot of opportunity for growth. It' s hard to get into the corporate side of things if you work for a contracted company much like myself."
bad,"Good job to work for in regards to benefits and pay. Politics suck and there is a lot of cut throat things that go on there. Its all about who you know and what your willing to do to make it to the top. Schedule is never solid and be prepared to work weekends. If you have children, they are not understanding. They want bodies to fill their seats and could care less about your family issues."
bad,"Terrible environment for non-management employees.... No matter how hard you work company controls whether or not you will get bonus - Company will short your pay, so you must be an accountant to keep track of hrs worked and pay received"
bad,"The way the Teleperformance managed the project left the agents not knowing what metrics were currently important. In turn the client, Verizon, was not really satisfied."
bad,"There were more employees than seats, if you didnt get a seat, you didnt work. If you went to the bathroom and someone took your seat, you went home without pay."
bad,No work life balance.  High goals and most customers are service customers that you have to waste your time with.  Promise you great flexibility but management and retail reps are not on the same page.  can be very rewarding but you have to work every weekend and work 9 plus hours a day.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"ok, time to move on as the culture has changed to much. too much off shoring of jobs, lack of value in the core values that got us to where we are today. top brass is all from the outside now, with no regard for past company values."
bad,"Good pay, no personal life.  If you have family or a personal life say good bye to it  The goals are very hard to achieve and you will be threatened with your job daily"
bad,"Not so Good Company."
bad,"Its very tiring and running around"
bad,Ok place to work. No chance for growth.  Hard work with little pay!  Hours varied day to day.  Work weekends.  wouldn't work here again
bad,you have to really like using phone and dealing with people. that is all you do. everything is under a microscopic and it is hard to have any personnel space here
bad,"A typical work day started with my supervisor managing by screaming at people for no apparent reason.  I did learn, trial by fire, 37 different systems none of which made a lot of sense. My direct line supervisor  was / is an alcoholic drug addict, His boss, the Sr Manager - although in the same building - never made herself available.  I never saw her in 5 years.   Most of my co-workers were / are like friends for exception of my team leads.  The hardest part of my job was getting out bed and wondering why do I have to go through this nightmare again.   The most enjoyable part of my job was using my access card to leave the building.   They paid well to endure the suffering."
bad,"The job on a day to day basses is alright for the most part. i do enjoy the customers that come in with questions, and seeing the excitement on their faces when solving their needs is very fun for me as well, but  overall with the staff being the only problem i do enjoy coming to work."
bad,"Great benefits"
bad,"Great people.  Very large global infrastructure, complex technologies, in great need of true leadership."
bad,Assisting Indirect/Direct Store Agents with Credit Application and Being the first level of Fraud Protection
bad,Not union friendly. New hires are treated like 2nd class citizens. Benefits are good.
bad,"My job title may be called Tech Support, but they may as well call us Customer Service too.  Revenue as a main metric? I didn't enter this company to sell stuff, and it sure wasn't in the job description when I was first hired into the position. Verizon Wireless uses us as guinea pigs to manipulate and test their metrics. We have 4 metrics that officially ""count"" but 20 other metrics that we have to meet or they put us on performance improvement plans and warnings. Plus, they change the numbers all of the time to suit their own needs. "
bad,"petty management and slavish culture. poor working environment, old systems"
bad,"came in and got straight to the phones."
bad,"While I did enjoy working with people, answering plan and technology questions I truly did not like working for the company or the management staff. "
bad,"I enjoyed everyday helping customers"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"this was a dealer of verizon, company only lasted 3 years, went out of business nothing else to say"
bad,"a typical day at work is always making sure that i take care of the customer understanding what they need, why they are calling and making sure they concerns are resolved. there is alot of stress involved as we get non stop calls. So we have to be available and not be in standby mode we have to use all our resources to show that we are doing every thing we can."
bad,"I have No Employee Benefits whatsoever, since I am working through an employment agencey . Would be a better place if I were a Direct Hire"
bad,"If you are in school and looking for anything yeah, if you are not in school and looking for something more serious no. If you are an extremely good sales person it could work out but not for long."
bad,Nice people to work with get paid every week fast work place answering inbound calls within a certain time frame
bad,This was a summer job after I came back to Atlanta from Georgia Southern University. I worked here to get by a pay the bills. I learned a lot about home remodeling. Unfortunately the pay was very inconsistent and didn't provide me with the funds I needed to take care of my financial business.
bad,"Hectic atmosphere, every changing management.  No consistancy."
bad,"I served a.m snack, lunch and p.m snack to the children. This included cooking luch and having each plate proportional."
bad,"Different departments have different cultures and management styles, but the common theme across the board is people gaming the system to get the most out of it for themselves."
bad,"No room for advancement, no base pay only commission on which half they take back from your paychecks for deactivations."
bad,"I appreciated Verizon for their great benefits and I really liked the people I worked with. However, Verizon's style of managing their union employees is definitely not the best out there."
bad,"This is the job for you. Super competitive and pretty decent pay. However, it has gone less in the favor of the retail sales associate as of late. As with any retailer, things constantly change and you have to be ready to change with it, in order to stay relevant.  I felt like I was caught between two parents that hated each other when I worked there.  The customers and the corporation.  They both wanted to pi** on me, because of the things they didn't like about each other. If you take things personally, do not apply! If you do not like incentive based pay, do not apply! If you don't like shucking and jiving for corporate people that don't have a clue about what goes on in a retail location, DO NOT APPLY!"
bad,very stressful place to work ..management and union are a team and job security is not part of the agenda for either of them...pay is not worth the stress....
bad,"Old school corporate culture the relies heavily on attaching yourself & career aspiration, to a senior director and his / her fiefdom. "
bad,"i was only there for a short period of time."
bad,"was a temp was advised  to be hired on after 3 months, I was there 9   I am in need of a full time job with benefits.  My daughter needs the insurance."
bad,"The company has a great mission statement, vision and core values.  However, they are very east coast bias and not a lot of opportunity for growth if you are not willing to relocate.  Team members are awesome, supportive and intelligent.  "
bad,Maybe the corporate office in NJ is better than the operations and logistics department that I work in which is the WORST.  Very little opportunity for growth and advancement with this company.  The pay does not measure up with the enormous profits that this company makes.  The performance measurement's that you are rated on are unrealistic and unfair and are only in place to protect the companies bottom line by keeping YOU on the bottom!  
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"This was a good learning experience. I really liked the support. I learned how to prorate payments on accounts, which has helped me through out my job history."
bad,"This company is a solid company as far as compensation, but when it comes to promoting, it's very unfair. They state that they're a performance based company, and I have been a strong rep from the day that I was hired. I've led the company in different stat categories, like upgrades and overall customer service, I've been an overall leading rep for the 2012 yr, and this current yr I am leading in every category that is recorded. Yet I am being bypassed by reps that are not performing as well as well as reps that have been placed on code of conduct warnings."
bad,"Excellent knowledge obtainment from HR, IT, and Customer Service."
bad,"I work in the call center environment. This is an already stressful location, due the customers and the nature of the calls coming in. The job becomes even worse when management is constantly down your throat about stats, stats, stats. The majority of scores come from customer surveys. These surveys are taken by customers who are already angry. Let's face it, who calls customer service to thank them for a great bill? Management does not seem to understand this, or care about how difficult the job is. Also, supervisors are never available to help or answer questions. When customers escalate, they get mad at you for escalating. There is just a huge lack of support at this company."
bad,We had to constantly take calls for tech support with little to no breaks.
bad,"A typical day at work would be to show up get organized for the day. Review all numbers and metrics to set daily goals. What i learned from working at Verizon was how to maximize every opportunity. Management was helpful in assisting if needed. All co-workers were great and personable. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the high volume of customers that would come in to the store and would not have patience. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with people and helping them in any aspects, weather it would be technical or on there account or just understanding our services."
bad,Not really geared to hear a customers problems. Just want to sell sell sell.....
bad,constantly on the phone trying to recruit clients
bad,Very confusing and always changing or increasing pricing. As a result there were too many angry and unhappy customers. If one of these customers give u a bad survey it basically knocks ur stats off for the month. After a while if no progress they will fire you. basically ur job depends on angry and confused customers. If u let it working for this company will drive you crazy.
bad,"walked into work, and learned alot of homes and how to help people finincal there homes, meet alot of good people who taught me things"
bad,"was a very disorganized office, understaffed and over worked. mandatory overtime ever monday, tuesday and friday. learned alot about the telecommunications business, managerial staff played more than worked, unreasonable sales goals and requirements. Met them all despite uphill battle. The hardest part of the day was the overtime, the most enjoyable was the one customer you truly felt like you helped and that sent an accomodation email to verizon corporate on your behalf."
bad,Cold calling was not my style. I did not get much training but that is expected at a sales postion
bad,"This job was by far the worst job i have ever had! The hours vary from day to day, your schedule is always messed up. Management was HORRIBLE, they watched your every move and was waiting for you to just pick up a pen or sneeze so that they could write you up. You did not see much of the same people because either they worked different hours than you or they quit. There was always someone different that you met. The hardest part was not having enough break time doing what you do at this job. I literally would have anxiety attacks at this place. What a wast of my life for sure. But then again its a call center, you get treated like wild animals and nobody cares about your personal life."
bad,recently laid off no job security. good bdenefits with healthcare and 401k
bad,On the phone all day with mostly hostile customers and always expected to sell them something.
bad,Managers - fair Come into position looking for next position- not dedicated to potition
bad,This job was very slow and routine. No place for advancement
bad,"A typical day at work varies, it is based on the customer. While our ultimate goal is to meet sales objectives however customer the customer may have technical issues or bill questions and more often than not concerns about services not working properly. These situations make for an interesting day. Management is there to assist and defuse escalations. My coworkers are great and work as a team."
bad,Job was ok. A little too much for the pay rate. Management was decent
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Retail sales rep
bad,Managers encourage certain employees to not do anything
bad,This is is ok for retail but kind of the same old same old. Where managment makes sure you are trying to force smartphones and mobile broadband on people.
bad,Management was not fair to employees. We were lied to about our benefits. Management set unrealistic goals for employees.
bad,"this was a typical call center environment, little growth seen."
bad,No work/ife balance. You work very long hours. Management is not open to new ideas or helping you to advance in your career. It's a short term opportunity unless you are a brown noiser.
bad,not a great place..bad attitude from managers not a nice office..hours of work and always be prepared to work both saturday and sunday
bad,friendly people good worke eviroment just was a permanent position. enjoyed working there.
bad,"- No process documentation any where"
bad,Overall my 18 years there was good. I had great opportunities there plenty of education. Great benefits for my family. Great school Benefits. Great technology company to work for if you want to be contented to information all the time.
bad,Never once felt psychologically safe at Verizon. Went so far as to tell my boss that and got nothing in response. How do you not respond to something like that? Management had low emotional intelligence and even worse ability to hold crucial conversations. Spent the better part of yep years working there in fear. Only wish I had left earlier
bad,"Don't take bereavement leave unless you are prepared to provide birth certificates to prove lineage of the deceased! Call center conditions caused heat strokes (3) due to summer heat! Air conditioning rarely works, nor does the ice machine. Great benefits but very little work life balance and frequently mandated overtime and scheduling is based on seniority. Be prepared to work a lot of 10 hour shifts as late as 11pm!"
bad,"Too many metrics to follow, and most customers purchase online.  Whole day pretty much doing customer service routine.  Overall a good place to get into sales but not a long term career."
bad,If you like being micromanaged this is the job for you  I myself do not like threats of discipline for something that is out of a persons control. The turnover is huge at this company.
bad,"Need to be there for employees when they express their discord."
bad,The benefits are great. But the quota is ridiculous at times. Management can be shady at times and advancement is based on who you know not your performance
bad,"Once your in not a lot of opportunity to advance or move around.  If you are not a network engineer on the wireless side or for that matter a part of the wireless (cell phone centric operations) you are at risk.  I noticed no real leadership as most are afraid to speak up.  Many ""kingdoms"" exist so you have to learn to navigate carefully.  All roads leads to NJ."
bad,"Hard work equals great pay. Industry is tough. Very fast paced high energy work environment. Culture is not warm or friendly. It is a stressful environment to work in. The benefits are outstanding: medical, dental, vision, life insurance and awesome 401K."
bad,"Was there 10 years until they decided to give severance to people who been there awhile to cut costs and pay new people less. New CEO as of Aug 2019 is NOT an ""employee advocate""...Just a ""bottom line"" guy. Stressful environment as of 5 years ago because of broken computer systems that never got fixed which impacted our stats, trainings not given on time about policies or new info which cause incorrect info to be given, bonuses lowered, leadership was a hit or miss in regards to knowledge and being able to lead, great feedback not taken seriously or ever implemented from the director on down. Increasing number of people using FMLA from the stress to ""escape"" from work - many people would be out the office as long as 6 months (including supervisors). Advancement based on likes, not skill most times. Most people stayed because they do have nice benefits."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"It was the ""Good Ole Caucasian Country Club"" executives who rarely had time to actually pay attention to how the middle-management treats their people..... being different is not a good thing at VZ!"
bad,"Good position for someone looking to get experience. However, what they say in the credo is not executed day to day.  Senior managers could care less about the individuals.  They encourage specialists to take advantage of customers in order to produce results.  The workplace is toxic and borderline unethical.  I wouldn't advise my family to go into a Verizon store because of this.  Benefits are good but good luck getting any type of support from managers as they don't care if you're sick or have a disability.  You're extremely expendable and there is no loyalty even if you sacrifice everything.   Targets are manipulated, and if you want promoted, you have to move around the country frequently."
bad,The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the sales. If you're not a good sales person or not good with customers I don't recommend this job. I learned a lot from this company and they do an amazing job at training events.
bad,"Lots of side amenities, good people, but consistently busy with issues and not the primary job.  In short there is no time to enjoy what is offered..."
bad,"Verizon offers thier employees great benefits, especially for new parents but I ran into so many issues with mistakes being made due to poor communication between departments because the company is so big. I've been charged for my (free) employee device that they essentially force you to have because they claim I purchased third party services, which I did not. It took months to take care of it even after I brought it to my manager's attention. Also, when I was on parental leave after having a baby it took them 5 weeks to pay me for the 6 weeks (after the 2 months of maternity leave) I requested and because of that I was late for the first time ever on my rent. I was considering suing the company at that moment. Management most of the time is horrible and micromanage you so much at most stores, over all verizon was not a good experience or environment for me."
bad,It was ok i didnt really like the job but i learned different things there such as inventory fixing problems and so fourth some of which these skills i took with me along my journey
bad,"Was a top employer in all areas until about 2013. The company's goal appears to make customer service obsolete. Benefits started to get cut @ 5 y.o. Pay increases became stagnant. Ppl who started in 2015 were making the same as people who started in 2006, ie, tenured reps got token raises of .05/hr. No job security"
bad,"I have worked in this company for 11 years and i understood the company well. As employee expectation we consider work on latest technology  , having big business and good salary but above all one thing every one take it first is JOB SECURITY here in Verizon  0% i can say 100%. If you not required they take just 10 mins maximum to sent you out of company. They will not  give any prior information or reason or time highly risky company. if you OK with that this is best company to work"
bad,This was a helpdesk setting and the training was horrible. They tried to bring people up to speed but if you don't catch on quick you will have a problem.
bad,"The company promotes work, life balance and this can be misleading. The total compensation is good, I advise anyone that's thinking about working at VZW to be a team player. The training and development is well thought out and supports the companies growth strategy. Follow leaders that truly work and exemplify integrity."
bad,The commission structure always changes for the companies favor and keeps slowly diminishing what it used to pay to the employees and then even at that you still have higher goals to hit as well. Its constantly changing and job security isnt a thing.
bad,culture is toxic and depressing.  leaderships seems out of touch with employees and only seem to care about shareholders.  used to be a fun place but no longer.
bad,"A typical day at work is productive, encountering problems & solving them. It can be fast paced but rewarding. Helping people to receive great service is very fulfilling"
bad,Would not refer to others. management was not always the best. Job/Work Life balance was good though. Not much room for advancement. I was also very unexperienced as an employee here.
bad,"Culture took a downward turn and the company would change stats to contradict one another and change policy without notice, customers would often call in about things changed by higher management and front line support were reprimanded for not giving the customer a great experience by the same people who had made the changes that the customer called in about in the first place."
bad,"Overall gave me an ulcer"
bad,"For many companies, adapting to change is part of surviving and at Verizon it's no different. Working at Verizon for almost 20 years, I've seen so many changes, although most are recycled ideas. For the last 8 years or so maybe longer there has been continuous layoffs, so if you don't mind working for a company where you have to worry about job security then Verizon isn't the place for you. It's all about the bottom line, you're just another number, easily replaceable, a place where it's about who you know that get's you promoted (seen this way too often, you know office politics). Verizon for the most part hasn't adapted to the new workforce employee, getting a flexible or work from home (for a day) is like tooth and nail. Now don't get me wrong, it's a good place to work short term to get on your resume but as a new employee, I can't see them wanting any part of this environment."
bad,Working at Verizon was very stressful in how you are to be degraded by customers on a daily basis and the management does not care how badly you are treated.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Verizon is in cost-saving, downsizing mode and it severely impacts one's ability to do their work. We have all the cheap versions of software and we're not empowered to effectively make sound business decisions. The work culture is too unprofessional and HR's absence is very conspicuous."
bad,It all depends on being with the right store with the best people. I have had many hardships but many triumphs as well. I feel integrity is key! When you are surrounded by people that don't share the same morale as you then this job becomes very challenging and that is where I am currently.
bad,"While I was there the cubicles were mostly empty and the campus was being renovated. Managers were mostly absent and not engaged. I did my work and got paid but then it abruptly ended, without warning."
bad,poor performance and employee dissatisfaction.turnover rate is high. some dropping out right after training in regards to being lied to about schedules.
bad,"While the pay and collaboration are well designed and encouraged, management is too erratic and lacks the maturity to steer development in one direction. They tend to use agile as a way to create too many proof-of-concepts without any actual roadmap or process. They focus on Buzz words and latest industry swings, which creates too many superfluous projects and products. Documentation is lacking clarity. Code is haphazardly added as AdHoc and frameworks are used like puzzles. Lots of inconsistency or then there is the other extreme of too much discussion on obvious mechanics."
bad,"Your sales are mostly based on what customer is in front of you.  Its a churn and burn sales environment.  Top sales people typically quit for lack of recognition.  Your monthly quota dictates your commission so you could sell more in one month but get paid less.  Used to have attainable quotas and commission plans but recently have been cutting costs by short-changing sales people.   If hired, negotiate the hourly salary.  They start every rep at different rates."
bad,Technically a fios installer. It is not an easy job. Coworkers hijack addresses that are easy to install. Managers are not to be trusted. They consistently lie. The Union is sometimes helpful. Avoid other coworkers and managers because everyone wants to know what you re doing to use it for their benefit. Such as easy installation jobs. As a technician you are a tool. Nothing more. Their is no advancement. Also management practices intimidation tactics. They have meetings on how to confuse workers as far as their entitlements. Also they have a quota on how many to suspend. Truly a hostile environment.
bad,"While Verizon is very generous with it's benefit packages, my experience is that in the recent past the company leadership lacks the ability to  rally behind and promote a single strategy.  This leads to conflicting priorities and difficulty implementing any particular initiative.  The new CEO may be addressing this moving forward"
bad,"I became an employee at Verizon via Indeed. I was not looking, the recruiter reached out to me. The best part of the job were the benefits and that was it. I learned that leadership is not a position or title but an innate ability and I learned that being in a position at Verizon is a means for revenge."
bad,"Verizon Telematics, now VerizonConnect,  was not a good place to work.  Worked all hours, on-call, and upper management in the end outsourced most of IT to offshore India support.  Not good for US based jobs or corp culture if your can suddenly find your job is no longer required and off loaded to off shore resources"
bad,Constant churn makes anxiety unbearable. Too many meetings vs. doing actual workload and there seems to be little/no focus or importance given to order releases.
bad,"Develop project plans. "
bad,A typical day at work in Verizon used to be easy going as long as you did your work and didn't get into any trouble. Now it's like working in what a totalitarian state would be like complete with cameras and spies. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management and the constant addition of unreasonable rules and regulations that only seem to be instituted only for the purpose of making our work life more uncomfortable and gives them more opportunities to punish those fail to keep up with them. The hardest part of the job is getting up in the morning knowing I that I have to spend the next eight or more hours on the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I'm walking out the door of the building in order to go home for the day.
bad,"A typical day entailed making outbound phone calls, scheduling appointments, meeting with clients, giving sales presentations, submitting proposals and updating the CRM."
bad,The culture at Verizon is one that focuses more on being politically correct than providing the best service to the customer/best employee experience. They refuse to fire dead weight out of fear of litigation and promote people based on ethnicity rather than skill. No career pathing opportunities and pay is terrible.
bad,This job comes with great pay and benefits but the morale is very low. There is also no longevity with the company anymore and the stress level is at an all time high.
bad,"The best part of this job is the pay, benefits and compensation package.  However there is little job security for management because there is a mass layoff about every 3-4 months"
bad,"As part of an Agile Release Train (ART) execute my role as a Scrum Master.  Not only do I understand and ensure my teams understand their role within the overall program.  Ensure my teams are delivering the expected benefits, enablers at all levels.  I love coaching my teams, so they learn from mistakes and successes.  Respect and embrace their cultural differences in a very actively exchange information about culture to better understand each other.  Take the time to learn about the people who work for me and with me.  Make sure to actively listen.  Making ceremonies as meaningful and fun as possible ensure the kind of participation required to make the team successful.  Pre-planning on the part of the Scrum Master is key to ensuring that meetings run efficiently."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"The only thing this company has to offer is it's strong benefits package.  The job itself is mentally draining, management heaps extremely high goals on you, and if you meet them, instead of recognition its, ""Here, now do this.""  I never felt less appreciated as an employee than I did working there.  The management was very cliquey and most assuredly played favorites, and if you were the favorite of one manager, depending on who your new manager may have become with a shift bid change, you'd certainly be least favorite by them.  I worked there for 3 years, and seriously by the time I left, I had been so worn down by the place, I was taking the stresses of work home with me."
bad,"Verizon's management is very poor, they don't know their own policies, and they can fire you for any small thing you do, they don't care about helping Representatives grow their careers"
bad,I have finished multiple degrees and certifications but the company does not reward current employees. They hire mostly external talent when promotions are available.
bad,"I just worked a contract in Verizon, so I don't know anything about the company. Seems like a decent enough company, and I can definitely take a contract there in future."
bad,"Lay offs are common, and work life balance is minimal. People say all the time that if the benefits were not so good people would have left a long time ago. Integrity is not at the core of all business decisions."
bad,I really have nothing to say about this company. they don't consider people with higher education for positions in management. Very stressful place to work.   No family and work balance.  They started taking away some benefits.
bad,"It is a highly driven numbers game, full of high expectations, and no discretion as long as you are pulling in a high volume of gross adds.  You are working holidays, nights, and weekends."
bad,"Verizon recruitment process is completely absurd. They've advertised for high technical positions only to have you work in a call center environment which is extremely regulated. "
bad,"Cutthroat environment hard to excel in, they care more about number than they do their employees. Hours are terrible for managers and must work as long as it takes to make numbers."
bad,"Company culture has undergone major changes in the past 5 - 7 years. The environment is no longer energetic or innovative. Frequent changes in senior leadership, an unclear strategic vision, and lack of communication prevailed over the past several years. The company began taking a reactive stance to market changes, and the business underwent several ""transformational initiatives"" resulting in major lay-offs across the company with employee morale and productivity plummeting."
bad,"The typical day at work was putting up with management who used and abused the employees (I was a union worker there).  I have learned this was NOT the right place to work for me because of the management.  They claim they value you but you feel unvalued all the time.  When you ask questions to the management, they will tell you it is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.  When I was told that once, I wound up punching the brick wall outside the building and wound up with a sore hand for the next few days.  The workplace culture is a nightmare.  We had to put up with deplorable working conditions, i.e., excessive overtime, working up to 12 straight days in a row without a break, working back-to-back hours such as a overnighter then be back the very same morning with only a 4-6 hour break.  There was nothing enjoyable about the job, so much that I refused any honors and awards given to me at the company because I was so resentful about it all.  I want nothing to do with Verizon EVER AGAIN!!!!!"
bad,Sales position in a nice retail store in Santa Barbara.  Helped customers through the decision making process by offering advice and answering questions.  Product knowledge was key in my ability to secure sales.
bad,Very changed company in the last 5 years. Social promotion is the norm and the color of your skin has become so important they are blinded to anyone's skills to better the company.
bad,The consumer sales and service department is extremely stressful and forceful. The company is beyond strict and it makes for a very cutthroat environment
bad,"Very Competitive"
bad,"productive but high stress, poor management without clear direction."
bad,This work environment is not good. Job safety is not there. Teams are still looking for direction. This is not a technology company. They are not sure what they want to do.
bad,"Eh, job is super stressful. Can be a pain in the behind to work there sometimes. Company is consolidating to so always be ready for that. Overall good pay but not worth the stress"
bad,"The training was not good at all and did not position you for actual phone calls. I would not work in a call enter again, mostly because the managers were not supportive when customers escalated calls."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"All the evils of a large corporation.  Stagnant ideology, unwillingness to adapt to change, management only concerned about their own careers.  Difficult to advance. However the pay is competitive and the benefits are good and the work is not terribly demanding."
bad,"good pay and benefits but job sucks!! you're on the phone all day talking to rude and some racist customers. work schedule changes every 6 month (bidding), so unless your are in the top rankings, you will get a schedule you don't work. You have to hit goals. management is young and doesn't have enough managerial skills. They are never available when you need them. They want you to sometimes lie to customers. We do all the hard work while management have off site activities (cookout, kickball, basketball games etc.) The pay is good but not worth the stress."
bad,Prefer not to comment because I was a contractor. the culture is different as a contractor.  You are not able to benefit on any of the company perks .
bad,"If you can hit the ground running on your own with little help you will do well. There is no job seciurity, pay and benefits are great but the culture is very bad here, everyone hates everyone else, nobody wants to help you, and there is no work life balance and they will tell you they don't care about your issues, job comes first."
bad,Middle management need to be qualified for what they do to be able to train and develop talents. Not trying to improve the way they work unlike what is being advertised.
bad,Verizon (and likely most other large carriers) are very dishonest in their representation of products and prices. I started in sales and consistently had sales goals raised to astronomical amounts. Accessories that customers did not want were presented as bundles with a phone purchase. Management would encourage consultants to lie about costs and exactly what customers were paying for. This is all to satisfy higher ups and their insatiable need for year over year growth. Turnover is incredibly high as most cannot survive the intense pressures of selling this way. Massive layoffs were a regular part of working for Verizon. I escaped one round to only be laid off six months later. Anyone not directly making money for the company is expendable.
bad,"Pays well.  Good benefits.  Great bonus.  That's about it.  Typical office politics.  A millenial haven.   Hard to succeed, too many obstacles.  It's amazing they turn a profit."
bad,Pushed through sales people that did well but had not experience and felt that there was only one way to sell.  We were a communication company but were required to go into an office every day and were treated like entry level representatives.  Great for someone who doesn't understand what an outside sales rep does on a daily basis but very poor for a mid level professional.
bad,"Aside from the benefits, Verizon leadership in my experience has been awful, and I've managed to survive 15 years. It's like sales goals are far stretched but ""do what you need to do"" on the back end to sell the product. I would say its almost like selling with integrity, but without it at the same time."
bad,"1. Nothing is ever good enough."
bad,"Typical sales job. Low pay, high stress, commissions are never worth it. Poor Management. Cut throat as sales persons try to out perform one another. Wouldn't recommend unless you love sales."
bad,Very poor sales management that did not appreciate my 16 years of effort to build a base of business customers nor did they appreciate the customer's patronage.  They felt I was satisfied with my base of customers who brought in my monthly quota so they preached new logo to me constantly and ultimately ran me off.
bad,overall could of been ran on a more professional setting. I was happy tha progress ive gain by working for this company. The relationship of working with such a huge company.
bad,"You are a cog in the machine. You will be trained thoroughly, but treated only according to your performance metrics that directly contradict each other. Past successes will not matter, numerous awards etc, only what can you sacrifice for them today.They have management problems."
bad,"Over  4 years ago when I started with the company it was a fun place to work. Now everything is focused on how much you can sell vs. good service, teaching customers self serve options (which causes some concern for job security) and pushing products in a really aggressive manor. Aside from some of those negatives, you really do get the chance to meet some great people, coworkers and customers alike. The hardest part of the job is feeling like no matter what you do it is never enough/good enough."
bad,"This job is commission based. You do get an hourly wage, but if you want to make any real money you need to sell. It can be lucrative, but people get aggressive over the sales and it makes for a very hostile work environment."
bad,"The people you work with as a team were amazing, but the management area lacked in many areas. They made promises they couldn't keep.  Salary was less than average."
bad,"My day at work consist of prepping for a successful day, assuring I'm on the floor welcoming my agents when they arrive. Holding my Team meeting to go over daily stats and how to improve those stats from the day before. Daily one on one coaching's, at least 5 a day to go over stats, review calls providing positive feedback and also constructive criticism to assure we are moving in the right direction as a business and as a team."
bad,Sales oriented to hit sale's goal if you want to get paid your comission. Definitely need to have great communication and people skills. Have knowledge on technology.
bad,Great place to work if okay with radically changing management and with it goes levels of professionalism.  Management rather threaten than coach employees.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Verizon is just an ok place to work for. The pay is low , high school like atmosphere you definitely need to know someone or be in a click if you want to move up in the city company in this rolling Meadows office"
bad,As a Customer Service Contact Sales Associate you are trained for 2 months and go-live with real customers at that point. Training is nothing like real life customer service calls. You are in a call center surrounded by many other teams of sales associates. As a Sales Associate you are required to be on the phone at all times unless on break.
bad,"It was a great company to work for at the beginning. Knowing everyday was something different but loved working with customers. Things change daily when dealing with technology. "
bad,"Pay wise, Verizon is great. Great benefits, provide discounts to their employees. But you are really just a number to them. They don't care about the well being of the employee, they are just interested in meeting their bottom line and their quotas. Yes, I know that is critical to the survival of any business but when you go to a meeting and hear that in Q1 of 2016 you made 22B in profit, up 2B from the year before but short of your 25B aspiration and told that you failed and you need to do better and work harder? Something is wrong with that picture. Also I used to work in Tech Support and most of my day was spent having calls dumped on me because my level one co workers did not want to utilize the tools that were provided to them to help fix customers issues. They were just content with discussing customer's bills and doing the bare minimum to achieve their numbers."
bad,"The daily work environment was poor. Monthly compensation was never correct, and continue to change months to benefit the company. You were forced to lie to the customer in the name of sales"
bad,A location with great possibilities. The project was understaffed and new managers with little management experience. They are trying to do too much with too few techs that have limited knowledge and outdated documentation. the management has very little knowledge of the procedures the techs perform.
bad,The culture is not what it used to be when I first became employed.  Change is needed from top down.  The management sometimes doesn't even speaking to you and will walk right pass you without saying good morning.  The culture has gotten worse.
bad,"typical East Coast company. Didn't take care employees. The pay is so-so. The benefit is okay. The managers are bad, and didn't know what is going on."
bad,"Good Salary and Benefits with Poor Management. Technical growth will be very less, unless you keep yourself updated. More Fun time especially if you are a fresher"
bad,Customer service and technical support have to sell and upgrade customers. Only inside and outside salespeople should sell. There's also a minimum call requirement which is hard to achieve when management views the call center as a one-stop shop. The job overall wasn't enjoyable due to the sales goals and call goals. Management is extremely strict.
bad,"Pay is good but the environment is toxic and stressful. I would not recommend Verizon Wireless call center jobs to anyone, not even my enemy. You have to work different shifts, holidays and weekends."
bad,bad management was the main reason most people did not like this job. peers would complain about management and the lack of interest they had. Typically wouldn't do much for their store but got compensated greatly.
bad,"A typical day at go90 consisted of pitch meetings, reading scripts, watching cuts of shows in production and giving notes. "
bad,"People steal your sales  which is called a FLIP. They disconnect what ever you installed and install something of their own. The service has to be on for a certain amount of time to br paid for it. We constantly get stuck with customer service and door to door salemans mess ups. Gpod pto, sick leave but thats just about it. My immediate manager is awesome. Systems are always glitching up and makes it hard to help the customers."
bad,"I might be biased but since I have a family I find the work life balance terrible. It didn't used to be that way, schedules used to be set for a month instead of sparatric and designed by a computer. Pay used to be great but now it's impossilbe to make good commission. Benifits are really good as far as medical dental vision 401k that stuff, so if you can get a job that isn't in the retail world it would be a great job. In the retail side of things it is terrible."
bad,Over the 19+ years layoffs have taken many of my coworkers and then myself with no warnings and almost never giving a chance to change jobs.  Many of the laid off seem to always be the older most senior personnel.
bad,"After Verizon acquired Verizon Wireless, the company became very different.  Downsizing is regularly done although the work load does not change.  Required to go to strike duty for 7 weeks in 2016."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"While working at Verizon, you are just another number to them and can be let go at any moment. No one is irreplaceable and the culture is awful. Promises are made for advancements, but are rarely kept. The rich get richer."
bad,"For this company to be able to fire an employee who has no occurences nor any write up's was completely ridiculous to me, one day someone will sue this place and honestly they will deserve it."
bad,"Originally Verizon Wireless took great care of employees. Over the past few years due to competitive industry Verizon has consistently raised targets and quotas to difficult to achieve levels.  The culture used to be one of ""We value the employee"" to one of ""We value the shareholders"".  "
bad,"Very Stressful & Inconsistent. The leadership does not care, you are a number. Felt like I was set up for failure, but was still very capable of making the stats, just treated poorly... workplace politics."
bad,"It was an honor to work for Verizon. Truly a learning experience.  I wish i can speak the same for their management from district managers (whom are mostly unqualified)  and also not only do they bully but always threaten their employees job security for results.To Regional Manager whom does not have a mind of his own.  I can only speak for A wireless in the North East Region( which has been sued and lost against former employees that were mistreated in the past) Verizon A Wireless is a Great Company, Terrible management. They will not see any improvement unless a drastic change is made in those positions. Until then they will keep letting seasoned reps go just to place unqualified bodies in positions they do not ready to be in just to show their power."
bad,"Simply put, the sales culture is not the greatest. Every sale is supposed to end with you ""getting something"" out of the customer, no matter what they came in for. You end up trying to force tablets on to the elderly, mobile hotspots to people who already have other alternatives, and expensive accessories to people who will never use  them. The people I worked with and most of the managers I worked for were great people that I still stay in touch with to this day. That was the best part about the job."
bad,"I would not recommend this place to work if it was the last way to make money on earth. While the training is good, the working conditions are not. Once you are on the floor, it is not easy to get support."
bad,"I loved my coworkers, however management micromanages employees, and favors others which leads to them getting higher sales. Nothing you do is ever good enough even if you are the top seller. Company is constantly changing the commission structure to make it appear better but inevitably hurts you also trying to get customers to buy online and pick up in store so the reps do all the work and do not get paid. The benefits are awesome and the overall pay is good, but you will pay for it in stress. Almost every person at my location was on antidepressants or anxiety meds."
bad,A typical day at work during slow times is a lot of sitting around if you are not motivated to make money. Management is hit or miss depending on who your manager is. The workplace culture is pretty laid back.
bad,"Company is trying to have employees do more work without higher compensation.  Layoffs are common in Network Depts, harrassment is a big area of concern for HR staff and conducts training on this subject constantly"
bad,You will have no where or time to spend what you e made because your always there.  No work/ personal life balance. Management is micromanaging and try to managing by intimidation. Definitely not like it used to be before became Verizon. 20 yr veteran and they treated awful!
bad,Great company that has a diverse culture. The facility also was in good shape. The lack of hands on training and coaching makes it easy to fail fast.
bad,Frontier doesn't really know how to run a company.  Need to put their money where it's going to make them money!!! I loved the company when it was GTE then it changed to Verizon and that was good as well.  Frontier bought several verizon territories and really didn't upgrade anything.  Technology is changing if you want to run with the big dogs then you need to have big dog services!!!
bad,"great experience, but the ethical nature and inner office politics are at another level than most jobs due to the nature of sales. many great salesmen/leaders."
bad,They act like they can demand a lot out of reps making minimum wage or a tad higher. as a manager that makes my job extremely hard. plus i have a district manager who all the sudden has turned into a psycho
bad,Challenging but rewarding work with business partners. Need to have the right upper IT management. IT Co-workers and business partners incredible people to work with.
bad,"short sighted management team"
bad,"Days started early and on time or you may be sent home for being a few minutes late. Staff were encouraged to use shady tactics such as changing plans without telling customers, sneaking products into their bill and other unseemly things to make commission. Disciplinary action for not making the high sales quotas is not unheard of."
bad,"Like with all company's, there are 2 set of rules, one for the call center and the other for the rest of the company. As long as your not in the call center, great place to work"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Difficult to advance. Promotions awarded based on relationships, not knowledge and expertise. Leadership lacks ownership."
bad,The job was great way to learn sales in a corporate retail location. The job is always changing so there is a emphasis on keeping up with the new trends among competitors
bad,you'll make money but have to do 60 hours a week so there is no time to live. great place to start and gain experience but definitely not the place for you if you have kids.
bad,"The pay and benefits are really awesome. However, management is awful. You have no job security. They demand a lot out of you and they DO NOT appreciate anything you do. If you're in it for the money then this is place to work. However, do not expect to welcomed with open arms because all of the management are rude and awful. Especially the ones in Camden, Tn and Paris, Tn. They are all about drama and out for themselves. I would NOT recommend working here. I saw a woman who had been there for 13 years and they completely screwed her over. Eventually causing her to quit. There is no loyalty here. I will again mention that the managers are AWFUL! Do not trust them. If they can, they will screw you over in a heartbeat."
bad,There is no such thing as work/life balance at Verizon.  Everyone is overworked & leadership is extremely demanding.  I would not work here for a million dollars per year.
bad,"Not a place to work if you are a self starter and have a strong work ethic. "
bad,"Very demanding Job for the salary they paid, also there is no stability on the schedules is like a roller coaster, you can't set long terms goals since your schedule is changing without any sense."
bad,"The company touts training, however direct management balks at paying for it and taking the time away from immediate duties to accomplish training."
bad,A typical day at work was spent being micro-managed and being given unrealistic goals.  No job security and was a stressful job
bad,Numerous layoffs - untrained management - would not recommend environment built around survival of layoffs.  would not recommend
bad,Verizon is okay but the schedules are not great if you are new. The pay is not worth the stress. I would not recommend unless you need a job. Coworkers are nice so that makes your day go by a little faster.
bad,"I have worked in retail my entire life so I had heard about Verizon and that it could be an awesome career. At first it was a blast selling a bunch and being rewarded with good commission checks! But after 6 months or so all of the quotas kept getting raised every month. Within a year they had nearly doubled so you had to sell twice as much to make the same money, on top of that the companies focus on tablets is insane, it was pushed so hard that if an elderly couple that had prepaid basic flip phones came in their once a year to put money on the phone you were expected to sell each of them a tablet on contract even if they could not afford the bill. Another example would be the focus on accessories. Cases, screen protectors, speakers, ect. The quota attainment goal is $120, what that means is if you go into Verizon for a new phone, they are expected to sell you the phone, plan and an additional $120 per phone you purchase including tablets! I found that just crazy, in order to hit those goals we had to tell people there trade in phones were only good for in store merchandise which was a bold face lie. I couldn't do it anymore. After multiple examples like that and being reamed by management I could no longer work for them. I believe myself to be an ethical sales professional and the only way to get large checks and move into management is to be the typical 'car salesman' where you tell some but not all of the truth... If you can be that type of sales person you have the ability to make up to 75,000 a year as a sales rep. If not then don't plan on  being there more then a year...."
bad,"Most of the jobs are being off shored. There is no job security at all. Pay is decent though. And if you get a good supervisor, they will work with you on what shift you want."
bad,The time I spent at Wireless Depot was a slow type of day and that is why I am locating a new position. Location location location
bad,"Company was once a very supportive and exceptional place to work. The past few years, lots of jobs are moving to India and Dominican Republic. Those individuals left in the US are highly overworked and stressed."
bad,"I worked there for 5 years.  I was fortunate enough to have seen the inner workings of the top executives and the systems set in place for promotions.  Most people there are secure if they know someone and don't have any true talent, are just protected.  The people that work the hardest and prove themselves, are worked even harder to the point of burnout.  The stuff that kept me there were the great benefits, tuition assistance, pride in being part of company everyone has heard of and significant discounts in wireless service."
bad,The culture is very appealing to busy bodies. Most people are friendly but will talk about you behind you back. I could only stay two months. There was pressure to maintain a high customer approval rating which was a good thing. It pushed you to do your best. The best was often not up to my standards of customer service. Agents often had no real power to retain customers. Problems took too long to get solved. Nothing should take 4-5 months for resolution. We were told to say things to the customer and make promises that were just not going to occur. I experienced sleepless nights and stomach issues due my conscience being bothered.
bad,No funding to improve quality of tools. Management poorly structured. You are just a number to them. You will never know when your last day will be.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,The job is great for those fresh out of college who need skills. It is a retail position and it has all the negatives that come along with that. Work life balance was poor and compensation changed wildly depending on the month and changes to the commission structure. They will tell you that you can advance to any position in the company in a year this is not true. You can advance to assistant management in a year but often the compensation is worse there and the already bad work life balance becomes non-existent. There is no guarantee for advancement after this.
bad,"Working here is great, work is time consuming, very little time for family. Security is good, but not great. Do your research"
bad,"I worked  for verizon for a year. The one thing I saw over and over was management simply does NOT care about anyone but themselves and their numbers. The team was great, the job was fun. But they always asked more from you and never wanted to pay you for it. My G.M was so vindictive and self centered on top of just flat out lying to my face about mutiple things. I complaint to HR and his boss but it just fell of deft ears. After they told me to ""fix it"" and my job is to do ""whatever I say"" I had enough. For a military friendly company, I never saw room for growth or even they back pay for my military time I am still fighting for. If you want a place that thinks your just a tool to help make them more money and make you feel over worked and under paid then this is the place. If you need good benifits for a short time you would be happy here.I wouldn't make this a career, and my whole team felt the same way."
bad,"In reality, I didn't mind it but competing against your own company via the internet is a joke.  Instant rebates via online and not in store simply stunk.  And also everyday there was a customer with a problem of some sort that seemed to be the end of the world to them, and in some cases i can understand that."
bad,"In many ways this has been the best job in my life. The benefits and monetary compensation are incredible. However, the greed of this company is absolutely deplorable."
bad,"Hardest parts of the job:"
bad,Alltel was purchased by Verizon. We went through a grueling process for a couple years with transitions process and just trying to hang on until our call center closed in 2011 in order to obtain severance pay. High performing reps were able to transition to Verizon. On the other hand leadership had to apply and interview. Competition was stiff. Along with Verizon hiring management only taking those in leadership puffed up by their managers.
bad,"A typical day at work to say the least was just simply monotonous. You were tied to a desk eight hours a day with no excuses accepted for being away from your desk, being late to or from break and your break and lunch schedule is dictated to you as if you were a child."
bad,"I worked as a sst for many years in several different locations and the turf team leaders(managers) had their hands tied. They all meant well but were totally controlled by the purse strings of corporate America. Enough time wasn't given to fix the trouble the customer had, you were allowed 2 hours then somebody else had to pick it up and start over from point A. Benefits were good but with a company making 14 billion dollars a year and a CEO making 21million  I think that a new contract should not be an issue the money should go back to the employees , first  and second level managers and union members who are out with the customers in all types of weather not sitting in an office drinking coffee. The most hardest part of the job was keeping up with the changes made bu management to do the job they knew nothing about"
bad,Verizon is heavily dependent on what team you end up on. A majority of teams are under high pressure projects with past due deadlines that creates a very cut throat and divided environment.
bad,"Job is very demanding with long hours. I have learned a lot in the short time I have been here."
bad,Xerox started off a great place to work until..... they broke a promise that made when I first got hired I told her that I am in school and I don't get done with class until 2 and they said okay I can come in at 3 and work until 11 and mind you that the job is 45 min's away from home and school and then they changed my schedule  to 2-11 and I would have to leave class early skip it or be late to work then I didn't like the pay system it would fluctuate  daily based on your call time and the survey score and they would take to long to get pay checks right and they would short hours and I felt like that was a you only do for them type of business they want you to be top notch and they cant be top notch to you
bad,Typical day at work would be doing opening duties counting the merchandise. Attending the customers either for bill pays or setting up for a upgrade. On our down time will do some call backs or go around the store cleaning.
bad,"Whilst employed with Verizon Wireless, I gained a solid professional foundation that has assisted me with obtaining other career opportunities. "
bad,"First off - this companies training program is a joke. Waste of time and money. Secondly, they offer great benefits but if you do EVERYTHING right and get the proper paperwork in before time - which you almost never do. Thirdly, Verizon could care less about their customers. They are far more worried about making the daily numbers, which don't allow you to really take care of anyone because you're too worried about not making any money at all if you don't make their bill any higher than it already is. Our District Manager gives no pat on the backs or congratulations for high achievement - we always have to do better FOR HIM... when we lack its our fault, when we do great its because of him. Would never want to work for a guy like that. As an employee, you have to BUY THE ITEM first to demo it for your customer. What a joke...."
bad,It is a large company that doesn't listen to the employees. Managers think they know everything and they always have a power trip.
bad,Unless you know somebody you will never get anywhere here. Its all about management hiring their friends and promoting them. Your effort and results get you nowhere.
bad,"Lots of internal politics that bleed down from upper management to lower management to developers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Great co-workers. Learned something new almost everyday. Enjoyed helping customers.
bad,"A company that will promise the world and give you coal in your stocking. Verizon preaches integrity, however that is so far from the truth. When you walk in you instantly get taken into office and are spoke down to about your sales numbers no matter how good or bad. Showing no compassion or empathy in any aspect. Has attitude of extreme cockiness and arrogance. Management is purely done based on how well you brown nose not based on abilities, New employees get promoted only 6 months on job while seasoned veterans of 10+ years are never to be looked at due to not sucking up. Hardest part of job is dealing with corporate policies changing by the minute and having absolutely no work life balance. If not for the people this job would not be worth it at all."
bad,Great place to work for a person with no family or spouse. I learn a lot of customer service ideas. Some of the management staff was very helpful as far teaching and reliability in escalations and sharing knowledge
bad,"As a sales rep you are responsible of hitting 6 different sales matrices to raise your commission. They also claim this is they way to success, yet the people that do get promoted are the ones management like, not the ones that are performing. I saw countless co workers lose promotions to people that were performing at a lower standard but were really good at kissing butt. Because those people got there by kissing butt, they in turn expect those they are now in charge of to kiss their butts. Management only cares about themselves and will gladly throw employees under the bus to make themselves look good. Most coworkers only dealt with it because the money can be good. Your entire day is spent mostly fixing phones and if you don't show that person every little thing they could buy management will scold you for 20 minutes, that's 20 minutes you are off the sales floor."
bad,trying hardest to leave. need more positive company to work for.
bad,"Management is just out to watch out for them, no more career development and sales goals and quotas make it impossible to enjoy days off due to missing sales opportunities.  Too much favoritism."
bad,"I was hired as a part-time employee with part-time benefits but worked an average of 45 hours a week the whole time I was with the company. "
bad,I would not recommend the company to anyone. The morale is low and they don't acknowledge employee concerns that would benefit the business.
bad,It can be tedious due to the constant changes due to chat's with customer service would wish for a job more with a standard work limit where you just did one thing customer service isn't a job for anyone unless they have no trouble with traveling to work or no prior engagements in real life in personnel time. They will mark you for anything like days off and weekends as normal but they check every minute while your off the job and on it for any leave of medical reasons not much care to show it will still make you lose pay even if the injury is work related. also benefits to be had from working not much considering you don't get over time also you will have to keep a impossible statistics for scoring for any increased pay which anything can factor in making it impossible.
bad,Verizon is built to succeed regardless of your background. Their down fall is the pressure that DM and above puts on the local store managers. There is never anything positive said to the management team or staff of the locations. The only thing they are worried about are numbers and trying to beat AT&T. If this company would put more infuses on their employees and let the managers do their jobs they would be #1
bad,"Arrived at work, put my head phones on and handled up to 1200 411 calls per night."
bad,"I have no real opinion, other than they will work you to the bone, than one small mistake is unforgiveable"
bad,"I have been in the wireless industry for almost 6 years now, getting burnt out after doing it for so long. The long hours, getting home at 10:30 at night all the time, i need a change and something that is more consistent with its schedule but I can still support a family with. I have alot of skills I bring to the table, looking for a company that will let me use those skills and look out for their employees over themselves. My job now is asking us to do 50 things at the same time for half the pay of what we are used to. Just need a change for my family and for myself to enjoy life a little more."
bad,"There has been a lot of discussion about this for quite some time amongst co-workers; the company has entirely sold its soul to corporate greed on the backs of its employees.  External auditors were hired to examine productivity and efficiency, and as a result, many corporate centers have been closed and positions eliminated.  No one feels safe.  Job demand and expectations have gotten out of control.  Every single employee has some sort of sales quota in some regard.  Starting pay has been cut quite a bit.  The majority of us eat, sleep, breathe and obsess our jobs.  We literally work ourselves into hospitals, psychiatric wards, and other conditions, then are left to wonder whether or not Verizon Wireless will decide to allow Metlife to approve our disability claim so that we will have a job to come back to, or if Verizon will decide to tell Metlife to deny it and do away with us.  Those of us with the most tenure seem to be at the highest risk.  On the upside, the monetary compensation is quite impressive, as is the paid time off allotment.  Many of us grow to be very close, and some departments almost have a familial dynamic amongst co-workers.  Also, I now know what true survivalism feels like.  Living just for your job, and praying each day that you're not next on the chopping block and doing whatever it takes to get through each day.  I never knew that before."
bad,"Can make money , sometimes you walk a gray line in order to meet all the demanding quotas."
bad,You basically sacrifice everything in your life for this job. You schedule is very random and getting time off is very difficult. Negativity is what your surrounded by from both customers and management. No matter how hard you try your best is never enough in the eyes of verizon. 
bad,"Very difficult and biased atmosphere.  Not family friendly, very regimented and inflexible.  They are a company which views its employees as numbers and doesn't care much about much else.  Not for the faint of heart. :)"
bad,suppose to be one of the top companies for working moms yeah right hope your kids dont get sick and you have to miss work they expect you to be there no matter what and the management has no consideration for families with young children and dont realize emergencies do happen and your children do come first
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,It's a very high stress level environment very hard to explain.
bad,i was having an opportunity for working on HTML 5 which opened the doors for achieving browser Independence.
bad,"90% of Management; Lazy, hypocritical, and will ride their high horse."
bad,The people are great but management is all Legacy (either MCI Worldcom or GTE) have to know someone very well to keep moving up or getting RIF'd.
bad,"its a great place to learn new things, but far as moving up in postions, no. i stayed in cust serv b/c is was safe. they want you to become a sales rep, but if you dont make quota, you go bye bye"
bad,"A typical day included waiting for customers to come in so that you could try and convince them to buy a new phone. Then you would teach them how to use said phone, or sign them up for workshops so they can take a class on their new phone. I learned a lot about different brands of phones and operating systems. Management is different at each store but at the store I worked for management was deplorable. The store manager didn't do anything except try and embarrass you in front of as many people as possible and out of 3 assistant managers 2 have no clue what they're doing. It's a mess. My coworkers were great for the most part, It was very much a cliquey environment. The hardest part of the job was explaining to customers how to use their phone while it was also the most enjoyable, this was difficult because at times you would be met with quite a bit of resistance."
bad,Would go over accounts companies had with cell phones. Update accounts where needed.
bad,Working for a corporate store sales are king. It is a very stressful environment.
bad,Unless you are Store manager or ASM then I would not recommend. Management is horrible to work under and the pay is not good. I under good faith couldn’t recommend them.
bad,"I learn alot at Vzw, but you are a number. Time management is a must.  Very stressful with hateful customers that vzw made. If your not on medication when you start you will be. They make you think there is no job outside of them. Leaving after 7 years was the best thing I did. Their are some great co-workers and some not so great."
bad,Lack of mobility when I was there. Lots of politics to move up. Management was not helpful with getting jobs outside your department. i don't recommend the call center positions due to this being very dead end job for most.
bad,"I'm not going to bash on the full company, that's not my end goal. The location I worked at was very tasking and asking for so much but doesn't offer anything in return. The managers always pick favorite, don't listen to their employees opinions, and there's no way to more up the company ladder. Again this all depends on the location."
bad,"I had management tell me they don’t care if I’ve actually fixed a problem , as long as I sell and the customer liked me. It’s a tech support job. If I don’t fix the problem, they’re just going to call back or pay for a technician"
bad,"meager training, badgering on any and all mistakes. almost impossible stats to achieve. Typical 3rd party call center. long term career is not normally an option"
bad,"Management sucked due to the amount of customers that weren’t satisfied with Verizon’s policies and guidelines, and customers are really rude, and difficult."
bad,"Sups are just reps that got promotions. They are childish and not all, but some don’t care at all about their reps. HR is a joke. I can do their job smh."
bad,Cool side job shouldn't be dependent on as primary source of income. Located in Weldon springs it's a travel especially if you don't own your transportation.
bad,You get a set schedule based on your skills. You are screamed at by the customers all day every day. You have no managerial support. Most times they are wrapped up in meetings or just missing in action. It's soul-sucking work.
bad,"Let go for not following authentication procedures. Asked a manager about the situation while it happened. I was let go, but it was a great place to work Part-Time."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"I borrowed this from someone else.  This company is changing quickly and not in a good direction.   In short, fantastic benefits but read below."
bad,"It was a great place to work for quite a while, until basically the entire regional leadership team rolled over. Then it just became about fleecing the customers and fast-food style selling.  It's a shame."
bad,"After 22 years of hard work and dedication, they rebadge you to an offshore company that will fire you immediately after you start so Verizon doesn't shell out any out of pocket expenses to eliminate an employee."
bad,Poor leadership. They are comfortable asking you to compromise your integrity. Nothing is ever what was told to you. They lie on a consistent basis and say just be adaptable to change.
bad,"I learned this job requires a great deal of physical energy, having to walk and talk almost the entire day. However, if you are really good in your social life, this job should be a walk in the park for some people. And because the work environment is so collaborative, everyone gets to know everyone else, even having team night once a week just to forget about work for the night. Overall, this job is very tiring from the walking but in the end you learn a great deal of information about the company and hundreds of customers you encounter throughout your employment."
bad,"The benefits are great, and what kept me there. It’s a call center, so you have your good days & bad, just as you have good customers/calls and bad. The problem is, when you care too much about your customers and you do everything you can to help them. It will destroy your metrics because you are not taking enough calls and are on the phone too long (not to mention getting harped at for too many outgoing calls).  Management is rarely around when you need them, so get to know buddy sups and other floor sups..."
bad,Almost every customer you speak to is upset over billing or data. You have no power to apply credits.Supervisors refuse to speak to customer even when they are requesting one which makes them even more upset. Your performance is an automated call back to a mad customer to pick 1-5 based based on their experience if a customer is mad no matter how nice you personally were to them if they did not get what they wanted they're going to rate you bad and your job depends on those ratings very unfair practice
bad,"I worked at Verizon for a year as a 1099. I didn't have much interface with Verizon proper, just the company I worked for that was contracted to run operations for Verizon's new state-of-the-art network. That being said:"
bad,Dress code used to be great. Commission structure was good before. They changed the structure. Much harder to make big commission checks. That's why I am on here looking
bad,Questionable business activities in the last 2.5 years. The focus has turned away from the customer to pure profit needs. They have strategically pushed tenured employees out the door and will turn a blind eye to unethical business practices.
bad,"Wouldn't try and build a life career here. MGMT makes favorites and only those favorites get promoted. You can be top sales person and if you don't play the game right you won't be considered for a promotion, especially if you are a woman.  Very sexist company."
bad,Too many transformations and management layoffs to provide a good framework for teamwork and advancement.  I have seen whole floors at HQ wiped out without any warning.
bad,I would not for the life of me go back. however if you can work there long term it is very rewarding. compensation is good and management is usually well trained.
bad,"Management doesn't care about you in the least bit and will make no secret of the fact that they'd love to fire all of you to be replaced with cheap, overseas contractors. Literally the worst kind of company you could work for."
bad,Morale was low at this data center despite employees getting good reviews.  Employees were always worried about job cuts that would happen at least once a year sometimes more often. .
bad,"No training on job responsibilities. Needed to acquire on own time. Management switches about once per year. New boss unfamiliar with job causing confusion and unnecessary delays in work completion. Not enough time, tools or parts to keep up with work making for stressful environment. Union causes as many problems and stress as management. Hardest part was getting through many company and union roadblocks to make progress on projects. The enjoyable and challenging part was taking a poorly designed project and using my technical skills to re-engineer and complete it so it worked as the customer wanted it to."
bad,"Great company ruined by office/corporate politics. Hard to move anywhere on merit unless you're in sales. (Spoken as someone who was both a successful sales rep and served in a corporate role). Lots of talk about the credo, but especially in the corporate office it's just words on a page."
bad,They portray themselves as a peoples company but work you to the bone. the work life balance is non existent. They always want more even when you're the best in the business. I lost hair and had trouble having any time for myself and was told that that's the job.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Stressful environment. Regular layoffs. Work is good - but not in demand in computer industry. Trouble finding job once you leave Verizon. No work from home.
bad,"I was at Verizon for many years and my group switched between organizations several times.  There is a lot of variation based on your organization/management.  For many years it was great, but my last 2 years were not nearly as good due to poor managers.  The work was interesting but there was lots of uncertainty dues to organizational changes."
bad,"Good place to work but not a lot of room for growth"
bad,"Management sucks and didn't really care about the customers. It was fun and rewarding when working with your close friends. "
bad,It is a fast paced environment and requires fast thinking and a patient soul. It requires patience and an active mind as well as negotiation skills. You have to maintain a positive attitude.
bad,Not secure about future with company makes for a very stressful environment.  Your concession equipment must be on your person regardless of time off.
bad,"Unless you were willing to sell things to customers that they didn’t need or want you would not ever be considered for advancement, period! Pushy sales practices were promoted!"
bad,We were watched more than pre school kids. We were timed on everything including going to the bathroom and told to multitask beyond imagination. It became unbearable.
bad,must be careful not to disclose everything if you actually want to make money. management encourages work arounds to close sales even though it is not in best interest of customer. shady reps get all the recognition while good reps get stuck dealing with all of their issues when the customers come back unhappy
bad,"Horrible work environment, pushy sales tactics, unscrupulous sales tactics, unorganized, bad work culture. Over worked underpaid, they skip over great employees and let the bad employees work there forever."
bad,"Lots of smart people. "
bad,Filled a need at one time to raze my son. There is no more advancement any more. Need to move a head to some thing new and too better myself as a person.
bad,Verizon Fios is a good product by management has a lack of vision and is stuck in an archaic business philosophy. Verizon does not train its employees on the latest technology and is afraid of change.
bad,"The money was enjoyable at first, and having metrics and goals to strive for each month was highly motivating. The pressure to use dishonest tactics was very high. Managers micromanaged and monitor employee's every move. During the time Wells Fargo was having a lot of problems with customer service, the things I heard about working for that company were very similar at Verizon."
bad,"Verizon is not a good environment if you are a dynamic, innovative kind of person who wants to move products forward in the best interest of the user. "
bad,"sales and service position  stressful, constant monitoring to bring up sales numbers.  treated employees poorly, and customers worse.  the positive side is the job offered great benefits and pay.  always had mandatory overtime."
bad,"The culture under Lowell MacAdams was definitely work people hard, promote the office suck-up, and terminate as many people as possible to cut costs monthly.  Hopefully this mindset will change under the new CEO."
bad,Days are typically conference calls and emails.  Pay and benefits are good.  Management was inconsistent in my last few years which created some frustration
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Just not a good fit for me. Completed the training and did not feel prepared for any of the calls incoming. People were impatient and rude and it felt like drowning everyday coming to work.
bad,"I was given the opportunity to excel at mentorship and participate in focus groups, however on a whole the company did not treat their employees very well."
bad,Our company did Verizon dirty sales jobs. I didn't actually work for the company. We were poorly paid and had no benefits. It was mainly a sales job and we were sharks and had to make the sales to make money and keep our jobs.
bad,I worked in a call center they told ya wouldn’t close but it did because the company decided to go another direction. Also don’t bother trying to use the open door policy it’s not something that’s respected. If you’re looking for a career where you’re challenged because information is always changing and you’re not told then Verizon Wireless is for you.
bad,"Long work hours"
bad,The overall work metrics seemed impossible to meet due to poor management and improper training. The trainings that were scheduled were scheduled after a new product or policy rolled out.
bad,No support from management.  Extremely competitive and cut throat. Wages are not balanced with cost of living in area. I would not recommend any to work there.
bad,Verizon has went from being a company proud of their employees and working to keep jobs to a company that is more worried stock holder revenues.  They take credit and gloat that stock holders know of company directions and decisions than employees.  #1 is not in it for the company but for the money. :-|
bad,There are chemical engineers and extremely experienced Network admins stuck in entry level tier 1 positions for years. They have people in the positions above that lack education and/or experience but leave the qualified people at the bottom. They simply are not capable of properly placing people in the positions they are qualified for.
bad,I learned a lot about attention to detail but truly as a company they do not care about their people they are just numbers that replaced but other numbers.
bad,"10 weeks out of the year you'll be working six 12 hour+ days in a row. God forbid you need a certain day off or you'll work THIRTEEN 12 hour days in a row like me, then get fired without being given a reason."
bad,Reduction in force of very high skilled talented personnel. Management lack professionalism and fairness.  Zero tolerance policy is not enforced by Human Resources.
bad,"Seemed like everyone was a contractor. I went 30 months with no advancement. I started as a ""Video production specialist"" Which was completely false. All I did was QA."
bad,"Culture is not the best, the company seems directionless.  Management is not merit based but political.  The sales environment is not the best and benefit are just okay.  Pay for sales is low"
bad,needs improvement of getting rid of the old and bringing in the new. what is a director at Verizon is not even management quality outside of Verizon wireless.
bad,"Part of the enjoyment of working with Verizon in the past that it was always evolving and creative with new solutions. In terms of the culture, Verizon was very strong in keeping employees happy. There use to be amazing Holiday arrangement for employees and their families."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,You are just a number.  
bad,"Constant onslaught of rude customers and less that supportive management staff. They mostly stood around shooting the breeze while we took all the cannon fire."
bad,Though   Verizon wasn't the worst place to work it definitely wasn't the best. The culture was cut throat and they constantly tried to violate local employment laws with making people attend mandatory meetings that was always information that could've been emailed.  They constantly tried to instill fear about unionization  but supplying false information about the communications union.
bad,"Life is simply TOO SHORT to work for Largely Uneducated Management Types who are Trained to Manage their employees by FEAR."
bad,"If all you are concerned about is money, then VZW is the place for you. managers and employees are ruthless and prioritize enriching themselves over helping customers needs. reminiscent of the recent Wells Fargo scandal."
bad,"I didn't get the correct training in the first three weeks of being there, work alone and hope you know all the answers to the customers cause it was hard to get ahold of a supervisor."
bad,"I retired from Verizon over 11 years ago, so I am not aware of how the conditions there are now. I do know that we were forced to strike on several occasions to obtain and/or keep benefits that we had."
bad,"I worked at Verizon as a manager for 15 years.  The company and industry has undergone a lot of changes during that time, driven by technology.  "
bad,"Not a fun job, people fired often, I left before the ship went down. I always worked over 8 hours a day and often found myself opening alone and then being a lone with a room full of customers for the next sometimes 3 hours. Again, this is not a corporate verizon but an authorized retailer. Like the same stores in the little towns between the big ones."
bad,"Verizon has been on a tough road and will continue to remain on it.  The Internet competition is outpacing Verizon's ability to build and launch application services, and their networks are extremely expensive to manage and operating, so profitability is down year over year.  Although Senior Management is attempting to steer the ship in the right direction, the politics and priorities of middle and line management seems to derail any progress."
bad,"The company was great for training. The trainers are good trainers, the environment in was nothing like on the floor. The managers where not happy about their jobs, No one wanted to go out their way to make the call center great."
bad,The management would treat tou. Diffetent nd would give you little hours their work system consit of favortism and made it very uncomfterable to work and people were constantly stealing stuff and blaming anybody
bad,"Contradicting rules and practices."
bad,A typical day at Verizon Wireless includes coming into the office at 8:00am.  It is important to work by the Verizon credo and work with integrity.  Hard work is often rewarded by competitive wages and short term incentives.  You must take full responsibility to complete your work with accuracy providing a positive customer experience. I often worked past 5:00 pm to ensure I have completed all assigned work and met customer requirements.
bad,"When I was allowed to do my job ethically and correctly, it was good place to work. However, I felt those times were few and far between. Again, it was a good paying job, but I would pick ethical business practices over money every time. I was released after many years with the company due to my job being eliminated, was given a reasonable severance that I am very thankful for, but loyalty and tenure doesn't seem to matter to companies these days. That's sad."
bad,"Close cliques. One can work hard, have good credentials  and do good work but promotions are often filled according to who you know (relative, friend in the company)."
bad,It's all about politics and the management is very passive aggressive. Don't expect to move up quickly and work every weekend. Have prior sales experience or you won't succeed.
bad,It was a good experience but was a stress full affair. Verizon is an ok company to work for. There is a lot of pressure created and delivery under ireasonable time line
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Great benefits but you will need them - a very negative place to work- when you start off with your team you are put on a warning right away and you have to prove yourself to get off the warning - Not a very happy place to work.
bad,"Very rigid environment, you will not leave your desk and if there is too long a pause between calls they will ask why. The calls that come in are sorted and specific people receive the sales calls while the unhappy customer calls are relegated to the rest of the crew."
bad,The reductions in the workforce/lay-offs that occur on a monthly basis as well as the constant management changes have led to a business community that is literally always afraid of losing their jobs at every level and in every position. This is not only counterproductive to the work environment but creates even greater workplace politics.
bad,"Verizon was a very well organized and well managed company.  Unfortunately after the sale to Frontier, communication, investment in systems and processes all began to suffer.  As a result the company suffered from a customer service and performance perspective and thus lay-offs and budget cuts followed."
bad,"A decent place to work, people are afraid of new ideas and innovation due to job security and there is not much advancement opportunity."
bad,"Assisted with customers for account maintenance, Customer billing inquires and resolving, Senior handler for escalated customers, Assist with resourcing and training new hires, Customer call backs for consumer fulfillment of requests, Did price plan analysis to satisfy consumer needs, Equipment sales and some commission based sales and incentives and had advanced training in technical support for troubleshooting phone and the network."
bad,"It was a very stressful job. Most people I knew were very unhappy. Lots of vacation but hard to take it, due to service levels."
bad,"Good money but work life balance leaved a lot to be desired."
bad,Its a great company to work for if you like making money. No so great for family's I was one of the best they had and it wasn't good enough. So I will  say not the best company to work for.
bad,"Great pay and benefits but they lay people off EVERY year, then hire others."
bad,"Im not a fan of this company. When I first started working there, the office was full of excitement and energy. They played games and gave away prizes to keep everyone excited. Slowly but surely that all went away. They also took away the Security and cars were being broken into constantly. We started getting poor contracts and still had to maintain a daily call average. Management was horrible! I reported one to the ethics committee because of racist comments and that person was eventually fired. A lot of the managers used bullying tactics with the employees. Because of the location, jobs weren't easy to come by but they finally offered a buyout at the right time and I couldnt get out of there fast enough!"
bad,"used to be a great company to work for."
bad,In my experience ive always been a contract to the Verizon account. I have had many good experiences but the customer and Verizon leadership can be very unreasonable and difficult to work with at times.
bad,"Too much stress and expectations from management, upper management wanted more from 1st level managers and didnt care about our work/balance"
bad,potential for growth in sales dept. and wireless retail stores temp to hire positions and contacted good benefits for full-time permanent employees salaried and commission.
bad,"Over the years technology has changed and so has the telephone industry. Verizon has the best Voice, Data, and Video product called FiOS. My co-workers are great but management could stand to improve greatly."
bad,"Verizon is a good company to work for when while you're young. When it's time to settle down and have a family, Verizon does not allow for any family life balance. The hours are extremely long. Commission structure is good and money is great but it is an exhausting job."
bad,"Many changes within Verizon.  Needed alignment between senior management, company's vision and employees."
bad,Too many promises with little results. The attitude was less than accommodating. Building was in a health crisis when the air conditioning went out and it was 85 degrees to work in.
bad,"I worked for AWireless, a premium retailer for Verizon and from day one felt like I had a target on my back. Expected to hit unrealistic metrics based on that month for the previous year. They raise the amount of sales by 30% from the previous year so for example if the store sold 100 phones in March 2015 they expect 130 March 2016. You have to sell atleast 3 overpriced accessories with everything even customers who come in simply to pay a bill. I knew most of my customers from growing up in the community and they still wouldn't buy any accessories or add-ons because of Amazon or eBay offered them near 50% off what we had them priced as. If you work a full day open to close by yourself you can't close the store for even 30 minutes to take a lunch they make you stay for 11 hours straight. No help from management when you ask questions or need help improving numbers. To top off the whole experience I was only making $8 an hour as a full time sales rep"
bad,"Verizon Wireless premature closing, displacing hundreds of employees was devastating for many. Fortunately there were provisions set aside."
bad,"Typical day started in the late afternoon or a full day on the weekends.  I took this job to help supplement my income as I was developing my business with Telecom National."
bad,"A job at Verizon is very demanding, with multiple projects thrown at you.  Everything is critical and needed yesterday.  There are a lot of unnecessary fire drills that are created so that executives can look good for their boss.  Needless to say, it is a stressful environment.  "
bad,I have been with the company for 4 years won numerous awards for metrics and still can't advance because of favortism to others.
bad,I learned a lot. It was an experience. nothing more to say. Each person has their own experiences and I have had mine. Thank the time. All the best who venture in to this environment.
bad,I think when Verizon decides where it wants it's future to lie then it will become a better company to work for. They're in the middle of deciding whether to stay in telecom or convert into a tech company
bad,It was an ok job. Very long work hour and they did not work with my school schedule. The manager made us do things the company didn't allow.
bad,I learned far more about IT at this job than I did in school.  It is a shame that Verizon does not value US employees and is shipping so many jobs overseas.
bad,"great money, treated like a number and no regard for you as valued employee, terrible work schedule with no ability to change it, impossible to transfer from one location to another"
bad,"It has been a challenging place to work. It is not corporate Verizon, but a franchise under the Cunix Enterprises umbrella.  Unfortunately there is little room for advancement.  The company is overly dynamic, making job security tenuous as well.  "
bad,"Most of the employees and middle management at Verizon are exceptional.  They are the foundation upon which Verizon is built. Too bad upper management is more focused on exporting American jobs to other countries in order to cut there costs. That has had a very negative effect on the moral of the employees. During my tenure I have witnessed several quality employees leaving on a weekly bases.  The attrition is so bad that the majority of the engineering team with the most expertise was either replaced by off shore workers or simply moved on to other companies because of policy.  That has left the remaining employees over worked, frustrated and disengaged because of the lack of resources."
bad,"non stop emails, conference calls, phone calls and texts"
bad,it is a simple job with a lot of minor issues from payroll to management. It is a good job to have for someone young looking for the experience to a job to have in between  jobs.
bad,"Very high stress environment. Expectations continue to be raised while lacking proper support. Leadership on the decline in a big way. Extremely talented people avoid leadership roles because they refuse to be walked on in no-win situations. You can deliver perfect results and the focus will be on what you need to do better. You can go from best results one month, and you land a problem way out of your control and you're in the dog house next month."
bad,"Account is actually trying to make the place more lively. Giving incentives and activities that could uplift the morale of the people. However, goal setting and compensation needs revision to make people stay and happy working for them. Needs improvement on the support mechanism as well."
bad,"If you like money and benefits, this is the place to be.  Having said that......................."
bad,"I learned a lot about cell phones, and also how the cell phone industries works with this company. I enjoyed my co-workers and trainers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"IT is currently failing.  I estimate 9-16 months of continued chaos before a significant change might ""right the ship"".  There is a constant push to outsource to India where we are not attracting the best talent.  There is currently an excessive amount of management due to the constant cycle of lay-offs and outsourcing.  As a result, management is busy trying to find cover and make reports look good instead of focusing on moving the business forward and making real improvement."
bad,"Has changed names many times:  GTE, PacBell, Verizon, Idearc, SuperMedia, and DexMedia.  Its a printed advertisement and unfortunately that isn't as popular as it used to be."
bad,"Poor compensation and stressful environment"
bad,"Overworked, micromanaged along with low compensation made this job very easy to move on to a better career once I left."
bad,over all a 2 compensaton/benefits 4 job security/Advancement 2 management 2 job culture 2
bad,"Typical day at work involves working with customers face to face whether they are having an issue with their bill, their service, their device, or coming in to upgrade or purchase a new device, or inquiring about our service whether its wireless or home. For the most part, my co-workers & I all get along. Hardest part of the job being that we are in a low income demographic, it's a bit challenging to upsell being that most of our customer base is on a fixed income."
bad,They are a third party that gets paid more for you being there each hour. You are just a number and not expected to stay.
bad,"streneous work, long hours, constant micro managing, short breaks, inconsistent goal attainment."
bad,"If you choose to work for a company like Verizon, you will be selling not only your soul but most of your happiness to a group of selfish New York investors who give no evidence of regard for the communities and lives throughout this country from whom they pilfer. This company looks only at the bottom line. If you care about people, this is not the right company for you. Verizon will change you into something less than what you once were."
bad,The company its self is ok. but other thatn that...i left b/c my father was dying and i needed to be with him.
bad,Good company in the beginning until top level management did  major changes that in effect made lots of money for the company and the top level guys These many changes to worker compensation reduced the overall compensation package.
bad,"In the past I use to think very highly of Verizon Wireless. However after working with them since 2009, both in their retail and customer service call center, I feel like it created a culture that makes its employees feel disposable. I mean, during my tenure there, I felt like I was nothing more than a number to them."
bad,No room for advancement.  Union rules.  Management out to get hourly employees for suspensions.  Benefits are good.  New contract forced me to retire due to my disability.  No help from management to try and find a desk job.  Good workers do not get any more merit than mediocre or poor performers.
bad,Callcenter jobs (including ones at VZW) tend to be rather unfair to the employee and very stressful. Along with customers yelling at you there are also frequent employee evaluations where you are yelled at because you didn't pretend you were a supervisor well enough and had to pass along a supervisor call to *gasp* an actual supervisor. This company has been sued in the past for illegal employee management practices so beware! If you can take a lot of stress and want a decent steady paycheck with benefits then this could be a good fit for you...otherwise run far away!
bad,I did not like the management there and the unrealistic expectations for customer service reps. It was a very high stressed job and It made me have migraines daily.
bad,"Hands down, best benefit and competitive pay however culture sucks!  No work life balance, no respect for employees by Sr. Management and unrealistic expectations for sales target."
bad,Good company.  Old style management is getting in the way of this company to move to the next level.  Internal politics and favoritism is wide spread.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Hard to move ahead or around. Started at the wrong time..... Most managers ok but now are trying to keep their jobs. Most consultants make more than they do. Company is changing and trying to break the Union..no morale at all and not sure if they really care.....
bad,"The only focus is revenue and there is no opportunity for advancement. Be prepared for micromanagement. I was statistically 3rd overall out of 400+ in my role, and all I ever heard was where my faults were. Poisonous atmosphere."
bad,A typical day is converting opportunities into sales by utilizing selling techniques and the consultative approach to solving needs and positioning products to meet those needs. High stress environment and low job security make this job difficult in a very dynamic and ever changing environment.
bad,A day as a Business Sales Associate at Verizon Wireless is very demanding. I work in the business to business enviornment which is demanding. As a BSA I work with the sales representatives after a sale has been closed.I speak with the customers concerning their billing as well as payment options and train them on the online tool that gives them constant access to their accounts. I also run analysis that help cusotmer's save on their wireless billing.
bad,"VzB provided good educational benefits that I took advantange of earning my PMP and Masters Certificates from George Washington University in contract, project and program management."
bad,"I worked at Verizon for 6 years and I saw to much politics and back slapping going on. The company prides itself on promoting those that deserve promotion...they don't! District Managers and Store Managers promote their friends and employees who are not management material (just because you can sell doesn't mean you can manage). My DM had no business being a manager of a leomande stand let alone a DM! I know for a fact that employees who were on final written for improper relationships with their employees were promotoed (over more qualified candidates) to higher management positions simply because they were friends with the DM. If you are single, young and don't mind working long hours with little to know positive feedback then this is the job for you because you CAN make a lot of money! But if you are a family person stay away from this company...."
bad,Business Model in decline. The Yellow Page industry has been in decline for 10 years
bad,"Verizon wireless is a great place for single adults. Very difficult to maintain life balance when you have children. Must have thick skin to deal with different types of people. Fast pace environment, must go beyond quota to make noticeable commission checks. Early morning calls if you dont meet your accessory revenue & other metrics. Friday morning meetings are mandatory. Co workers are great people, you tend to become friends easily because they are in the same position you are in. Best part is Verizon wireless has tuition reimbursement, I wouldn't recommend taking full time classes. Great insurance if you have time to take advantage of the benefits."
bad,"On the surface, a great company to work for. But, the longer you work there, the more you see that this center needs to be revamped. They have no concern about the employees home life. The schedules get worse each time...they are always changing the bid times, at least once every other year you are working a shift for more than 6 months as they ""readjust"" the schedules.."
bad,la mentalità americana di innovazione cozza con la mentalità di un'italia medio borghese ancora legata ad alcuni concetti ormai lontani dal mondo lavorativo moderno.
bad,"company wants to move jobs south or overseas, no job security- no family / work balance"
bad,"I was a customer service rep for about a year and a Tech Support (next position up) for about a year as well. The most positive thing about working for Verizon Wireless is pay and benefits are very good. However, the job itself is difficult. After a few months of being on the phone, it became very draining to take 8 hours of calls about peoples' problems every day. Adding to the strain, there was not much time that I was scheduled to be off the phone unless I was on break. You definitely learn to appreciate any time off the phones in your schedule. Further, the scheduling was unfair, at least to me. it was based on seniority which means that the people that have been there longer get better shifts, which doesn't sound so bad except there was not much upward mobility or turn over in the people that have been there a long time, meaning that you continue to get poor shifts even if you have been there for a few years. Also, if you move up like I did, your seniority resets in your new position, so you go back to to bottom of the totem pole for scheduling. This also means you will work every holiday that the call center is open. Lastly, my job was virtually based on performance stats I needed to maintain. For the most part, the stats are attainable, but if you struggle with a certain stat, you will hear about it...constantly. Also, a large portion of my stats breakdown was only partially under my control. A lot my performance was based on customer opinion, which doesn't seem so bad if you're nice to your customers, but there are some that cannot be pleased and would give you poor"
bad,"Not a true team environment. Most employees start out in a retail sales environment where competion against your coworkers is encouraged and expected. This mentality carried over into the B2B side of the business. The management is truely the definition of the word ""manage"" and leadership at the low and mid-levels is lacking if not missing entirely. The hardest part is quota attainment and keeping up with the changes in direction. The company LOVES meetings that don't seem to result in any real contribution or improvement to the sales process. The most enjoyable part of the day is leaving the building."
bad,"- A typical day at work for Verizon wireless was just like anything other. you prep.for your customers, and have a morning huddle and then you have a plan to execute plans on how to meet daily goals and plans."
bad,"I established phone, internet and television services for customers throughout PA and DE. I answered up to 100 calls per day in a busy call center environment. I gained an incredible amount of sales and service experience in my eight years with Verizon. Management needed work. My co-workers were great. Some of which I remain close friends with today. The hardest part of my job was maintaining my integrity, which I did. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers and selling products I believed in."
bad,"I established phone, internet and television services for customers throughout Penssylvania and Deleware. I responded up to 100 calls per day, in a fast-paced Call Center environment, with a very strong focus on Sales and Sales training. Verizon contributed significally to my sales experience. Management needed improvement. My co-wokers were great. Some of which I remain friends with and in close contact today. The hardest part of the job was maintaining my integrity, but I did. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able assist customers and sell products I believed in."
bad,"After working my tail off, and after going through all the ropes they wanted me to (hidden and not hidden), this company still laid me off. They played games with me, telling me I was a great employee and monitoring my computer simply to educate an otherwise dumb staff. The unfortunate thing is some of my other teammates, who didn't work at all and lied about their skills, were embraced by the company."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Inbound call center with high pressure sales outlook. Very little room for advancement once in position. Management runs on numbers alone.
bad,Verizon has good benefits and pays well for the type of jobs they offer. However they focus on things that are popular (in regurds to employees)with out truly focusing on it. Making it not feel genuine.
bad,"Pay was good, management lacked. I. Was not given enough training. Then they expect you to know things you where never thought. I was very disappointed."
bad,"I was able to develop my sales skills in a very rewarding environment, starting out in 2015 the environment and sales structure was great, early 2016 the sales structure changed and was a little harder to make as much commission, and then became revised again both in 2018 and in 2019. In 2018 it seemed as though through some trials we would be rewarded more if our customers left happy instead of feeling like we were pressuring them into buying something, which is basically how we were taught to sell items, then late 2018 Verizon realized they weren't making enough money that way and changed the sales structure again making it significantly more difficult to make great commission checks."
bad,"if you care more for family time than being ambitious and learning the latest technologies out there, work at verizon. the compensation could be better than competitors."
bad,"The only good part of this company was the pay and benefits but at the end of the day your sanity is a little more important. The company is huge on the customer is right and do anything and everything to keep them happy. If you enjoy being a punching bag and being cussed out for 8+ hours a day then this may be the job for you but if you're like everyone else.. this job is horrible. Management is not helpful, advancement only happens if you're a kissass. I learned a lot within this job but most importantly I learned my self worth and that a job is just a job and there are better ones out there"
bad,"Great people but lots of work.  Dept under staffed and no high level mgmt help.  Work requires lots of OT, weekend and nights from December thru February.  Director of payroll lacks expertise needed to properly lead the large payroll department."
bad,Worked closely with Sales & Customer.Worked with Network Solutions Engineer and scrubbed orders to ensure we were placing clean orders. Once information was obtained keyed orders in proquest.
bad,"Verizon offers many great benefits for their employees. However, there is no such thing as work/life balance for employees in their retail market. Quota expectations can be unrealistic and commission changes can be drastic where you can go from making a solid commission check one month to making bare minimum the next. The job can be unnecessarily stressful. Although Verizon promotes growth the reality is there is very little opportunity for advancement."
bad,"They used to be a company that valued employees, tenure, performance and career goals.  They then in the last 5 years became very impersonal, less flexible and corporate snobs."
bad,"VZ is ""Transforming"" to VZ 2.0 which is code for layoffs / RIF's on a quarterly basis since 2015 and now Voluntary Separation Packages to 44,000 employees in 2018.  Before 2015 this was a great place to work but now it is just constant fear about losing your job. You are only a number here. Look elsewhere."
bad,"None. I was not a fan of this company. Low comp structure, every time the comp structure was changed every few months to make it harder to get paid on what you had sold. Very unfair and selfish"
bad,"You think a tech company would be somewhat up to date, but these folks live in the 90's.  Sure, the network is supreme, but they let vendors manage it, mostly.  Everything else is right there with Hootie and the Blowfish.  And that doesn't even start to weigh in on the culture of back stabbing and finger pointing.  If they had a team-based culture, they'd literally have no competition... but stock holders are more important than product or employees, so go they're only as good as the commercials."
bad,"Verizon is a company who continues to have high expectations of its employees without realizing the toll it takes on them. Until I worked for Verizon, I never saw so many employees have a short term disability or FMLA claim. Verizon claims they focus on work life balance but that is in fact not true."
bad,"If you like being micromanaged by nitpicky people and sitting around twiddling your thumbs, this is the place for you! Lots of down time, some can get away with watching youtube and netflix all day but dont even think about doing anything non work related that is productive."
bad,"When I first came to this company I loved it, it was great, but as time went by I just realized how broken it was. We were moving towards we and me and being better but the stores did not follow so it is a constant fight with them, also I did not really like it because I strugfle with anxiety so not know what call could be next is tiring and mentally exausting. And even tho they give you time off you have to scheule way in advance or else you dont get that day off..."
bad,"Promised advancement and bonuses. In my entire time I never received any of the bonuses I was due. I had achieved or exceeded my sales goals, but I never received them."
bad,"Everything you do is watched on a microscope.  A lot of micromanaging.  Customer is always right, no trust in employees.  High stress and performance goals."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Working here in a call center was fun, it was very interesting talking on the phone with different people everyday making them comfortable enough to buy phone and internet service from you."
bad,"Verizon can be a great company to work for however, there employees are under paid for what they do. They other excellent benefits and as long as you fly below the radar you are able to move up withing the company. Verizon is not based on what you know but who you know. Its extremely subjective when it comes to raises and receiving promotions. They don't value their employees on a merit system rather a friend system; but I guess that is every company."
bad,"Unfortunately, Verizon lays off employees every year sometimes twice a year.  It's not about your skills or job performance.  They decide on who to lay off by title and physical location.  They offer good benefits and there are some great people to work with, but job security is low to none."
bad,"Great job to start your path to your next job, fun job with a lot of fake motivation to keep ya going, great benefits and awards when you do well. Poor management, why? Because it is more of a number they need to fill as management than actually training them to make the company the most profit possible. Reps carry the company and are the most watched for any mistake due to good reputation verizon likes to keep as well as to cover themselves of any situation that may happen. Verizon is a great place to be for a small amount of time because the job is not promising, verizon changes a lot for their best of their interest even if it is letting go of thousands in one day. But great temporary job!"
bad,"Constantly had long wait times and frustrated customers due to upper management not filling/posting positions as team members left. Unrealistic expectations were then put on the sales reps to make up for being shorthanded.  Managers at the store level were great, but the higher management rarely visited the store but claimed to know the atmosphere and climate of the customer base."
bad,Very stressful environment. To many employee reductions to experienced employees. I was laid off with only a few months to retirement. Very disappointed in direct management.
bad,"No career growth unless you are a programmer.  Becoming more IT based than telecom and more focus on IT, cloud.  If your 5G you should be OK.  Current IT needs work."
bad,"Inappropriate workplace behavior, poor working conditions,very little office management. Poor professionalism. Low quality training to new employees.s"
bad,"Verizon has a lot of overtime opportunities towards the end of the year so there is plenty of money to make. However the work life balance is terrible. I literally feel as if I missed 4 years of my child’s life. And this is not the place for me anymore. The schedules are not good and the ability to get the schedule that works for you, is not in your control. I’ve never had a weekend off in 4 years. I’ve outfrown the desire to “make a bunch of money” Verizon has taught me the importance of time."
bad,"Verizon used to be VERY employee focused.  Not any more...they have recently cut commissions, lowered the employee discount for purchases, not to mention the multiple layoffs recently.  It's not always about the money Verizon...take care of your people first"
bad,"Verizon was a company i have not worked at in almost 4 years. During my first several years there i enjoyed my time and my peers, as the years went on it did prepare me for my next roles outside of Verizon."
bad,"This was fast-paced environment,  I like that because it made the day go faster.  I learn a lot about the products and how to assist the customers in all levels of the positions"
bad,"The company itself, the cost of things, the way things were ran. I just didnt want to work within a company for how it is was. My least favorite place to have worked at ever."
bad,"Don't work here. They take advantage of their workforce and the only reason you will want to stay are the benefits that you get for being employed. The only reason they want people to come in is so they can train them, then have them be berated by customers without support to actually help customers they way they want you to. The time off was literally the only thing keeping me for as long as I was there."
bad,This is a good job for someone without a family. The hours are demanding and mid day. Money is great as long as you hit your targets for the month. Atmosphere can be daunting. Opinions and ideas are rarely heard. High pressure environment. This company could use improvement in the management division.
bad,"I worked in sales for a few years, and learned that it was not the industry for me. Verizon is far from the worst in this regard, but the pressure of needing to meet a goal to be compensated was not conducive to my desire to grow a career."
bad,"Decent job, frequent headaches. As a call center employee, you get the best and the worst of 'em."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Working for Verizon at first was great. As time went on the culture in the center went way down and it wasn't  fun or enjoyable anymore. It might be different in other centers but this was my experience.
bad,"When I worked for Verizon, it wasn't about the customer, it was all about the up-sell. It felt very cutthroat and frustrating. At the end of my employment, I was so miserable I was hoping to get sick so I didn't have to go into the store."
bad,You're only as good as your last sale. Company says it cares about you however I fill it cares about your last sale only. Never consistent work ethic.
bad,"A typical day consists of talking to customers about their wants and needs as far as their phones and internet usages are concerned. Once I have learned about the customer I try to find a product for growth or an accessory that might help the customer or perhaps is just something that would interest them. "
bad,Retail location are competing with online and losing. Everyone buys online and they do not want to go into stores to hear a bunch if sales pitches.  Quotas are the same as when we had the customers coming in that we now don't have
bad,"Verizon purchased my company and proceeded to eliminate the jobs in most departments. I was offered jobs in a few other locations throughout the nation, but nothing in our local tri-state area. They pride themselves on thousands of jobs being available on their job site. That is true if you count most of them being a clerk selling cell phones from a kiosk at a mall location for close to minimum wage. Obviously, they never had any intention of retaining the thousands of us that they acquired in the purchase. What a blood bath..."
bad,"Work days can be stressful, most customers you talk to are unhappy and it is your job to talk them down from the ledge."
bad,"I was employed at Verizon as a result of a company buyout. In the time between Verizon taking over and my leaving, I watched as quality management professionals were let go or found their roles diminished. In their place, ineffective members of teams were promoted to leadership roles. During that same stretch, I also had many discussions with clients who lamented the sharp decline in service and how it started from the point where Verizon took over."
bad,OK to work for   Lots of flexibility for telecommuting and hours. Constant change (re orgs) and quarterly RIF (reduction in force) lends to insecurities among employees and managers.
bad,"The hourly compensation for what you do here is great, due largely to the union collective bargaining.  That being said however, the union can't/doesn't do too much for the individual worker.  The benefits are pretty good, though you'll be waiting a very long time for anything better than the standard 2 weeks paid vacation.  There's not much opportunity for growth or advancement and micromanagement is to be expected."
bad,It was a good experience wouldn’t work their again because they where very unprofessional. Not a bad company just don’t think I was the right fit they are looking for.
bad,Company has grown too much. Do not view or value the employees as human anymore. They have become very impersonal. They do not listen to employees. You have no input. They overwork managers.
bad,"Verizon is a decent place to work if you are just concerned with pay and do not have any degrees. But if you are highly educated there will not be any room for growth. Yet, they pay for people to obtain degrees and certifications."
bad,Leadership development was something that I took advantage of. Critical thinking is highly recommended and Highly motivated peoples fit best with the culture at Verizon.
bad,VZW is making major changes to move toward a 5G platform they believe in. Their case of the Wirelesss side is anything but enjoyable.
bad,The company seemed to play more on politics than on performance and metrics. It felt like each level of senior management was removed from the other and messages were not consistent.
bad,Couldn't work round the clock sleeping very less hours as  I am not single. Couldn't balance work and personal life as I had to be online in the night connecting to offshore and get on to call in the morning.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,There’s not much room for movement and advancement outside of sales opportunities. The company does provide an excellent benefit package and paid time off.
bad,"I found the people i worked with were the only saving grace. The management  was in constant fluctuation, along with the ability to make money. I appreciate the opportunity to work in Full-Commission sales."
bad,"No issues with compensation but very stressful and the unwillingness to share job knowledge sets up failure.  Employees shouldn't feel like they have to hoard knowledge to keep their jobs.  Don't know if this is a trickle down from the top or if lay offs occur so often that employees feel the need to hoard in order to secure their jobs."
bad,"Though many seem to enjoy the job -management has the ability to ruin your experience. Micromanging and belittling is a common occurrence. Compensation is decent for a sales position - but not worth the hours, stress, or expectations. Goals are so all over the map its hard to count on a dollar amount."
bad,"So many people want to get into Verizon because of the security that they offer.  Most people stay for a long time once they get their foot in the door.  Working in the Verizon call center was the most challenging stressful jobs I've ever had.  I had to leave because I became miserable and I was not alone.  Most of the people that worked their hated their job but stayed for the money, benefits and security.  Life is too precious to be miserable."
bad,"A typical day at work could include a multitude of things. We are taking calls non-stop, no breathing time in between. Micro Managing was very common with fellow colleagues who have the same job title as you. Metrics that are required to meet could jeopardize your job; which includes a code-in system that counts against your ""performance and overall scorecard"". The System used to code into lunch, break, personal time, in for calls, etc. was extremely biased. Going to the bathroom or using 'personal' of an excess was frowned upon/affects your scorecard/metrics and someone was always there too ask where you are when in this code. Even when used on a normal basis and not abused. All in all colleagues and management friendly and always willing to listen, but our input sometimes meant very little. Great benefits. Great Pay. Great associates who all understand the hectic days we would more often than not have."
bad,"My team saved this company millions over the course of my twelve year tenure. In the end I was laid off in a move to save cost. What sense does it make to cut a person who saved the company so much money with innovation. I planned on retiring one day from Verizon but it was not to be."
bad,"I happened to work at a poorly located store that no longer exists, so my experience may differ from others. Management was focused upon sales above all else, even customer service."
bad,Would not want to go back and work there again.  Minimal advancement opportunities.  Not  well integrated across organization and various acquisitions.  Need to define strategy.
bad,The job is fine but their policies are archaic. i have never ever heard of anyone getting released from a job for being in the hospital until it happened to me.
bad,"Typical day is around 9 - 10 hours."
bad,"Joined the company as part of an acquisition. There seemed to be a large disconnect between upper management and the actual workforce in terms of goals, timelines, and overall company direction.  Constantly changing work processes and guidelines."
bad,Verizon used to care about their reps. They now make it harder and harder to make money with more work to achieve less. They want to filter out high paid reps to save money
bad,I love working for Verizon but my pay has went down over the months and went down even more when I got promoted.  You only get half time when you work over time and you work a lot of it.  Expects you to do things outside of work that you don't get paid for.  Verizon likes to get free advertising with their employees doing extra stuff for them without pay.
bad,"Managers dont understand employee needs."
bad,"Working for Verizon was not an easy thing to do but it improved my communication skills greatly and it showed me how not to talk to or treat people. The company offers good benefits like paying for school, which was great and helped me a lot. The customers I had to talk to everyday made me hate my job and the surveys they sent out after each call made the job even more stressful."
bad,"Its a hit or miss when it comes to a busy and slow day, on slow days it can be very unproductive, busy days is what makes the job."
bad,"Not organized. management and upper management are never on same page.,. this is for A wireless not verizon ( which is a third party retailer) alot of broken promises here"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"The pay and benefits, at least when I worked there, were great. However, to me it was not worth the stress of the actual job. Management rarely supports you when policy is being followed and a customer is escalated. Not to mention you will get a different answer from almost every manager."
bad,The job had a lot of on the job training the job understood the working person life and love to get to know the employees and made sure everyone was on the same page
bad,"This was one of the worst employment I've ever experienced. The call center is not a pleasant place to work. Management claim that they will give you support after training to help you succeed. But, once training is over the help is not there. One on one coaching weekly claim to be for development, in actuality it's for finding something negative so you wont develop. It is too much interaction with management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with those awful customers. Believe me, some customers you do not want or need!!! We have to try and save customers when they call in and threaten to go to another carrier. Customers call in most of the time to complain about how Verizon is charging them for services they have not used, when you know that they've gone over their data limits or international calling and they just call in and demand credit for service used and that they was unaware of using. I though poor people beg!!! NO!!! this is not the case....Verizon customers beg for refund and credits more than any group of people I have ever known. It's is a lot to learn and you will probably never learn it all, but each call determines how your day goes. I learned how to be more confident in my decisions.  I would not recommend this job to my friends!  But, in spite of the working environment, Verizon take care of their customers. Although you can not save them all because of their nasty attitudes about a darn cell phone!!! Calm down people it is not that serious!!!"
bad,"•	Maintained accountability for, and demonstrated 100% commitment to customer satisfaction. "
bad,"I'd say Verizon is your average telecom company. The work can be decent depending on which part of the company you're in."
bad,For being the number one most reliable network in the USA they don't care much about there employees. This job is like baseball if you can't hit goals you will lose your job. There turnover rate is unreal you have been warned.
bad,it was door to door service in the central florida area overall it was a good job if your a good salesman it was commission base job not reliable if you have family
bad,"Verizon advertises that they want you to have a work life balance but the reality is they only care about your numbers and what you're producing sales wise for them. Compensation is great, but after working there for several years, compensation isn't enough to keep me there.  They want you to be very pushy in sales but then fire you when complaints come back for doing what you have been trained and advised to do."
bad,"With any career path, it up to you to most of every opportunity.  Must must always strive to do your best, but sometimes your best at Frontier is only good for the day.  Each day has its own separate goals and struggles, good luck!"
bad,Layed off management every quarter for 4 years making culture very negative. Trying to get rid of the wireline business.
bad,You are a number at Verizon and the higher on the number poll you are the more favored you are. You are only trained up if they like you or your coached out.
bad,I am grateful for the opportunity to gain employment with this company but this job is not for me. I often feel as if I am not good enough because it seems like you can never do enough things right. I  have seen people become mentally and physically sick from working here and I don't want to become that way. Verizon has to be for you for you to survive working here.
bad,"The pay is very competitive but it is not worth your health.  There are so many employees there that are on medical leave, medical accommodations (workplace arrangements), and management is not consistent.   I was going through some stress that was bring on health issues and I went to the doctor.  He listened to everything I had to say and his first prescription for me was to find another job because he had several patients having the same issues as I was and they all worked for Verizon."
bad,Great product and services but large divide between management and front line.  The culture was too demanding for anyone to feel comfortable and productive.
bad,"Fast paced, demanding, changing company.  Compensated employees well with exception of forced overtime with management.  Today customer focused only to meet productivity numbers."
bad,Was a nice place to work but can be very competitive and cut throat. The pay is great for the work that you do. But due the bonus money you can earn it gets a little cut throat at times. People lying on other to get them fired so they can get more sales. People stealing co-worker's clients and customers to get a bigger sale. A cut throat sales environment.
bad,"worked in inbound call center to assist customers with situations such as, billing issues, problems with equipment, explanations for charges on the bill"
bad,"Initially, in 2000, Verizon was an incredible employee oriented company that believed the best way to determine how the customer was to be treated was to treat the employees that way."
bad,"Good benefits, good peers, good support partners.  Over all good company to work for when it comes to the employees and the partners, management leaves much to be desired when it comes to work life balance."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"The first 19 great years were great, but the company has changed a great deal in the last five years. Career growth is limited to the Area HQ located in Irvine, Atlanta, Chicago and NJ. The culture is rapidly deteriorating."
bad,Great compensation. NO work life balance.  Mandatory non-stop overtime and no grace period.  You will lose your job if you do not commit all of your time to this company.  This is not the job for a single parent. There's more to life than money.  There's also little chance of advancement.  It takes years to get promoted.
bad,"The day is spent helping customers that come in with phones, technical issues with the phones, bill issues and bill payments, and general questions about Verizon service and coverage. When we do not have customers in the store, we cold-call customers that are upgrade eligible that have stopped by in the past as well as look through their plans to see if we can save them money with the latest and greatest plans. This job continues to enforce the strength I have in customer service and the working relationship I have with people I have just met. I love that part of my job. It is an extremely joyous job being able to help people with things they use everyday. This company lacks the ability to allow growth and also lacks a pay scale that would allow a sales consultant to be lucrative"
bad,Taking inbound calls and resolving through first call resolution customer inquiries. Average anywhere between 30 to 40 calls a day and maintaining corporate procedures
bad,a typical work day would be operating the phone lines to figure out customers needs and questions regarding bills and upgrades to phones and much more.
bad,Must sincerely continue to develop employees. Bottom 10% of employees with a low performance is due to trust with management. Say what you mean and mean what yousay.
bad,retail wireless store lead pretty much dealt with store operations and customer service issues
bad,VZW was a difficult place to work only because they allowed the customers to talk to you any way they wanted to no matter how they discriminated against you or cursed you out. My co-workers and managers were awesome in helping with the communication barriers between customers and reps but it was hard keeping the balance when the customers were always right.
bad,"Currently have been working there for two months, have yet to be paid. Get put through many loops when trying to contact payroll. Nobody seems to be willing to help and just pass me on to the next person. Was told I was working at a store close to me, after one week got transferred to one 40 mins away.  Managers are very unhelpful and only acknowledge you when your not meeting their expectations. "
bad,"The company continues to have great potential and some great people to work with. Unfortunately, the level of bureaucracy and politics is so overwhelming that it's almost impossible to get things done. Leaders bicker behind closed doors like they're in high school and decisions are made for political reasons rather than because they are the best option. Employees are hired because they have a certain skill set or certain expertise, yet that expertise is not listened to unless it confirms decisions that have already been made. Leaders sit on things for months then make decisions on a whim and expect you to execute immediately. This creates an environment of constant stress, frustration, and poor work-life balance."
bad,They would like to think they live the Credo the stands upon. But the company is changing so quick they can barely keep employee's taken care of. To many great tenured employee's slip through cracks because the company is willing to take the collateral damage. The backbone of this company that made it great is disappearing. They are an amazing company. No regrets I hope they get there act together. This from my call center perspective.
bad,Great place to get your taxes done. Small office. Must be able to multi-task
bad,"New installation and timely maintanance of customer business systems and equipment...operation was in a Central Office 24x7 setting. Duties along with Installation and maintanance included tech scheduling, payroll issues, computer platform training, union issues, and admin duties."
bad,Verizon currently does not care about their dedicated and faithful employees. They shipped some jobs overseas to same money. It was terrible they way it was handled also. Personnel were brought over and employees were had to train the new workers to take over their Jobs.
bad,good benefits. this company is a good job sometimes. it has its ups and downs. chances to move up if you sell well. numbers based company.
bad,Terminated after 10 years but proven to be not at fault by labor comission
bad,"good benefits, tuition reimbursment"
bad,"When started company, great environment and very accommodating. Company really cared about customer and employees, When I ended my working there, company had definitely gone downhill. They promoted wrong people that were ego centric and created a negative work experience and had impossible quotas to meet so that it set up the employees up to fail and be either placed on written or fired from their jobs. People who had no problems excelling fell to mediocre."
bad,It pays well and the benefits are great but please dont drink the advancement kool aid. get in and get out. use it for what its worth and it is worth great experience to put on your resume for a job with more security. There is no security here at all.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Typical day, logging into the systems database, browsing through emails and checking for any cellular updates and changes made to the systems. Monitoring the foot traffic and assisting every customer in need. Up-selling products, troubleshooting and problem solving customer interactions. Carrying out daily demands/requests from management, update sales board, direct calling, etc. Sales team works well together, coaching one another with sales techniques to develop best practices at work. Most challenging aspect at work is not satisfying the customer. Going above and beyond to your abilities to help the customer and he/she doesn't appreciate your efforts. Most enjoyable aspect is making customers happy or sharing stories that can reflect a closer relationship in the future. Every job comes with challenges, just have to be driven enough to overcome."
bad,"In my experience, there has been nothing but poor managers. They micromanage you to do everything exactly the way Verizon wants, including scripts and no down time. They reward the managers that use threatening tactics to get you to preform. Not many employees are happy with their jobs but you deal with it because they pay nicely."
bad,High stress environment with lots of recognition if you are top sales but once you slip up your jobs on the line. Can be a fun environment if having the right manager
bad,Good Luck if you work there. Only the Strong Survive.............Get there on time. Let the customer hear your smile . Be kind. BE HERE NOW -- Great Benefits
bad,"The company does very well in retaining their employees by offering great benefits. If your're in sales, the job isn't hard either. The hard part is the stress that management and the customers provide. The sad part is that you're selling to a very saturated market with many alternatives. Because of all the heated pressure management give their employees, many of them lie and slam sales on customers to make quota. Verizon, along with many other carriers, are very guilty of this because they promote a lot of shady reps. If you're an honest person, I would avoid working here unless you're prepared to argue with your manager during every sale about why a customer isn't buying XYZ."
bad,"Pay good- mental exhaustion. Call center environment, with no chance to excel or exceed. Management more worried about numbers than employees. thank you"
bad,Less work life balance. Pay is good. Leaves are good. Micro management becomes a common culture and it affects the skilled employees and force them to leave the company.
bad,"The store was a great place to work but, it ended up closing which is why I stopped working there.  It was a sales job and very customer oriented type job."
bad,"Constant layoffs at least twice a year, dont know when your time will come. Even if you survive like I have, you feel terrible for your hardworking teammates that do not."
bad,Workload is over whelming. You get non stop back to back calls if you are on the phone. Metrics and P.A is out of this world. Management needs to focus on getting trained and know company policies. Stop micromanagement.
bad,"It was all about the money, Constant bickering between the union and the company. Company‘s main goal is to put management against the union employees, job rules changed on a weekly basis and suspensions were handed out like TicTac‘s. Great place to work if you’re single, or looking to get divorced because it will make you both"
bad,"tremendous pay but very inflexible rules..i.e. i had to try and sell fios (tv, phone and internet) to an 80 year old who was calling in to ask why her bill was 20$ that month instead of the 18$ it had been for 10 years..."
bad,"The company did not care about the employees. Focus was on removing higher paid, long tenured employees to replace them with young, cheap staff.Management stated that older employees were not up to date with technology and semi-functional. Clean sweeps with total loss of historical knowledge were common."
bad,After nine years with Verizon with no write up never late and always getting recognized. To one day getting laid off with no real definition on why but only your positions has been affected. I would not recommend for anyone to think that they can build a career in because one day to another they can take it away. I was happy at Verizon but they took that away from me and it affected my family’s life style from having a good life to now a struggling life.
bad,"Highly insecured company, but a good company with good  work/life balance. The management is very bad and useless as they do not know what needs to be done. A total of 972 employees were sacked on a single day last year. Its ridiculous."
bad,"Within IT, layoffs are common and advancement (except in a small group) is almost unheard of. With recent decisions to outsource both Mainframe and a subset of application development, I don't see this trend changing"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"If you like to stress the job is for you! No more job security, and dealing with customers on a daily basis while not personal is waring on you mentally."
bad,"Limited in variety and flexibility for scheduling of things outside your work life like FAMILY, school and other things. Also you are treated like a a child constantly throughout you time there."
bad,This place changes more than a little bit. Right after a few months they make you want to quit. They make up different reasons to things that is not true. I would not recommend anyone to working here. Unless they are applying for tech job.
bad,Alright company to work for. Management needs allot of work. discounts are alright. Job security is 50-50. As long as you stay for your term contract you should be permanent.
bad,"100% commission no base pay. You sit in a store for 8 hours hoping that someone comes in and wants to buy a phone. But most often they come in to figure out how to fix something on their phone and guess what you have to help(for free) You charge a $35 set-up fee for your services that can extend up to 3 hours per customer and for some reason the company takes half. For the first 3 months you don't make commission. you make $11/hr. You work in 15 different stores, some up to 2 hours away, with no gas compensation. As a newbie you get put in slow stores for 8 hours and have impossible sales goals to meet. Unless you are a master of sales and know a ton of people who would switch to Verizon for you, don't do it."
bad,"-Extremely stressful, poor mgmnt"
bad,Productive and good to work with employer.  Management at the time was unorganized.  Training was fast and you were not able to work good in class room . You were not able to use the computers in class with what they wanted you to do before you were put on the floor taking live calls
bad,This job really ismt that bad its just the late hours and not being able to go home when you want to. You have to rely on other people to say yes to make an income.
bad,How you get paid is a mystery.  No one understands it and its just swept under the rug.  It also has a draft system making it hard to get good shifts.
bad,My position was eliminated after doing a good job with excellent reviews Not much positive to say at this point. I miss the folks at my office they were great to work with and we got along great.
bad,working at Verizon was good but it did not cultivate a culture of a good workplace balance.  The great pay did not make up for this weakness in company culture.
bad,"Working at Verizon Wireless was stable income.  Although the culture advertised promotion it was difficult to advance and in the end I was laid off.  Very little training was offered at this level and management had minimal influence and knowledge of what employees were doing day to day.  There was always impending doom as to if our jobs were safe and although we worked with a skeleton crew I was still layed off.  I feel that after seven years of loyalty to the company including relocating to take more responsibility within the company, that my legs were taken out from under me in the end.  We worked both nights and days on a shifting oncall schedule.  If work needed to be taken care of at night and it was your assigned week you would need to move to night work which could make sleep and life scheduling difficult.  It was enjoyable working as a system tech (engineer) and getting to learn more about telecommunication networking and everything that went along with the work.  More and more responsibilites were shifting to the tech level and I'm sure that will become more stressful.  All in all the work was fun and my coworkers were great people.  In the end I felt as if management levels were disconnected from my position and that my tenure, loyalty, and sacrifices carried very little weight in the decision to lay me off."
bad,Extremely micro-managed with trermendous rules and policies. Very very very stressful enviroment in relation to company's expectations of each employee.
bad,"All of the companies in the Telecom industry are struggling, enter any at your own risk.  The general situation is that they can not maintain the customer service and are constantly cutting back. The copper is deteriorating, the switches need to convert to IP and only some of the companies are truly ready."
bad,Corporate Greed has Demolished what it was to want to work for Verizon it was a Career now it’s just a Job! If Verizon Gave Pensions to All Employees they would decrease Churn
bad,"IT being outsourced and downsized continually.   Job security is low, moral at the company is low.  Benefits at the company are good and for the most part the people who work there are dedicated.  But the culture is one of uncertainty now as the wireless industry is no longer growing and Verizon is looking to cut costs in a big way"
bad,"They try to tell you they want you to advance, but if you're a good salesman, they want to keep you there because you make the store money and in turn management security."
bad,"While Verizon Wireless Call Center does offer extremely competitive starting pay, benefits, and culture, the training process is tedious and redundant and I do not feel it prepares the employee for their position post-training."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"customer interaction was most of the day, not a lot of training provided. learned how the computer system operated. The store manager was more of a worker and not a leader, but tried hard to help subordinates. Co-workers were amazing and great to work with. the hardest part of the job was advertisements on the store location, customers did not come because they did not  know our location. customer interaction and comradery were the best parts."
bad,"This used to be a good place to work for; great benefits, good salary, great people, strong culture, etc. Now however all that they seem to care about is how do we take costs out of the business. There is no compassion or loyalty to the employee base. And if you happen to be in a group that is expendable well you best start packing your bags!!!"
bad,"Back to Back release, busy working schedule. need to work overtime often. 401K match is 8%, preprare to work with offshore"
bad,"Day usually starts off with  about 60 follow up calls, then you greet customers upon opening until classes start mid day, after you teach elderly how to use their phones then you go to lunch and after its back to greeting and assisting sales reps with their transactions and ensure customer happiness with what they receive from verizon."
bad,Cotinuous monitoring of call center operations along with aligning forecasted call volumes to actuals in an effort to maintain service level goals.
bad,Hardest part was meeting objectives.  Being on the phone 7hrs a day with customer selling.  Learned how to deal with irate and angry customers.
bad,"Verizon was not a great place to work. It was a hostile work environment. Constantly changing policies and procedures back and forth, with a view of their customers as not as important as there bottom line."
bad,By far the most stressful place I have ever worked. But also the place where I made the most money.
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"My experience at A Wireless Premium Retailer was decent. Good pay, nice and friendly work environment but poor management. Advancement was impossible if you weren't affiliated with higher management. Most enjoyable part of my position was helping customers resolve account and equipment issues. The worst part of my experience was that they took my kindness and helpfulness as a weakness. I went above and beyond for that company with no recognition."
bad,the systems in the company make it too hard to get anything done.
bad,"A nice place to work, not perfect but not bad. Should be proactive, not reactive."
bad,"My time with Verizon was not enjoyable. The workplace is filled with disgruntled employees. This makes for a very long work day. And, being a contractor, they restricted my work to only what I was hired to do, so I couldn't show my skills in other areas and try to move into a different group."
bad,"Enjoyed selling and working with my coworkers.  Hardest part of the job was getting paid - hitting sales quota.  I always hit the quota but it was tough for the area and traffic that we saw.  We were in an area that created a lot of chargebacks, even when we did everything possible to prevent them.  I felt underpaid for the amount of work that I did."
bad,Commission structure constantly changes - goals are not consistently administered.
bad,"Assisted sales force in selling wireless technical solutions to small businesses, government and large enterprise customers."
bad,"I spent 6 months here at the call center as Technical Coordinator 1, they base everything off performance metrics. And the training is long and can be rewarding if you get a good supervisor and a good training assitant. They will monitor and give you feedback on your calls, i hated it!"
bad,"Processing new accounts, billing , troubleshooting entering all information in Database."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"answering calls from inbound customers, learned patience,"
bad,"A typical day at work is talking and resolving technical and billing related issues with customers. The co-workers are nice. When upper management put stress on the middle management team, it trickles down horribly to the front line employees who are already dealing with the stress from the customer everyday. The most enjoyable part of this job is when it time to leave at the end of your shift."
bad,"This company would have been a great company to work for but their lack of inventory constantly made it a challenge to make sales.  Also, on 5 seperate instances they made huge mistakes on my commision checks and 1 month I didn't even recieve my check."
bad,"Benefits were great, Pay is good. Overall best company I worked for."
bad,Provided many good opportunities but is a very large corporate environment. Excellent benefits and leadership development classes.
bad,"Typical day here is show up and sell phones. Day in day out keep up on what is going on in the cell phone world and internet world, so you can give the customers the best information available."
bad,"Its hard to spend time with your family when you work crazy hours. One day I'll work from 10:45 am to 7:45 pm, and the next day I'll work 11:15 am to 9:00 pm. This is every week. I hardly ever get to go to my kids school activities."
bad,Not enough time off available at the time I worked there. hours were okay and co workers were great to work with
bad,"I was an intern hear for a summer, and quite frankly, it was a pretty boring job, with a subpar manager. He was more interested in playing games on his computer and hitting on the female intern than actually doing work."
bad,Long hours of work with multiple projects assigned. Resources assigned to multiple projects can not focus to complete it all within the standard work hours.
bad,First time being sales at Verizon. They tried teaching me the the best they could. Very great film for the experience. Taught me how to talk with customers and follow up.
bad,Die in den Vorstellungsgesprächen dargestellte Spezifikation der Rolle wurden durch das tägliche Geschäft konterkariert bzw. meine Erwartungen bezüglich meiner Aufgaben im Unternehmen wurden nicht erfüllt.
bad,"Fine if you don’t mind being fussed at all day while trying to pitch products at the same time. If you do mind, then you will find this job stressful."
bad,"Verizon is not what it used to be , they threatened my job consistently, their was a time when customers were allowed to be helped with their equipment so I could create repeated business and was demoted and restricted from helping customers, making money and forcing customers to buy things that were irrelevant to customers"
bad,District manager lacked communication and never was responsive for urgent emails. Scheduling wasn’t bad for management. Overall the idea of a Team is non existent
bad,"I worked for Verizon for over 7 years. I would recommend working here to all of my peers because the benefits are amazing! 50% off your phone bill, the best health insurance. Plus very casual you wear jeans every day and get to work from home once a week."
bad,"Helped a lot of people with issues for their phones.   Sold, upgraded added new lines and helped with bill pays. Would also help people with tech support issues."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,Management is not good quality at all. There are some good ones but they're also leaving. Flocking birds. IT department is overlooked heavily and their needs and demands often go unheard. This is worst company. Product based but no experimentation or innovation happening. Only boss pleasing is going on. Now there is too much work pressure as all good people and talent is leaving. We are getting paid less and made to do job of 2 people. This is not correct. Any company better right now
bad,"Good pay, decent advancement opportunity, terrible management and communication. Extremely shady company with questionable practices and you have to work  holidays."
bad,"Wasn't for me, didn't like the job or environment, not an It person. This job was just a transitional position until I could find work in my chosen field"
bad,"Thankfully, I learned a lot on this job. Unfortunately, some of what I learned was about the culture of corporations. Again, bottom line gets in the way of valuing employees to ensure that they stay with the company."
bad,"It's call center work."
bad,"This being a large company, but unfortunately, the workforce is not managed effectively, at least in the IT/Cyber Security dept.  In general this is not the type of company I'd refer to a friend."
bad,The demands on the associate are high but pay is great.  I learned alot about aggressive sales working for Verizon. It was a great experience and I would not take it back.
bad,If you want to continually get berated for things like why you didn't sell a 70 year old couple a tablet as they came in asking for help using their flip phone ask they're thinking they're just going to cancel their services because they barely use it anyways then Verizon is the place for you. But if you make them a ton of money they'll turn a blind eye to your shady sales tactics.
bad,"great facilities, food truck vending, clean building and restrooms,wonderful communications & engagement director, convenient location, a bit stressful chat flow at times"
bad,"Very Centric and data driven"
bad,work force segregated based on skill set and challenge to move between teams for upward mobility - lack of state of the art products availalble to team if not at hq
bad,They told me they would work with my school schedule but then did not once finished with training. That's why I'm leaving to have more work life balance.
bad,"Working here is terrible, but they pay you decently and provide good benefits. It can be okay if your management is good, but most of the managers I've encountered only cared about making sales and would scam their own grandmother for a dollar in their pockets."
bad,"Good place to work at,fast paced ,enjoyed working with children management was easy to talk to.would go in the morning and prepare meals for the children in center. Ordered all the food supplies that were needed."
bad,"Nothing new. Just continuous work, monotony, several interesting characters. Another position as a contractor where all the prime work goes to the prime."
bad,"Verizon was a very stressful working environment.  Although you were compensated well, they were not very understanding towards family life.  They also did not do a lot of promoting from within"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"I was a Contract Consultant at Verizon Wireless, not an Employee. Therefore, I cannot answer the questions about how they compensate, promote, etc., as I was not involved in Employee Issues."
bad,"I Was an authorized retailer Called Cellular Sales For Verizon Long Hours and 100% commission. Management was horrible they were liars and thieves,  I quit due to management,"
bad,Lies to customers and messes with bills to try to sell more stuff for commission. They give you outrageous hours and no incentive. They’re all about making money
bad,"If you can handle being yelled at and getting calls non-stop without being allowed to use the restroom this is the job for you. You will received a yearly bonus, but it does not make up for the stressful work environment."
bad,"Not a hard job at all, depending on what location you are in. The company has some locations where as staff its hard to meet monthly commission goals."
bad,", expectations were difficult to meet.  There was a disconnect from what the customer wanted and the company expectations.  Made it hard to succeed at work"
bad,"Like all jobs it has its ups and downs. My main issue was with a rogue supervisor but mainly it was just too stressful. They had amazing benefits and  treated their employees better than any company I have worked for. Those amazing benefits are missed are well as the bonus but other than that it got old. Even though I resigned, if I could work in executive operations rather than ANYHTING to do with the call center I would for a favorable salary."
bad,"But my manager was a shark. I think there are other stores that had a much better working environment that would have kept me around longer. However, the long hours during peak season and shady sales tactics were absolutely not my idea of good sales. I couldn't stomach it! Many of us left under this particular manager's time there. However, I hear the current manager and staff is great. I would definitely consider employment here as benefits are fantastic, and with the right management, it could be a lot of fun."
bad,"The department I worked in was very clicky. People in the main office looked down on remote employees and made decisions without consulting them. There were so many deliverables that no one could provide clear direction on what the priorities. I got the sense we were doing work just for the sake of checking boxes. Immediate manager was scatterbrained, secretive but also a micromanager who was suspicious of everyone. Everyone who joined when I did was gone within a year because of the chaos, distrust and lack of focus."
bad,"Poor management. work was good and we developed good product but due to poor management the product never got launched. "
bad,"Great place to work if you don't have a family at home that you want to spend time with. If you have activities that you want to do outside of the normal 9-5, then Verizon may not be for you. Work-life balance SUCKS big time."
bad,its a good temp job but honestly this is probably the worst job I have ever had. plain and simple. the only thing that really made it bad was just the customers and lack of knowledge when helping customers.
bad,Horrible place to work very stressful hard to move up in the company.I dont have anything good to say about the place. Only pros were the health insurance
bad,"Very bad company to work for. Management was not very nice and did not follow through with some things they said they would do. Very stressful environment. They do not keep good records. I was forced to resign because I ""hung up"" on a customer. I did not but because they did not take good remarks therefore forcing me to resign."
bad,very cut throat and fast paced just be sure you consistently sell very high amounts of what they demand or else you wont last long it is dog eat dog and stressful
bad,"Verizon paid very well but I was working 2-4 hours every night in addition to 8 hours every day, not including the weeks when I was on call which would push me to 90-100 hours a week. The job was very stressful and put a lot of strain on my personal life."
bad,"Working for Verizon is extremely stressful, no matter the position held. The culture can be different depending the center your in. Smaller center are usually the worse for any advancement."
bad,"Working with New Phones, and consistent Training may this job a blast. However trying to sell people features they didn't need or want was the only down fall of the job."
bad,The turn over rate is very high . You work every weekend and every holiday . Management does not work with you . The pay is good . overall this place is not a good place
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,did not like this company at all the management was horrible i was forced to work every weekend 7 days a week and no one else was forced to work them.
bad,Learned a lot from taking care of clients to opening new lines and signing up clients with verizon. New products were always a good thing to try and sell new phones and tablets.
bad,"Overall, the people are fantastic and a joy to work with...the main issue with employment at Verizon is around the amount of process knowledge required to be successful."
bad,"Well While Verizon wireless may be on the rise still, Verizon land line business services is an ancient business model trying to operate in the 21st century. the training is 3 months long! yes I wrote that correctly. and yet with all that training when I got out on the floor despite the fact that I was top of my class, I was lost due to the fact that nothing in training carried over to the floor. This is not a job I would recommend."
bad,"There are so many requirements that at any given point, any employee can be gotten rid of due to not doing something right."
bad,Not a disability oriented place to be. Management target individuals who have had years in the company. This pertains to the Elgin Call Center only - have not worked in other call center. Not culture diversity.
bad,"This was a great place to work.  Time off was fantastic and bay and benefits were solid as well.  Especially the insurance.  They laid everyone off in a corporate role except a few, who had to relocate to new offices in another state.  I took a package and went elsewhere."
bad,not a place to work if you enjoy a family life. good benefits because of union. company does not care for employees needs.
bad,At this job I learned persistence. For every 50 no's or hang up's I got I would always stay postive knowing that is the nature of the beast.
bad,"daily activities including anwsering calls, building trouble reports and working closely with customer's and technician's to resolve network issues."
bad,I was a paralegal but since I wasnt working full time I was getting paid minimum wage it is to much work for the pay  all I did was sit in a desk and assist the other paralegal with filing cases and translating
bad,Lower pay and compensation than promised.  Long days and a lot of tech support.  Poor upper management.  Workplace very unenjoyable.  No room to advance within the company.
bad,"Verizon Wireless is an employer that pays well, but overall is a corporation and has all of the issues associated with working in a massive corporate structure."
bad,"a typical day is very frustrating, management gives you very little room to do your job. While they harass you to reach unrealistic metrics, through fear, by threatening you with suspension or loss of job. the company does not take the time to train you properly, and then expects immediate production. the most enjoyable part of the job, is punching out and going home. management doesn't lead by example, inspiration or experience. its a punitive mentality, be more efficient, more productive, go faster or your suspended. Not let me show you how to be more efficient, how to be more productive, do it or your suspended. they are not managers just disciplinarians."
bad,"Night work, must multitask, very busy most of the time. Covering all of Pa., Del. and N.J."
bad,"Used to be a great place to work.  Working remote and compensation were great advantages.  However, morale has suffered as job security and advancement opportunities have disappeared."
bad,Good pay benefits.  Poor work life balance.  The stock is doing well so that's all that matters to our execs.  This make employment there difficult at best.
bad,Verizon is not sure what to do with this company that they purchased. Leadership has changed multiple times and each group has a new vision and new direction.
bad,"Worked directly with customers to improve their overall experience with our company. Each day my job changed based on the needs of my management team and my customers. I have learned that if you only pause for a moment and listen to your customers you will find their needs often are simple. The best part of my job is taking a persons problems and turning them into solution. I enjoy watching a persons stress over an issue melt away and having it replaced with a soft smile. The biggest challenge I face with my job is limiting the time I spend with each customer. I believe in giving them the needed time and that for some can be lengthy. I am know as the house mom to all of my coworkers. I love taking care of people and this is not just for my customers! My co-workers are my family. I believe if I am going to spend 8-10 hrs. a day with them, I want to have a healthy working relationship with them.."
bad,My day was horrible they have no respect for any of their employees and they don't care anything about you. If we didn't make money we weren't getting money for that day.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,I already reviewed this company once. I do not see that another review is going to make any difference in the outcome of anyone's opinion.
bad,"Verizon is one of the high payers in the markets. Apart from that, they offer good work/life balance. Management is good enough but not a strong matrix organization. They are still a functional organization and are slowly adapting the matrix style of working."
bad,"From the mouth of one of my peers, ""Management treats the union workers like dogs.""  "
bad,"Day-to-Day operations consist of managing sales, inventory, exceeding daily quotas, creating sales strategies, training, opening and closing of Stores."
bad,"If you are younger, or don't have a need for balance with family a good place to be. Can advance if you get into the right circle. You have to like change as there is constant change in the industry. Commission is not what it used to be as the company has grown."
bad,"Excessive layoffs has resulted in a significant brain drain for company's operations, which has also resulted in low employee morale."
bad,"They are extremely micromanaging, and their pay for Instructional Design work is mediocre, but great for a midlevel designer."
bad,"Very fast paced,  non-stop with calls -one coming in right after the other. I learned to stay focus on my job at hand, I learn being in a very large facility that no matter how stressful work can get- to leave it at work and not bring it home. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers are family.. we all cared for each other and became very close, the hardest part was the rules at Verizon rules changed constantly  and lack of communication between management and workers."
bad,I made good money at Verizon. I just have a family and this is not a great mix with a family. Stressful with never getting off on time and making sales.
bad,Anser and resolve customer questions and concerns making sure they had best possible package for their personal needs.Always learning how to deal with many types of people.Management was available to assist with any issues. Had awesome co-workers. The hardest part of the job was not having opportunity to move. Always learning something new and meeting new people.
bad,"Fun place to work and learned a lot from people/seniors."
bad,"no advocacy from management, constant stress, very little support from direct supervisor. good benefits and pay."
bad,I was a technician at Verizon Wireless before they got rid of all of their techs. Our daily work day would involve troubleshooting of customers cellular devices and resolving the issue. It was more like listen to the customer yell about a phone that didn't work right and try and sell them accessories they did not need. We were constantly being told by upper management that we needed to sell more accessories or data packages. Now we didn't make a commission. By us selling these items we were taking money out the sales team pockets and also frustrating the customer even more.
bad,"I started at Verizon when I was 18 years old, Every year was a learning experice I worked Tier 3 support for many years and had over 300 customers so I am a very hard worker and my goal was to always make sure my customer was satisfied if they are not happy than Im not happy. My management was good they push you to do a great job"
bad,"You spend your day in a cube calling contractors selling them leads and memberships."
bad,it was ok call volume was high the hardest part was the terms and conditions that wasn't disclosed before customers agreed to set up servcie
bad,"show up to work sell phones,  deal with customers problems, take payments."
bad,"A typical day at work is very slow being that some months are a lot slower than others, you never know how much your comission will be. I've learned to better work with customers and how to be more comfortable with them as well. Management is not the BEST but I learn what i need to. My co-workers have made this job a joy. The hardest part of my job is not knowing if the clientel will increase. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with people all day so there is never a dull moment."
bad,"I loved working for this company. However, they were not very appreciative towards it's employees."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,I have learned great customer service skills through my time at Verizon
bad,"It is not customer service.  It is sales/customer service/stop disconnects at all cost.  The customer base with back to back calls is challenging enough without the added admin pressures.  Verizon focuses on making profit from anything.  Example....customer needs a phone but not eligible for upgrade.  Customer for 12 years.  Management says they will approve as long as customer buys an accessory bundle with the phone.  ""Position"" (aka Bullsh#t) as making sure the customer's device is protected when in reality it's because ""leadership"" is on an accessory kick."
bad,"Decent place to start auditing, though it all depends on the people that you end up working for. Your experience will be colored by the Partners and managers you work with."
bad,good company with benefit but very stressful and had to sell
bad,"Personally there is a lot of things that I like about working for Verizon, I really love helping people all day, especially when you have a good experience with them. The management is okay here, it seems the supervisors know more about everything than the high up management, there isnt very much of a chance of advancement, and there is some unfair things that happen. For example, there is a very slow store that they would have me close twice a week which was really really impacting my commission for the month, and they were not paying me any different for working at a branch that is slow (the full time employees of the branch make more hourly) also they will do anything they can to take from your commission"
bad,"A typical day at Verizon was either opening or closing. Cleaned and stocked. Made sure everything was in order for inventory. Helped find the perfect phone for customers. We handled with complaints al the time. We handles shipments. Courtesy calls to let customers know when they had upgrades to try and get more clientele. I learned a lot about phones. i learned how to use excel spread sheets. How to do inventory, how to make sales and activate phones. Co-workers were fun and energetic. Others were Debby downers who brought their drama into work. The store manager had poor communication skills. Didn't tell you were exactly company meetings would be. The hardest part was to close a sell with those who weren't for sure if they wanted a phone or not those who just browsed. Also the hard part was to try and make it to a meeting when it would be an hour away from work when know one new addresses. The most enjoyable part was working with the employees who enjoyed there job and were positive."
bad,"Aside from military service, Verizon has by far the best benefits of any organization I have worked for. The amount of paid time off, the very affordable health care from premium providers, excellent 401k, 8k / year for tuition, make up some of the many benefits of working at this organization. However, I feel many of these benefits are provided in order to get people to stay. "
bad,"As a customer service representative you take approx. 50 calls a day helping customer with a variety of issues. Your patience will be tried. I've been called every name in the book because I have to follow policy set up by people that have no idea what it is like to be a consumer. "
bad,"Hours where M-F 3-11 "
bad,"Nothing really to talk about decent pay good benefits, just a lot of pressure of course."
bad,People at the company were okay to work for and found that they have a high turnover
bad,customers do not understand reps cannot change everything
bad,"To sum up my experience working for Verizon Wireless call center. They took my soul in exchange for excellent pay and great health benefits as well as matching your 401k after three years of employment. There's a reason why places like this have all these excellent benefits. It's a horrible job that sucks the life out of you. You have no control over what you schedule fits your personal life. It's a ""take it or leave it"" negotiation."
bad,not many hours. when we did work it was a good experience though. learned how to use certain heavy machinery.
bad,Inappropriate work environment. Enforced unethical sales on customers.
bad,"no work life balance, not good hikes as per industandards."
bad,"very competitive, fast paced. commission based pay, i was able to improve my sales skills more."
bad,Productive and happy workplace . Employees work hard and productive but are treated as family members.
bad,Good company to work for until they throw you away.traveled a lot. Education paid for
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Over my 17 year career, people became less and less important. I was on the operations side for most of my career and you can never do enough.Politics, not job performance, ruled your success."
bad,The pay was great however the Supervisory staff and Management was horrible
bad,Verizon trains their call center support better than any other company I have worked for. Shifts and supervisors change every 6 months so there can be a period of time where you have a great supportive supervisor but also you can end up with just the opposite as well. The company depends on customer surveys as part of your rating which can be detrimental if you are unable to give the customers credits or free phones. It has also become mandatory to have the call centers sell accessories and add lines to peoples accounts as part of the metrics and this has made helping the customer resolve issues far more difficult
bad,"I was the Project Manager for California and Washington providing fiber optic upgrades. Coordinating and supervising fiber installations for residential and commercial properties. I ensured safe working conditions for all employees working on the construction sites, while performing routine quality tests on finished fiber optic installations."
bad,"its a good company.we can learn more there in training"
bad,"ok company to work for. very stressful work, but pay if very good."
bad,Continuous lay-offs required fewer workers to do higher volumes of work.
bad,"sat at a desk prosessing customers accounts, learned how to work with diverse personalities, multi cultural work environment, multi tasking, hardest part was sitting in one place for eight hours a day not being able to get up and move around. the best part of my job was my co workers"
bad,Fast paced environment.
bad,"Overall impression was not a good one, work days are long schedule not always availabe till the end of the week and policies and procedures changed daily"
bad,There was a challange with dealing with people and there cell phone bills.
bad,"After February 2013, I can be candid, not until then."
bad,"This is the only job i've ever gotten fired from. EVER! The service is superior to anyone else's. I'll give them that. But you will work harder than you've ever worked in your life. Gauranteed. And there's nothing wrong with hard work, but there's a reason why this company is ALWAYS hiring. The turnover rate is off the charts. When you first start, plan on working until 11 pm and every weekend. And be careful about the amount of times you go to the restroom. They monitor closely everything you say and do. They did me a favor when they fired me. And they terminate a lot of people. When you go in to work and pass by the front security desk, glance over at the large stack of papers that are more than likely, people who will be escorted out the door that day. It's routine. Like i said, great cell service, but i wouldn't work there again in hindsight."
bad,"When recruited, I was advised of all the oT available so you can exceed your numbers however, when the business manager was terminated on day 2, things changed and numbers were harder to acheive without the overtime. When they launch a new product, they never have enough in the warehouse for the demand."
bad,Learned to work as a sales representative learned great people skills.
bad,Very fast pace an i have learnt to properly understand the cstomes want and need. The management were great and co workers too. The hardest part was the training and the most enjoyable was the co-workers.
bad,loved my job until new mangers came in and everything changed and wasnt the normal way of doin g things
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Overall, the company is great to work for, but some of the leadership was questionable."
bad,"We received inbound calls from landline, internet, and cable customers inquiring about billing or services offered."
bad,"Learn a great deal about small business, as well as business ethics."
bad,Inside sales in a retail setting. Did get some outside B2B experience.
bad,"• Development of a system to integrate all customer orders into one billing system using J2EE, Spring, Hibernate, Agile, and JBoss AS."
bad,"You do get a lot of bonuses and the job is fast-paced. This, however is not a job for everyone. Not all customers are gracious, and you must remain professional at all times."
bad,I was forced into working for verizon after they bought alltel. alltel was a great company but after seiing how things are done at verizon it was time for me to move on. Management was a joke and the hours were awful. Never anytime to see family or enjoy your hobbies. And dont get me started on the waste of time meeting they had every friday. If thinking about working there DONT!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,Not my favorite place that I have worked at. Benefits and bonuses are nice but still almost not worth it. Does pay well though for the location and gives you room too move up.
bad,"I worked at verizon for over a year and loved it, got plenty of vacation time and pto, life was great."
bad,"Due to changing technology and the change in culture Verizon became a difficult place to work, Management and union relations really deteriorated over the years. Between micromanagement and gps and unrealistic goals set by upper management inflicted on lower management is what made it a difficult place to work."
bad,Very stressful environment with constant change to bonus structure and metrics company is a machine they do not care about mental strain that employees go through
bad,Worked 60 hours a week 6 days a week. Very tough work but great opportunity to make a decent living pays very well. Management was overall very good with nice motivating people.
bad,Very non-personal environment. Managers know nothing about the people who report to them. It was a switch and bait deal. They lure you in with all these great benefits and then find out it's a call center environment.
bad,"I worked at the Verizon Wireless call center in Albuquerque, NM.  I must say, the facilities there were absolutely gorgeous! Halfway decent food court too, as well as a fitness center.  Training was fairly straightforward, and they do a wonderful job hyping up the work to their new employees, while still being realistic about the Challenges of the job.  Workplace overall seemed very supportive! We were expected to work 30-40 hour weeks at nontraditional times of day (not your normal 9a-5p weekday job), though higher seniority gave you better choice in schedules.  Call center was inbound customer service calls only, no sales.  You must be technologically competent, as you are expected to complete multiple troubleshooting steps to assist customers before forwarding to ""Tier 2 Tech Support"". Nearly all work is computer based, assisting callers with billing, tech issues, device purchases, etc.  "
bad,"Great environment"
bad,good pay; bad for mental and physical health. forced to sell things to customers that they didn't want or need when all they had called in for was to get something fixed.
bad,"This place is good, short term, but after a couple years, and if your not kissing brown all day you will not advance in the company, literally if your good at being honest and a hard worker, management will make you feel like you are not good and nit pick your numbers, the reps that lie have all the top spots. The people for the most part are ok , the random a-hole that calls in does make things a little tough, but pay is good , hence why I'm there still, recommend part time, full time will shorten your life. Just remember lie to all customers, gets you good stats, thing life"
bad,Needs more than ever to update their systems and let departments work together to get something done. their systems are antiquated making it difficult to get things done on a customer time sensitive manner.
bad,"this place was fun to work at first, but depending on the superviser you where stuck with, it can become a real nightmare. some people are easily offended, so much so I found my self having to watch everything I did or say. going to another superviser other then your own was often met with little desire to want to help."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,when started with the company there were 49 call centers when mine was closed down verizon is down to 16. not safe company to work for. ..............
bad,"I would have to say that I was never completely satisfied with the company, however as of late my satisfaction has declined greatly. As of the writing of this the company is looking to close corporate stores and laying off most of it's retail staff.  It has already started where I live and now I have to go to work with the fear that my store is next and that I may potentially be laid off."
bad,I really enjoyed the work i was required to do. The company made it enjoyable to work. The managers tried to help make my job as smooth as possible. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the customers. My co-workers helped each other out whenever possible. The hardest part of the job was the last two years dealing with the company fighting with the union.
bad,It was a great environment to work in with awesome spiffs. I enjoyed meeting a diverse group of people. I loved solving customer's issues. I did not like the lack of communication within the company. I didn't like the discrepancies within Human Resources involving payroll.
bad,inbound customer call center. co-workers are nice. Most enjoyable part of the job going home everyday alive.
bad,This contract was split between VFNS and SRA. SRA treated everyone with respect and was very ethical. VFNS was at the time still being run by the old WorldCom folk. They still ran the company like it was WorldCom.
bad,nice family team work.  very laid back cause we got the job done.
bad,"help customers and try to sell them. take payments. "
bad,"work hard is the anthem,"
bad,worked closes with other people and business clients. Very fast paced environment
bad,"Great company to work for, excellent wages & benefits. 100% Tuition assistance."
bad,"Suggestive sales based on customer's wants and/or needs. Hosted conversations with customers reguarding billing, device issues and upgrade opportuniies."
bad,"As a training Facilitator my responsibility was to train, coach, and develop existing and new employees to Verizon, on methods and procedures so that they may be able to efficiently and productively perform the responsibilities of a Consumer Sales and Service Center representative. Ability to work independently with general supervision; work was checked at critical points. I planned, scheduled and executed my own daily activities. Responsible for communicating and keeping consultants well informed on all changes to procedure, and FCC compliance. Responsible for maintaining employee personal records, documentation of student progress, by submitting weekly progress reports, trend sheets, test scores, disciplinary documentation, termination documentation and time reports for payroll. Participating in conference calls in an effort to stay informed on the latest updates, releases, and promotions. I assisted the client with conducting remote observations of trainees, to monitor behaviors and to ensure that all were in compliance to FCC as well as corporate regulations. I assisted the office with analyzing productivity by coaching and development of consultants, while setting goals to improve sales and increase revenue. Monitored customer care results through calibrations and customer surveys. Created job aids and training material to assist the call center management team and associates in improving both average call handling time and revenue. Traveling when needed to various sales offices within the Verizon footprint, in an effort to conduct full initial training classes and or any"
bad,"This is for the call center - taking calls all day from angry people is no fun and can be soul draining, but you get paid well enough for it if you can tolerate it. Very competitive, which can be fun at times (internal rewards like candy, fake money for the employee store, etc.). Pretty good amount of opportunities to advance and/or move to other departments if you pass tests. Schedules are very strict. People call sometimes because they were told something in an actual store that wasn't completely true but the sales people were trying to make a sale, then the call center rep ends up having to explain and clean up after them, so that's really frustrating."
bad,"Overall experience was average. Definitely could have improved on work/life balance. If you are looking for a fast-paced environment, then this is the job for you! Go Sprint!"
bad,Everything is okay until I have a customer with a problem that no one has heard of. My supervisor does not have answers for anything if you do not know how to use resources then this is not a good job for you. Most people at this job are stressed out 75% of the day. I'm use to angry customer and have my ways with customers with making them calm down. If I had correct information from my supervisor then it would all be so simple.
bad,"Verizon pay is great but not worth the stress.  My typical day included addressing customer service inquiries in a timely and accurate fashion, "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,I worked for verizon wireless for 9 years.  It had its up and downs.  In the last year with the nee director ot has done a 360.  Of you love to sell then this company is for you.
bad,"Sending most technical jobs out of the US.  Very little opportunity.  Great people, but senior management has no clue how to make money in the wireline business."
bad,i had one of the best managers that anyone could ask for but the company from higher up is not making the best decisions at this time.  they are laying people off in that name of saving money but yet have on going plans to remodel one of their facilities at a cost of 13 million dollars.  for 13 million dollars they could have kept most of the people they let go of.
bad,"Every month you push yourself, and every month more is expected. like most sales jobs its who you know and not what you know. the benifits are great and thats why you stay.Pay is decent."
bad,"Working at Verizon was initially a fun, energetic, learning environment everyday.  You could advance in as a little in 6 months and the benefits were the best I every had.  My co-workers and I were always willing to help each other out even in situations that were out of our scope of support.  The most enjoyable part was being able to learn new technology before the public had it in their hands.  When management was away, Verizon gave me the opportunity to have a role to support the representatives.  The problem with Verizon is that they did not hold their outsourced representatives accountable for the lack of service provided to customers, their constant promises made to customers that were not in line with corporate policy, and basically not doing their job.  They allowed those reps to pass those situations on to corporate representatives such as myself to clean up their mistakes.  Now Verizon is closing 5 more corporate call centers and keeping the vendor centers instead.  That will lead to a severe drop in customer service experience and drive this once successful company down."
bad,"work tension,not clear regarding the work"
bad,Started out working with bassi eventually worked my way up to a FIOS technician.Working with Verizon was the Best job of my life.We went from Bell Atlantic to the usa best cable and cell phn service.customer satifation was a priority
bad,"A great company to work for until you get too old or make too much money and then you can expect to be laid off.  The people are great, but the fear of losing your job is awful."
bad,"Employees were always upset on a day-to-day basis. At this call center morale was low because when you walked into the facility someone most likely was fired the day before. The hardest part of this job was knowing if you would still have it tomorrow. The most enjoyable part of the is job was satisfying your customers.  My typical day consisted of: receiving high-volume calls from customers with issues with telephone service"
bad,"Mandatory overtime, stressful at times, pay is based on performance. Atmosphere is upbeat."
bad,"1) A typical day was working with customers to find their cellular needs."
bad,"Learned from the best there, will never forget what they taught me"
bad,"•	Effectively managed a high-volume of inbound and outbound customer calls."
bad,"This is a very good company to work for, good benefits, and diversity, they do try to have a good work life balance."
bad,Could be a great job but customer service representative can be a very challenging position.. it is very stressful and the hours for me are not good and it seems impossible to get a decent schedule.. its not fun in a call center in my opinion.. rarely looks forward to going in.
bad,Benefits and pay were great.. but not enough to make up for the job. If you like sitting at a desk all day with non stop calls coming in from angry customers who you have to make feel right then this job is for you.
bad,"I love the culture at Verizon. Sadly, the culture doesn't make it far down the company's ladder. They ask for specific goals, but do not always train everyone in time."
bad,very ok to be very ok place to work get along with everyone everything the customers are very fabulous they help me out a lot I was so happy to help them
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
bad,"Resolves administrative problems by coordinating preparation of reports, analyzing data, and identifying solutions. "
bad,"I did many jobs at verizon from installing phones in homes .business,govt.,and hospitals."
bad,I work from 2006 through April 2013 When two major departments in our corporate call center relocated to Ohio.  The  company kept to themselves about all the rumors of are call center closing until the last minute then the big announcement came they laid off 5200 workers and relocated to Tampa Florida.
bad,The work life balance and the competitive benefits make the company one of the best place to work in the corporate and retail industry.
bad,"As a company, Verizon Wireless takes care of their employees for the most part. You start off with paid vacation, they provide training, and they even have events on-site for holidays and customer service appreciation."
bad,"This is a franchise, they don't pay as much and don't have benefits like corporate."
bad,"I was placed in a 3 month contract as a frame center technician. This was to support the summer rollout and basically involved the execution of clec cuttovers and disconnects from the Frame center. The pay was good, tasks were simple, and the job was autonomous."
bad,look i dont work for verizon no more why all these question about them what do u need that for a different job this has nothing to do with me do u help find new jobs or do u investigate job i'm confussed
bad,"It was a lot to deal with and handle but I meet great people who encouraged me, and motivated me that wanted me to come to work.. "
bad,I do not care to discuss online.  The job was ok.  Just have to be a jack of all trades.
bad,Flexible timings and highly paid organisation which I ever worked. Micromanagement is a big problem. Work culture is really good and enjoyable. Don't know much about the management.
bad,Went downhill over the years. I was part of the 2015 lay offs when they closed a bunch of stores. Was my career for 15 years. They closed the store and didn't offer job placement. Commissions went way down over the last few years.
bad,Great experience with Verizon. Able to learn a lot from my coworkers. I’ve worked there for two years as an escort. Wanted to become a technician. To bad it was temp.
bad,"Great place to work, great people to work with.. lots of room for advancement"
good,"Open space environment. First come first serve sitting arrangements, Excessive work. Nice place to work. gained good experience. Provided many luncheons."
good,This company has horrible manager and no room to grown and move around the company. Id rather Babysit than work here and Im not a fan of kids. This company is famous for ripping of the good to replace it with worse
good,"In the process of cost cutting and redefining the management in the organization, unnecessary complexities are raised and work life became stressful. latest technologies are not implementing in the products. hence not much technical growth. learning only business of the organization."
good,"This job is a entry level job that require no skill, no room for any advancement. no kind of initiative for this job. Has a lot of personal talk going on between other employees and managers."
good,"If you want to party and work up to 7 days a week for sometimes months at a time this is the place for you.  Poor management - little to none and not trained.  Open the store at 8:30 send previous nights paperwork over, count cash drawer; make sure the floor looks clean and accessories are stocked as well as all phone displays are finger print free; inventory check making sure all devices make up with their correct individual code."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The managers are very partial. There is always a lot of pressure while taking calls.
good,This company no longer cares about their employees nor their customer I have been employed at verizon wireless for 8 year in that time I have watched the degradation of the company core philosophies no longer is it a company where employees or customers are valued just an attainment  of a number.What recently happend to the verizon wireless employees that were located at bjs speaks loudly of how employees are not valued by vzw...
good,Installing Fios into the customer premises on a daily basis. Also repairing customers services. The hardest part of the job is walking in the inclement weather.
good,"Job requirements were challenging and always exciting, but mgmt was not aware of how to manage or how work should be organized.  Talk to landlords, explain contract intricacies.  Speak to internal and external groups regarding questions.  Financial Analysis daily."
good,Top management is completely out of touch with IT. Decision are made in a vacuum.  They don't promote from within and they do not care about their employees. You are just a piece of furniture to be used until something better comes along. They lay off from IT every Fall.
good,"Stressful job, trainer was nasty and not helpful at all.  Treated us like we were were stupid.  Job is not for everyone, I wouldn't work there again.Bad"
good,"I worked my way up within Verizon Wireless through several roles and became a manager. Verizon culture expects managers to put in extra time though anything over 40 hours is paid at 1/2 your hourly rate. Store events and training often took place outside of retail hours, so very early in the morning or late at night. Managers were regularly expected to attend and lead events after hours and without compensation. In the end, despite hard work and above average performance I was laid off. I showed up to open my store and was told that my position had been ""affected"". Severance package and transitional opportunities were no where close to what was communicated and in the end after 3+ years with the company I was asked to exit through a side door so that the store staff would not ask any questions."
good,"I did not actually work for corperate but an retailer"
good,"I would not recommend anyone to work this positions, the hourly is not great and they claim to have advancements in positions but that is not the case."
good,"Making sales goals, making phone calls. The management could be better. The coworkers were great to work with. working for Verizon 4G was great for my first job , learned customer service."
good,"Greet customer, assist associates with servicing customers, caring for customer issues and training. Management did not display leadership, did not assist with development. Hardest part was not having the proper resources/tools. Resolving issues."
good,"Addressed problems customers brought into store."
good,"I learned various computer skills, helpful co-workers, the hardest part of my job was the time limitations with the clients who need more time, ex elderly, physical disabilities"
good,"Every release seemed like a hectic press, rather than management planning better to get things done so testers had time to do their job."
good,"Overall the company personally, I dont feel care about their employees, does not promote within, the work and life balance is slim to none, they dont care if you have a vacation scheduled and have bought flight tickets if they need you to come in, its just that no question, and will not refund you for your ticket, they like to threat employee with their jobs, instead of showing them how to improve."
good,"no advancement opportunities, Customers look at salesmen like crooks. scheduling is based on commissions the previous month. commissions can be charges back even after they have been paid out"
good,"Oddly strict setting; breaks are strictly scheduled...similar to grade school."
good,"Working at Verizon is like being the leader of a church group in a POW camp. You always have poor work life balance, dread coming in, get filled with empty promises, brainwashed that this is “the best you can get pay wise” and forced to interact with some of the most miserable humans you will ever meet. They trap you with good benefits and the possible earining opportunities. Once you realized that the constant commmision restructures make you work 4x harder for 2x less pay its too late. Voicing your concerns eliminates any chance of advancement. I was in a position where I constantly made those promotion choices and sat with groups of people who would bring up that one compalint and use it to abolish any of the individual’s accomplishments. Overall, the company is very misogynistic and I would keep searching. Save your metal health."
good,Upper management worries more about sales numbers than what the customer actually needs. Sales are more prioritized than giving the customer the service that they deserve and pay for
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,on phones at all times. no support for issues. mind less zombie required to work there. this place will suck the life out of you. please do your self a favor and stay away
good,I worked for a Alorica call center it is the worse place to work the management sucks they don’t care for their workers and if you have a kid or medical condition they make it seem like it doesn’t matter even if it’s from your doctor they also don’t tell you everything when u get hired they make it seem like it’s a great opportunity when it really isn’t
good,Verizon was a very tough organization to work for as they were only interested in KPI's and not the quality of servicing the customer.  Absolutely no work life balance.  Reps were held hostage.
good,"Stressful company to work at"
good,"The company  was an awesome place that employees looked forward to working daily when it was Bell Atlantic. Since the company merger the employees have had job security and stability stripped away. The company have major layoffs regularly. "
good,"It was a temp job that was supposed to last 6 months, but wound up being 2.  Very early, long hours but did allow for some time at home. The volume of business was inconsistent."
good,"it was a great job as a college student, the more you sell phones the more your commission is, not a lot of knowledge required, as long as your savvy at using smartphones and knowing their features."
good,"You could tell management wasn't too forthcoming with the direction of the company. The message was too inconsistent, with too many demands to meet with not enough support for meeting customers unrealistic demands. Customer service surveys were only used to remove service reps instead of improving performance."
good,"I do not have an accurate review to provide, as it has been many years since I worked for the company.************************************************"
good,"Struggling to keep customers due to upper management hawking retail employees to sell. Quotas were astronomically high, and have fun using your vacation time."
good,A typical day at work is troubleshooting the customers issues. Learned how to network with people. Management is average. Workplace is culture is ok. The hardest part of the job is the satisfaction of the customers.
good,A typical work day at Verizon Wireless is taking over 40 calls dealing with people issues and problem with either their phone services or their bills.
good,"quota is higher each month and the less people you have in a store, the more your quota goes up. Also consist of cold calling customers and also getting them to buy products that they get cheaper from other places."
good,"This company quickly transitioned from customer loyalty and appreciation to the plant on little shop of horrors. I can be unpleasant at times, however, when you allow a culture of people to take charge who believe in having to not work for theirs, it becomes toxic. Leaders and mangers in place are simply there by favoritism. Thankfully my position was disbanded and I separated respectively with compensation for the 6 years. Would not recommend unless you have no ethics or morals. Could not wait to go home the last year, couldn't be happier!"
good,"The company makes great strides to ensure we are employing current management strategies disciplines.  Verizon was quick to embrace ITIL, Lean Six Sigma, and Agile.  I personally led a project creating ITIL based processes."
good,"Employers failed to notify me that the job was 100% commission based and lied telling me it was an hourly pay job. Worked from 10am to 10pm, sometimes later for a period of two weeks with no base pay at all. Dedicted over sixty hours to the company before someone told me I wasn't makling money."
good,"They did not care about how you were as an emplyee or how well you did your job. They only care about numbers and how well you sell products, even if that means screwing over people who can't afford the things you sell them. Even if that means you Lie to get people to buy the products."
good,"I worked as an account manager. I did not enjoy being yelled at all day long, but I was proud of my ability to turn a negative situation into a positive one. I often felt like I was being led on with incentives to improve, and when the goal was met or surpassed, the reward was never delivered.  I felt that this job was based more on selling than on customer needs and satisfaction. Breaks were at certain times, weather you just got there or not. and Weather you needed it then or not. You were in trouble if you were 1 minute late from break."
good,"Feels more like a politician giving you information then an actual person. Always a hidden objective, or a good ol boys club getting a direct answer on any company matters."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Job started at 11:30 am and work until finished. Several days we were done within 4 hours. once or twice we got to work 8 hours. I was heard onto a bus and told that i would work at Disney because business was slow at Verizon. You either did it or quit. There was a problem because we were not allowed to take anything with us to Disney, not even lunch. we were told that we would be bused back on our lunch to retrieve our belongings. only problem was lunch was 3o minutes. no time to eat,."
good,"Work life balance here is not good if you have a family. The expectations are a little far fetched. If all you want to do is sale items to anyone breathing by any means, this is the job for you."
good,This job initially was meant to be a part time position in exchange for school credits but then somehow became a full time position. Its a sales company more thn anything who sells their employees a pipe dream of owning their own office in a door to door capacity of sales. With the capacity to make over 6 figures with. As a salesman I was naturally a good fit and then office environment was although laidback very professional and everyone helped everybody. But ultimately the dream I realized that was sold to me was being sold to every new employee. As I sit their watching them get brainwashed I realized that i no longer wanted to be apart of it and moved on.
good,Not a good place to work for.Services is terrible and most of the managers are always on their cell phones and have a terrible experience with customers.
good,"-fast paced"
good,"Working there with the people I was, was fun. Always had a good time, but there was no sense of professionalism. There was no room for advancement in the company, no matter how many times they promised you. The store was always very slow, there for easy for my coworkers to goof off periodically. Not a very promising company, perfect for someone coming out of highschool."
good,Experience was less then desireale. No opportunity to advance. The good points were it allows one to build a resume.
good,I like the company but I would like to advance my career. The advancement is limited and doesn't seem to be based on skills rather who you know.
good,"Very depressing place to work, management completely out of touch and do not care."
good,very good location to work because it is in the mall by the foodcourt
good,Worked more hours than scheduled and they fire people at will for non fireable reasons and keep others that should be fired for things that are non ethical.
good,"When I first started with Verizon it was a good place to work, many people working to improve other, As time progress Verizon became more focused on their bottom line and their share holders rather then customers or their front line. Upper management would not see the problems around them and instead promoted people that had no business being promoted. Favoritism run deep in Verizon as well, brown nosing or being in the right group is what will get you promoted or keep you from being targeted by upper management. Being fair and understanding of your employee is frowned upon, its encouraged to be a jerk."
good,I don't have enough good things to share.  If you are looking at retail be prepared to have very little work life balance.  Expect to work ALL holidays except for Christmas and Easter.  It's a pretty thankless place to work.
good,There are favorites within your own store.  You can have a family atmosphere but you always have to watch your back. everyone is trying to get a leg up.
good,"Verizon is a company that looks at numbers, it is high pressured and demanding. The management does not have the knowledge to adequately support their teams but teams are expected to perform regardless."
good,"I’ve had my experience, best of of luck to those who wish to explore Verizon Wireless as a career opportunity. You definitely develop long lasting bonds."
good,"Just No, Job Work/Life balance non-existent, education-reimbursement is a fraud, management lacks skill and setup employees to fail, job culture is deceitful."
good,"no work life balance, the workload is overwhelming. You are expected to do things outside of your job title. You must have a lot of patience. Customers are rude."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Work/ life balance was non existent. Rate of pay was always changing- lowering the commissions or front line workers. Goals were way over the top.....
good,"time for a new challenge. 18 years at verizon looking for new motivation, growth, surroundings. lack of life, lack of stimulations. tired of constantly being micromanaged. felt like a robot."
good,There is no reward for tenure with good performance. Verizon plays a political roll when promoting. Verizon promotes incompetent management and does not listen to lower lever employees. Commissions are getting harder and harder to hit and consistently finding ways to hinder a decent commission. Reps are constantly threatened with a process called pip for termination. I exceed all of my targets and have been to over 12 interviews for a assistant manager position only to be overlooked. I have worked for the company for 10 years and have watched it slowly deteriorate. I’m looking for other employment as we speak. Verizon is a company that looses good employees because they could care less about them. I do not recommend working for this company if you have a family. Retail is slowly dying.
good,"I liked working here until I realized I couldn't advance whatsoever. The manager didn't run her business in a professional manner. However, working with customers gave me very good experience and helped me understand people more."
good,"Knowing the management is the key.  No rewards for your quality jobs, these for others who know the management and take a drink after work.  All commissions given to who know the supervisors."
good,"Verizon Wireless, lack business and operational processes. The management is poor, and the company is more interested delivery then product efficiency."
good,"Verizon, like many other Telecom companies, continues to search for lower overhead solutions with continuous layoffs and outsourcing. Enjoyed time there with friends made, after many years of employment, but joy unfortunately overshadowed by poor management, low morale, and constant concern of losing your job."
good,This is good place to work if you are fresh out of college and want to get a taste of how corporations will try to do you over and take advantage of you in every way possible.
good,"I didn't enjoy my tenure at Verizon. The job becomes stressful and during those times management is down your back to push sales. There is a high rate of fraud and it is unfair sometimes. Highly competitive, so if you don't like that, this is not the job for you. Also you will ALWAYS be there, no work life balance"
good,I had to constantly stay on my toes to beat the other sales associates to the punch. I had to call customers and try to pitch them add ons to their plan and I didn't enjoy the work environment or the clients
good,"Management was horrible. "
good,"You are subject to having a good, bad, or absent manager .  At times it does not matter how hard you work because your superior may be afraid of being let go.  In an ideal work environment it would be encouraged to work hard and even make mistakes, however it is not like this here . Everyone is overworked and the lazy employees are rewarded while the ones that work hard suffer in silence."
good,Typical day involves interaction with clients and product development. Very Good training programs. Culture of promoting cronies and favorite employees.
good,"Verizon is a very competitive sales environment. Bad days are not allowed here, though they'll tell you otherwise."
good,"After many years working for Verizon, I worked for a manager I just couldn't deal with.  The senior leadership is very cut-throat and you really have to find the spots where you are on a good team in order to be insulated from the rude, demeaning behavior of leadership.  Not  female friendly."
good,"•	I would try and get a jump start on my day by coming in at least an hour before anyone. Systems wouldn’t update until after team was out of the building most days."
good,snakepit do not trust anyone.They treat employees and customers poorly . Internal politics are the rule and not the exception. Senior leaders changed targets and pay monthly.
good,"words of advise: if you are capable of being quiet for 9 hrs straight for 40 hrs a week.... this could be the job for you. Management will twist everything you say and do. Customers are a hit or miss. Training is lacking and is lead by uneducated managers who will blame everything on you to save themselves. Do not go work for a retailer! go work for corporate! This was probably the most awful job i tried to stay at. I refuse to work a retail job again after working for these people. Your Wireless will cheat you and their customers to get one step closer to a bigger paycheck. Lastly, education is non-important when it comes to employees. A college graduate makes the same amount as someone without their GED."
good,"HR doesn't help out employees, defends management. Will conducts  investigations and never fill you in. Not a trustworthy company. Zero work family balance!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"They hire contracts to fix what the SME's won't.  Treated very poorly. In the meantime, we are forced to fix what SME's won't.  Zero job security, but yet to fix issues that full time engineers are required too."
good,Trying to expand in multiple directions  and not sure how its going to workout. Its loosing its grip of a technological giant. Too much bureaucracy which eventually will be cause of its overall downfall.
good,"This company is very strong and pays well, But they lack in diversity in application of the word and culture. If you do not walk a certain walk or speak in a certain tongue then you may be ex communicated and sent to walk the plank."
good,"If you get in at the employee level, this could be a great company. I entered as a contractor. While I found the culture to be fun and exciting, management had unrealistic expectations. Expectations for 1 person to do the work of 5 or 6 people. Even the employees stated that there was too much work for 1 person. The company needs to start hiring more people if they want the work done faster."
good,"I was with this company for over 12 years, I learned from the basic skills of opening a store to the overall operation of the store at the store. The hardest part of Verizon, it changes too often. What I mean by this, you can come back from a week of vacation and things have changed."
good,Not alot of room to move up the corporate ladder..... unless you know someone already there. Expectations are to do better in every single category every single month regardless of anything that could help or prevent that from happening.
good,I loved working for Verizon because i worked in the small town of Orting where i grew up and knew everyone and could talk about the town with them. I made a lot of great relationships with people and grew as a good rep in the community so i got a lot of people referred to me. What i didn't like was the commission part of it and how hard management was on you for it. I grew to care for these people and develop relationships i didn't want to be forced to sell things to them i know they didn't want or need and got in trouble when i didn't.
good,"as we all know, Verizon is one of the higest cellphone availability in the US. While the staff is very friendly for the most part, it is quite dificut to grow in the company, incentive commissions are hard to achieve."
good,What can i say.  I worked in a call center that took 411 traffic.  Local management was good.  Sad part was the people up in corporate cared nothing about the workers.  They shifted our jobs overseas
good,"Taking 48 inbound technical support phone calls daily "
good,"This job gave me an opportunity to work with individuals that I otherwise might not have chosen to work with. That being said, I do not regret my experiences with this company. I needed to communicate with people in the office and on the phone that on my own, I probably wouldn't have dealt with or crossed their path. This is a very good thing. We need to view all of our experiences and lessons that we must go through."
good,"I worked for a outsourcing agency called APAC who was a company managed by global expert solutions. my problem was not with the verizon account itself, but rather the treatment that the employees received. when I worked there I worked there for a little under a year, during that time they kept changing policy, increasing demands, and breaking promises of bonuses and increases in pay. of the over 500 employees in the call center I always ranked within the top 10% on a monthly basis, but was overlooked for promotion simply because I did not play office politics, or suck up to my employers begging for special treatment. overall I would rate Verizon itself highly, as every interaction I had with corporate was rather pleasant, however I believe that they need to choose who they let represent them better."
good,i worked here for almost 10 year and the pay was the only think that keep me here. manager get no training and they cheat customers to hit number . that is why i had to leave i have integrity and this company doesn't
good,"no balance for work life and,  home life. Good hourly wages thanks to the union.Used to have good benefits ,but thats been sliding over the years"
good,"My job is a great work place if you are competitive and love to impress your supervisor. However it is very far from my home and they wont cooperate with me and transfer me somewhere closer to home. The management is horrible as far as their role in the store, bur they are understanding of family emergencies and I can appreciate that."
good,"Verizon was a very difficult job to work at dealing with customer trying to order phones to sell to other people for money. So on are side we have to confirm order to verify that we are speaking to the right person. On a typical day was getting yelled at customers,confirming orders."
good,"This job is for school kids with no responsibility. Not stable, schedules are not a pro in this company. I guess this is how retail in the communications field works"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I have worked for Sprint and Now version, the money was good but working for Verizon i now realize what they mean by ""money can't buy happiness"". Now, I love sales and made record numbers but they are going in the direction of customer care instead of what the job is and thats sales. I do believe that customer experience is  valuable and important. However, Verizon is now allowing that to effect their profits in a negative way. It has also now caused a lot of long time employees to loose their jobs and or push them out the door."
good,"•	Review, audits, validates security findings based on agreed IT Governance."
good,"I helped and assisted customers by creating an extraordinary experience. I used suggestive selling techniques to increase revenues. I also worked with peers to share strategies, helping to develop others and increase store results."
good,The management was always changing.  We had a different supervisor on average of every two months.  We did receive our breaks on a consistent basis.  The supervisors did not really get to know their team.  Very good benefits and pay.
good,Good culture towards promoting and driving sales. Hard to maintain a work-life balance.
good,"The job itself was great, as long as you could do your job and leave, I tried my best to get in, do my job and get out."
good,There were unrealistic expectations and standards of position.  You were timed on everything you did including how many bathroom breaks and how many.  Management was unprofessional and inexperienced.  Micromanging.
good,"Job is very unprofessional, management knows less than CSRS. The overall work environment is not healthy."
good,Poor Company to work for. Constant change to how you make money and really do not care about their employees. Verizon only cares about the bottom line.
good,The job itself was great it was the management and how they bent the rules when convient for themselves
good,"People do not stay at this job for a reason. If you hire experienced sales professionals, give them a decent base salary and a reasonable quota.  The quota here is twice that of the competition and the prices they charge customers are double the competitors' prices. Less than 20% of the sales force makes quota monthly. Turnover is about 75% in one year. The one good thing is the the benefits are really good."
good,I worked at Verizon for 7 years the benefits were great but the unto achievable goals were ridiculous. I did technical support and the job was easy but management kept pushing sales on things that did nothing for the customer or you. Things changed all time and the turn over rate was ridiculous as well. If you want to advance in the company you have to know somebody in management that likes you. Very cliquiesh environment that changes all the time. Great job for the time but not a company to grow with.
good,I would rather not comment anything about these two companies other than I didn't like it
good,"Challenging , multi -task oriented . responsible for providing excellent customer service in trouble shooting customers connection."
good,Very reactive work atmosphere.  Majority of the day spent on customer escalations.  Great co-workers and some work life balance with telecommuting options
good,It was a nice place to work. But under staffed under inventoried. The customers were great.
good,"verizon retail is very new to retail industry making its foot print in odisha localy & needs long way to go, challing work place, good management support & retail is linked with multilevel marketing."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,this company will not give a chance to grow unless they lke you period
good,Productive and Fun workplace .Very fast pace and many changes.
good,It is not a place to work if you want consistent policies and mature management. They have a revolving door and it's because they feel all employees are replaceable
good,Trusting your leader can be difficult when they are not engaged in your success. People who been there for awhile should get more respect and honored. I was forced to resign and at the time they did not have Part-Time but now they do from what I heard. Corporate is a dangerous place to work when seeking longevity.
good,I worked for a contracted company for Verizon Wireless. We handled their customers. The environment I worked in would attest to the dislike of the overall company
good,"Good place to begin your career.  After 19 years with Verizon, I'm pleased to say it is a great environment if you are looking to learn.  Fast paced, fun.  Tends to promote mediocre candiates into leadership."
good,"Manager was awful, but the job was great. Pay was really good. Loved working with all the customers. My manager was mean and made me lose interest in the job. If it wasn't for I'd still be there."
good,"I worked multiple chats and while most of the chats were fine, there where a few that would challenge me and the managers where most of the time helpful. It's fast paced"
good,"Spearheading projects such as printer"
good,From the day training ended the office changed everything they told us. Starting with mandatory Saturdays for the next year. It wasn’t until the union got involved that we worked Saturday’s every other month. Mandatory overtime in the summer causing no work/life balance. The requirements to make goal change monthly and the company makes it harder and harder to make your bonus. There’s no room to grow. Managers have their favorites as usual. They make up their own rules. The office was dark and depressing
good,"Not consistent, they keep changing. We used to be able to work at any store make our own schedule. Not anymore. Hard to hot standards of you don't speak Spanish and English well."
good,The communication between upper management and management was horrible. The goals were so high most people would give up half way through the pay cycle.
good,Worked hard for a Verizon retail company but die to inadequate management ended up being the only one in the store. I still maintained daily inventory and sales achievements on my own.
good,"Heavy workload all the time, they have employees competing against each other and abrasive management (intentionally).  I believe the idea is to try and get employees to  work harder, but instead it makes for a toxic work environment."
good,If you want to work for a company that values the stockholders more than the people actually doing the work then choose Verizon.  They recently laid off 40000 employees due to corporate greed.
good,"Verizon was a great company were you learn the essentials of sales and customer service. Excellent company to work for with lots of training and employee development. Bonus structures have changed, however, phenomenal company."
good,Hard to move from customer service to other corporate positions. They wanted more supervisors in customer care and wanted to push employees to fill those roles.
good,"I don't want to write a review , the culture deteriorated with the new management taking over. I do not recommend employment there. It is easy to have a poor working experience there."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I worked there for 15 years. I was worked hard and had little rewards.  The work life balance was hard.  Leadership was not consistent and the executives were so focused on money like old ma bell, instead of the employees."
good,"The Benefits are great! No  dress code,  literally! I prefer a more professional setting.  They change commission structure, rich is the norm but to change it to the impossible where your veterans address claiming they don't see the same money they use to.  The inconsistencies from one center to the next.  In the Tampa location customer service would recieve several appreciation days, friends and family functions,  ect. We would be in the same building and wouldn't get. 00009 percent of what they recieve. The main issue wasd the amount of time you have to spend there.  People would work from open to close top make money.."
good,"Constant commission restructures ensure that you can’t make much money. The company wants to work you as hard as they can, but only make themselves money in the process. If not for the benefits I don’t know that anymore would work here."
good,I wouldn’t work here again but if you need to have a steady job with a steady decent income than I do recommended it 10/10. You just need to have a strong personality to deal with thousands of callers complaining every day.
good,"Wanna work for little money, get told to commit fraud, deal with poor management, Check it out! Although this company left me with a bad taste in my mouth, I do have friends that love it."
good,"Lack of management, change of work schedule at the drop of a hat, change of pay structure at the drop of a hat, hard to take a day off, and make you travel to meetings at 5:00am for nothing..."
good,"Working at this company was great for learning various communication skills with various customers. The culture of the team wasn't great and made for a stressful work day. Scheduling could be flexible at times, but there was no PTO."
good,"No matter which level you are in... you have to have a god father to survive. Gone are the days where Performance, commitment, dedication has any value in this organization. Current leadership and the HR team have no core values in the org. "
good,"They are in the process of ridding the company of their bargained for employees, through attrition and contract language that provides no job security."
good,"The company acts as if it is trying to make changes to help with the work and life balance.  The frontline redesign program is all talk.  The purpose was to reduce workload.  Instead, the company added more work to be completed but did not remove any. "
good,"Each day was different. I worked in a call center where 1/3 of the computers didn't function and you never had the same place to sit the next day. "
good,In 13 years I never took medical leave.I had severe events in my life that impacted my health.  I went back to work when it wasnt recommended and lost my job bc I took time off.
good,Management was not a thing while I worked there. There was no structure or leadership. Every employee was treated differently and we were never informed about a lot of information we that we had rights to know.
good,"It is not that bad of a job, the sales goals continue to get higher, and the way their compensation structure changes every year, it will soon be not worth it. It seems like the reps with the most questionable ethics are the ones making the biggest checks sadly."
good,good start up job to get into corporate has a lot of potential to get good at face to face. a lot of time to brush up on skills to build rapport you can utilize any sales tactic.
good,Generally a good old boys club and very difficult to advance unless you had connections. No mentoring or development took place and most supervisors and managers were legacy employees from acquisitions. Some good most bad....
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant monitoring/threats of punishment or termination. The goals are often unrealistic and management used fear and punishment as a means to motivate. You don't get any time off the phone outside of your breaks and lunch, calls are literally back to back your entire shift. You are not given the proper tools or enough time to solve the many problems customers call in about and are required to sell to every single customer regardless of their satisfaction. There is no work life with required overtime and no sick time outside of FMLA. The culture is being made to feel like you are never good enough and your one mistake away from being fired. The call center job is also under constant threat of being shipped overseas and every few years you have to worry about going on strike, working without a contract, reduction in benefits or office closures. "
good,"Depending on the area that you live in a brick and mortar may be available.  The Charleston, SC office has decided to close so we are now working from home or relocating to a state that has a brick and mortar. Depending on which leadership is on your schedule depends on the environment, it can either be very fun and positive or negative. This is a very stressful job and very negative as well. Nothing is ever good enough."
good,"If your ok with coming in every day and acting perfectly corporately politically correct. Using the same corp. lingo, no worries, fair enough, just reaching out to you, hope all is well. If your not best buds with your boss forget about advancement."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"This job for me was a temporary position, but I would have loved to have had the opportunity to gain a permanent position.  I never worked on a project such as this before and it was a great experience."
good,the supervisors knew next to nothing about the job. the learning documents where useless. the customers where rude and there was no room for advancement. all promotions where a popularity contest
good,"Younger employees knew how to fake actually working and only worked 5 hours a day.  They worked the system while older employees who were conscientious with a good work ethic, gave 7+ hours a day and did the more challenging work, eventually got punished for it."
good,"Verizon does give it's employees great benefits, but the job itself is taxing. The rapidly changing pay structure and mixed messages from management and ""leadership"" make this job very frustrating."
good,"12 hour work days "
good,I learned a lot with this company. Very strenuous quota and high stress environment. A lot of product knowledge is necessary. Quite a bit of micro management.
good,"The job was good when they were paying commission but since then they have gone to all hourly and made it impossible to make a living and raise a family. This job has turned into the high school worker, or college worker. Not the lifetime employee."
good,Wireless Company a working hard type of corporate with almost no time for family or down time to any fun. In my time working for them i made year over year sales increase in my location at Bjs club.
good,"Verizon/Gulf Coast Services a true employable company, Non-Discrimination."
good,This was great experience for me. I loved the work environment. The manager was fair and concise in what was required from everyone.  I did not however liked how the employees treated contractors.
good,Working for this company I had no free time open 7 days a week.You also work holidays weekends .Have to hit your numbers or look forward to being written up.Pay is great but not work the time you waste of your life
good,this job was challenging and fun.  I learned constantly since technology is always changing. My co-workers were family.
good,"The training was  great experience once the strike was over major layoffs occurred . The majority of the team that was there has 30 years of experience and do not want to share the knowledge. it took forever to get the Union to listen, once everything was running smoothly they started to do mass layoffs."
good,Very little regard for hard work and loyalty. No incentive to advance to Management. No job security as Management. Fair salary.
good,Great pay but culture is awful --all stick and no carrot. No appreciation for a job well done. Work life balance is not respected.
good,"the best part of this job are my co-workers, I really enjoyed meeting different people. I have learned great customer service skills."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great place to work but the future is not reliable. Verizon made job cuts last year and let go over 1000 employee. It impacted alot of lives but other than that it was a great company to work for with great benefits.
good,"While the work is not difficult (though stressful) and the compensation is adequate, the work culture, management and advancement system is beyond repair. Verizon has gone so far into its legal shell that they can no longer see that their ""fair"" hiring practices are a) anything but; and b) cause them to lose valuable talent. It saddens me that I threw away 6 years of my working life on a promise of advancement that was never really going to be kept. I would not advise my enemies to apply to work for them let alone my friends or family."
good,"If you are a driven salesperson, this is a great company to work for. You can prove to yourself every day what you're worth and Verizon Wireless believes in compensating producers."
good,"Access Excel spreadsheet tracker, Quickbase, Siterra, Network Flow and Outlook email. Research changes in tracker and software programs and enter newly acquired data into Quickbase. Interact with co-workers as to what data needs to be added into Quickbase. I am a contract worker with the title of data entry clerk working at Verizon through Rangam Consultants. I perform my duties with little to no supervision from management."
good,"It's a great place to work and further your overall business knowledge within the organization and outside as well with their great tuition reimbursement programs. "
good,"Management talks on Sig Sigma but teams are not practising Sig Sigma. Though 24/7 is not required but implementing by Management, it is effecting health. Overall company is good but it need some change in Delivery Management"
good,Company hired close to 600 employees and only remained open for less than a year.  Company hired employees who had no customer service experience.  Environment was very unprofessional.
good,"Getting to work and immediately having to get a sale"
good,"Verizon gave me an opportunity to enhance and better my customer service skill set."
good,It's out of Verizon's comfort zone and they've struggled to incorporate everything about Terremark from the technology to the compensation.
good,"It was not a hard job, just busy! I can tell you this if you decide to quit and put in a two weeks notice they will terminate you on the spot and even though you have direct deposit they will cancel that and mail you your last check. So if you have a new job you better tell them the day before you start your new job."
good,"There is a lot of ""bait and switch"". That is all I will say, you can apply at your own risk. One hand they say don't worry how long a call takes, but then be off in 15minutes."
good,"I've been working at Verizon for almost 5 years. Always striving to follow the model from Senior Direction but the mid-level management has a mind of their own. Benefits are good a pay-grade is on par with industry. However, like many major firms in the U.S. stocks run our lives and profit is where the buck stops; and the U.S. employees take a back seat while majority of jobs are shipped offshore to Philippines where dollars are sold for profits."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for.  It's core values means a lot.  However sometimes the values and the duties of the job are on separate ends of the table depending on who you work under.  Some in management only care about numbers and not the core value and credo of the company.  So you may be put in a position where you are forced to do something you don't agree with.
good,great place to work for benenfits/pay..upper management is horrible my office started with 220 people when i started when i left there was 95 people remaining
good,"Fun and relaxed work place, great coworkers, and great environment"
good,"Huge company with very little visibility.  Extremly hard to move up or around.  Great benefits, ok pay, typically flexible in terms of time off, appointments ect."
good,"loved the people I worked with, but upper management didnt care about who you are or what you did"
good,Working with customers on new accounts and going over details of their accounts billing as well as assisting with technical support and setting up email address for new hires and helping my team lead with this process
good,Everyone has to have their hand in the pot and no one knows what's ACTUALLY going on.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Constant employee changes, compensation changes for the worse, the costs of phones got so high and reimbursement so little that they started selling Certified Pre Owned phones only!"
good,"long work days that include evenings,weekends, and holidays."
good,"Primary focus is numbers and metrics, humanistic and employee concern comes secondary"
good,"Productive and structured atmosphere, very good compensation and benefits including Healthcare"
good,had to answer calls all day about customers not paying there bill or having to call them to pay there bills so services wouldnt be shut off.
good,long day... no time for breaks... poor management... low morale... no respect... code of conduct not followed... everyone treated as if doing something wrong... long commute... company wont allow transfer to office closer to home
good,"Too much work can burn any one out. Especially work that goes unnoticed. There was no such thing as a social life, working here."
good,Verizon Wireless exposed me to a new  business  culture. Sadly for a communications company  it lacks in this fundamental business practice.  It was a  great  place to work my co workers  where exceptional.
good,"Being employed at Verizon Wireless for 16 years allowed me to gain valuable work and interpersonal skills.In the late 1990's and early 2000's advancement was based purely on job performance, education and willingness to take on new tasks. Once Verizon Corporate began departmental synergizing with Wireless, advancement became more about who you knew and not what you knew. While I have nothing bad to say about my time of employment there,my opinion is as the company grew it also lost their core corporate values they always prided themselves on  "
good,"Responsible for coordinating implementation activities between the customer, internal groups (e.g., order entry, provisioning) and third party client/vendor resources as needed"
good,"My experience with Verizon Wireless was OK. I was not happy with management and co workers were ok. The hardest part of job was, i was treated as a robot."
good,"Since the helpdesk operates 24/7, this means you will probably have to work a night shift including weekend days at first. You will have to work some holidays, including christmas if you are unfortunate enough to get a lesser desired schedule. The helpdesk gets back to back calls from 8am all the way to 8pm. In general, there is never a break between calls as long as you are working. There is very little room for advancement in this branch of the company. Tier 1 agents cycle over by the dozens but Tier 2 and supervisory roles very seldom have any change to staff."
good,taking calls from commercial accounts resolving issues and providing great customer service
good,Employed with the Verizon for 8 years and was terminated as first offence for an innocent mistake. I had an outstanding work history and created a distinguished record that was never taken in consideration when terminating me.
good,Commission only based sales job perfect for someone who is single and wants to dedicate their life to work.
good,"The management was very disconnected, there was a company shift between me working there between privately owned and company ownership."
good,Temp company that closed down. very bad experience with management and company
good,A lot to learn in short period of time.
good,Love the customers happy when they purchase phones and the customer is happy with what they purchased.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A typical day at work: get in at 8:30AM, eat lunch at your desk and work until 7PM. Constant communication via email /IM. Schedule is packed with meetings; typically you work while listening in."
good,most enjoyable part of the job is the end of february bonus & company celebration
good,"Excellent training materials, on the job great chance to learn the business."
good,they are OK to work for. it is a highly stressed job and management like to micro manage you in every way
good,High priority on buying customer satisfaction instead of actuality solving issues. Management was disconnected from the day-to-day stresses of excessive metric tracking
good,Everyone there was very supportive. Upper management did little to encourage growth. I didn't like how you were forced to change supervisors every 6 months because it requires some time to develop a good raport.
good,$100k/ year job that only requires a high school diploma.  verizon hasn't hired outside field technicians since the year 2000.  for those fortunate enough to have these jobs the corporation seems determined to drive all their best employees away by providing no reason to stay once pension eligible.
good,"Commission was almost impossible to make. Very slow internet, which caused long wait for customers. Many walked potential sales because of slow service."
good,I have nothing to say about this company. I've worked for them in the past but I am looking for something more permanent.  They do not convert their contractors.
good,I worked here 7 years. It's corporate America folks. Sell your soul to sell phones and other unnecessary devices. I made some great friends here. You have to because you will spend your whole life at work I'm talking 60 hours a week if you want to move up. Then even after years of employment nothing is ever secure. Work for yourself people!
good,"No communication between Store management up to higher management. There was always conflicting expectations and unobtainable goals at times. They intend to make sure that you make as little as possible so if you do well one month, expect your quote to sky rocket in 2 months and you will be back to eating ramen and crackers."
good,"Management uses scare tactics about job security to increase productivity and will “work” people out of the business. The company tries to control your behavior and if unsuccessful, you may be targeted"
good,Version gave me a great platform with customer service and I learned a lot for sure. As for the company itself in my opinion they do not care about their employees. The pay is not the best unless you’re there 24/7. While working for version it’s all about work so forget about having a social life.
good,"The culture at this company has changed, unqualified people are getting promotions while tenured employees that have the experience are getting passed over for management positions.  Leadership leads a lot to be desired"
good,"fun fast place environment "
good,Most important key take away:  to make your monthly numbers you have to trick the end user (consumer) aka lie to make your numbers.  Trust and believe once you lie to an end user your credibility goes out the door and you have a return which affects your quotas next month.
good,"Pay, benefits are pretty good but overall I would stay away. Layoffs every year and a lot of people making decisions who are out of touch with what is really going on."
good,"My final position was both good and bad. I was fortunate enough to travel all over the US and go places I normally would have not gone to. My boss was great, however his boss was a bit intolerable and micromanaged every step our team made."
good,"Leadership ha changed and the culture as changed for the worse. It is no longer the good company it once was. The new CEO is a clown. For example he talks about the 5G build out but when asked what are the financial benefits for being first , he said there really is no benefit for being first. However at Verizon it is a number 1 priority."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Lots of transition and change with the co. Highly compensated but lots of changes the past 3 years. First years at the company were great and stable market pressure has hurt work culture
good,"This position was a BETA trial for Verizon and eventually offered me no stability and security.  This company allowed me to pay off bills, but has a strong atmosphere of favortism and not for the sensitive or someone who expect to be appreciated for dedication and hard work.  There is a lot of crabbing"
good,It paid good but they really don’t care about you the way they say they do. It’s more to life than Verizon and once you treat your employees better maybe your customers might be a little bit more satisfied.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was when the team had to meet goals in order to gain rewards. Management was fair and understanding.  They were always willing to help their employees in during crisis situations.
good,Have to play politics in order to move upwards. Company is going through a lot of changes so job security is definitely not there. This is a good company to start off your sales career since training is pretty extensive.
good,Verizon Wireless started as a great company but slowly went downhill. The work and life balance became nonexistent as employees stressed just to obtain a paycheck.
good,"Verizon has taken the view of getting rid of the older employees with experience and hiring younger employees with no experience.  If over the age of 45, then forget about any upward mobility."
good,"Verizon acts like if you do the most basic work you will receive a commission check of 1,200 each month. More than half of our store does not reach that goal regularly. Not to mention, those checks are taxed I think 35%. "
good,"This is a highly recommended company however, management only care about themselves and will throw you under the bus at any moment, instead of trying to help. You can have the most stressful day and you can't get off of the phones. You're forced to deal with the negativity no matter what happens!!!!"
good,"Verizon is cutting edge in technology. Never a dull moment. Always learning, sometimes too quickly. They will keep you on your toes for sure. Not always a good thing."
good,Unless you are willing to move to New Jersey forget about career advancement. The company offers excellent benefits and salary but get comfy in your role because you will be in it for a long time.
good,when i firs started at verizon it was just for customer service.  the job then changed to offering products.  it then changed to making sales and had a quota attached.  it was very stressful.
good,"Verizon is a great company. I've learned many things during my time there. However, the company has placed leaders in positions that have completely demoralized the team."
good,"Co-workers/peers are great & want to get the job completed successfully, but upper management gets in the way with bureaucracy.  Good benefits!!  Morale is very low!!"
good,"I worked for the company for over 25 years and submitted over 70 internal applications for advancement during that time.  I was only provided 3 or 4 interviews from all of the applications.  There was very little promotion within my department (any of the several I was a member of over the years).  Most promotions I witnessed were to other departments.  The compensation and benefits were wonderfully negotiated by the union.  Verizon paid for most of my advanced degree programs, but did not appreciate my efforts to improve and try to give back on their investment in me.  I retired and am using those degrees to pursue positions away from the company."
good,"stressfull, if the mamgers dont like you they will find a way to get rid of you.  The stress no union for them to do as they please, the directors and ceos are in the blind of the real things between managers supervisors and reps all frontline."
good,"but the same managers that came up thru the ranks of the toxic culture are the same ones to implement the creedo. unless you behave like the old culture, these managers will hide behind the creedo and say you are not honoring some part of the creedo. the mangers are protected so it is losing proposition for non union people to fight. however, the c-suite has been offering many of these managers a ""retirement package"" and most of them have been taking it. so there is hope the creedo will actually be honored by management completely. but it is still a slow change because of so many of the old culture managers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"During my 10 months with the company there was a lot of ups and downs working for them. For example, the managers were not alway easy to get in touch with. Second, the store was in a supermarket and we had no doors and a lot of customer complaints. Lastly, store closed down couple months ago due to business"
good,Verizon has great benefits! Work life balance doesn't exist so if you have a significant other hopefully they understand the retail world or you will have issues.
good,"In my three and a half years spent at Verizon as a Solution Specialist. I found it beneficial networking with thousands of people and being in touch with hundreds till this day forward. The company started out great for my co-workers and myself. Although, the strategy for career building was absent for many of us. A select few representatives moved on early to expand their career with the company. We all worked at a location called The Verizon Destination Store and it was a learning process for both the company and upper management. The company spent millions of dollars to come up with this concept. However, the location was not thought out, because the company had to downsize that particular location from over 80 employees to now less than 15 employees. Some of us like myself had the opportunity to keep our positions and move on to another locations. But many of the seasoned individuals where giving severance packages. I believe the company has plenty of great benefits, however I do not believe the company is doing the best out of all it's competitors."
good,I was a Managed Services support for the group. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting into very large accounts and positioning Managed Services offerings.
good,"it was extremely stressful I never got to see my family, I wasn't allowed to go to the restroom without being questioned about it. they give you old inventory as thankyou gifts and are fine with you being verbally assaulted"
good,"The pay was low, and the stress was high, the training set expectations that were not true as to what the job was really about, there was no ture open door policy and there was no mobility for job advancement"
good,"The experience was fair and loved doing client interaction and resolving their issues. I loved troubleshooting, when we could, and trying to figure out how we could resolve the issue for the client"
good,"Not a bad company at all but not progressive company. A very antiquated computer system, as well as equipment.  Micromanage their employees.  Definitely needs to get new energy to continue to be a formidable tech company."
good,"Verizon has good benefits, but loose management structure and very little job security. Verizon would prefer to loose good employees, with many years of experience, and hire younger, cheaper contractors, instead of moving experienced employees to other projects."
good,"Job is very demanding, with little worry about customer or employee feelings. If able to preform can be well compensated. Lot depends on management and boss. Good boss makes job fun and easy. Bad boss, makes you fear for your job and demanding."
good,You have good benefits however if you have a family at home and want to see them at all then this isn't the job for you.  The hours are random and keep changing you never have a set schedule week to week.
good,"In Fraud Prevention, you're given the ability to do quite a bit of good, provided you're able to balance office politics and real work.  The ""toys"" we had at our disposal were really fun to work with, and the satisfaction of saving someone's rear end or catching a criminal in the act was quite rewarding.  Yes, a lot of the work became monotonous (credit checks, etc.,) but there were times when it was apparent that this job is not for the faint of heart!  Challenging situations and decisions that have very real, very significant impacts on people and businesses are a part of daily life.  That said, it can be utterly exhausting, dealing with the highs and lows of the day."
good,"I met a lot of senior leadership and they were all amazing, however the leadership in my store was lacking majorly in accountability. It’s corporate so there’s games that must be played to win."
good,The hardest part of the job is the stability. You are in the dark a lot regarding company's direction. This is your typical job now days decent money but no job security.
good,"it was a job didn't seem to concerned with keeping employees, if you want a job here it is easy to get but realise they do not care about you or your schedule"
good,Regular layoffs in the Verizon Business division seem to target long term employees as a way to reduce per employee wages.   Morale is about surviving not producing innovation.
good,"I would answer calls from customers.  The best part of the job was the pay and benefits,  the worst part was the management and there was not time off if you were ill."
good,The call center experience at Verizon was difficult. The calls were on top of each other with many technically complex issues. There was inflexibility with scheduling and no work/life balance.
good,"Effective Suggestion made and ignored, very set in their ways and unaware that wired services are in Jeopardy. Inconsistent and unfair pricing tactics in wireline services. Money oriented and lack of focus. Very loosely structured needs total quality improvement efforts across the board to realize profit potential and stop being lazy and making excuses when there is so much low hanging fruit statistically speaking. Unqualified people in positions for many reasons. need to clean house retrain and go from top down management styel to top down bottom up communications. For a communications company what goes on in wired services with regards to my experiences is an absolute shame."
good,Challenge your skills in customer focus and multitasking. Open to ideas from employees. Job security similar in other companies in field. Challenging to advance within company.
good,...but it wasn't the best either. The culture is toxic. The stress level is high. It has the potential to be a much better company but Verizon is late to adopt new changes in telecom and it shows in every aspect of the company.
good,Never be comfortable since a center can close at any time and you may have to relocate or completely be out of a job. The shift that is worked can also change every six months.
good,It was a fast paced position and is a good place for someone young and just starting in the work force. I prefer a smaller more intimate  office setting. The noise level on the floor was a little much and the instability of to position isn't something I would want for myself.
good,The job that I work in is not that great because management is not very well and you are always struggling to learn new things about the products that are offered when they don't even teach you about them or inform you
good,"I've learned a lot during my tenure and am grateful for that but I'm also learning that the change in leadership is changing the culture overnight.  To get ahead you have to say ""yes"" and not challenge things that are wrong.  People are being promoted with little or no experience and the hiring process is shady.  Integrity used to be at the core of who we were but now it's about putting up numbers no matter the cost.  We are becoming 2018's version of Wells Fargo."
good,You need to have tough skin to work there. They feed you a ton but the managers can be extremely demanding. I worked part time and i constantly felt pressured to work overtime
good,The environment at verizon was based solely on politics of the work place. The only way to advance was to make friends with leadership and become a flunky
good,"Ariveat work, have five minute hudle with your team leader.Ilearned a lot in vthe many training courses but also hands on training over20 years.Workplace culturewas very fun the first 14 years, the last 6 wereexcruciating.Higher level management brought in to fine any loop hole or excuse to cut head count in half.Scaring tenured reps into retirement with performance plans, code of conduct violations for dress codes.Forming to ques for calls one being sale sthe other everything else (billinb, repair, irates, etc) quota to be made in either que.Only enjoyable part wer ethe trips I won and the paycheck."
good,The job was stressful at times. They were always changing the job rules and worksheets day to day.   But I could go my own pace and I did like that...
good,"I would start my day doing a serialized inventory count to make sure all the serialized devices are accounted for, I would research any and all missing devices. Then go through the stores merchandising portal to make any changes needed for the day, and make sure all demo devices were powered on and working and restocking accessories  on the sales floor. When all that was finished, I would start processing returns form the previous day also making sure every returned item was accounted for. After that the daily shipment would arrive and I would check in the shipment and price and put everything in it's proper places."
good,Very high stress and not very well managed. Demands to sell are extremely high and the volume of customers and lack of leadership was a really big down fall.
good,Would not recommend working for low pay and management is always lookin for a way to fire you if you want to work for the make it temporary and never be late for work and expect to be doing mandatory overtime
good,Verizon wireless was a job that required lots of time but waa not wirth it pay wise.  No job security ir room for advancement.  I wouldn’t suggest that job to anyone.
good,"management was not very willing to assist coworkers. All for the numbers, not for customer satisfaction.  Not very much room for advancement in job positions."
good,Good company. The size of the company can be a bad thing sometimes. Poor HR department. Eg. 2 serious issues I reached out about were never discussed.
good,Verizon does not necessarily back you up or go to bat for you in case of unsubstantiated issues. The manager was fair and kind.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Lack of communication constantly changing management and quotas plus comission structure. Great benefits and discounts when emlpoyeed would advise to keep track of own sales
good,Very stressful fast paced poor work life balance but great pay I would recommend this job for anyone without kids or spouse who is money driven and does not mind long hours
good,This job was a horrible choice. Management never remember where they came from and only care about self image. If I had known this place was going to be like this I would not have ever thought to apply.
good,"My first year was excellent, the commission structure was great, staffing, and scheduling. Everyone made good money with minimal stress. But at the end of the day, you're working in the wireless industry where things change on a monthly basis. Commission structure turned into a joke, management and reps either got laid off or relocated without an option. Keep in mind if you work here, do not get too close with your team and expect to work a lot harder to make a decent paycheck. Verizon is not the same company it use to be, and never will be. Other then that, Ive learned many things from this company that will benefit me for future jobs."
good,They were an ok company to work for due to lack of communication with reps. They also were always last minute with planning meetings and responding to emails.
good,Poor management style.  Rather then focus on building business  and proper revenue focus the company continues cost cutting measures with continued layoffs.  Always n fear of losing your job
good,sales of cell phones and provide wireless and broadband services. maintain knowledge of cutting edge technology. understand customers needs and provide customer service and understanding of technology .
good,"Overall your lucky if you have a manger that cares remotely about anything other than numbers and with that being said, you are treated as such. A number. The company's goals is not associate retention, but volume so everyone is treated as they are disposable."
good,Constant Change is inevitable. Many technical contributions to make as a team player.  Top Fortune 20 telecommunications company delivering innovative products and services to customers via the most reliable network and latest technologies.
good,"competitive environment with much emphasis on hitting target goals "
good,"Good company, does not seem to prepare it's employees well for a new position. When changing jobs, little help is given. I understand that it is also up to the employee to succeed, but no data sources are given"
good,"Retail sales with bad hours, dealing with overly the public that thinks that you are there to be a personal assistant and fix all their cell phones issues. But our training has little to do with how to fix phones beyond what can be googled."
good,TCC has taken a turn for the worst.  Culture which once was the leg of a happy employee became money focused and no longer did customers or employees matter.
good,The pay was great but the work environment is controlled by fear of being canned if numbers are not met instead if trying to help from a management perspective. Even when excellerating on numbers still used fear of loosing your job if one metric is not met.
good,"Great place to work if you really enjoy sales and customer service. The hours do get long, and the team culture in stores are very helpful in being successful."
good,"Working at Cellular Sales is more exciting, I'd love entertaining customers and give the best I can to meet their expectations when it comes from service. I'd be the top one from the selling market at our store, but it came to the point that I need to have a better job that can provide benefits and can give competitive pay for the employees."
good,"Like most retail jobs, the hours are awful and you don't have much personal time.  With VZW they required more of your time for Workshops, customer training classes, and still expected you to work to hit ALL metrics.  Unless you were slamming customers with stuff they didn't want, which I did not do, the typical sales process would take 45 minutes to an hour, per customer.  Which also didn't help with managing all the customers waiting to helped next with an average wait time of 45 min.  Overall VZW was a great place for learning hands on, and good money for someone fresh out of school, but not for someone with a family."
good,"The culture has changed negatively due to the lack of support and knowledge from leadership. Promotions are not based on what you know but who you know whether you have the skill sets, education or not. I would only recommend this company to those of you who are looking for entry level positions so that you can gain the skills that you need to move to a better company. The only plus about this company are the benefits but the morale is horrible as much of leadership is unethical and care more about meeting numbers and increasing revenue rather than showing appreciation to their employees."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verison Telematics a division of Verizon lacks diversity - the division is completely East Indian and the management is poor.  Product releases are not in line with customer requirements."
good,Verizon at one point was a great place to work but with the buddy system now your hard work goes unnoticed. No work life balance and no HR department to help you out in time of need.
good,"Bad Management, No Advancement, Bad deals, Cannot make decisions, always complaining about the bottom line, tense environment, waiting to get RIFFed, Nice GYM and caf"
good,Very cold environment with no room for growth. Management will throw you under the bus for their mistakes. Very stressful with no opportunity to have fun at work or get to know your coworkers.
good,The general manger was the main reason why I left this position. She is more of a dictator than a manager. she would break people down instead of looking to build them up.
good,greeting people daily. wasn't given the option to become a permanent employee. management was rough. coworkers are great. standing all day with no chair is the hardest part especially when there are no costumers coming in. pay was great.
good,"The location In Ephrata is a slow store and for a sales job is not a good thing. Good customer, and okay management. You mostly sit on your but all day."
good,"It was a good compant with good people. During my time there the company was in transition, so alot was disorganized. However we had great teams and achieved goals dispite the move. We were a close knit team and the CEO was a grat motivator. However this isnt a job I would reccommend if you have children or a husband/wife it take alot of your time."
good,"The store is always short staffed, so if you work there expect to work more than 40 hours a week. Also the store is very slow, so majority of your time is spend making phone calls"
good,"I worked for Verizon Wireless for t 5 years. Company culture is highly political. Unqualified people in management . Most of the work is sent outside the country. Verizon has opened VDSI in India for tax purpose and are getting rid of people onshore to send the jobs outside the country. IT management is not worried about making sensible decision on increasing the company's value by making the right decision, but to cover up all the bad decision they make."
good,"Management is never on the same page....too many managers that dont communicate. Extremely overwhelming & very high quotas that are often unobtainable, traffic & customer flow has slowed down."
good,"good pay, zero training, had to work in an office with a gas leak, it made people sick, I had more personnel issues here in one year as I did with at&t in 5 years"
good,"managed well & treated well ,spent a sign for 4 hours ,took breaks when needed , management seem  to goof off a bit but seemed to hold it together every other day"
good,"I remained neutral with all the constant daily changes and the nit picking from upper management. At first things would really get to me and I would take everything literally and personally and then I just became numb to it all.  Reported to work like a robot, did my job as best I could, Collected a paycheck at the end of the pay period, paid bills and the cycle repeated for a year."
good,Pay is good and benefits are great.  Not much room to move up unless you drink the red Kool-Aid and get a manager up your a**.  High pressure sales to meet quota each month and you must sell sell sell whether the customer has a need for a product or not.  Put my 4 years in and I am done
good,"Nothing ruins a company like bad management. Verizon was a good company as it relates to personal growth, but the leadership is awful. Advancement into their leadership means you're no longer a valued employee and they will turn on you."
good,"I loved the pay and my peers but I hated this company. Management was so shaky and all over the place it was sad. We already had to give Verzion 90 percent of our life and when they would make us come in on mandatory meetings and other mess it would take more time out of our personal lives. They pretend they care for you the moment you get hired and a few months down the line they are slaving you like dogs. If you want to work here, go for it, but be ready to have no life but Verizon because they will do this to you."
good,Good pay and fantastic benefits including tuition assistance without requiring you to stay after graduation. Technology advances quickly so you have o be on top of that. It's retail so no work/balance. all requests HAVE to be  submitted a month in advance for consideration
good,"bad management, not good commission, manager talked down on the company every day. was easy to learn the task it took to do the job."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great benefits but constant restructuring and comp changes makes it difficult to earn a commission. Commissions payouts continue to decrease while quotas continue to rise. No job security.
good,"The expectations for this job were unrealistic at best. The monthly quotas of sales was an extreme source of stress. I worked in the cellular division, yet we were required to sell a certain number of FIOS orders each month, and your job was threatened if you did not. The amount of tablets, jetpacks, and accessories a consultant was expected to sell on top of cell phones was extreme and a great source of stress because your job was on the line if you did not succeed. Many people had to forfeit their own sales and give the credit to a coworker to save that coworkers job. The monthly and weekly meetings were horrible. They would require us to go to a location that would take a very long time to get to on a friday morning, during rush hour, and then expect us to get back to our store before the time that it opened, without any excuses. If you opened the store late, you were fired. The managers were out for themselves, and everybody who worked there was expendable. It was not a good place to work if you follow ethics because you were expected to shake down every customer that walked into the door, regardless of their circumstances and were yelled at if you did not try to force every device down the customers throat until they bought them. There was also a constant rotation of managers and the managers of the managers. At any given time we could have three levels of bosses in the stores critiquing everything and there was no consistency of managers. None of them lasted more than a couple of months."
good,"Typical day at work: Told what goals to meet, never actually being coached on how to do it. Doesn't care about customers needs in person, uses their 800# for that but relies on our ratings for bonuses. I learned to never go to management about anything, to keep your mouth shut. Goals don't have to be met in order to keep job. Over work employees."
good,Management needs to focus on employee's and not trying to get to the next level.  They have their favorites and tend to do what is best for them and ignore the rest.
good,"co-workers were excellent, work was challenging, scheduling could be flexible, remote working was allowed, learning opportunities were provided although some training for new responsibilites was not very well organized"
good,"Miicro-management to the hilt!"
good,"Little room for growth, poor management.  Always have to worry about getting layed off, compensation is below par.  Benefits are ok, but salary can be much higher compared to other industries."
good,"I went to work for Networkfleet at the beginning of 2011. Verizon purchased us in 2013 and it is totally different company, I am on my 4th manager change in the last 2 years. All of the employees that are being promoted as from the Verizon Wireless side and have no GPS/Telematics experience. I had been promised promotions and opportunities for advancement when I was hired almost 5 years ago but all of those opportunities are being given to Verizon employees, plus they have cut commissions and territories while raising quotas to almost double of what they were just a year ago. They also bring in ""preferred partners"" to compete against their own employees"
good,"I enjoyed getting experience in outside sales (b2b), and being able to control my own paycheck, I loved my sales team but management made it very clear that we were replaceable. Hardest part of the job was checking my moral compass at the door. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met at this job."
good,Job security but not flexible with working schedule or work/life balance. Advancement opportunities are available but reviews are too structured and scripted.
good,"A fast paced workplace with a schedule that will change every 6 weeks. If you like getting yelled at 30/40 times a day, 5 days a week then this is the job for you."
good,"Great company, but they would  prefer you to put company before your family and health after Verizon. Example winter time state of emergency called by governor Verizon still expect you to come in at all cost to except phone calls."
good,"I used to work for walmart and It was better than this.....The money is nice but when the quality of service depends on if your leadership is cool or pretentious then its not worth it in the end. Meaning that if you have a stat oriented leader then your screwed if you cant maintain stats but if your manager is more leaning towards finding points or places for growth then you may have a easier go. If you fail surveys which also has its ups and downs, then your in more hotwater than anything else except maybe attendance or schedule adherence."
good,"I've found the atmosphere to have changed substantially over the 15 years I have been with this company.  The seemingly constant restructuring and resulting job insecurity make for a very stressful work environment. "
good,"The product is great.  The opportunity is awesome, but Marketing Werks does not invest in its people so that they may excel."
good,"A typical day at work would be spending most of your day on conference calls, checking emails and coaching employees.  The most fun through out the day is when I get a chance to help customers and make a real positive difference in peoples experiences and the business. Over all great place to work."
good,There could have been so much to make a positive environment and keep morale up.  Slowly some areas were being advanced on for improvement.
good,Management always wants more and will push without explanation. Jobs are not secure. Everyone is treated like they are toddlers and talked to like they are dumb. Hold pay over your head and tell you that you cannot find another job that is like the one that you have. Promotions are based on being part of the boys club.
good,"I was recruited to do a specific task, work a M2M project it turns out I'd be selling phones.  Hiring manager totally misrepresented the position and job."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I have made this company more money then I would have liked. They constantly treat our store in LaPorte Indiana like a Chicago land store and expect the same numbers. Just last month (November) I made the company a little over $10,000 and in commision i only received a little over $400. Awesome company, terrible commision structure."
good,Verizon is a very Dynamic company. Helped me grow as a professional and personal as well. Had many mentors.
good,I choose not say anything further at this time.  I am being laid off with about 24 others and do not wish to comment.
good,Online market has ruined this job.  90% of customer who come into a retail store are there for service of the product they had bought at the wal-mart store down the road or online.
good,"You sit at your station and greet incoming customers."
good,"i worked for Verizon for three years and was one of the top ten sales reps in all of upstate new york for most of my three years working there.  Through training the first thing they said to me was ""you are replaceable"".  I got a bad taste in my mouth right from the start."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work"
good,"When I first started with the company over 3 years ago as a customer service representative in billing the job was very enjoyable. I ultimately progressed to technical support. The tech work was great also, until they forced tech agents to become sales reps and still do tech work. The best thing about the job is the pay and the benefits have been and still are AWESOME!! If you have a family and enjoy living stress free, I wouldn't recommend this place!! Also management is very poor. You may find a few good people in management ,but other than that the rest of them only care about themselves and don't look for them to help you with anything, there never around and will ignore your or hide from work. In order to advance you have to know someone that knows someone. The company overall is probably a good company but customer service in a call center is overrated and not worth the stress. Advancement in the center is all about who you know and not about your merits."
good,"Each day at Verizon Wireless we strive to achieve execellence in customer service, increase productivity, strive to gain market share by increasing consumer base. The most difficult task each day is not always being able to solve every problem presented to me by my customer, however it feels extremely rewarding when I'm able to turn that situation around and create a suitable solution that meets their needs. It's my resposibility to ensure that all of customers I interact with are treated with the upmost respect and presented with options and solutions that benefit their personal and professional lives."
good,"Not the best company to work for. Not a great experience, unlike most telecommunication companies."
good,You will not have a life outside of work unless you work in the corporate office.
good,Verizon was an okay company to work for. They are very demanding and there is no room to advance within the company. Very short breaks and no time to prepare before your shift (i.e. let the computer boot up).
good,It's very busy on any day. I deal directly with customer who has fios internet i upgrade their services also set new acct with new internet. I also deal with billing issues that customer may have.
good,"Since Hurricane Sandy hit the location of the store, when it reopened, it wasn't very busy. Always had to find something to do because the store was so empty."
good,People in a position of power were taking the work from the night crew so we would have nothing to work on to meet production numbers. We would then get written up for not meeting numbers.
good,"It has been a invaluable experience. A typical day at Verizon involves opening, counting the drawer. I then take the deposit to the bank and then take the inventory count. A day could be busy with many customers or it could be very slow. In retail it is hit or miss. The management I worked under is a Private retailer. The hardest part of the job would have to be the 60 hours every week. The work/life balance is the hardest part for me. The most enjoyable part is seeing all the people and getting to meet new people every day and selling. Sales gives me a rush, so every time I sold something, I enjoyed doing it."
good,"Work, work and only work !! Good place for learning but be could be made better."
good,The use of shared resources (staff) in an MSS environment does not always work out as well as it should. Shared resources can do little to no work on a contract they do no like. The result? less work in that they no longer have to support the contract and they still have a job supporting the contracts that they do like.
good,"Directory Assistance Operator is a great job environment to work in. However, their expectations were more demanding than they had to be.  Each call was monitored and the disposition of the call was monitored as well, and we were given only seconds to answer, listen and connect calls. Management would sometimes listen to the calls and guide you on how to release the call at a more acceptable time frame.  It was very hard to listen to a customer complaining and not interrupting them and just basically asking them what number they were wanting, this came across somewhat rude and they would get more upset.  The job itself though, talking to people and helping them, this was a great sense of accomplishment at the end of the day, and made me feel very good about myself, and my job."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Worked in the company from MCI to WorldCom back to MCI and then Verizon Business.  After 28 years downsized
good,Provided directory services to a high volume of calls of daily. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency of hours and job security.
good,It is very fast pace environment with wonderful benefits. That it is all that I really want to say about the company since I am currently employed there. Discount on phone service.
good,I love working the job but the paid was not fairly and I have bills that I have to attend to.
good,"Provided supplies"
good,"a typical day is back to back calls, all day long. as far as advancement, its more who you know than what you know. you have to be close to someone in management to actually move up otherwise very difficult"
good,Its a good job to get you feet wet in the field of sales. The management could be better but over all its a decent company to work for. It helps you to improve your people skills a great deal.
good,"In the Hanover branch, pay and opportunity to advance are solid but are rarely based on more than personal preference of management, not on ability or skill.  Despite being a largely black center for frontline call-taking jobs, more than half of the management is white; this disparity is much, much worse at some other call centers and is better in others.  "
good,"Great experience, and can be a fun place to work at. Very diverse, and everyday is different. My co-workers have become very close to me, and like family. I have a learned a lot about the wireless industry and how to accept change."
good,"The pay was good, but everything else sucked about the company"
good,Issues with being paid on time (or in general) would not recommend to anyone trying to make a living off of this job.
good,"Verizon has been historically a company that pays its employees very well,and also great benefits. One must be able to handle a lot of mind games."
good,Helping customers weigh their options as Verizon customers and helping them make valuable decisions based on those options.
good,left this job because i was spending more on travel than actual pay. Seem pretty good just too far
good,I worked there for 29 yrs and and was happy to leave. The company used to be secure and professional. They lowered their standards and anyone and everyone was hired and promoted. The union runs the company and the company has their hands tied due to the union protecting lazy employees.
good,"Een baan met uitdagingen, hoge werkdruk en onrealistische verwachtingen."
good,There are some things about Cellular Sales that are less than desirable in the management field as well as the constant schedule changes interfering with things outside of work. I would prefer not to discuss.
good,"Management was unable to get salary increases, employees pushed to be unionized. Salaries and benefits got substantially better and the management got substantially worse."
good,Typical day revolves around servicing customer needs weather its sales to technical support to sales. The customers are usually ok and you keep in mind they are just frustrated with the company and not you.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great co-workers, and very good benefits. I learned how to manage a call center, and also how to improve and meet my numbers with the Business to Business Sales to help grow the company."
good,Had opportunity to resolve various customer issues in a face to face environment
good,• Trained and directed approximately 40 IBEW Union represented employees.
good,productive busy lack of advancement outside of retail especailly in the south.
good,Working for Verizon has been a curvy ride. There are many pros and cons.
good,Company needds to do a better job of imfomring its employees on training and company changes.
good,Working with verizon wireless through Alorica is a challenging expereince. The face of work is at a timed limit from taking calls to breaks that are given. You must be able to multi task and respond in a correct timely manner.
good,"I enjoyed working there because my co workers were nice, but I disliked the company because they fired my superviser as soon as she reported she was expecting a baby. I also noticed they fired people just because they were not selling enough merchandise."
good,A great place to work if you can be flexible with your time and commitments.  Tends to stressful due to tight timelines in a competitive market.   Stressful environment due to constant staff reductions and re-organizations.
good,You must be flexable and not want a life outside off work. Not the best place to work if you have a family. There is no room for Advancement and there is almost no training.
good,The company has some of the best benefits such as insurance and if you are going for a college degree. Not an easy job. Must be willing to work a lot of OT and give up any life outside of there to hit quotas. The quotas are getting harder to acheive and payouts are going down.
good,Verizon is a great place to get started on your employment journey and educational Journey with educational benefits.  VZW fails to capitalize on those employee dollars by not promoting those employees that utilize those dollars and their skills to improve company outcome
good,"As long as you don't move into leadership with this company, you will enjoy the culture and pay structure. The company needs to work on being supportive towards the management team."
good,"Your pay is based on a commision scale that is hardly obtainable by the amount of customer base for the area. I can see how it would work in a more urban setting, but not at this location. So as a result, employees will work extremely hard to never reach the minimum in order to receive their commission, but will not get it. Instead they would have to settle for hourly which is extremely low. So the company gets to reap the benefits of having their employees work for minimum wage without having to pay out the commision."
good,The department I worked in was very unorganized. Filing of contracts was in disarray.  My responsibilities did not match my bacground.  Guidance was somewhat available.
good,"No advancement opportunities, slow but fast work place.  Decent coworkers and management.  No benefit options and no security in job. Pay was not worth it."
good,fun place to work..must be very flexible because schedules  are not the best ..must met all numbers...will work with employees to try and achieve goals
good,Not my type of work. I hate that i am forced to do this. Verizon was boring and stuff and junk. did not love Verizon. not loving this either. best part of the job was quitting.
good,"Good pay for a call center, but still working at a call center. Prepare to take lots of calls and get yelled at a decent amount. Benefits are good. Job advancement potential is fairly limited."
good,Never again. Disorganization in management. They want you to work out of your position add receive less pay and no benefits!! Verizon is scamming people.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I would come in and count out my dawer, run to the bank, get out my devices, check my e mails, do confences, communicate with the supervisor! "
good,"A lot of backlog and a lot of management issues. They take a lot of contractors and at the last minute, not enough training and expect them to perform. Management blame everyone for their inefficiency and refuse to solve their problems from the root."
good,"This is a job I'd recommend having short term for a quick turn around of cash through commission."
good,Tuition assistance was fantastic. Health benefits were great. PTO was acceptable. Just be prepared for restructure and change. Culture has changed over the years.
good,"Call-center is always busy.  Very productive. Challenging at times due to micro-managing. Company has good health benefits, pays well and had a gym onsite."
good,Working for Verizon Wireless was a subpar experience. Decent company but needs a vast improvement when in comes to employee relations. I learned a lot along the operations side and made connections with clients. Way too much favoritism from Solutions Managers as well as General Manager.
good,"Working at Verizon, hasn't been the best experience as I am a contractor and am not provided the same benefits as the full time employees. Other than, that it has been fine."
good,Since I did not work for a corporate Verizon store I cannot share all experiences. It would have been much better to work for a corporate locations. thank you
good,"The management in our department is worst.there is favouritism.partiallity. and in transparency ."
good,If u have small children this job is not ideal. Good for graduating high school students that are looking for a long term gig. If u get in when ur young by the time u have small children you will have more flexibility.
good,If you are between the ages of 21-31 then you’re welcomed and trained. You will have no work life balance and your commission structure will change once you deduce how to make goal. Save yourself a ton of heartache and just say no.
good,"I feel like my time at Verizon was a very disappointing time in my life. There was way to much turnover, as well as no leadership. I feel like they wanted me to sell my soul some days just to make a sell. The three no's policy was very hard to handle when it was known that several of the people who came in to our store were either elderly or on a very fixed income."
good,"I am not a sales person.  This was not a good job for me. I love phones and thought it would be fun, but the pay wasn't worth the training and stress of the goals."
good,"Verizon is an old world company with hierarchal management styles, inaccessible leaders, countless meetings with no agenda or outcomes; most work is micromanaged slide-ware and all decisions are top-down only."
good,Verizon provided me with a place to learn how to work after college and I'm grateful for that.  A lot has changes since I left so I'm not sure my experiences are still relevant however I know they still have a very large footprint in the telecommunications world and I'm not naive enough to think my experience as a retail sales rep over 15 years ago gives me any insight into how Verizon runs today.
good,"Worked there for 17 years. I really hated the corporate nonsense. Very little constructive feedback, they just complain about small unimportant little things. The micromanagement never ends. I wish I had quit 10 years sooner. A typical day involves a short meeting if the business allows. This meeting is intended to distribute important information, but it gets canceled a lot or turns into a gripe fest. It is also a good opportunity to listen to corporate spin about how some decision they made that is bad for customers is actually good for customers. If you want to enjoy your life stay away from Verizon."
good,"I must start by stating that this is not Verizon corporate, but rather Cellular Sales a third party company for Verizon. The money is very good if you are really to cut corners and bend the truth with customers. Otherwise you wont be there any longer than 4 months."
good,First started with VZW we were all making money and the company was making positive changes.  Then they started to get money hungry and changed commission structures numerous times and were unable to really keep up the the dynamics of the industry.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The management micromanaged every tech question, every sale, and each customer. I felt rushed and was not able to help the customer in their entirety."
good,loved the job hated the management .great people.. hated leaving but was forced to retire by the company ..........................................................
good,If you have not been moved to a Director by 40 few chances will be available. The internal structure is rigid without a entrepreneurial feel.  Most roles have a small focus within a large structure and little opportunity for independent decision making.
good,You learn how to read people and establish their needs and wants when coming to purchasing new technology. You have goals that are set and you have to reach those goals. You have weekly meetings regarding the goals and new sales and events happening. Fun place to work for.
good,The culture within Verizon does not allow for expression of ideas. Advancement seems to be more about age/seniority rather than merit of ones work and improvement. An elitest mentality can be seen in the way peer and contracted organizations are treated.
good,"The provide great benefits..  Do not have anything else I can provide about this organization beside the benefits."
good,Fun environment you are your own boss within reason.  Only complaint they want you to have the newest phones which are not free and if you are a single mom with daycare being only option it is hard to juggle family and work.
good,I didn't really enjoy the job. It was fast-paced but there was no actual point to it. There was no room for advancement there. The job was also temporary.
good,"Many job openings and closings."
good,"Lack of communication due to poor management, decent pay, learned how to assist people in the buying process, very boring when there are no customers,"
good,The pay was very good for the industry standard. Toxic corporate structure. Fear tactics employed upon employees who fail to achieve sales metrics. Unreasonable goals placed upon stores that lack the traffic to achieve goals.
good,"Great company to work for with outstanding benefits. However, management can be micro-managers, petty biased & have the favorites whom are cultivated."
good,"worked for verizon for a number years received recognition on a regular basis as a top rep in my field but it was never good enough, quotas keep climbing and it obvious that the person setting them is out of touch.  recent rounds of layoffs is going to destroy that company."
good,"Work / Life balance is BAD"
good,If your over 50 and don't have any drive then this is a good place for you.  Manager yelling at people. don't have a good vocabulary. People put in positions without qualifications.  Old boy's and girls' network atmosphere
good,The staff is the only good thing I would say about working there. This location was not a Corp. location and the owners weren't the best when it came to caring about the workers. The staff works 6 plus days a week and may or may not even make 40 hours on top of trying to make goals when traffic is either slow or not even there.
good,No work and life balance within the work environment. Pay salary is low and customer service position is highly stressful. Your advancement in the career is based off how a customer rates you.
good,There are advancement opportunities but don't believe it until you see it in writing.  They temp you with advancement opportunities to convince you to work extremely long and hard hours to then give the position to someone else.  Very political company.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"In charge of a very large high volume store with 30 people associated with the sore. In charge of staffing, skill development, culture of store, overall morale of store environment. Commission based environment and have to exceed sales quota to make increase in annual income."
good,"Verizon gives great benefits and pays better than most retailers. That said, there is very little work-life balance and the job is very high stress. You will work long hours and have high quotas to meet, but they are are obtainable if you're willing to dedicate the time and effort needed to meet the goals. This company will give you the accolades and awards for your hard work, but it does come at the cost of your work-life balance."
good,"The pay is great. Management is so so. Some care.  Most don't.  It is a very clicky environment.  Benefts are great, especially education benefits.  Higher management has changed multiple times recently and new CEO is making many many cuts.  He wants to save millions in the next few years, therefore, they are cutting employees, and hiring much cheaper ones.  They are also outsourcing thousands of IT employees to India and Customer Service reps to the Philippines in order to save a bunch of money."
good,Years of hard work and dedication only to be caught in the middle of corporate restructuring. Corporate reshaping over the last 5 years leaves little job security.
good,Home installation of internet service for customers. Great opportunity to travel and ability to make your own hours. Creating your own schedule based on customer location was interesting and challenging. Frequently had a hard time getting paid for work performed
good,"You get a negative ""ding"" if you clock in early as well as   continuing customer service with client... if it cuts into your breaks or clock out time you are ranked as under performing for doing your job diligently!"
good,"I worked for Verizon for almost 5 years, but was promised at the start of my career that advancement would happen fast if I worked hard an improved my knowledge. I was fast in the training and learned the ends and outs of the company. I worked hard making #1 salesman for multiple months and years. I worked towards Senior Rep, but was never able to get further then that. Despite how hard I worked and what all the training and goals were given to me. I felt that the only reason they didn't promote me was because I was successful in the sales field that they didn't want to lose that sales dollar!"
good,it was okay from learning and working on cool stuff apart from the instability in the organization..........................................................
good,"Verizon offers competitive base pay for consultants; however, has an extremely wide gap within manager pay scales.Coming from the outside into Verizon is the best bet over attempting to rise through the company."
good,"My manager at first was great, then left for another position internally, new management was hired with no real sales or telco experience. Culture is that of monthly number counting and putting everything from service to daily calls on sales."
good,Culture is changing. Direction can be misleading. Niche professionals will have a difficult time adjusting to an operations based mentally. Company is focused on training.
good,"Mostly driven by metrics- based initiatives, but also focuses on the good 'ol boy network. Company focus has shifted from wireline to wireless technology. Employees on the wireline side of the business are essentially being forced out."
good,verizon a great company to start out working for. as of late the company has changed to commissions structure for the worse making it near impossible to make a decent paycheck. benefits are awesome and one of main reasons people stay with the company for a long time.
good,"not the best, not the worst. my manager didn't know his head from his foot. I was in the top 20% in my district as a  salesman making decent communion but it still could not live on my own. Definitely a temporary job."
good,"Great benefits (medical, tuition reimbursement, 401K) but the culture is poor. The tenure is not rewarded and it is easy for management to have “favorites”. Promotions are not solely based on accomplishment but also on people’s perception and being well liked."
good,"Performance is no longer rated on meeting expectations but on ranking against other employees and has caused a lot of discouragement for employees that have returned from leave and therefore are far behind the other employees. This happened after returning from work after maternity leave and caused me to have a very poor schedule. Schedule is based on performance more than seniority. This makes long time employees that have to take leave have schedules that will not work for their families and the reason I had to leave the company. The goal now is to beat your peers in performance rather than helping improve your team/peer performance. This creates a poor working environment."
good,The work environment is very fast paced and at times bordering hectic as we handled incoming call from field managers and technicians. Overall I enjoyed the work as I love to stay busy and stay focused on the task at hand.
good,"Always an effort to cut labor costs, but never an effort to streamline the work still needed.  Highly political environment. Never a hesitation to run over anyone with the blame bus."
good,lack of advancement. very political in the management departments. no interaction with technicians and management. lack of respect for personal life problems.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Until recently you would be working at a call center however they have or are closing a majority of the call centers. If you want to work in a normal building your options are limited but if you want a job from home that is an option in most areas. The job can be very tough on certain days depending on the people you deal with. Co-workers are definitely a bright spot in the company. The benefits are also very good and competitive considering there are no Unions at Verizon Wireless.
good,This was a contract job working at the Verizon complex in Irvine.  I only worked here for about three months before moving on to Hyundai.  Was very fast paced.
good,"Good Benefits, Company strives to ensure communication and the ability to communicate via their network is the number on priority. It places all resources into a reliable network."
good,they treat you like your nothing here. Do what you have to do while you are there but use the company name and get a more secure job elsewhere. I've Never seen a company be proud and encourage their supervisors to create such a toxic environment
good,"Lack of opportunity for advancement, even for stellar employees as a phone operator. Great benefits however. Terrible hours. Employees aren't compensated enough for the stress of this role."
good,Great place to work. Just not as organized as you would think they were. Management knowledge of products could be a lot better. They also should follow the same guidelines for everyone.
good,Not the best company to work for. Pushes employees to be shady and dishonest with customers. Culture was broken to the point of not being able to be friendly with anyone around you
good,"Supervisor was not professional.  Very cut throat and favored people that have been there for a long time.  Management would sit in their office instead of being hands on.  I have been in management and would never let new hires or veteran workers struggle if there is a topic or situation someone is not familiar with.  Seeing several management staff standing around joking around not paying attention to their team was disheartening.  Being threatened about call backs or about customer reviews.  One statement from a manager was ""if I am going down you are going down with me""  ""I will just start writing up everyone until you do not have a job""."
good,"No room for advancement ,false promises. management did not keep there word. I enjoyed the feild of electronics so I was able to learn hopefully to advance in my career."
good,"This place is stressful and demanding . Pay is okay but not worth the anxiety. Layoffs happen all the time , and job security seems to be non existent. This used to be a great place to work but it’s no longer the place it was a few years back ."
good,"While opportunities arise often within the company, they are usually filled with those who have the most tenure versus those that will best fill the position."
good,Answer high call volume. Trouble shoot technical issues and resolve billing questions. Provide consumers with knowledge of account and data. Equipment changes.
good,If I was an employee it would be different.  As a Contractor/Consultant advancement or having the opportunity to advance is not available.   I have improved my design and development planning skills at Verzon.
good,Verizon Connect - I really enjoy my coworkers and the teams I've worked with across the organization. Fast Paced work environment and excellent benefits.
good,"The company only cares about the bottom line, will sacrifice its people to hit their targets. Management only cares what you'll do for them, they only care about themselves. You can make it a great career if you can deal with all of it and stay under the radar. It is great money and benefits and your team member will keep you there."
good,"I really enjoyed the team that I worked with however the company does not provide much in the form of job security, advancement and training, or a solid structure."
good,"Late Shift Mon- Fri. 12- 9,  Saturdays 12- 8"
good,"They were not family friendly, i had to look for a new job based on the hours they were giving me and i did not have a night time daycare nor are there really any night time daycares so i could not take the hours."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The pay to skill level ratio is actually fine, but be prepared to be yelled at for hours at a time, not by management but by the angry customers that call."
good,I worked here for 9 months and it was great. only downside if you don't work in a busy store you dont make much money and the company sees it as your fault the store is slow.
good,"The only true thing about Verizon's workplace culture is that its diverse. The don't promote team work and management is hard pressed to make any beneficial changes for their analysts to make the job worth keeping. You must stay in your position for one year, after that you can move into a new one. The day anyone hits their one year anniversary is the day they start looking for a new job in a different department than Wholesale Wireline. No training or focus on growth. They want you to sit down, be quiet, and work. period."
good,only worked there 4 months wasn't the right fit for me. little support and never saw my supervisor. would not work with schedule when i started school such as being part time. lack proper communication when trying to get another work schedule.
good,I wish management was different because I really liked the job. The way they treat there employees was not good and they liked to get away with how they acted because the district manager was 230 miles away and was rarely there.
good,Many lay offs periodically. Stressful environment. Great benefits. Job security and advancement not great. Difficult to change culture. Very fast-paced.
good,"could be a very fun productive place to work, if the management in store wasn't lacking as much as it is. they did provide good training, and a competitive environment."
good,Management on up needs to come up with a different strategy in every department to better service their customers. They are a very difficult company to do business with and work for.
good,I would tell my worst enemy not to work for Verizon Wireless B2B. Management is all family so there is little advancement opportunity. Worst management team I have ever worked for by far.
good,Verizon was a good place to work at the time. It has its ups and downs. There are different shifts available which is nice. They do have the ability to send you home when things are slow thus leaving you with less hours to be worked.
good,I took an inbound and outbound calls
good,"In your process for applying for a position, interview questions are in that STAR format. So its not a conversation. It has to be in a Situation- Action- Result format. If you miss a point or not exact format, forget being considered. Garbage way of doing interviews."
good,"This hob is stressful, high paced. Sometimes it feels like you cant look up to breathe. I have had managers to come looking for me in the bathroom with less than one minute from getting up from my desk.  There is some good management and some not so good"
good,Lots of stress with everyday.  Director says is focused on culture and ensuring a good environment but the opposite is true.  This team will assuredly have union representation soon.
good,"My last position was not a good experience.  My manager and director were toxic people that created a toxic environment.  The only technical training to be had was training I could find on my own.  The only support provided was from other engineers if they were willing."
good,"ok place to work. Great money, but long hours and managers that think they know everything because their dad is a lawyer. be ready to spend all your time there and not with your family."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"In the store staff was great we all pretty much got along, but upper management seemed disconnected and all they cared for was production and not customer service. Employee's that did everything right and had integrity would be ""coached"" for not up selling additional services/devices and the employee's that up sold everything with no integrity would be rewarded every time even though management a knew that those services/devices would be returned within the week."
good,Verizon has a great benefits package but don't ever start enjoying your job. Worked for Verizon for just under 10 years they did away with my job. Verizon has no loyalty to its employees or customers it's all about the bottom dollar
good,"The company is slow to adopt technology and is always trailing other competitors in the industry.  They spend a tremendous amount of money trying to enter a space, but they're always behind the first-to-launch product. There is no urgency by leadership to push into new spaces with any type of accelerated tempo.  Things that don't work out the first time are often abandoned in place.  The company acts like an old telecom company instead of a technology company. They are risk adverse, slow, and other than some of their offices in Silicon Valley, they are primarily outdated and stoic."
good,"If you cantb sell you won't keep your job. Very competitive, training was there but not really. If you know how to pitch and sell this is an awesome job very flexible"
good,"I disliked the lengthy commute to the middle of no where in Basking Ridge, NJ. Everything was slow and felt bloated. Lay offs were a regular occurrence"
good,"Working as a Call Center Rep for Verizon Wireless is a tough job. Besides learning escalation and how to handle some calls, there is a lot of competition between the employees and a lack of growth opportunities."
good,Very demanding and fast paced.  Little room for error in the job I performed.  A lot of rework and often times communication from management was not given or was not clear.
good,I was taught nothing and expected to know everything. Paid minimum wage and made 1% commission off products. It was a waste of brain power and basically they didn't pay me enough for how hard they wanted me to work.
good,"The job I enjoyed for 15 years has completely changed in the last two years, and not for the better. Long hours, high stress, work force reductions while workloads have doubled or tripled."
good,Worked as a contractor for Teksystems in between Broadwing/Level 3 layoffs. Mostly LAN Server oriented with some WAN monitoring. Mostly a software management job that was outsourced to Verizon.
good,The management is terrible.  The environment is so negative.  I hated it. When my grandma was sick and had to fly home to see her they accused me of using it for vacation purposes.
good,"It is so unfortunate, poor leadership decisions caused the fall of a great company to a mediocre one at best.  The driven culture that made the Verizon great disappeared."
good,This job was just a temp job I took orders for fishing and hunting licenses for the state of New York. Interesting to say the least. It was fun I guess.
good,"Verizon used to be a wonderful place to work. Everyone worked as a team and we made it the number one carrier. In recent years however the culture changed to be more cut-throat and unproductive.  The company is barely keeping ahead of the competition, and the competence level has dropped considerably. The company has now begun to downsize starting with it's older and more experienced people. It is no longer a pleasant secure place to work."
good,"Over the course of a 30 year career at Verizon I have seen the moral and feelings of a promising future disintegrate. Job cuts, moves to overseas, and cost reductions have led to a stressed out under appreciated work force."
good,"It was a better place when I started. But far from it now. It is very stressful with the fear of losing your job. Trying the compete with google and facebook, but offering a fraction of the salary."
good,"It's hard to understand how much earning potential this job has, but if you work hard and take sales seriously, you can easily earn 6 figures. The downside is the stress. You're often treated like nothing more than a number on a spreadsheet, and when the number doesn't read what management wants, it becomes disposable. There's a lot of reward, but no rest. Ever. Also, very little room for advancement. Managers will often fill positions with transfers from another state, rather than nurture the talent they already have. Bottom line is if you can handle the emotional abuse, and value money more than other aspects of your life, this is an amazing job."
good,the only thing good about the place was the competitive pay rate. reps are shady and will steal sales at any chance provided. Would not recommend to the faint of heart
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"You are responsible for everything that is happening in your store, customer complaints, sales goals, inventory management, merchandising, displays, workshops."
good,"I started at Verizon almost a 10 years ago and it was a great uphill career. They offer lots of trainings, compensation and benefits. I was able to aggressively take action in my career for a while with the resources they offer. After acquiring various companies the vision and culture of the company got lost in translation and the leadership could not get a grasp of how to make their employees happy. Good luck to those who are still at Verizon and to those to join!"
good,The hours were given before being hired and during training.after training they gave you any old hours and didn't let you decide on them most were evening and weekend shifts not advertised in jon ad.
good,This job would of been a great place if the managers were only concernrd with making their next buck they did not care about the customers and the customers ability to pay for products or services .
good,"Verizon Wireless closed its operations in Connecticut after 27 years and relocated to Columbia, So Carolina. All employees were given an option to relocate to So Carolina or be laid off with a severance package."
good,Poor management and work environment. Management’s goal is to hit numbers only. Do not regard employees with respect or tact. Long and tedious work days
good,"Nice place to work, got a chance to dress up bit. Good place to network and make new friends, the back office management is a pain, but the immediate supervisor is kool."
good,"The management was top heavy and they all wanted someting different. Every week there was a new objective, ei. idle time on trucks and too much cellular time on the phones."
good,No work life balance. Stressful work environment. Compensation and benefits good but that’s it. Micromanaging and being expected to work more than the 40 hours you are scheduled is part of the job
good,"I was happy with my position towards the start of my time with the company.  I have considered advancement within, but it is not possible.  Additionally, the company has undergone too many changes since initially signing my contract."
good,"A typical day at work was 7 and a half hours of phone time with breaks. "
good,"Challenging work environment.  If you can handle the pressures of being micro managed and having customers complain on a daily basis, then this is the job for you.  Compensation is good, but it is easy to take the stress home with you."
good,They will enslave you for them coins people was committing suicide.. becoming junkies or alcoholics just to be able to deal with the stress of the job.
good,"Worked for the company for 5+ years, advancement was difficult if you wanted to get out of the retail channel. Laid off after position was no longer deemed necessary."
good,"While working for this place of business i was still attending High School. In order for me to acquire the position i had to at least work 40 hours a week, but i was typically working 60 hours a week while maintaining my academic life. This job created a lot of stress in my life and was mostly commission based so it was a very competitive work environment."
good,Management is awful and lacked horribly in communication. If you didn't sell what was wanted the managers were constantly on you to get numbers up and it was never good enough.
good,"It's good working along with a lot of very smart people. Very Flexible in terms of schedule. There wasn't much of a culture, at least not if you are working as contractor."
good,Good place to work for few years and move on. there are few pros and cons but overall it shows good weight on your profile to work with such a enterprise.
good,"sweatshop attitude to the workers, bad IT infrastructure, not a lot of flexibility. I wish there will be more spending for training! good for full time."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Jobs shipped to offshore.  Too many conference calls daily because staffs are in multiple locations including international. Long working hours including weekends.
good,"I work at an indirect location, so this doesn't apply to Verizon Corporate. But this is the only job where you make less money the longer you work there. Every year the sales goals increase while your rate of pay/commission stays the same or goes down. Simply put, you have to sell more to make the same amount of money."
good,It was a fun place to work with incentives in the beginning. But more and more changes came down the pike making morale lower and lower. It became more and more stressful.
good,"The pay that you will get for doing next to no work is pretty stellar, but the amount of stress that is put on you because of terrible management makes you wonder at times if it is worth it."
good,"Typical Day ; Arrive at 730, right on a call with INDA dev teams, triaging issues and working through logistics until 11am EST. LUNCH then Training or prepping for training the rest of the day"
good,"Verizon has great benefits and is a good company to work for, however there is no work/life balance you are always at work and picking up your phone even when you are not working.  Your job is never secure because Verizon is ever changing."
good,"Training is very brief and you are then 'thrown' onto the floor. Metrics are quite strict and you really have little control over surveys, which play a major role in your job retention ability. The site I worked at was disorganized and management was not valuable at all!"
good,Great company to work for at times. Some managers don't know how to manage there teams causing issues. Others are better at what they do. No over time. expected to work more hours with no OT.
good,"Good pay but you work for it and every year gets tougher to make the same money as the day before. High Quotas, however you do have a chance to make good money if you remain driven and don't mind the stressful sales environment"
good,Verizon is an employer to work for if you're not looking for advancement; commissioned sales; advancement is based on being favored; You will either have a great day or a horrible day; no in between
good,"Verizon Wireless has a very difficult culture to stay with long term. Company consistently turns over people. Verizon Wireless was a better employer in the early 2000's from what I'm told. Company undervalues it's employees and customers. Bill is too high for customers and employees are always receiving a commission pay reduction year after year. Company quotas are not always obtainable and change inconsistently every month. Company is always looking to eliminate or downsize postioins and departments costing good people their jobs. No appreciation or recognition given to employees for going above and beyond.  Once you make too much commission, Verizon takes half of your payouts. Not told this throughout interview and hiring process. I work very well in a commission related environment so I anticipated doing well at Verizon which I did but because the company takes half of your earned commissions once you reach a certain point 2.0, I found myself holding back from my full potential. Very strange and demotovating to go through. Also you would think being a technology based company that things internally would work. We'll hate to disappoint but unfortunately Verizon has broken equipment and programs that are launched that don't work correctly all the time. This affects your daily job and duties on a regular basis. You find yourself always coming up with work arounds and apologizing to customers for Verizons internal issues. Verizon customers think it's the employee's that are incompatent but really it's Verizon broken systems. It gets old very fast after awhile."
good,"The company has peaked.  It has the feel of a large anonymous coporpoation, a stereotype of itself.  After aquiring some many companies in its creation no culture is left, if is about only one thing, shareholder value."
good,"Frontier has no idea what they are doing. Since beginning at Verizon and then seeing all of the acquisitions of Frontier, I believe it is like a high school team competing with the pros."
good,"You will be paid but you will work. You will find as a cell site tech that any meaningful work is done at night. you will work your normal shift, go home get a couple hours of sleep and be at a site by 2300 Hr(11:00 PM)"
good,"horrible culture--> company does not care about its employees at all, sole concern is growth at any cost. frequently practices unethical selling strategies (overtly lying- not just coercion) without adding any value to their consumer packages "
good,"This is a retail position which should really say it all.  However, sales targets were set for the store without regard to how many reps were available on the floor.  Sales quotas were becoming unattainable due to empty positions not being filled."
good,I started working for Verizon Terremark when it was recently purchased.  The Terremark culture was great.  The Company slowly transitioned into Verizon. The direction of Cloud services changed and most data centers were eventually sold.
good,"Verizon used to be good to their people, mostly that time has gone away.  They still have the best benefits in the industry and some really great people but the culture is changing and not for the better"
good,"A typical day would consist of some minor operational duties (open cash drawer, perform serialized inventory, clean entrance of store) followed by a quick check of email and other forms of organizational communication. The majority of the work day centers around customers- resolving issues and discovering sales opportunities."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Only people who make it in the company are the upper mean corparate greed people. They tell you that you are the voice of the company because your the front line to the company. Behind the seen they treat lets say not so great. Benefitts money great but the work enviroment the way you are treated is horrible you dont value no matter how many sales great things you have done for comany.
good,"Clean building, management usually seems upbeat. You will need an excess of patience and empathy while dealing with customers here."
good,Excellent place to stand out of the crowd. Many opportunities to develop your people skills and work with international teams across a diverse product set. Many times you will help guide the formation of the processes.
good,"Verizon is a very strange place to work. It is not your typical place of employment. The company is ran by many different departments that can get confusing if you don't take the time to learn what each department does. I did have a supervisor but it wasn't a normal supervisor where if I running late, I could call and let them know. I had to contact another department for that. You are put on a leash once you get the ability to sign into the phone system to take calls. That phone system coupled with your scheduled basically ran your whole day. It told you when you can take your breaks and lunch. You also had to make sure that you used it to also let the people who are constantly watching when you were going to the bathroom. They didn't really get on you for going to the bathroom much but they knew every time you did by watching the status of your phone. My day was mainly taking calls about customers technical issues with the service. Most calls were friendly but some were bad calls to the point where you had to get a supervisor involved. Not your supervisor that you see everyday but someone from another call center playing the roll as supervisor. Mainly it's a job that will make you tired mentally because you have to do a lot of thinking for yourself and also the customers that call in. I enjoyed talking with my co workers the little time I had. They all were friendly and very helpful. Hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers and when your computer would be on the fritz. Most enjoyable part was signing off and going home."
good,Company needs to do better for the union workers who built this company and are the face of the company.  Dedicated worker with 20yrs of service.
good,Very long hours tons of overtime.Tight deadline all of the time fast pace.The pay was good overall but the hours were tough at times
good,"Cooking, cleaning, and preparing food with regulated guidelines to success was a must and proved to pay off with the requirement of customers."
good,"Fun atmosphere, but things are constantly changing.  I went through 3 store managers in 6 months.  A lot of micro managing as well. You couldn't do anything without calling a district manager."
good,have to do a shift bid every year and you get horrible shifts even if you have good stats because they factor in seniority. so it is pointless to try. it is hard to move around in the company to something you like.
good,Worked here for many years. Towards the end it was just about the pay that kept me here and that i needed a job. Management changes changed the demeanor of integrity as far as sales and over all work exp. moral was very low.
good,Some management is ok and others needed to go back to diversity training. I feel there was no loyalty to the employee and the folks were ok to work for.
good,I truly enjoyed this job if it was not for management. Favoring other employees can really damage a companies reputation.
good,No work/life balance. Time off is difficult.  Retail hours are difficult. Not enough compensation for what we do. Managers are hired based on being good sales people. Benefits are good.
good,"ok compnay to work for , but advancement no they still handpick who they want based on personality and not quality of work"
good,Verizon gives an ample amount of paid time off. The problem is they won't ever approve a vacation because they are perpetually under staffed. This is mostly the case because of poor management and a high turn over.
good,Verizon was the products I sold but the company that I worked for was a retailer called Precision Wireless LLC.  This company was bought out from another retailer and I will be taking a reduce pay home around forty percent decrease in earnings.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Plastered inconsistency with selfish ambition to display my knowledge of overcoming to advance, which resulted in the termination of my time with GoWireless."
good,The earning potential seems to be decreasing from the time that I have worked there.  The work life balance is decent in the retail side of things.  The benefits package as far as health coverage is very good.
good,"You work a lot the pay is decent but there is no work life balance. Hard to have a family and work here. but its an okay place, management sucks, co-workers are awesome, hardest part of this job is customers,"
good,"Verizon offers employees the opporunity to earn a competitive salary and great benefits. However, I must say that the overall culture is suffering due to limited career growth opportunities and constant restructuring and downsizing of their workforce. As a reuslt, it is difficult for some employees to find a proper work/life balance due to the fear of losing their jobs in an increasingly competitive workplace."
good,Its retail and you work holidays and lots of weekends and late shifts. The plans are always changing and everyone has an old plan and you have to keep track of all the rules of plans.
good,"I normally come into work at about 8:30am or 9:00. I begin reviewing our store numbers for the month and what we need to be at for the end of the month. I try to organize my days with calendar reminders every day for different times out of the day. Verizon has taught me a lot about respect and how to speak to people and careful listening skills. My district manager is very inspiring and he knows how to run a business. My employees are amazing and enthusiastic, they're very hard working and do everything thing possible to keep our customers happy. The hardest part about the job is having to balance being a manager and being a college student, but I manage. Hard work goes a long way. The things I enjoy most is actually building a relationship with the customers and being able to help the with any issues that they may have. I really enjoy meeting new people and learning about their lives."
good,"Great benefits for the employees, was a great place to work however management was not so great. Moved on for better opportunities."
good,"training was awesome, management needs work... groomed to be robots no mistakes allowed sitting for hours, hardest part of the job was meeting the quality expectations, because you could not make any mistakes, 100 quality, the most enjoyable part was working with my co workers"
good,"Management from manager and up are clueless to what the workers on the floor really do which causes low morale."
good,The benefits were pretty good and the hour eligibility was awesome. The pay was fantastic for the rate and the fact that they had night and day shifts in full-time were great.
good,They were too far worked their 2 years went through 3 vechicles. Too many favorites and not enough fairness. Ever mistake you make you are threaten with losing your job.
good,No work life balance and very stressful environment. No job security constantly laying people off. Also do not enjoy the union work environment.
good,experience varies greatly on management. Little career advancement if you get a different degree than your working in.
good,Very limited opportunities and over priced.  Would not match competitors.  Best in class service but difficult to sell.
good,"Unfortunately, the culture started to change making it an unstable work environment.I learned what was necessary to provide management skills to careers in my future."
good,Manager was very new and didn't know much about what he was doing. Would not work there again. Not much more to say. Maybe someone else will have a better experience
good,"Unfortunately, Verizon does not have a simple method to calculate your sales compensation; therefore, you have no clue if your being compensated fairly or being cheated."
good,"Overall it's a very stressful environment on the upside the pay is good as well as the benefits. Be prepared to work 60-70 weeks and for there to be a reorg every six months. I have been there 2 years and I have now had 5 managers. Change is constant, but so is the paycheck."
good,Work life balance is no existent.  You're a number not a person. The only good thing about working for Verizon as a management employee is the paycheck.  If you're an associate backed by the strong union it is a pretty good place to work.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Your are busy every minute of the day, which was good for me. I believe that the way they handle commission is unfair. working 60+ hours a week is not a good way to live life."
good,inbound and outbound call center. I needed more pay for my customer service experience. I didn't like the outbound calling to customers
good,Depends on who trained new employees.  Very fast paces and high stress.
good,"Responsible for Developing and facilitating Trainings for the call center (1041 employees) around Customer Experience, Employee Experience, & Revenue Generation."
good,Work Environment was very nice co workers were very easy to get along with and management was good also i learned a lot being there and made some friends that i really enjoyed only bad part was the pay it took over a month of training and still no pay and was going to have to wait another 2-3 weeks for a pay
good,"This is a much different company now since the big merge, upper management seemed to be too remote to have a closer relationship with its employees.  Usually a challenging process to get idea across and budget approved."
good,this company definitely allows you to make money but you have to sacrifice a lot of your personal time and other things to get it.  I feel this company is more suited for single people.
good,"my review is a mediocre one because in the wireless industry your constantly walking on egg shells. There is no relax or down time for your self except your lunch break. "
good,"The first thing I was responsible for was opening or closing the store depending on what shift I had that day.  My day mostly consisted of helping customers with their wireless questions (account, device).  And the primary function of my role was to meet the sales goals set forth by management."
good,"Verizon is an overall great company.  Lately though the company has been making big cuts across the board. They've closed multiple call centers, laid off management and hourly employees.  Benefits started great at 100% paid but has fallen more in line with other companies where you have to pay a portion.  Management receives no retirement pension and hourly employees will likely lose that soon as well."
good,"I learned to work hard, using what is today coined an Agile process;"
good,"I started off there in 2002 as a customer service rep, and worked my way up to coordinator, then transferred to tech support. Liked tech support, my supervisors ranged from micromanagers to very laid-back. I was then taken out of tech support after coming back from knee surgery with a promise that I could get a refresher course in tech support, which never happened."
good,"Take incoming and make outgoing calls for collections, review their accounts,.help customers with payment arrangements. I learned  to handle every customers personality. Our work environment was like family we were always willing to help our co workers. The hardest part of my job was when customers were angry about their bill they would automatically call us names using profanity but I always overcame it by telling myself its not really directed at you and the enjoyable part of my job was that those customers that started out by calling me names had thanked me in the end for being a great help and an apology as well."
good,I learned a lot at Verizon but the skill set acquired seems frowned upon once you leave there. The Union works for the company and those jobs are one word from being terminated. The last Union president saved his meal ticket until after he was voted out to sign a deal with the company right before he retired which put a lot of people out of work.
good,enjoyable place to work. but the customers is what was hard. everyone around there tryed to help out as much as they could. management was there when ever needed.
good,Yea it was great. You should really check it out. I am actually just kidding.
good,"Lots ot smart great people being weighted down by inept, bureaucratic management"
good,"- a lot of driving "
good,"Worked for Verizon Wireless for 2 years in the North Charleston call center. I worked in the technical support department which at first was about resolving customers technical issues. As the call center gained new leadership the infrastructure focused on sales, which is great for a company to profit! but the sales goals became the tech support departments number 1 goal. Resolving the customers issues became less and less important, new programs were pushed out every week, new guidelines that were ridiculous to keep up with, Tech reps did not know what to say or what to offer customers other then promote into the new programs which at most time the customers did not qualify for. "
good,"At APAC it was my job to take approximately sixty calls per day, and to resolve the customers issues. Those issues could"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Worked posting paperwork and making sure cash safes were correct
good,"Worked with lot multiple task. Learned the company process. Worked with multiple departments. "
good,"Long days, long commute to Reading. I do nit have a review to write at this time... Is there no skip this part button and why is this a mandatory field?"
good,"Everyday we would motivate our workers and get them mentally prepared for the day with games and music."
good,"Okay company to work for, like any other sales organization you should be goal oriented."
good,"A typical work day felt like ""being handcuffed to my chair"" while the ""warden"" listened to my calls. Then being ""brought up on charges"" on a regular basis for ""crimes of lost sales opportunities"". I learned how to provide quality customer service, the importance of maintaining confidentiality and how to be a fantastic call center customer service representative despite management redicule. Management ""micro-manages"" and has no compassion for the employees. They'd rather have ""robots"" than humans working and taking these calls. Co-workers were awesome and, away from the office, would agree to the above and complain just the same. The hardest part of the job was being ""picked apart"" after each and every call by a supervisor that enjoyed making me feel like a rabbid child in a corner and kick me while I was down. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers, engaging with them and making a difference in their lives."
good,Working in a union shop was a culture shock to me as a Veteran. I was not excited to work there and work under rules that seemed to limit productivity.
good,there was a new challenge every day and always a new location to work.  Company did not believe in work life balance
good,"Working as a NOC engineer has been exciting, but also exhausting.  I have had to work awful schedules (Tues-Sat. 3-11PM, Wed-Sat 6pm-4am) without choices of when to work.  Management also pushed hard to have us escalate on union workers who were not going to do work, and more time was spent following up with issues and other groups than actual technical work. Also, our group was frequently blamed for things that were not our fault and I have had to go to great lengths to prove that. On the positive side, the work was never boring and I did end up feeling like I was doing something somewhat important."
good,There is always a fear of being laid off and employees are spread too thin doing work of 3 people. Excellent benefits but not worth the stress! I was sick because of work and stress and then laid off after all of my hard work. Employees are not valued here.
good,"I worked as an Assistant Manager for three years. The employees were great, the owner/store manager is still the worst person I've ever known in management. MICROMANAGEMENT would be an understatement. His days off, he would sit at home and watch our point of sales system to see if we had made any sales and then call us when he didn't see anything new. Only he could use every system, and he didn't trust anyone with anything other than their own login and password for Verizons systems, so no one had ""manager"" capabilities. Only he could make orders like phones and accessories. ALL of our accessories were bought for a buck or two on amazon and then resold between $20 and $40 in store. Literally a 10-20X mark up on almost everything. He would buy used/refurbished phones and have his employees sell them on upgrades as new phones lying to customers. Then he would break his back in service for the rudest of customers and be a complete jerk to the face of the nicest people and refuse to help them. He had absolutely no control of his store, employees or customers. He had no management abilities at all and that's why a lot of our customers walked in, and left. Because of him."
good,"If you do not like working with technology and the latest and greatest in mobile technology advancements, you will not like this job. I for one, love working with gadgets, and I always have. For this, I actually enjoyed what I did at Verizon. Talking and helping people with their mobile devices and other products. But! When it's everything else that comes along with it that really makes this job, not worth it. You will have absolutely no life. I was guilted into doing so much overtime at this job that I would hardly ever see my family. There were weeks where I worked over 70 hours."
good,"Good hours especially for retail, but in my particular retailer (Mobilized) there are no benefits for full time workers and no room for advancement. They make you feel easily replaced."
good,A typical day at Verizon Livesource was dealing with about 1500 callers per day all while having to handle each call within 24 seconds… it was a very very stressful job since you have to deal with people shouting and yelliing in your ear. The benefits were excellent  and the management was very understanding and helpful.
good,Not as Organized as it could be. It is not the worse nor the best place to be. The benefits are okay but could always be better. Management can stand to take some management classes and classes on how to speak to their employees as people and not kids
good,"I worked for Verizon for 2 years and found that the team they put together to support JetBlue was filled with excellent Techs, the way the conducted business was excellent, issues I had were due to lack of any forward movment within my department in Utah, we were the only few techs within VSSI and the ability to move forward within that side of Verizon was limited due to lack of places to move up within Utah. Had I moved to New York state or someplace on the east coast I would have been better off."
good,It was up and down working for Verizon Wireless. During the times that I was in my leaderships plans I supported in sales and development of the district. Any time you are assigned a new manager nothing you did in the past matters.
good,worked for vzw for 10 years was very complicated to advance.  The only available job opportunities were rotational but would lead back to original position after rotation.
good,"Just a number, no compassion. The company lacked training or specific guidelines for employee relations and interaction. Any slight misunderstand or mis-communication results in separation."
good,"I enjoy the work but over the last few years Verizon has been consumed like a lot of employers about the bottom line which has created a very tense working environment. Most, if not all the people I work with do not enjoy coming to work anymore because of the micro managing environment."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"After 15 years it was time to go."
good,"I worked in the Freehold, NJ Fiber Solutions Center for 3 years. It is a call center for customer and field tech support. The management and a significant portion of support staff are incompetent. The management, all the way up the food chain to Basking Ridge, just care about their numbers, not the customers. They want you to fix the problem, but also be off the phone call within a certain amount of time, otherwise their numbers look bad. They intimidate and use scare tactics against employees. Major stress trying to placate irate customers and major stress from management. I was a network tech and supported field techs. The field techs are the face of Verizon to the customer, but they would rather have you off the phone asap, rather than fix the problem. It's a no win situation. Verizon is penny wise and dollar foolish and in the end it's the customer that suffers. They pay well and have good benefits, but after a short while, the stress and torrid conditions aren't worth it. It is truly like being a prisoner and being subjected to psychological torture. P.S. - Don't fall for FIOS!"
good,The company claims to be family oriented but when my small child was in the hospital I was asked to come into work. The schedule is ever changing as you have to bid on your schedule every few months.  It is a very professional environment and I did learn to be more professional on the phone. Although many of the supervisors and managers need to practice this more.  Perks were they have a gym and cafeteria on site.  Also extensive training before you are say left on your own
good,"Unfortunately, there is no leadership in this organization. The internal order process is not organized and ridiculous. Management has no clue how to drive business or bring collaboration among employees or with core account teams. We saw the VP of our organization one time in a year. That should tell you something."
good,"good customers that aren't whiny, pay is okay."
good,"Customer service and generating sales was a typical day "
good,They are a true business that wants to be #1 24/7. They will do anything to get there. glad im gone. 
good,This is a very stressful job due to a high volume of technical related calls about resolving irate customer issues with take a toll on employees. Many people get sick due to lack of movement at job and high stress environment.
good,"A great company to work for, but you have beginning family or social family. Company demands a lot from there employee. If you would not be able to balance work and life, not the company for you."
good,Management is do not care about employees in the CSSC and but pay is good. 
good,It was good for the pay and benefits . I learned a lot from my Fifteen plus years there . Good education and experience . Company changed its core business and gave buyout in lieu of layoffs . Going to all wireless Technology etc .
good,"When I get to work, there seems to always be a fire that needs to be put out. I may have my mind set on doing one task, however, based on what is urgent at that time I will have to deal with that first. Communication sometimes is not always the best, but seems to be getting better. My peers are cool to work with, because we assist one another whenever any of us needs assistance. My agents that report to me, seem to be pretty self sufficient, and can do the work with no problems. The hardest part of my job is when I have to deliver bad news to someone that I have been trying to help them out. The most I enjoy about my work are my co-workers, they make the job seem simple and easy enough to do."
good,"Verizon is huge company and sometimes you need a luck to achieve your goal. I was lucky to have a great teammembers, manager and director. My director had big vision and clear direction and took us to next level. The task process was based on Effective and efficent, CMMi, Agile, coordinate and communicate, think outside of the box and etc. It was great ride and it helped me to be successful worker. In my next job, my clients were very impressed with new innovated ideas, problem solving skills and effective/efficient process."
good,"This is not a company I would work for again. Organizational skills were a joke. Keeping promises for customers were not very reliable. All sales, no customer care. Training was passively effective at best. Great pay, little values."
good,"Good opportunity to make money, but there are too many complications put in the way that makes it a struggle to do our job."
good,"I worked for Verizon and took my job very seriously. I was leading month over month in my stats, the managment shows favorites and when you do get in a bind they do not stand behind what they say. I will never consider this company agaion. I have been so happy both in work life and personal life since I left this company."
good,Verizon is a very soundly run company that values the bottom line of profitability above all other concerns.
good,"I don't want to write too much about this company. It was a job for me. If you're in management, expect to never see your family. If you're an hourly employee, expect to never see your family. Enough said."
good,Very hard to apply to other positions in the company that don't require you to be on the phone. You are your numbers!
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I enjoy my job at Verizon. Good people to work with. However, I was told this would be a 3 month contract position with going fulltime perm at the end of 90 days if I took and passed all required courses work. All course was completed I was placed in the center and 5 months later promoted to EA/Project Manager for the Center Director. This is a fun job but having no benefits it is time for me to start looking outside Verizon."
good,There were many management issues and hidden agendas that were detrimental to their employees contracted for security.
good,Ok place to work but they hire via a temp company and you dont get the same benifits
good,My typical day of work consisted on taking phone calls coming in for customer service. I would sometimes be pulled off for coachings weekly. I learned much information in regards to soft-skills and as well as billing and payment information. My co-workers were normally friendly and considerate enough. I believe the hardest part of the job was my schedule as well as my management. The most enjoyable part of my job was definitely speaking with the customers on a daily basis.
good,7:30 - 4
good,Performance based environment which hosts and owns the customer experience and gauge the perception of customers versus your performance. It is very subjective and political due to call center nature.
good,At the time I was there this was by far the most serious work environment I had been in. Unfortunately my experiences there were not what I would have liked; there were some promises made that I don't believe were ever going to be followed through on as far as promotions which led me to leave.
good,"Typical day at work is helping customers with billing, device questions, upgrades and selling new service."
good,Verizon Wireless is a good company. Nice benefits for employees but they do not listen to employee suggestions and definitely promote high sellers that are not necessarily the best employees for the job.
good,"my typical day at work is finding ways to save money and time for my customers, my enviroment is extreamly busy but at the same time rewarding.."
good,"Verizon was a great place to learn and a great place to make sales because of the area, but when it came to overall store-volume, the Ballwin location was very slow. Some days we would only have 2 customers come in during a 10 hour shift."
good,Enjoyed my co workers and assisting customers but the hardest part of the job was the constant time schedule changes was really what pulled me away from this position.
good,Typical day would include:
good,There were a lot of clicks in the district I was in so not a great environment for if you didn't tow the company line.
good,For the kind of work that is performed on a daily basis the rate pay doesn't compensate at all. You learned a lot on how to deal with difficult customers but once again the low pay rate is not good enough for me as a professional.
good,"The atmosphere of the store was mostly about numbers. As it is a business of selling, most people were focused only on sales."
good,Verizon had great benefits and was a great opportunity to hone my sales skills. I'm ready to persue a career that will provide a stable income and a friendly work environment.
good,"The benefits are great and the training is wonderful. I believe the company as a whole was a great place to work. However, in my district there were many challenges with management."
good,"good work life balance, too much gosssiping. job done get ready for the next day."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great benefits, Seem to have job security not alot of oppurtunity for growth"
good,"Get ready to be a punching bag. Surveys were a joke, and there was no way to change system mistakes. You aren't rated on how well you did your job. If a customer just wanted to vent about the company, you still took the hit in your stats. You are in competition with your coworkers, so there is subsequent drama. Can feel like a high school.."
good,"I love this job when I first started, but unfortunately it has become a very competitive industry. The company is more focused on getting new customers, versus retaining the current."
good,"No work/life balance, work long hrs, cant take off when you want to even if you have PTO, a lot of favoritism, upper management only care about numbers"
good,"It's an interesting job, we either sell phones to polite customers or get verbally abused by people upset at Verizon as a whole. No in-between. Management is not very compassionate and understanding of disabilities."
good,"At First working there it was amazing, the job was good and actually easy and i caught on quick, and i felt the job was definitely worth the pay, however the job did begin to be extremely stressful, because they had emphasized on meeting stat goals which for the most part were unfair to the reps ,and the workplace was severely mismanaged, such as supervisors would have meetings at peak busy times and leave with no floor support. there were great supervisors who were there for you and your success, but there was either low quality support where i wouldn't be able to fully assist my customer at times and then were my metrics would get effected sometimes. I would recommend working here short term until something else better comes along."
good,You have to be in a certain group to be promoted....so many people have left it use to be a great fun environment now it's just about ur numbers just over it
good,"Good customer focus. Senior leaders don't walk the talk when it comes to people development and eliminating bias. Turf wars are encouraged or not addressed in a timely manner, a lot of duplication of effort to keep each others silos growing."
good,Verizon was a company i thought i'd  retire with but its just not the same. It seems as if they are trying to push out tenured employees and they are succeeding
good,Working at verizon was very productive and challenging . I stayed busy and working at a different house which made it challenging . i enjoyed working and helping other.
good,"Good pay. Great perks. In my experience, management sucked. Like working in a tank full of sharks? Well VZW is for you! If you like money and can sell, then you have a bright future."
good,"it was good at first, then the culture AND pay changed for the worst. I feel like they were trying to push out all the older reps who were making really good money, just to bring in new, less qualified people who they didn't need to pay as much."
good,People are friendly and encourage collaboration to accomplish tasks.  Encouraged to learn and grow your career.  Constant change in work direction and process.
good,"Worked at Verizon for 11 years..Slowly saw the decline in appreciation of employees, pay and integrity. Employee benefits go away or get lesser by the year. No matter how much you sell or do its never good enough and they want more. Management has become nothing but extreme micromanagers.  12 employees left my store location in a 6 month period."
good,"Verizon is not a bad place to work. It has it's pros and cons like any other company. You are in charge of your destiny at verzon. However, it can be very political there."
good,"Minimum wage and a fight for sales. Quotas constantly going up and new ""strategies"" are made on how to fool people into buying phones and contracts. Some months are better than others, however, there was little room to advance."
good,Was expected to meet a minimum number of tests performed and closed in a day.  Was very difficult to do if the test did not pass.  Felt extreme pressure to meet these numbers.
good,Strict working guidelines in a call center environment. Hardest part is staying on the phone for long durations. Your outlook is so dependent on your immediate supervisor and manager.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The entire company is driven off of performance reviews.  Unfortunately, this is implemented poorly.  You can't just be doing your job well, or even exceptionally.  You have to be driving change."
good,"Verizon is a very busy workplace. Things move at such a fast pace. It's easy to get stuck in a role, so I recommend that you explore a different role or assignment every 3 to 4 years."
good,Great pay and benefits but it’s not worth the mental stress this job causes some managers are good while majority not great at all I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone PA metric constantly changing
good,They have good perks with their phone plans. Work life balance can sometime be a challenge. There is a lot of turnover in the industry which can make building a strong culture difficult.
good,"Over the years, the company became much more of a company with a do more with less. The 'threat' of RIFS were always a concern. Pay was pretty good but the management style changed."
good,"Although the people were great, in my first week i experienced working 50 hours and no lunch. my second week when i worked alone i experienced someone coming into the store and stealing. i was not prepared on what to do in that situation because no one told me what needed to be done in case that would happen"
good,Verizon overall is a wonderful company to work for with good potential advancement opportunities. Each individual District is run differently depending on the district manager and store managers that have been hired. In my experience management has been very poor and hard to work under.
good,Verizon was a fun place to work for. I met a lot of great people there the only thing I would say is once new management came it became very shady at the store I was working at.
good,"The work is interesting, but the Company is always focused on reducing costs.  That can spell trouble for long term job prospects."
good,Considering I wasn't working for verizon directly ot wasn't half bad until comp was cut by 3/4. I was working for Etech which was hired as a third party for verizon.
good,"And that's how they keep you, good benefits for dealing with poor support and micro management, no human factor you are a statistic...a number...on a piece of paper that affects the bottom line"
good,"Verizon is purely Number/Money Driven like most companies and/or all centers. They have had massive layoffs in the last few years and there is absolutely NO job security. Management is ok being that they follow what they are supposed to do/tell you from what information they are told. The work culture is ok but very caddy/messy being mostly women work there. Pay tended to be well or equal to what they position would pay in most companies. The best part of working there was payday, vacation and clocking out for the day."
good,Missed business opportunities that lead to lagging revenue.  The company was so focused on trying to reinvent itself as a content provider while failing at it's core competency as a telecom utility.  The result is bad decisions by incompetent leadership.
good,This was a very heavy sales oriented job you either meet there sales goals or it's next in line but if you can consistently perform this job pays well
good,"I left Verizon after 16 years because our customers were being ignored regardless of how management like myself pointed out poor practices.  I also could no longer suspend or terminate my employees for no good reason other than ""if you punish the good, the rest will fall in line..."""
good,Productive team oriented workplace.  Everyone is expected to put to in long hours.  This includes weekends.  You are treated as a professional and are accountable for your actions.
good,"Great upbeat environment, with competitive goals . Pretty decent targets , not very flexible with hours if your in school . No job security. Favoritism is big ."
good,"Verizon is an ok job money wise and for this reason only. Ok wait, maybe another reason, it's pretty good to have on your resume. But with this job you get extremely poor work-life balance. And the culture is ok but it is very competitive even at times when it needs not be. The harmony is off overall."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon has changed a lot since I started back in September of 2010. From what I'm told, I have the most difficult job in the company and it can be difficult, however I feel if the right tools and support were still in place then it could be a much less stressful time."
good,Management can be very lacking of knowledge while demanding the world from the representatives. It was easier to get help from another representative than from management
good,"The company has great benefits but management is just about luck some are great, others are terribles. The culture in the stores does not reflect the mission of the company-"
good,"Advancement was always encouraged but metrics were stringent, sometimes changing without notice and after applying for promotions. Pay was good, benefits and time off excellent. But day-to-day job was overwhelmingly stressful."
good,"in a sales position like verizon, you determine how much you are going to make after your hourly/salary. the harder you work and step up, the more money you will make. The more you relax in the work environment, the less you will make"
good,I loved traveling every day reaching out to agents and agent employees.  I feel a great deal of satisfaction knowing I helped VZW customers on a daily basis.
good,The culture was very cut throat and stressful. I stayed for 11 years because of the pay and benefits. Management can be very unprofessional and a lot of nepotism.
good,"I held a sells job. They required things from that and if you didn't produce, you were scolded for it. Like a child by children. Moving up in the company was greatly based on who you knew."
good,Verizon Wireless is very stressful work environment. The company doesn’t care about their employees health and work life balance. Verizon Wireless makes you feel bad about calling out from work for your health.
good,"Management checks in potential customers at the door. If you are in good standing with management, new customers will be passed along to you. If not, expect a long day doing tech support."
good,"VZ is an Eastern company run by people in NE USA--if you work for them in Management do not expect politeness because the people --especially director and above --can be tough ""sharks"" who take a very hard nose approach to their daily activities.  Arguments during conference calls are not uncommon."
good,"Flex time and working from home was offered by our manager, however upper management would frown upon this. They would like for you to work 9+ hour work days with no option to work from home. The culture here could be described as: departments/divisions not cooperating with each other and critical of each others' processes. People would forget that 'we work for the same company!'"
good,"•Making calls non stop to drive sales and hit a certain call number daily"
good,"The company provides a great environment. They have decent pay and great benefits. The job itself is extremely stressful. The part of the job I wish I knew before I accepted is how mentally and emotionally draining, exhausting, and costly it is to your mental health. The down side is the verbal abuse you suffer from some of the callers. The lack of work/life balance. I would highly recommend going into anything outside of the care department."
good,"company does not care or value employees complaints or provide a career path clearly to existing employees."
good,"Very low key atmosphere. Very hands on, can be stressful at times. I learned a lot, it just wasn't the location for me. I would have rather been busier than to stand around at this location."
good,"I do not recommend for good leadership. "
good,Not recommended. Lots of internal politics. All management people are some how relatives to each other. They have turned a business giant to a family circus.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"My experience working for Verizon was an okay one. My manager was often very rude & hostile but also tried to be the ""cool"" one and get along with everyone when he wasn't having outbursts or picking on others. If it wasn't for him, I'd probably still be working for Verizon or would have worked for them longer. He is the reason I quit since it was taking a toll on my mental health."
good,"All about the sales quota! Unrealistic ones at that, you must oversell in order to hit sales goals and often it will require work on off days to do so, as well as questionable sales practices."
good,"I worked for 12 years and was severenced during their many merges. This was my career goal and after the hard work, I was asked to assist with training the person who was taking over my position. I tried to reapply but once you get a severenced they would block you out for no rehire. I guess I was just a number to them. I guess I should have went with the other companies during their mergers. Some good managers and some very incompetent ones."
good,I worked here for some time and it was okay there I got my work done sometimes stayed an extra hour mgr was nice and co workers was nice as well my hours was good
good,Primarily work from home as a Sys admin. co-workers and direct management great to work for and with. Being on-call 7x24 hardest part. Enjoyed being a build engineer / project engineer.
good,"Higher end management at the location I was at, was very unprofessional and everyone leaves due to her disrespect. If the owner would recognize this, this location would be amazing to work for!"
good,Decent 4 yeas with the company. Didn't see my future there though. Too much demand to sell for the amount payed. Unrealistic sales quotas that would changed constantly.
good,"Management won't understand that you have personal life as well and ask you to attend the client call even at 12 AM"
good,Verizon is where I earned my PMP.  I worked in projects and as a program manager on the Allstate account.  The pay was low compared to other companies so I chose to work elsewhere on contract.
good,Working with high expectations and drive. I was expected to perform on my arrival and was reminded quickly that I needed results or I would be moved. I enjoyed it for the most part and wanted to learn as much as I can. Unfortunately I was laid 4 months in the company due to store being closed.
good,Workdays could be very stressful. There was a daily goal for the number of calls one could take in a day which added to the stress. Sometimes the rules of the company didn't apply to management but always applied to the worker bees.
good,You have to plan the game of thrones here to get ahead and it kinda ruins the binge watching experience for me lol...I do believe things will get better here but at the cost of a few good people. I don't hate the players... I hate the game.
good,"High turnover rate, no balance with family life. Managers were great and training was amazing. Company policy conflicted with what was required of staff"
good,"Overall this is an amazing place to work at. We're like family and the company is typically good to their employees.... for the most part"
good,"The compensation and benefits (salary, bonus, health care, paternity leave) are all above comparables of corporations.  "
good,"I was laid off from Verizon in 2016 with what I'm guessing was upwards of 10k other people. They offered a severance that was in line with my compensation - fair, but not quite enough to do anything interesting with. They offered us the opportunity to find work elsewhere in Verizon - which seemed to result in dozens of applications for each available sales positions in a store, no matter what job you held prior. I took my severance and moved to a different state in order to find better work."
good,I think the conference center is miss managed and they have too many over paid people there that do nothing. They will lay people off that are doing the work and let others that are over paid to do nothing.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"After 6 years with the company, they change a rule witch everyone one has been doing for years. Then with the rule change, it's a way for them to cut staffing in order to save money on work force no matter who it effects."
good,"VZW was a very intense company to work for, the stress was high all of the time. The stats were a constant focus and the general disdain from their customer base was taxing."
good,They are ok. I would not recommend a long term career here but it is decent money and decent benefits. They don't like to promote from within even though they say they do. That is what bothered me the most. But overall had a good experience here.
good,"Managers do not care much about developing or even talking about developing employees, company does not promote within preferring to hire from outside at cheaper salaries"
good,"If you work here, you will be asked to sell to customers in a way that is dishonest and pushy. Very stressful. Payouts have gone down in recent years."
good,They needed better trainers because when it came time to getting on the floor some things you didn't know and they expected you to know that they didn't teach you in training and you were yelled at or they were frustrated with you about and when you raise your flag for the management management wanted to do their job cuz they didn't want to deal with the customers which was unfair to us because I'm being yelled at for you on top of me for something that we had no idea what they do need better trainers for the call center other than that everything was fine
good,"When I started working for Verizon things were great. Goals were obtainable and the compensation matched the goals. Since then, Verizon has undergone multiple compensation re-structuring. The goals since then have risen but the compensation has not."
good,"Highly structured environment with micromanaged systems and processes. Customer support representatives have to ""spin"" unresolved issues to retain customers. Support agents are also  ""encouraged"" to grow the business by doubling as sales agents. Difficult for many to advance to other areas outside of the department. While being a ""self starter"" in the company is highly desired, it doesnt guarantee promotion."
good,although Verizon has great opportunities for individuals for specified advancement it lacks in structure to help people with development for the better position within the company.
good,"This is a company focused on its customers. However, if you are just starting out, or if you think this is a fun place to work - LOOK ELSEWHERE. Unfortunately, the workplace culture is stuck in 1999 and the management is worse. Mostly, it seems that upper management is trying to make locations more inviting to the younger workforce, but is failing at every single turn. If you're a person with new ideas, be prepared to be shut down at anything remotely fun. On the off chance that any of your ideas do get approved, just know that there is an 80% chance that your manager, or senior manager will take all of the credit and leave you wondering why you even bothered. Workplace advancement is very slow, and trying to get ahead is slim in general. Don't expect much unless you're willing to be around for 20+ years."
good,General call center work. Over 80 calls a day non-stop. Management is never satisfied. High stress. Rarely if ever any off phone time. Multiple metrics goal monthly. no schedule flexibility.
good,"Work environment is very uneasy and there is always a threat of getting laid off."
good,"Verizon has been a Good Job, but in my field (UNION) there is No room for advancement, It's been decent over the years, Good People but work is on the decline and the group is slowly shrinking,"
good,"You are just a number to the company. Not matter your tenure or skill set and knowledge you bring. If the company is making cuts, you will get cut...."
good,"A typical work day at Verizon was good for the most part. Sadly I learned more about company politics at Verizon than I did at any other job. The workplace culture was negative much of the time as Verizon slowly took away benefits and retirement plans over the years. Employee morale was low when I left. Workforce reductions were a common occurrence which led to more employee dissatisfaction. They also have a tendency to age discriminate.  However I will say it wasn't all negative. The company provided excellent healthcare benefits and I really enjoyed working with my colleagues. Overall though, the negatives outweighed the positives."
good,"Verizon is the 800 pound gorilla that is not easily customizable to clients needs. Current culture is tentative with over 75,000 “tenured” individuals, like me, who have been offered very generous cash offers to take an early out. The payment is too big to refuse. Verizon will be mostly shorter termed employees and engineers making tougher to customize client solutions in the Wireline Enterprise group."
good,The people there are great! As for the managers they were awesome if you have no issues with home or sick kids all the time. I definitely would recommend this job if you are able to not get home life mixed in at all with work life.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon will try and convince you to buy into this obtuse company culture that rewards political prowess rather than merit. Don't get me wrong it is not the worst job in the world. But it is a call center. If you like working at call centers, this is as good as it gets. But like any center, it is a place where your numbers are everything. Getting up to use the bathroom is tracked. Micromanagement is how the machine keeps moving...and it's hard not to feel like more than a small cog in that machine."
good,"If you can’t hang with the ‘bros’ or your management, forget about it. It’s simply a boys club in this area and no one truly cares about customer service.  Sales"
good,"this is a what have you done for me lately type of environment"
good,"Constant, never ending transformation and change which forces people to reapply for their own jobs, job eliminations and overall instability which causes significant distractions.  Verizon acts like it is a privilege to  work there."
good,Any college grad can start here and gain work experience than move within the company if you are lucky or move forward with another opportunity elsewhere.
good,It was great at times and hard. It was always very demanding and always under a deadline with management and senior managers.  Expectations were set high and it was expected to deliver regardless of the resources around you.  If the project was well designed and funded well thise programs went well.
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for. They properly train employees on their products and services. They offer annual bonuses, employee discounts, vacation and personal time."
good,I really love my team but the opportunities to grow seem limited. Use your skills and network. Utilize the tuition reimbursement. Move up if you can. If not try somewhere else.
good,Verizon is a retail driven company and depending on who you work for it can be a good workplace culture. I enjoyed my time at Verizon and would work there again if the opportunity presented itself.
good,"Company needs to go back to doing good for the customers. I doubt if those in management have a clear view of how the company makes a profit."
good,"This job was difficult to manage due to retail hours, 100% commission and traveling schedule.  Plenty of people make a lot of money there, but unless you absolutely LOVE selling phones and trying to cram plans that little old ladies don't need, then I don't recommend this job."
good,"Verizon Wireless does not value education when I worked there. I left after achieving 3 degrees with this company and could not get off the customer service representative list.of jobs there. Managers are unavailable for employment references and it is almost impossible to find someone committed to being a solid reference now that I have left the business. Verizon Wireless is not a good company to reapply to. The hiring managers spite of my education level did not value me as an employee. The feedback I received for nonadvancement was minuet like I was to tall, walk hard. I desperately wanted to leave and did. Not the best business long term."
good,"Fast paced, competitive environment that is in constant reorganization with regular workforce reductions.  Employees are hard working and loyal through all the changes.  Surviving and thriving in this environment ensures one will survive anywhere."
good,"Come in, look for seat arrangement, check computer for games or shows, get ready to run my games or shows, run games, check replay on games,  go home."
good,"Maintained servers and sofware.  Answered user questions.  Attended planning meetings.  Learned much more about Linux, SQL.  Direct management was great.  Workplace Culture was good and people worked well together.  Hardest  part of job was interdepartmental politics.  Most enjoyable part of job was learning and troubleshooting."
good,I have worked with Verizon for most of my working career.  I have found them to be good as far as training is concerned.  Much of my experience has been learned on a daily basis actually doing the various jobs i have performed.
good,unrealistic sales goals. managers only want to push sales on high priced accessories and push u to persuade customers that they have to buy them in order to purchase a phone in a bundle deal..
good,Missing future directions. Seems Management and Sr leadership not focused on long term goal rather short term which continues to impact company targets. Same management remains in position however key skilled resources shown door.
good,Layoffs reduce the opportunity for growth in the company.  You finally get promoted to a position and then they remove the position in the company causing you to step back into the position.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is an okay place to  work.  Not great but there is a boys club of goofy managers and they are entitled to o what they want.  Not that exciting but there are worse
good,Quotas constantly increasing but pay out is decreasing. A lot of politics and difficult if you are a single parent. Weekends and holidays are not yours.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Verizon Wireless but the work life balance especially during holidays was horrible. Also if you have a different view than a coworker you will be targeted whether or not you speak publically about said view. I saw this happen to over 10 different solution specialist in three different districts. Management plays favorites and if you need to go out on FMLA you're basically blacklisted when you come back.
good,"On a typical day at work we would spend two to three hours in meetings for Junior and Senior staff training. After the morning meetings, each trainer would gather their sales team for another hour or so to help them improve their sales technique. After that the sales team would go door to door, asking if people want Verizon Services. This was anywhere from seven to nine hours nocking on doors to try to sign people up for Verizon services."
good,I would say this is a good place for a college kid needing some extra cash.  Not the best for family life.  I could not find a good balance between my home life and work life.
good,No thanks not unless you want to pay me for my time. I do not give marketing to former employers for free. More words to finish this up blah blah blah
good,Peers are great to work with. Company would be a great place to work if they would do more for their employees. Job security should be handled more professionally if there is a  serious situation happening with the company.
good,"My time at Verizon was somewhat enjoyable for the 1 year. My second and third year, is what Made my decision to leave the company. Between management and tinkering with pay plans, I was making less money doing the same amount of work and production as previous years. Management selections for our store were something to be desired. Rather that hire leaders that supported the people who made that store great on a daily basis, people who were power hungry and in-experienced were hired. It was the eventual downfall of a really great team that made our store one of the best in the district and region."
good,This is a good place to work if you are in between careers and need steady pay and a lot of hours while you're in school or figuring out your true calling in life. It is not ideal to really build a career.
good,Verizon Is a great company to work for but you need to be aware of your surrounding and how you present yourself.  There are multiple deliverables that seem to be in constant conflict so learning how to prioritize and balance the work and still be productive is a great skill.  You will impress by your ability to do the work with a smile and be ready for the next project.
good,"There is a lot of unethical stuff promoted by management just make sure you are doing the right thing always.  For example, They will try to manipulate trade ins to make more money off a single customer"
good,People are hired for their sales` skills but are constantly watched on every transaction as if they don't know how to sell.  Experienced sales people who know how to communicate with their customers are given a specific set of options on what to present to customers even when the salesman already knows the required product or service is wrong or not applicable to customer.  Plans and promotions are presented always to maximize the transaction by adding devices or phone lines whether they are needed by the customer or not.
good,"Verizon has a tendency to chip away at a lot of the perks that made the job attractive. Over the past several years work/life balance has been reduced along with the ability to telecommute; even though the tools are more advanced. These changes are also dependent upon the organization in which you work so it's not consistent across the board. There also has become very little flexibility in which office you can report to even if you are an individual contributor. The benefits contribution has creeped up and the plans aren't as robust. In addition, downsizing has unfortunately become the norm."
good,"verizons creedo boils down to they want more with less. this is all good but not at the cost of your company's knowledge base. it is one thing to remove the fat from any company/department, but to remove the long term knowledge with out any way to replace or preserve it can cost you more then you wish to spend."
good,"The people you meet there are amazing"
good,"* Check emails, review voicemails, handle priorities within case load"
good,"Customers were difficult to handle   "
good,"This position provided a typical 8-5 mentality, with good benefits, and decent pay.  However, the ability to promote, or even lead within the team, was non-existent.  Everyone knew they were stuck where they were, with no advancement opportunities, nor the drive to advance.  I for one would have wanted to advance, and even asked to on several occasions, but they did not provide the resources or guidance to do so.  All of my co-workers had been in the same positions for decades, but seemed to be comfortable with that.  A few simply said  they do not want to promote because of the bureaucracy and politics above our levels.  If you want a stagnant 8-5 job, with good medical benefits, and decent pay, this may be for you.  But, if you want to move up the ranks, this particular position did not provide that."
good,I love interacting with people so for the time i had the opportunity to work there i enjoyed it. The hardest part of the job was the weather. People often turn you down.
good,"Fast paced, technical support.  Supervisors sometimes very hard to find or even unwilling to felt.  Not a great experience. I enjoyed working with many of the customers.  Some of the management/supervisors were great, others hard to find when there was a question or I needed a cal escalation."
good,"Please keep in mind, contractors are not always handled as employees."
good,Beaucoup de travail et pas de sécurité de l'emploi ou peu d'evolution. Collègues très sympas; bonne marque pour le CV
good,"High stressed, but rewarding. Just need to positive and surround yourself with people who are moving up within the company. You can only stress if you let others control your work."
good,Verizon has eliminated thousands of management jobs in the last 15 years so job security is nonexistent.  People are assigned a great deal more work than they can usually complete in a superior manner.
good,Once the company’s stress was worth it because of the pay. Over time everyone makes far less and the stresses to preform have sky rocketed.  No one knows when they will be separated but it’s a fear the front line lives with daily. The stocks and shares look gray but it’s at the expense of the frontline.
good,Current management structure and employee review process almost rewards negative feedback and micromanagement from management to front line employees.
good,The job is pretty good if you just go and do your job dont attempt to make extra friends or be friends with your sup because at the end of the day if your job is on the line they would rather it be you than them i've watched alot of reps lose their job being in relationships with sups or other people in the center. The environment is pretty laid back and the job is easy however there really isnt any support from the higher ups they expect you do everything with no help they barely want to do their jobs . A lot of communication is lacked at verzion
good,"Verizon's culture has dramatically changed over the past 10 years. The collaborative environment that once was is now a seemingly never ending fire drill caused by the leaders of the business not being aligned on company and overall strategy and goals -- priorities are very much by business channel and a ""let's see who gets the project completed first"" mindset."
good,"The company is ran very differently depending on the area. I've worked in the Mid-West, North East and the South. Each area was completely different and I only felt like a person in one of these regions."
good,I loved my co workers.  Great pay and wonderful incentives and commissions as well as insurance. I had a great time almost every day at work. Could be very stressfull at times so you had to have thick skin and be prepared to handle customer escalations in a proper fashion.It was not the work envirenment for a single mother with two small children due to the long working hours and overtime.
good,"Make no mistake, Verizon is a fast paced retail environment. Your feet are to the fire as soon as you leave their inadequate training."
good,"The big two used to be a great place to work and make really good money, however they now practice very shady selling tactics in order to get close to hitting quotas. This causes most reps to not disclose very important info to customers which is why VZW suffers from poor retail store experiences. Agent stores are even worse than Corp stores since they are mainly commission based with very little hourly pay. Corp VZW has great 401k and benefit packages but be prepared to lose some integrity if you work for either Corp or Agent/resellers"
good,"I worked for Verizon Wireless 13 years in sales, in which I obtained my Bachelor's degree through the tuition assistance. I applied for several positions but was never promoted."
good,"Meh it's a corporate job.  Their benefits are good-but I felt you're really just treated as a number.  Was not my favorite place to work, especially since they took a lot of tools away that helped us take care of customers.  It was even worse being a customer"
good,"At first it seemed everything was fine. There are talks of promotions and becoming manager and you are doing a great job, but if you make a simple mistake you are in for a world of hurt. I mean so simple as to be late once after being on time for months. By late I mean 1 minute and 3 seconds at the most."
good,Great employees focused on providing outstanding customer service and innovative solutions. Challenging work & wonderful benefits. Promotional Opportunities can be limited within some organizations. External talent is highly pursued to bring new perspectives to this mature firm.
good,"I did not feel fulfilled at this job.  The pay and benefits are great, but there is little room for advancement.  The monthly goals are high. The overall culture is poor due to the management and micromanaging."
good,"I worked  in call center environment, stuck on 12-9pm shift... management changed often, frustrated employees often walked off the job. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"My managers did the best they could most of the time. Alot of stuff rolled downhill."
good,Working in Verizon was a great first step after graduating in 2014. at first hours were stable and work environment was pleasant but than it felt like hours were not stable always up and down 40 to only 10 hours a week.
good,A typical day at work was producing reports for the sales team. I learned a great deal about features and how to read a wireless phone bill. Management was horrible! I had a manager with some illness but the illness was mostly too many booze and sleeping around. This company keeps bad employees too long. And get rid of those that are innovators and not afraid of improvements. Most people at Verizon look forward to the yearly bonus.
good,Too many changes without explaining the whys behind the changes.  The benefits are great but have decreased over the past several years.  I feel like a number and don't feel valued.
good,"Working at Verizon is definitely a stable job but they sell you on being a business owner and your ability (no matter the role) to make business decisions and to take accountability for those decisions. The negative about that is it seems a lot of management isn't really qualified for their job and know less than the actual employees. Employees are required to empathize with customers, own the issue, and provide stellar service but the leadership for Verizon is unfortunately lacking that. So many qualified individuals get lost in the shuffle, only because of office politics and relationships."
good,They don't care at all about individual you are just another number. Only concerned about profit and image that is it. Great money but you work for it and get nothing but pay check
good,"Great compensation a lot of politics. Great money no work home balance. A typical day at work started with grabbing your IPAD logging in hopefully your IPAD was functioning properly. Management at Verizon was a joke, they knew nothing and were lazy. Its hard to find good managers who stayed on top of the changes and systems, and could truly help you when running into a dilemma. The workplace culture is fun, a lot of freedom, very competitive, and great compensation, so people are mostly friendly, but they may steal your sale but that is all apart of the sales culture. The hardest part of the job, was meeting newline quotas and all the other expectations, it can become stressful and mind consuming at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the commission check. Work hard play harder good look having time to spend it."
good,"The most profitable thing to do is to hunt and steal leads/deals from your co-workers. This practice is accepted and there are rules of engagement. The benefits and such are great, but it isn't fun."
good,"Promotions are based on whether or not you produce a lot of sales, not your education, experience or business plan. As a result a lot of stores are mismanaged."
good,"The company needs to improve on management screening, culture in store, maintaining healthy balances with work, and providing healthy feedback for the team even management"
good,"I would prefer not to say, however will speak to my experience face to face. Verizon provides great benefits to their employees and Verizon is always willing to change with the industry."
good,"Verizon's approach to leadership is to assume employee's don't need enforced processes, while assuming employee's are not doing anything. The top talent left and Verizon did not back-fill. Verizon seemed to be a dead company."
good,"there never was a typical day at work.  As a Field Tech I covered 38,000 square miles and had 40 cell sites to maintain.  The freedom of the job and the many locations in remote areas made this a challenging and very rewarding experience.  There were no ""hardest parts"" to this job.  The technology was always changing, updating, or needing repair/troubleshooting but I loved the challenge.  Management was typical large corporation."
good,"Be prepared to have a company not care about you at. The money is great for no degree. No room for growth within the ""franchise"" of Verizon I worked for."
good,The first 5 years was amazing the final 3 wasn't easy frankly it was very stressful. Verizon stopped caring about their employees and we became disposal. Best thing the money and benefits.Management shows favoritism the only way to get ahead is to be extra inappropriately friendly. After nearly 10 years I received a phone call while on stress leave that my services where no longer needed via phone call. Good luck to you if you work for them.
good,"This job pays excellent but it’s not enjoyable and the stress leads to lifelong problems "
good,"I really enjoyed working for MCI, until Verizon business purchased us, then it was all about cutting jobs and they cut mine.  I had worked for them for 9 years and had relocated from Washington to California and the it was just different.  I had lost my seniority and so when it came time to cut jobs, I had to go.  Hard to swallow after giving the company 9  years of my life."
good,Everyone walks on egg shells as the turn over rate is high and lay offs common.  Its a job were you cant concentrate on your work because your always worried your manager is going to tap you on the shoulder and hand you a box before escorting you out of the office.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The main issue with this position is the demand for work versus the supply of workers. Because Verizon technicians are compensated so well they do not have enough of them. This leads to a constant demand for extreme overtime. Working in this manner long term leads to undeniable health issues such as knee damage and heart failure.
good,"all elements in the weather.  pay and benefits were great. no time to spend your money, always at work. which was apparently a problem for them cause they laid everybody off and sold the company to frontier"
good,"Taking inbound calls on billing, activating, troubleshooting, sales."
good,interacted with customers with phone issues and selling phones and accessories.  repaired phones and tablets screens and internal parts. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"Used to be a very good company with perks and flexible timings and good hikes."
good,"No balance between your social, work, or family life. Your job is your career. Whether you're a top of the board rep or sitting at the bottom, you'll spend most of your time networking and advertising yourself to others as to WHY they need your device. I was a good rep, but no advancement even when positions were open because the DM was always busy with other things."
good,"NYXEX, later Bell Atlantic, had a meritocratic structure based on pay-for-performance.  I excelled in this system, and as my responsibilities increased, my pay increased commensurately."
good,"The only reason I stayed around as long as I did was because of the bonuses. I believe the don't even give that anymore. The job set you up for failure. They had all these quality points they want you to hit on a phone call, and also pass your NPS survey. People would constantly have heart attacks or faint every month while of work there. The pay was descent but the stress is not work it. Also dealing with stupid customers about there cell phone problems."
good,"My experience with the company helped me grow as an individual and taught me many things about owning a business. One thing I will hold forever is that no matter where you go, the people make the experience so invest in them."
good,"I was not a member of corporate Verizon - but a member of an authorized retailer - Cellular Sales has a great commissions structure but the management is lacking, you have employees that will grind 50-60 hours a week while management will often take days off and refuse to cover. Over all it's a pretty solid work place but the management doesn't receive training but once a year."
good,"stressful, made me reconsider sales.  Youre only talked to as a rep who has quota and all management really cares about is if you are going to work hard to help them make more money."
good,If you caome from outside Verizon Wireline can be very vicious with mediocre middle managers feeling jealous about your accomplishments and rival companies. Tread with care because even directors are infected with this disease of being inbreds.
good,The pay was awesome and you would receive a increase in pay for every year you stayed. The management was horrible. The work load is overwhelmingly stressful. There is little to no work-life balance.
good,Nothing to say Verizon is good company to work for just need to have better managers to help others be more outstanding individuals to work for the company.
good,"Very stressful, fast paced, and micro manage on a daily basis. Excellent pay, benefits, 401k and commissions. My last manager was not a people pleaser very undermining."
good,"Verizon has excellent benefits and a good corporate culture. However, much of it doesn't filter down to the individual store or district. This leads to a lack of focus and sometimes conflicted messaging from management."
good,"Demand work load, management is all over the place. You dont have strighnt answers. workplace culture is at a all time low, budget is always being cut"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I learned to deal with a wide variety of customer service issues...I also learned how to turn those issues into successful sales.  The work life balance suffers a bit as you are following retail hours.
good,Aggressive....Very difficult to keep up with management in the sourcing dept. Very passive aggressive management in the sourcing function. Not transparent....very political.....hard to accomplish goals and foster innovation.
good,"When I first started here, the culture was one where employees were valued. We were seen as corporate owners and as such we were trusted to make good business decisions, as well as trained on what constituted a good business decision. As time wore on and new technology came on line, training in these things began to slow down, and the ability to make deals with customers was gradually taken away. Any credit capability that employees had once had was taken away, due to management's perception that call center credits were the reason for poor profits. "
good,The hiring process for supervisors was based on trial periods which led to inconsistency in leadership skills as well as knowledge and availability for reps.
good,Was a good job.  Was able to work from home and keep your own hours to accomplish the job at hand.  I would recommend this job to anyone in the telecommunications business.
good,"Work load was originally done by 4 coworkers and was given to 3 and then 2 workers."
good,"Best part - they pay for you to exerise with a  personal trainer ."
good,"They teach you a lot. They expect more than miracles or fair share of your time. Most managers are good. There are far to many politics involved in getting promoted, quotas are unrealistic."
good,"Cons: Constant changes in direction, unclear vision of future.  Executives play power games, not competent in role.  "
good,"The workday usually is 9-6 with flexibility on the hours.  The work is very focused on technical aspects and keeping the infrastructure in top shape is the main priority. This means when production issues arrive everything else is dropped off."
good,"Due to Verizon's focus on becoming the ""Everything as a Service"" provider by acquiring multiple other organizations, it has come at great cost to their employees through non-publicized RIFs, lower compensation and reduced benefits.  Career growth within the company is almost non-existent, even for the most seasoned professionals and top performers."
good,Advancement is limited but training is available. Stressful work environment that takes away from the good benefits. I would recommend it if you plan on making a career of staying grounded.
good,Future seems very unpredictable now and uncertain.  Most jobs are being sent to foreign vendors.    Hoping Fios will continue  so that U .S. jobs can be maintained.
good,A typical work day you take 80-90 calls a day. It is a very fast paced environment and is often tiring trying to reach metrics set by the company. Over all if one can keep up with the demand it is a decent place to work with decent pay.
good,"You can benefits from the perks they have available. You can learn a lot working of the company. work life balance can be difficult at times. The medical, dental, vision and tuition assistance benefits are wonderful."
good,It is an ok place to work. Benefits are pretty good. However there is a lot of overtime work. A lot of overseas contractors make up the bulk of the work force. Management gets shift around a lot.
good,integrity is not the core of this company even though it is stated in their core values. As long as you sell even the by misleading the customers management will look the other way as long as they make their quotas.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"strong company"
good,"Over the last three years, the culture at Verizon has shifted.  The company used to stand for something and used to truly be customer-centric.  It is no longer concerned with customers nor employees but, solely with finances.  Many members of management have no strategy and simply operate from a reactionary place.  They lead by manipulation, secrecy, and game playing."
good,"My overall experience with Verizon was good.  The benefits Verizon provided their employees were very good.  The company in theory encourages work/life balance, but in reality employees are penalized in some cases for utilizing the time off their entitled to.  A typical day at work consisted of eight to ten hour days on average.  I learned a lot about the company culture, policies and procedures.  I am highly self motivated and goal oriented.  Team work was always an integral part of the work culture at Verizon."
good,"This job got me on my feet. The benefits are great and time off is great as well. But you will need it this is a really stressful job. You have to deal with angry customers. But to me that was not the bad part, it was management listening to your calls. Giving you unrealistic goals. They wanted you to pull up this screen and make sure you ask for over Verizon experiences. Customer got so tired of the reps sounding so robotic."
good,"No real OTJ training (there are loads of mandatory CBT that do not benefit the job)"
good,There are lots of great managers and people there.  I was able to advance in position and take advantage of training programs.  There are tons of positions but you need to network to continue to grow.
good,"Good job, good benefits, and plenty of room for advancement. The customer service area, though, has gone downhill since I've been here. It used to be a much livelier and happier place to work, where you were encouraged to be yourself on calls and chats. Now, everyone is being pushed to say/be a certain way on calls and chats, and leadership, as a whole, is focused solely on performance. Like in any work, some supervisors are better and seem to care more about their team, but the higher up you go in the leadership ladder, the more apparent it seems that leadership either has forgotten what it's like ""in the trenches"", or never knew to begin with."
good,Great benefit and pay but switching shifts is very hard to do every 6 months when you have a family. Very positive in the beginning of my career and when I quit moral was really bad nothing that they want to do for employees anymore just not feeling appropriated
good,I enjoyed working for this company a few years back but I feel that in desperation to keep up with T-Mobile they have become overbearing. They fault the reps for the failures of the company when the real problem is horrible marketing and PR. The management culture is arrogant that the network is the best... Reality check no one cares and it is fast losing its advantage.
good,It was great working in a challenging environment. Lots of training and professional development opportunities. From last few years the management focuses on hiring cheap resources hence compromise on quality.
good,"A typical work day is helping customers with accessing their Verizon Wireless accounts."
good,"Ok place to work if you like talking to people and have thick skin. Not much work life balance, but ok if you dont have children and dont mind working weekends"
good,The company is not about what you know it is who you know. If you become friends with the decision markers in the company you can go far. The work load is not something that can be accomplished in 40 hours a week.
good,"After working at Verizon for 10+ years, this is not a place I can recommend to anybody going forward.  Too many passengers getting by on the hard work of others and far too few opportunities if you are not considered a minority."
good,"-High intensity"
good,"A general mix of very smart people, aggressive, nice, not-so-nice etc. Management will tell all that there is a lot of work to be done right up to the moment they announce layoffs."
good,Great benefits but very stressful.  Pay is very great however each day is the most important day of your career.  Very competitive field and very stressful.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Start work at 4:00 pm, lunch at 8:00, end of day at 1:00 am."
good,"Great job for when you are in college. Great benefits, great opportunity to move up, and great for if you want to work a lot. The cons are it is very cut-throat, they are down your neck, and you always feel like your job is threatened and there are company wide layoffs at least once a year."
good,This job was financially rewarding as it was based on commissions. Upper management is completely out of touch with the retail stores. Retail managers were only concerned with making a paycheck and scheduling vacation time. Employees who lacked integrity but sold lots of products were rewarded regularly. Advancement was difficult due to favoritism and the work culture was cut throat.
good,working at Verizon gives you no time for a social life especially if you have a family. I am a single mother and the only time I was off was the weekends.
good,It is retail so your hours are all over the place. You have high goals that you have to attain. Good people to wrok with and good management. If you like to work retail hours this would be a very good job.
good,Our department was very poorly managed. Company could not retain experienced workers so we had to do a lot of training since we had new recruits practically every time. Sometimes half of the team were new recruits.
good,"If you like being voluntold things wether it be hours of work, constant changes in commission structure, or being led by a lot of leaders who care about their numbers and not their employee then this is the place for you. A bonus is when you get horrible work life ""balance"""
good,"I currently work in a call center taking customer calls and resolving repair issues,   Difficult to sit at a desk for hours at a time taking calls from unhappy customers,"
good,"Welcome greet customers "
good,"During my tenure with this company, I provided the best overall customer service experience to maintain existing customers. I learned different types of cultures in the community. The hardest part of the job was coming up with ways in accordance to company polices to meet or exceed customer needs. the most enjoyable part was being able to come up with effective solutions to customer needs"
good,"If less effort were spent on Go90, Yahoo and AOL, perhaps the company would show a profit. Lost a lot of quality people with these layoffs. Great training department."
good,"Ok experience with the company. You will meet some good people. Upper management tries to ""fluff"" the reality of what things actually are. Working in retail can be stressful with so much uncertainty. Working in corporate is less stressful but then again those jobs are not very stable either. Overall the company is on decline. Verizon is going to need to make some MAJOR changes in order to turn that ship back in the right direction. Sad to say."
good,The work environment was not good and the managers did not do their job well. The workers were not professional and would fight with others. The supervisors were always on their cellphones and not helping others.
good,"The overall culture has changed. Bad investments like go90, aol and yahoo have changed the way the stores are run and commissions have changed for the worst. No longer is it about the employee and customers, now it is about what you can slam the customers account with."
good,This call center was  not that friendly.   Everyone is just moved along like a cattle.   This was a 24hr center and the hours are not very family friendly
good,I would go into work early and check the work log assignments and make sure enough time was allotted for the work to be done. I had a manager ask of me to do things that were not ethical or have any bearing on my job. They would not follow the rules that corporate issued. I did get satisfaction making the customer happy.
good,"I have been working at Verizon Wireless for four years and have spent the past few years working as a Technical Team Lead/Application Engineer.  During my four years, I have spent time managing projects such as launching applications  CHM (Converged Health Management) and VV (Virtual Visit) within the Machine to Machine (M2M) platform.  I was also in charge of implementing and directing a defect project plan for fifteen million plus devices along with delivering technical briefings and project plans to management while leading and assisting my peers in providing Tier III technical support."
good,"micro management, managers sit in back. Tell you to ""earn the right and discover needs"" but bully customer into buying $100 in accessories and a tablet or HUM while on a higher plan that is not needed. Work place culture is very middle school like with different groups. All about numbers and anything to attain those numbers, misleading and confusing customers is encouraged.Managers play favorites to reps that have higher numbers.If you have a family forget this job, no work life balance schedule is always changing and can not have a set schedule. long hours and often get stuck at work with customers and meetings. No chairs, always standing and walking around. no room for growth unless you are willing to relocate."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Dttggggggfdsd him cf jigdcv for sure the best of way ever to get the a good lord out and there are a good way of doing that stuff is not wrong or what you are going on through your honesty or you doing can be fine and for what he does for sure you are a great man you and the best team party and you have a the right you to do with your that time and you're going out with the best of things that can be your life and you can do what your mind will and you can make sure that
good,"The people you work with on a daily basis are great.  People at working level overall strive to do the right thing.  However, lots of pressure to do things faster and do more with less"
good,"Great Compensation but not worth the time invested. You are another number and they don't care if your close family member died You had to show up to work no matter what. Highly stressful, no set schedule, and you would be happier working for anyone else"
good,"It was ok, great work culture however may be unfit for ambitious employees as compensation is limited. More so of a glass ceiling, very little job fulfillment."
good,The organization you work under determines the culture and the work day-hours and how employees are treated overall.  The company does not have a consistent culture through out.
good,"This is a call center in which you sit in a cubicle all day and answer hundreds of calls. There are a variety of types of people, but little interaction is allowed. Managers were very strict. However, benefits are great and the company arranges office parties which was enjoyable."
good,"The job was just that, a job.  It took a lot to advance and when you did, it rarely came with much compensation for that advancement.  The hours were standard so at least you had that and benefits."
good,"Typical workday, sit at desk and talk with customers. Different tech issues in telecommunications.  At one time the work culture was satisfactory, then it became micro managed.  There was once positive times there, then not."
good,"Great benefits.  The culture changes and the work gets demanding as well as the hours.  It all depends on the trends of the business.  This change led me to be laid off when the operations portion of the job was trumped by sales.  If you cannot sell, the company does not value you as much.  That is what it came down to in the end.  Be prepared to have a fluctuating schedule.  Nothing is guaranteed with the work schedule."
good,If you are good at the game of politics Verizon is the place for you. It require a good set of knee pads to get advanced and be willing to jump like a puppy when asked to do so.
good,"I have nothing good or bad to say about this place, i had a bad experience while working there and the treatment lets just say it was very unprofessional."
good,"good environment, friendly employees, well informed management made sure you knew your job and was always there to assist when you were not sure of how to handle a situation. The hardest thing was not being able to assist a customer"
good,"this company is only concerned with money and cares nothing about its employees, they continue to make poor decisions only to show growth to shareholders"
good,"This was a great company to start, it seemed as if we'd have a ton of job security, but as of January 27th 2017, the entire Rancho Cordova Call Center will be shut down."
good,For the most part was treated fairly but poorly managed. Managers cared more about getting promoted & hitting numbers than their employees. I worked hard for years & didn't get a lot back in return.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I enjoyed my position within this company. I felt like i became family with the people i worked with and had a great boss. I was only employed as a contractor and had a limited time with the company and no benefits.
good,"Retail work is never easy, but Verizon makes it a pretty fun experience. Sometimes, getting along with coworkers and customers alike can be challenging, but overall Verizon is a company that has much room for promotion and lifelong career tenure. There is a little bit for everyone in the Verizon corporate culture."
good,"It depends on the territory you receive. You may have a deck of accounts that are open to new technologies and meeting with you or you may have a deck of accounts that have little interest in innovating. Management does not care about that, you're instructed to create new sales opportunities in spite of having 80% market share. Also, you are competing internally with indirect agents, retail stores, telesales, and small business specialists. You are all trying to get a customer to purchase solutions through you to get credit."
good,"Verizon is good steady job with excelent benifits, food days, prizes and awards.  Though the running joke is that they should a couple Therapist on staff to keep us sane untill we getbto see our own that week.  Sometimes you can't do anything wrong and  the next anything right.  And there are far too people showing younyour mistakes not how to fix them or to say that you dod an awesome job some other call.  It'mentally unbalanced for a people person like myself.  I need eye contact, I nned that smile when I've helped someone.  Bottom line I need interaction, projects, the chance to show off what I'm capable of what I can do."
good,"Great job for people who do not have a family, its hard to balance time between work and personal life because it is retail and just about any retail job will have that downside.  Can make a lot of money if self motivated and understand how to correctly communicate with customers and gain trust of customers quickly."
good,"I have been with Verizon Wireless for 2 years. A typical day at work consists of taking a minimum of 36 calls per day. Those calls can consist of taking payments, answering questions about bills and plan pricing,or upgrades to new devices. I have learned phone etiquette and also how to multitask. Management is average, there are those who in leadership who are very personable and others who prefer to stay to themselves. The hardest part of the job is handling escalated calls. Escalated calls are customers who call in very upset and it is up to you as the advocate to deescalate the call and work with the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is hearing how I helped make a customer's day. Those positive feedbacks can truly make what could have been a hard day worth while!"
good,Nice place to work but 12 hours shifts are hard to deal with. Typical day was completing as many open tickets as you could.  Good place to learn different things
good,you cannot advance in this company unless you know someone in management really well to help you move up
good,"This is a great place to work at once you are out of college.  The job can provided options to grow.  It does give you a base for many potential jobs outside of Verizon.  The job though is very stressful, most people quiet or move on after 3 years.  Managers are a mix, some are great while others are just down right mean."
good,"The company has benefits such as paid time off, vacation, healthcare spending and tuition assistance that are great and much appreciated.  But if you have used all of the time you are afforded off and you become ill they don't even accept a doctors excuse.  Being sick can lead to loss of your job even with a medical professionals opinion that you shouldn't be working.  If a supervisor makes an error in calculating your time available to be off and you take that persons word, the company will hold you responsible for the error telling you that you are accountable for keeping up with your own time and again you can suffer the consequences of incorrect info received from a superior.  The only way to really progress is to relocate and most times you are confined to the area of customer service.  Strict adherence to daily number quotas with no regard to forces that aren't in your control.  Constant threats of progression on the corrective action ladder can be an issue and also the high number of employees that face final action that lead to termination for work performance or attendance should make the company aware there is something wrong with their system."
good,"When I started, this company had a GREAT culture.  But in the last few years, it seems like the company no longer cares about the employees, and that they're only numbers to be used and discarded."
good,"Great Energy level, I've learned negotiation skills, and to fit where the customer needs assistance with in company guidelines."
good,A typical day at work consists of receiving inbound/outbound calls in regards to billing or technical support. I did learn better time management and improved customer service skills. My co-workers were very diverse and they all brought something to the table to keep the team meeting goal for the company. The hardest part of the job was the environment with different personalities and non appreciation from management. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing excellent customer service to the customers whom are calling for assistance.
good,"Paid well, but micro managed and overworked. The Executives at the top care little about the laborers at the bottom. However, they are very effective at imposing their will on the workers."
good,"I would come in and go over my team members goals. I would prepare workshops. Go  "
good,"Great place to work if you have enough money in your savings.  You educate customers on insurance needs, and sell them.  only money you make is if you sell no base pay."
good,A typical workday involves solution selling of wireless products to incoming retail customers. I learned quite a bit regarding teaching groups of people how optimize their use of wireless devices. The management is ever present and willing to provide coaching. The co-workers are friendly and willing to assist whenever needed. The hardest part of the job is maintaining functional knowledge of peripheral devices not sold at the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the break neck speed of product advancement.
good,I enjoyed my time here for the most part. my co workers were everything. didnt allways agree with upper management but I performed job to best of ability
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Was with the company for 15 years and 2nd time I was offered a severance. Lots of politics within the company and management did not care about my advancement. Cared about results instead of the people.
good,The type of training provided was limited but the work flow was great I enjoyed my time there I did have issue with management very unprofessional
good,"I communicated with various people on the phone and in person. I learned a lot of deescalating, retail, troubleshooting and problem solving skills. Management was not available most of the time to assist with critical issues. The hardest part of the job was the various work hours.   The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and assisting customers with their phone and technology issues."
good,"40 hour quota driven sinkhole that will pay for certain educations so get some money and education and move along. Career advancement from sales is done by being in the right place at the right time or by beating out 900 other people. Benefits were good but poor for a top 20 fortune 500 company. No job security, a mistake, poor results, or customer threats and lies can get you fired. Managers could be terrible or great and typically moved around every year. Culture was one of frustration, forced kool aid drinking, sales pressure even when it angered customers, and trying to walk the line between right and wrong. Lots of learning how to ""position"" things to people. They talk about development but really its about how to improve their numbers through you."
good,Call centers are always busy and can at some point in time seem to be hectic. The nature of the job I have learned through previous experience along with this current experience would be to know that when customer are calling upset or irate they're not directing in toward you as the representative/agent but the company in which we work for. This has gotten me through many days of de-esculating calls where customers were upset. The environment is peaceful in a sense where everyone around you can at lease relate on the job duties while socializing out on breaks or lunches.
good,"Really good benefits. But company doesn't look for any advancement if you're not in sales. Also zero work-life balance, as well as constantly changing goals. Even if you don't work in sales you are expected to sell better than the actual sales reps."
good,I did not enjoy working at Alorica because I felt they were very unprofessional and too strict. They make this job a lot harder than it is. Everyday I went to work I felt like I was going to lose my job.
good,My personal review is that the company does not have enough time to fully train is staff and does not have a system in place to compensate its staff and customers.
good,"No permanent jobs are being filled.  Only contract, the contract is limited to 2 years, or 4160 hours. By the time you have mastered your assignment it is time to leave."
good,Assisted in start up for a fully bilingual recover call center agents to collect on previous / write off verizizon accounts.
good,"Officially commended for sales, enthusiasm, tenacity, persuasiveness, intense customer focus and dependability in performance evaluations for 10 months."
good,Too big of a company. Don't care about employees.  Employees that have been with company 10-20+ years get laid off every day.
good,"I enjoyed working with new technology.  Learning a new system is a fun and challenging endeavor"
good,"I enjoyed the training part of this job, but when it came time to actually work I had to do my job while everyone around me slacked off."
good,"My co-workers were fantastic. Retail hours were crazy, hard to make any plans. They did provide excellent medical and dental benefits."
good,"-Troubleshoot customer devices quickly and efficiently."
good,"The pay is relatively high for most retail positions, but you're expected to grind out high numbers. Due to market saturation, most selling is up-selling of existing customers. The company is very heavy on performance and quotas so you are pushed to sell products/services in a way that may not always be the right fit for the consumer. Although the company tries to balance customer promoter scores (which are largely negative) through incentivized bonuses, at the end of the day exceeding YoY is what matters the most regardless of what the customer may think. Store and assistant managers are relatively understanding of the difficulties employees face (slower traffic, market saturation, continual changes in compensation, etc), but because the message comes from the top-down they don't have the ability to make changes in the business. Even upper management at the Director and Region President level are scrabbling to find new ways to achieve growth and revenue through sometimes ridiculous strategies."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Started as a great opportunity. Ended up costing me more to get to work than what I am making.
good,This was a high stress job where you were held accountable for your performance each day and expected to maintain a high level at all times.  Some of the supervisors were not very caring of the agents and it was difficult at times to get resolutions to problems.  It was very difficult to talk to customers with a supervisor would be running around screaming loudly so customers could hear.
good,"Terrible work life balance, advancement and promotions are based on who you know not what you know. The pay is great and so are benefits. Co-workers are good people for the most part"
good,Good job for those just getting into the work force! They work well with Soldiers that are in the Reserves. The benefits are awesome!
good,"bad work life balance "
good,"No authority to make good decisions to help customers, not all management teams on the same page, and held accountable for company issues not your own."
good,Verizon has taught me skills that I can carry throughout my career. As a leader in the telecommunication industry it is a company that prides itself on customer satisfaction. They provide a great pay and benefits package and provides plenty opportunities to use the skills that were taught to you. The only downside is the growth within the company. For me there isn't much room for growth. The opportunities to rise within the company is almost non existent. From what I have seen most upper management is hired from outside of the company and not within. Besides that I have enjoyed the last 15 years as an employee there.
good,Verizon is a large company and it operates in a highly competitive and fast paced environment.  There are lots of opportunities for advancement.
good,"I was very excited to be hired in a Verizon Wireless.  After training out of store and in store, I was finally thrown to the wolves.  I must say I was NOT impressed by my management team and the people who they had me shadow during the process.  I had little to no instruction from management and those that I had shadowed were some of the worst at hitting their sales quotas.  I took the initiative into my own hands and sought help on my own from those I thought would benefit me the most and finally learned the ropes and different sales techniques which are ESSENTIAL for surviving in this type of retail environment.  I have never seen a store with such poor management OR a company that trusts in individuals as such; I didn't even meet my store manager until I started my second month in store!  She was hardly ever there which left it up to us sales reps to manage one another due to the fact that her supporting management team was never on the floor to help or assist in sales and traffic flow.  Our district manager hardly ever stopped in and knew nothing of what was going on at our location.  There was constant drama and people did not respect management and others they would appoint to do their ""duties"".  Even after problems were addressed it was just a repetitive cycle which happened over and over again.  To Verizon, anyone at a sales level or lower, You are JUST a NUMBER.  I was told that on a weekly basis by management when they addressed us as a group.  I felt like you had no one to address problems with ie. S.harassment, etc...I had a bit with S.harassment and it just got"
good,"Been working for the company since 2008, started out wonderful, thought I would retire with the company. Eventually they got too big for their britches, found a way to place blame on the rep's. Did not resolve things in a timely manner the added stress to rep's was unreal. Almost half the employee's were on short term disability of some sort. after the first two years I would not tell people where I worked and stopped recommending to other as place of employment. very sad."
good,"Verizon has many valuable great people and managers but the size makes getting your job done difficult.  There is a culture of working the best people as hard as possible and allowing others to skate by since it is very difficult to do anything about bad performance. Change is almost impossible because of the many layers of management, silo's among the groups, and confusion over the constant re-orgs.  Once one thing begins working a re-org, RIF, or  change in strategy causes more challenges. "
good,"I loved this job was there for 14 years. I was in tech support which i did enjoy fixing things and loved the people i worked with and still do. But when you are hired to fix something that is broken and in the same breathe try to  upsell that same person your helping to a better plan thats more money or sell the an accessory for a broken phone is just not practical. VZW was once a company that worked for their customers, now its all about making more money off their customers.  People that I worked with for 14 years with alot of experience is no longer with the company because of the sales."
good,"long days retail hours your shift doesn't end when the schedule says, more about who you know not what to get promoted, like most other sales oriented companies is under the perception the best sales people make the best managers which is usually untrue"
good,"sales, help customers learn about new products, great training, good benefits"
good,"This is a good place to work, with great benefits,and compensation. The atmosphere with the fellow workers makes it a fun place to work,   The biggest draw back to working at Verizon is the company's attitude toward management style. The company chooses to be very adversarial towards it's employees."
good,"Worked in call center/customer care for nearly 4 years. Company went down hill dramatically. I experienced constantly fluctuating metrics in call center, poor management practices and no support."
good,I enjoy assisting our customers. I work with a great team. We have embraced a culture of team work.  I am heavily involved in changing our customers negative perception of our business.  Our customer's experience is my top priority. The hardest part of my day is watching a team member put personal gain ahead of the customer's experience. The most enjoyable part of my day is having a customer thank me for being honest with them and telling me that I have restored their faith in the company.
good,"very abusive work environment, little or no chance to advance or move within company, call after call irate customers, but that's not the bad part.. constant obs from managers, all negative feedback, even when you save the customer, you cannot follow thru and help them"
good,The union had an impact on what we were able to do and how we were able to help the business.  This impact was both good and bad
good,"A typical work day was non-stop, and became a daily grind to achieve sales goals/ numbers. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,This company no longer care about employees only profit.  This will make all stake holders suffer.
good,good money and benefits thats all other than that you had to live with the feeling of today might be your last day always good to have a plan B if working here
good,"Being a chat coordinator consists of handling two customers simoultaneously throughout the day via the chat system. Inquiries, escalations, technical issues, billing concerns, etc. You just never know what you will be dealing with from one minute to the next which creates an environment of constant change. The management team works with you to maintain company goals and strives for improvement consistently. Co-workers make the job more enjoyable abd bring that element of fun into the work place. The hardest part of this job is that there is never an opportunity to be successful. Every time you reach the goals set out, they are revamped and you struggle to find a way to conquer those new goals again. There is no job security as when you do not reach the goals set forth you will be walked out the door and are constantly reminded that for your spot, they have another 100 people waiting to fill it. The most enjoyable part of this work is the constant change and business. Not knowing what is next ensures that there is no chance for boredom."
good,"When I started there in 2000 it6 was a great place too work. Co-workers pleasant, management attentive . Hardest part of job was not being able to more for my customers. Enjoyable part of job was helping customer with equipment."
good,"Get cussed out repeatedly daily by customers."
good,The company got a new manager and he cut all our hours down from 35 hours a week to 4 hours a week because he needed 40 hours.
good,"A typical day of work consists of starting my day at 6:30 am reviewing all timesheets from previous day to ensure accuracy. I then check all the technicians work, loaded to them for the day. I advise a dispatch center when changes need to be made. I meet with my team, usually for about 30 minutes, to ensure all have what is needed for the day. After the technicians leave, I maneuver through many websites containing productivity, rework, customer satisfaction, contractor invoices and safety compliance. Then out into the field to inspect contractor completed work and performing job inspections on technicians to ensure compliance and safety standards are met. Attend several conference calls daily consisting of product knowledge and upgrades, new sales opportunities, productivity, rework and safety results. Work with other managers to resolve conflicts between sales, engineering and other support groups. In the evening I sign off all completed timesheets, fixing errors and reporting the teams estimated overtime for the day, usually ending by 7 pm."
good,Not a full time job just for people that want some extra money
good,"Great steppingstone opportunity, mandatory overtime, great benefits and pay for little experience but little opportunity to move within the org"
good,Great benefits not a great environment to work. Great co-workers. micromanagement. great union.
good,Great pay and benefits hands down. Thou the new surveys and customer driven employee yearly  review is not effective.
good,"Cellularsales is an exclusive Verizon retailer.  Their business model changed a year earlier.  Once a 1099 employee, in 2012, all employees became W-2 employees hence reducing many of the benefits of being an independent contractor.  Furthermore, it was during this time when many large chain retailers (Walmart, Costco, Radioshack, Bestbuy, etc) were undercutting our prices, hence a severe loss of business occurred.  However, the work itself and atmosphere was very liberating. Hours and locations were very flexible.  Work peers were friendly and fun and I also had lots of support from my superiors as well."
good,Best part of job is the benefits.  There is a very unfair rep performance monitoring system used to get rid of people that changes every month.
good,I've been working in retail and call centers for close to 11 years and I feel very comfortable ... I am currently a Manager at a wireless store and my typical day revolves by helping and solving customers issues.
good,"Through working at Verizon I gained experience in recruiting, reporting and employee relations. The HR team I was apart of was team oriented but also competitive. Most people got into the office by 8:30am and hardly anyone left before 6pm. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with a variety of teams. My manager was very busy and did not have the time to develop me as I was hoping she would. My co-workers were quite busy as well but a few took me under their wing to mentor me."
good,"I'm reading the reviews and thinking........"
good,Management is to occupy with meeting quotas and spending enough time try to maintain a work enviroment that promotes stability.
good,No paid overtime. Benefits were good but morale was low. Constant meetings. Management expected everyone to put in at least 10 hour days or longer.
good,"Managment vs. Union gets old"
good,"Loved the work place, you basically act as your own boss while gaining knowledge of people skills and landscape of various areas."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Immediate managers were fantastic, but upper management didn't care about employees or family, would call about issues after hours but would never answer after hours if you needed them."
good,"Productive Enviornment"
good,I enjoyed the pace and using my skills to make for a contented customer.
good,"Lots of company changes over the years.  Good benefits, constant changes in commission structure.  Negative sales reps.  Burn and churn, overall ok."
good,Company becoming very selfish. Very stressful.  Not enough encouragement for good but dwell on bad.
good,Definitely the place for a single adult. Is a very intense sales environment fast pass with high quota margins and expectations
good,"A typical day at work consisted of long hours, managing sales team, daily manager calls, weekly bank deposits, and ordering store supplies."
good,good job just unfair business practice against me as an employee
good,"Great benefits and core values, however plan on never seeing your family. Long hours with never having a consistent work schedule. The overall management reminds me of high school, you have to be part of the ""click"" to be promoted. Advancement is very unlikely, company went away from hiring within. Great place to work if you need a job but not a career. "
good,"Come in count inventory, cash in drawer, and clean before opening. Make Cold Calls during the day. Management is great and will work with your schedule. Co workers are not dependable. Hardest part of the job is not making a sale. Enjoy helping customers fix any concerns they have."
good,The most stressful job I ever had..only stayed because of the pay.
good,this was a great job until Verizon bought the company out. it was a great paying job with commission on top of it and Verizon did not match that. 
good,"The days are pretty steady and laid back. I've worked at two(2) locations and I found it easy to work with everyone. I did encounter a hardship however, due to management not being honest and it nearly cost me my job. my co-workers now are amazing and it has been a very long time since I've been able to connect and work with the kind of people that I'm currently working with right now. I'd say that the hardest part of the job is trying to make a descent living. At $8/hour plus commission and the stakes are raised every month it makes it rather hard for a man with 2 kids to maintain any kind of positive lifestyle. I found myself always scrambling to stay afloat and when the goals change by $900 in a 4 month period and your percentages are all ready lower than all the other cellular phone companies its becomes a little disheartening. The most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion is the contact I get to have with all the different kinds of people. Being around other people is my driving force and so to have that as a part of my life is very important."
good,"Answering inbound calls, and reconciling customer complaints. Learned that it's good to be an active listener. Management was knowledgeable. Co-workers where great and helpful. The hardest part of the job was being monitored and critiqued every second of the day. What i most enjoyed was being able to assist customer with their needs."
good,"My current position is Sales Representative with Verizon Wireless. I specialize in retail and small business sales. I am continuously ranked top in store and also top 10 in district out of 90+ reps. I’m seeking a new challenge to grow my sales skills. My store location is in the Irvine Marketplace. In addition to customer walk-ins and appointments, active cold calling expands my customer base. My business clients range from construction, healthcare, and social networking industries. Working in sales at Verizon Wireless has dramatically changed over the years. It now consists of making sure the devices we sell will work with every aspect of daily life. Whether it be a tablet to increase productivity, a new business phone line to save money, or a mobile hotspot to access the internet while they are on the go. We discover solutions for needs that go beyond just phones. I would love to speak to you more about the opportunity. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time and consideration."
good,benefits are good and the money can be really good. If your great at sales its a great company.
good,"As a Verizon store manager my responsibilities were endless.Some of my daily activities included opening the store, speaking on conference calls throughout the day to discuss action plans, percentages to quota, and any concerns. Along with those responsibilities, I also managed/coached three other employees, who I designed schedules around, gave monthly observations and helped encourage to meet there personal quota along with meeting my personal quota. I was held responsible for updating the stores planogram and making sure the store met its monthly/yearly quota. At the end of the day my responsibilities were closing the store and typing out a end of day report summarizing any sales and foot traffic for the day. Ive learned many things from patients to leading by eaxample to get the best results from your co workers ,I would have to say the hardest part of the job was creating foot traffic in a store located next to no where. My most enjoyable part of the job was talking and helping customers overcome the obstacles they were facing,it put a smile on my face knowing they were relived"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon Wireless on paper is an excellent company. But once you are hired, the closest example I can say you will experience is that equal to a college freshman hazing. The office politics are so horrible that it's a good thing the health insurance VZW offers has an excellent mental health coverage, as you will need it. Verbally abusive management is an everyday event. So if this fits your criteria of an acceptable work environment, then VZW is for you. But make sure you document everything, and have an excellent attorney on retainer for the EEOC claim you will be filing within the year. If you can last that long."
good,Its an okay company to work for !! a lot of rules and regulations.
good,Good compensation package; hard work required. Management has high expectations of the workforce. Learned a great deal about Fixed Asset reporting.
good,"Coworkers, where really great. I worked for operator services for thirteen years. Hours were really hard because they were never consistent and hard to plan a life when working like that. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the customers themselves. The enjoyable part would be the customers. Catch 22 situation lol. Management when you had a decent leader could be good but believe me it can be ugly. I learned to push for excellent service always and whether its a good or bad day excellent customer service is always key leave personal business outside."
good,"Verizon Wireless, as a sales representative offers a decent hourly and commission salary. The starting salary starts at 55,000/ annually if you achieve minimum quota. Everything goes up from there. Management is relaxed and usually not the type to breathe on your neck unless the district manager is on their necks. It can be inconsistent and expect random meetings just because. It could be as simple as not selling an accessory."
good,Traveled daily from store to store. As an independent contractor there weren't any benefits provided. I assist customers in store and provided them with any needed information and set them up with service. I performed on site presentations and assisted in at work connections. Maintained and exceeded demanding sales quota and consistantly provided excellent customer care. The most difficult part of my job was the daily travel to different locations.
good,"Great JOB with good benefits.The pay was great,also the insurance was good also."
good,"Good job, great co-workers but miserable upper and middle management."
good,I enjoyed this job and all the customer contact if afforded me.
good,"benefits are great but their contracts are fishy especially in retail sector, having people you know out of work come in for service or activations are a liability according to verizon and you will be terminated"
good,"A typical day at work starts 8-5 for me if for whatever reason its 8:01a (real event that has happened) your going to be questioned and marked late whether they see you or look at the camera. nest step as a technician is to prepare to have everything you need for work in your van/truck realistically speaking it takes like 20-30 mins. They want you out by 8:15a if your not then some managers calling your manager to complain. Simplest way to explain Verizon is numbers managers get numbers and reports of numbers everyday over EVERYTHING. The numbers can be manipulated(fudged) by both techs and managers. The techs who cheat the system often rewarded by cover ups from there managers if your like me and just do the job as its supposed to be done then your going to deal with management trying to attach your job every moment they get. Your going to have to be extremely thorough because the company is going to be waiting for you to slip up. The hardest part of the job is ""drops"" where you have to run a line from the pole or whatever to the house sounds simple on paper real life can add all sorts of issues and troubles to get in your way and the only thing worse then a drop is doing someone elses drop because they ""take to long so they blow it off as something else"""
good,We are micromanaged in every aspect of the business making it unbearable to enjoy work. A representative has more knowledge than 85% of management which is extremely frustrating when you need assistance. Process and procedures are constantly changing even (daily) making it very hard to keep everyone on the same page. Great pay/ benefits but really making it hard to justify working in an extremely over stressful environment.
good,The company I started with 5 years ago has completely changed. I am a seasoned Sales Manager and feel as if I can be easily replaced due to upper managements strict statements. Very little work/life balance which has put some stress on the home life balance. Very great benefits and the employees are very thankful and caring
good,Leadership is terrible but they pay you good. You will be miserable with terrible bosses but great pay. No one cares about you in this company you have to be a brown nose to make it anywhere in this company.
good,A typical day at work is taking a high call volume of calls. I learned that there is not much room for advancement. I worked with a lot of great people. The hardest part of the job is systems. There are so many of them. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfaction in helping the cusotmers.
good,Love the money...hate the grind. I am a driven person so money and performance were never the issue. Advancement moves at a snails pace since no one ever leaves in management. Benefits are the best thing offered here.
good,"Training, developing your accounts to be more proficient at selling your products and service. Management has very high expectations. co-workers are all on your team and are great resources. Hardest part of the job is long days, and weekend work. Enjoyable part is making relationships with your accounts and seeing your hard work pay off."
good,daily duties: helping customers with bill questions upgrading phones and adding lines to their accounts.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,micro management...manage through intimidation...not enough management training
good,"Fun, ennjoyable, just was not able to move further into the company. Hardest part of the job was living in Maryland while my family lived in New Jersey."
good,"Presented strong communication skills in supporting a wide range of customers with cellular invoices, updating account information, issue credits for billing discrepancies, and provided troubleshooting for defective devices."
good,It was okay but they give you no time for family or personal life
good,"A typical day at work consists of clocking in no more than three minutes after your start time or otherwise a full hour of sick time will be used. You get no more than five minutes to open up all the systems you will need and go through emails. You receive an estimate of 30 emails per day. Once your intial five minutes are up you begin to take calls, at times non-stop, until break time about two hours later. Once the 15 minutes of break are over you are back to taking calls until lunch. That is the daily routine. I have learned a lot while working here, most importantly the value of excellent customer service. The job is very fast paced and I have learned to multi-task and improve my typing skills. Management tends to be very ""black and white"" and depending on the situation it can be a good or bad thing. There is not much time to get to know your co-workers due to the high volume of calls that come in on a day-to-day basis. The hardest part of the job is taking calls all day with short breaks. It tends to be tiring both physically and mentally. The most enjoyable part is learning about the communications industry and the technology behind it. The benefits provided are excellent!"
good,"Great Pay and Benefits, very stressful"
good,• Demonstrated outstanding interpersonal and emotional intelligence while directly resolving customer calling center billing escalations managing 60 calls per day out of call centers and retail locations.
good,A great opportunity to develop telemarketing skills and customer loyalty.
good,On a typical day most people are running to desk not to be a minute late. I learned time management and patience. The company growth is very limited for its employees. Loved working with professional people such as coworkers. Management needs to be restructured based on experience and merit not friendship or personal relationships and a class on respect. The hardest part of the job was the restrictions that were put on customers accounts. The most enjoyable part was I LOVED my customer and miss them. The company needs a class on respecting its employees.
good,"Sales, cold calls, research. This is a good company to work for, they have good benefits, and good incentives."
good,Non stop calls. Was not able to tell customers about best deal for them.Rep is evaluated on callbacks from outside party and customers forget who they spoke to but will still comment. Best part was co workers and always having the latest devices in the wireless industry.
good,"I had no problem with the pay, however, I was not very happy with the company's ideals. Working for this company seemed to consume my life. Not a family-friendly company. Its all about Verizon Wireless and what you can do for them."
good,"Working for Verizon Wireless has offered me a great insight into the large corporation business structure. I have been able to take full advantage of the great training this company offers. Working as an account executive has allowed me to use my educational knowledge and grow my profesional experience. The selling techniques and pyschology have come full circle from school and work. I have become very comfortable talking to all executive levels. A typical day for myself, would include constantly checking emails from clients and follow ups. I have found that the best way to create and maintain relationships with clients is constant communication. This allows you to know what the customer needs and be able to fill that need with a product or products that the company may offer."
good,If you like retail than this is the job for you. I for one could not take being screamed and cussed at everyday because people didn't understand their bill.
good,You are able to trade your shift with other workers. Fellow employees are friendly
good,"Do not trust everyone. Very corporate hierarchy with rules that get made up along the way and blacklisting that occurs on a regular basis. If you drink enough kool-aid and be a good puppet, you will climb the ladder."
good,The Premium retailer company's are trash who do NOT care for their employees. The Corporates stores had a better understanding since we had to call them more often in not to be able to get the job done
good,This company can cause a high level of stress if you let it other than that they offer a lot of opportunity.  The company have a lot of job openings to explore.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Not much else to say, the pay isn't great and the commission goals are often not attainable unless you are willing to be somewhat underhanded. I would not recommend staying long term."
good,very numbers driven no longer care about employee. Could be doing great and becuase you dont hit one metric or two you get bashed. Fellow employees make it great but you either get with the program or you will get hammered down.
good,"Helping Customers with their phones/setting up new lines or up grading to new phones. Everyday inventory to make sure that the store products are all accounted for. Learned how to run and operate the store, with the help of upper management. They gave the tools to keep the store running smoothly. Most difficult part of the job is that when it is short staffed there is a lot of time spent working alone and if there is a rush you really feel it. Helping customers get set up and ready to go out the door is the best because I know they are leaving with one less headache and a great working phone."
good,Pay can be great but the pay plan and percentages are constantly changing. Management only cares about sales. Employees can tend to lose customers trust which hurts the honest ones. Stressful if you're not uses to that line of competition and work. Hours can be long and exceed you schedule due to mistakes and or computer system glitches.
good,Constant change in the work life and your penalized through verbal and financial abuse if you dont quickly change with new changes. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new gadgets and helping people understand them.
good,"Good company with bad managers. They won't work and they won't let you to work peacefully. Use to have quarterly reviews. Before 20 days of first , they will appreciate you, when comes to the review, they will say no use of your work..."
good,The job is good for what you do but since I have been working here the culture has completely changed. It used to be easy to progress and felt like an actual career and you were happy to be apart of Verizon. Now it's just a call center job
good,"Lots of drama. This particular owner was very controlling and always wanted people to rat each other out. Pay was good, better than other stores from what I was told. They always wanted you to lie to corporate Verizon and say everything was great, and when you were honest you would get yelled at. They give you a handbook at the beginning but they dont follow it themselves. Upper management was fake all the time. Never really knew when they were being  Genuine."
good,"Verizon is a huge company, find the right fit for you and you will have a great time. Work/life balance is tough since depending on your role, you are expected to be available even when your clients are not. Has great stability and advancement options if you know the right people/what you want to do. You work with great people for the most part who do want to see you succeed."
good,The culture is constantly changing and management and corporate never see eye to eye. The company will state they are going one direction but management typically has their own agenda on how they want to do things in order to maximize their paychecks. Goals are typically set higher so that commission is harder to reach and multiple. Work life balance is pretty awful so if you have kids be prepared to not see them.
good,"Great environment "
good,"Management is not to brag about, and customer loyalty has declined. The pace you work at can make for a long day. But incentives and commission make you excited when you do get the chance to make a sale."
good,"I don't care to fill this out and not sure why this is required to apply for jobs on Indeed.  I left Verizon because I wasn't happy.  "
good,The time I spent at Verizon was very rewarding but the culture and commissions have changed so much since the company became so large. The benefits they offer are fantastic as far as health insurance and 401k. The down side is the work life balance.
good,Fairly good company to work for.  Lots of internl politics. Depends on current manager.  Allowed to work unsupervised.  Can express opinions.  Curerentr management has impact on atmosphere.
good,"B a self thinker, Do not rely on management for guidance. Be able to be a self-learner and take advantage of all classes offered to you. The tuition program and 401k are musts to take advantage of."
good,"This job is for college grads and those reentering the work force, not for a serious career, no advancement opportunities. Management is not flexible and not logical in there choices"
good,"Poor advancement opportunities and an extremely limited number of tools to help sales people meet and exceed goals. Changes to commission structure before I left were part of my departure, and the sales environment has become even worse since then."
good,wish supervisor was more helpful and better pay and less gossip. it was not a horrible work place it just could have been better over all and for what we did gave more to the employees.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Productive and competitive work environment, but job security is not stable in coming years do to corporate stores being bought out by retailers. Over all, good company to work for."
good,It is a good place to work. Co workers are friendly. It has a nice cafeteria. No problem in parking. Good location for people living in Herndon or Chantilly
good,"The money is good but the job is not a career for most people. The hours are sometimes long. Store meetings for the most part are pointless. Get money, experience, and move on."
good,If you get in with management then your life will be much simpler there. Verizon wireless was better to work for but Verizon Fios you make way more money
good,Management at the company has no clue at to what the techs do in the field. All they want is their number to look good.  Forced to work Saturday split tours for straight time pay.
good,"Retail locations appear to be on the way out, all business is being pushed to online.  Sales targets are no longer realistic, traffic in stores is more customer service and technical support."
good,"Good place to work, great benefits and good discounts. Management is poor, and little room for advancement. Enjoyed the gym at the location, coworkers are friendly. Good training."
good,the business has really changed. schedule is always changing. great people work for this company but sometimes there isnt always the best communcation between sales reps and managers
good,"Stressful setting, unprofessional and not very clean place, most days were harder than others. The schedule was not the best and did not accomodate to your life"
good,"Very corporate, poor managers, too much volume dumped on too few people. Rigid office environment. The salary wasn't in line with the work being done. I would never work for a carrier again after working at Verizon."
good,"Work was good, people were teammates. Management kept changing and therefore continuity of rules was not a given.  But the work and the company were good and I enjoyed working there."
good,dont work there unless you can get fmla. pay and pto is great. but a really stressful environment. managers need coachings as much as reps do. they make sure your fed.
good,"My schedule changes every week, so it has been arduous to plan my life with wife and kids. The benefits are great but the sales goals are sometimes unreachable which leads to many sales reps to struggle even making a check."
good,"As for co-workers there were some friendlies. Management is always on a power trip. They believe yelling and force is better than communicating. Pay was ok, but still under market. Benefits were good."
good,i do not wish to talk about my employment at verizon. This is a personal matter and of no ones business. I apologize for this but this is my personal oppinion
good,Verizon was a great place to work and you connect with a lot of people. You deal with the general public on a day-to-day basis to upsell people from upgrades to new devices.
good,People around me were nice. Flexible time frame. The duties are very routine and not too much to learn. Something good is you are able to manage all your duties without pressure.
good,"As a representative I handled all customer inquiries including troubleshooting, reaching out to direct locations. It's very fast paced with little or no downtime in between calls."
good,"Pay was good but it was very stressful and demanding. For every phone sold you had to sell $100 of acessories per phone. What if a family of 5 bought a phone and didnt want to buy acessories there and wanted to buy their acessories on Amazon?"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"If you are in Sales versus Tech Support, sky is the limit and you are basically untouchable as long as you put up numbers. If you are in Tech Support, this could not be more opposite. You will pickup after Sales people and clean their messes with not even a thank you."
good,"Verizon is an okay job, not great, but okay. Every quarter there is a layoff and any time you want new equipment, access, or something else the bureaucracy kicks in and things quickly become overly complicated. They do have great benefits and good raises."
good,"Don’t waste your time. You will never promote unless you know someone higher up. I produced 200% to quota month after month and the commission was pathetic. You are also capped on commission if you “windfall”, meaning you made $4500 that month. You will also live at Verizon and have no life. You will never see your family and be required to come in on days off for “jam sessions” aka. Cheerleading by managers to sell more   No thanks"
good,"- Have to brown nose to get picked to move to new position"
good,I love the team that i worked with at Verizon. We developed a strong bond and were able to accomplish a lot in the competitive environment as we were all competitive. Middle management often times was disconnected and did not understand the overall goals and how to get there. Manager pay is low salary with high commission at the time I was there.
good,"Was a great place to start working and build my sales experience but not where I ultimately planned to stay for my career. Had to learn to overcome objections and learn to work in a commission-based system, as well as working with a team while managing my own performance."
good,"In the end, the pay was better than any other retail job probably. However there is no work/life balance, management is unsympathetic to your life, majority of company has no integrity and will do by any means necessary to get a sale (even though they state in their credo they do not)"
good,I was an employee of another wireless company when Verizon Wireless purchased us.  Since joining I have always been made to feel like an outsider.  I spent my time in constant fear of being laid off.  It appeared that management played favorites.
good,"I enjoyed the people mostly, very diverse and knowledgeable staff. Commission based sales are great for a particular type but not reliable enough for me."
good,"There were many benefits to working for Verizon.  the company was stable and paid well.  However, there was not career path  and downsizing came frequently."
good,The work place was OK. The difficult part is dealing with the customers and having to stress about things like your numbers. Average calls per day trying to keep people from calling back and things of that nature. You were penalized if the customer call back within three days and also if they didn’t like Verizon and they gave you that in the survey it Karagen you.
good,Verizon is such a large company that you will have a very different experience depending on the group you join. Excellent health benefits compared to other large companies.
good,"Verizon has a great reputation. Constant change in technology, management, commission structure. Retail hours, schedule can change at any time. Unrealistic sales targets. Medical/401k benefits are great. Young unexperienced management."
good,"If you want to work for Verizon, you need to be available all the time. Do not plan on having any other outside activities or family to tend to. It does pay well, but you do have to work hard for it."
good,If you want to be forced to sell garbage products to people by lying and get rewarded. WORK FOR VERIZON. Also if you like to be treated like an animal work for Verizon!
good,"Your manager may or may not know your job function. Mine had no idea. Wasn’t even in the same state. As a result of not understanding my position, stood in the way of my success. I eventually left. The training provided was good if they let you attend."
good,it was a high paced environment that can become very stressful with constant back to back inbound calls for various reasons the hardest part was talking directly to customers who are very upset and sometimes irate
good,A typical day at work was signing into the phone and answering customer's concerns with their services and bills all the while trying to upsell more products.
good,"If you really enjoy Sales this job is for you. However, it does have a tendency to be draining but you really do get what you put into it. There is small risk, large pay off. But they do recommend lying to a lot of customers in order to boost Sales. Again, it is what you make of it."
good,Good company but not many advancement opportunities.  Constant change within the culture.  Management does not collaborate with front-line employees to assist in making the company better.
good,"A lot of pressure and stress. no matter how good you do, they always have to ask for more out of you. Management wasn't that helpful. Good benefits and time off."
good,Job made difficult by constantly changing rules and policy. Very oppressive work environment. Supervisor coach not giving credits until customer wants to speak to them then told to give credits.
good,Verizon is great company to work for. Over the years this company has taught me a lot with in the sales process and how to provide great customer server. I have learned a lot in my roles with in this company. Management has been a challenge but rewarding.
good,Majority of sales time is spent trying to convince customers who have come in with questions or issues to make purchases instead of dealing honestly with the customer.
good,Typical 9-5 job in customer service. Take calls all day long. Workplace culture changed dramatically from being very work life balance to becoming more and more Just Do the Job.
good,The fact that a fortune 500 company does not provide its employee's sick days is irresponsible and unconscionable. Especially since the WORK stations are so close together you can hear each other's thoughts. There has been several reports of a strain of a virus that took out 12 people at one time. Due to patient zero being afraid to stay home with their contagious illness.
good,Downsizing has resulted in overloaded staff with more work. Impacts work-life balance. Stress and culture suffer. People are leaving for other opportunities. Migration of some IT teams to InfoSys has hurt morale.
good,"atmosphere has changed. used to look forward to going to into work. Now the goals seem unattainable and micro managing is they key. When goals are not reached, the bottom is blames first even though all the work is done by the bottom"
good,"Not a bad place to work, great people but not the same as when i first started working here. Great employee discount. Management can be a challenge at times."
good,Very high pressure sales from upper management and lack of leadership. Management needs to have a open forum on how to make things better for communication when employee have concerns.
good,"Awful corporate culture, there is no support from management and most employees are only concerned about getting promoted.  They have no idea about what we sell and don't care.  Terrible place to work since 2015."
good,"a typical day at work is very focused on your task at hand. Continued education is emphasized, if management considers you to be a valued employee they will encourage & help you to move fwd in your career. If not, well, you'll get tossed aside. From what I observed it can be very political; if your manager likes the attention, shmoozers will go far. Overall the work experience was a positive one; the opportunity to learn was great and the options to move into another area of the company are varied - if you have your manager's approval behind you."
good,Verizon has been a great experience. It has its pros and cons. A typical day at work consist of assisting customers with phone related issues and selling products. Management was wishy washy.
good,Money was great but company lost vision of employees first and just worry about the higher ups getting more. Great company and benefits but no work and personal life balance
good,"overall a good company for technology and benefits. Improvements are necessary in the areas of career growth, adoption of new tech as well as management"
good,"Was great, now more of a focus on investors instead of customers and employees. Support was removed which made managing customers and selling new business a challenge. Compensation did not match this increase in work required to maintain consistent quota attainment."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,work day was long and busy you keep moving from job to job management wasn't much help was no work place culture everyone for themselves hardest part of job was waiting for tech support when problems arised. most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of watch people enjoy the services you installed in there homes
good,"If they want you gone they will find the slightest mistake you made to terminate your employment.  Trust is a big problem, It all politics there in terms of moving up or getting promoted."
good,Not to bad fairly easy just need a better pay raise even if you get promoted is not much of a difference some customer are not understanding but have your customer that aver very chill but the big concern is the pay no that of a good pay unless you overtime
good,"Learning the job was a lot of fun, and so was getting to know your co-workers and helping each other when you run into trouble on a call. However if your co-workers aren't around or able to assist, I found asking management only led to a negative result for myself along with the customer. Not worth it in the long run."
good,"Good medical benefits, good/decent pay, but way too many layoffs (every 4 to 6 months = bad morale.)"
good,"It is what you make it, it can be fun then at times it can be stressful. I would recommend it as a quick Passover job but there is opportunity for advancement for sure. Just stay to yourself"
good,No ownership by management. Lacking knowledge of basic concepts and support techniques from management who then grade employees performance on those very concepts they aren't trained on themselves.
good,"With world changes, management also needs to be updated and incorporate change management with times and situations. Much area of improvements needed to be implemented but still continues to have old top management without accepting new ideas, policies and work loads."
good,"I started working for Verizon in 2014 and loved it. They had wonderful benefits, great pay and a fun work environment.As time went on the commission structure changed significantly and management declined. I ended up leaving the company due to poor management and the lack of focus on customer service."
good,"I feel that the position is a challenging one with the company getting less thankful for your efforts every year. Every year like clockwork from the near 5 years ive worked here i would lose substantial benefits or pay or a mixture of both. "
good,"Unprofessional management."
good,"If you have worked one sales job you have worked them all.  It is simple. If you are good or even adequate at sales you will make a good living, but will sacrifice time with family, friends, and other loved ones. Not family friendly."
good,"They have zero clue on the toll this jobs take on the mental well being of their employees. There is no longer the positive job culture it once was. I have a friend planning a celebration of leaving the company, not for any money, or better job, just leaving the toxic work place."
good,"I worked in the retail channel and it used to be easy to make money, there were a lot of incentives and travel and rewards. I used to be a great place to work. There are different people at different stores so experience can vary by location. Over the past couple of years, though, these bonuses and incentives have either fallen off completely or made nearly impossible to get. The benefits aren't as good as they used to be and it wasn't worth dealing with the customer facing portion of the job. The only thing that I really miss was the culture and the people that I got to work with."
good,"Turn over rate is high, the pay is not good management isnt the best you dont get the training you need to be successful. They dont take care of their employees unless you're a favorite"
good,"great pay and benefits. Expected to work extra hours for no pay in management.  Union members cannot be downsized, so they continuously downsize management.  Always working with fear of layoffs."
good,Not a bad place to work. Verizon is a unionized company which is GREAT if you are a associate. Managers are consistently laid off when he company need to cutback on expenses.
good,"The company has poor management, they weren't flexible when i had emergencies to attend. The moved me around from different stores and really far from my home."
good,I was hired right before management changed when the new management came in they changed our pay and commission structure. Terrible Power tripping managers.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Worked here a year and a half. I can't stress enough how they only promote people who put up good numbers. Although numbers matter, they only promote people with high numbers so you end up with management that can sell  but cannot do operations and cannot teach their staff how to improve. I learned valuable sales skills but my day to day was extremely stressful between screaming management and upset customers. Customers will always assume you are to blame if something shows up on their bill. You have the potential to make a lot of money but most staff barely hit requirements because of low traffic or stubborn sales metrics. If you don't sell enough they will not give you your commission check. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. The job itself is not for the weak. Expect to be hounded on daily"
good,"i was contracted so I didn't work directly with the company. Traveled to 26 indirect locations across the region providing sales training and support for retail employees. Trained employees on new promotions, updated advertisements, and provided 1 on 1 and group training."
good,"Until the higher ups got greedy and started chopping heads. Bottom line, Verizon wants to portray to the public it's ""The Best place to work"" but it isn't.  Once upon a time it was!!! It's all about who you know now."
good,Good place to work if your team and management is good. learned lot of new technology. the most enjoyable part of the job is team communication to resolve issues
good,"High-call volume with mediocre support from management.  Management is more concerned with listening to previous calls than assisting with current calls. "
good,Culture is not great and the new CEO is not in touch with the field at all.  Constant downsizing was the norm in many of the non sales departments there.
good,"Driven sales organization, office culture focuses on creating and maintaining a positive mental attitude, good opportunity to develop thick skin and strong mental character."
good,I am a contractor with Verizon so I don't know all their ins and outs.  My manager left us alone to do our job.  A couple other full time employees though otherwise and always thought they could tell us what to do.  But you will get that where ever you go.  End of the year is a hassle as theya re trying to get a lot done and everyone is going in 50 different directions.
good,"Great Pay, Work life balance could be better and trying to get promoted to the next level could be frustration at times. Overall, great company to start a career."
good,Not many opportunities for advancement. Management from different teams never communicate with each other or employees. Good benefits and good starting salary for people coming out of college.
good,"Verizon was a good company to work for all in all. They compensate you very well with pay and benefits. 1st day you start you have full coverage insurance and a week of vacation time. HOWEVER there are certain times of the year that no one can take vacation, they refer to this as ""black out days"". All major holidays, back to school, iPhone launch, and any big promotions they decide to run classify as black out dates. They expect you to sell something to every single person who walks through the door, weather you are a sales consultant, the greeter, or a manager. After every customer you work with, you have a ""coaching"" in the back with one of the managers about what you could have done better or possibly talked them into. Some of it is legit other times it was plain crooked. I was an employee at a Verizon retail location for 3 years. I was laid off on the day of my 3 year hire date. I will say, for being with them only 3 years their severance package was enough to keep providing for my family without having to change our budget for close to 6 months. For that, I owe them a thank you."
good,my location specifically was unorganized and misleading from management to training. Horrible work experience especially for first time call center employees.
good,Customer service was extremely unhelpful to customers. The customer was not priority. Only company worked with no cleaning personnel. Its been years but wouldn't recommend.
good,Was laid off after two years.  Nobody really knew what they were doing as far as management.  It was frustrating trying to get anything done internally.
good,"Verizon's customer service department is sales driven with much focus on meeting numbers and retaining customers.  The higher ups, pressure the first level managers to meet quotas, which in turn puts intensive stress on the front line workers (customer service reps).  For the most part, the daily customers are irate and looking to save money on products that the company does not have for representatives compete with competitors."
good,Hi stress and anxiety. Management is terrible. Pressure on you to sell to people who don't want sold to. Pay and benefits great. If you can take the pressure and stress you can work there.
good,"Verizon asks a lot of their employees and changes their demands often.  Verizon changes their pay structure constantly and that means solutions specialists get paid less for doing more work.  They have an extremely unforgiving schedule with no sort of consistency or reliability.  "
good,"Enjoyed my day to day time there. Learned renewed patience through interacting with the customer base. Enjoyed the culture they built at the call center, meant to make employees enjoy their time there."
good,Verizon was a very laid back workplace. They were very flexible with hours and helped you strive to be the best salesman you could be. It was a great experience.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Never given appreciation for a job well done. Only pointed out flaws. VZ was big on attendance and had a high turnover due to this. The pay was great but required long hours of overtime to do so.
good,"Used to be a good place to work for but nowadays there is no direction and they are going through chances but not really sure what they want to do and where they want to go ."
good,If you have no life this is for you all the overtime you can get If your schedule is available. Ok pay for someone with no children or going to school
good,"Cellular Market is saturated with no new customers or potential growth. Network use to be priority 1, today secondary, no over time allowed without Director Approval,  with lay-offs every 6 months before major holidays."
good,"Very good leadership development in wireless not so much on the connect side of the house. Horrible management with very little experience and vision to grow the org. Wireless presented many leadership development opportunities while it's not the same on the connect side. "
good,"They have Great pay and benefits; Excellent work life balance in this place"
good,"Culture of quality, and commitment to employees went downhill  during my time at VZW. The industry became much more competitive, and consequently, numbers mattered more than people."
good,Work days were spent talking to customers about upgrading phones and phone service. Often forced to push older phones that were close to being taken out of inventory due to age limits.This was pushed hard by management even if not in clients best interest.
good,I've learned that you're just a number at Verizon. The culture and overall direction has changed thus it's time to move on. I enjoyed the educational opportunities however.
good,"Verizon pays very well and there is a reason for this. Once your hired on and in the Union they can make you work 7 days a week 12 hours a day if they want to. It's non stop fast paced endless work. If that's your thing have fun. If you have a family forget ever seeing them. Don't get me wrong the work itself can be enjoyable and interacting with fellow union employees. Being in the union gives you job security but the union is only interested in getting their contract. They really don't put up much a fight when it comes to individual grievances. They go through the motions but management always ends up on top. Speaking of management it's like talking to a wall. They don't care about the customers they only care about their teams metrics and making them look good. You can't have quantity and quality but according to them you can. So if you don't put up a fight and repeat ""I'll work on that"" during your individual meetings with your supervisor you should pull through. I could go on and on but there is only so much time in a day."
good,"Great supporting staff to work with, Was at the job for almost 10 years, Then to cut cost Verizon decide to outsource most of it call centers to either 3rd party companies or overseas."
good,"Long tough at time hours, retail environment with fast pace.... seems to suck the life out at times. Money is good could be better. But tough at times to stick with it all"
good,"High stress, job uncertainty, constant unease and people taking FMLA from stress, anxiety and depression happens at all centers for Verizon.  Pay and benefits are very good, but are needed because of job.  One very good aspect is that they currently pay for up to $5000 in advance for college classes."
good,"As most companies, the sales goals of a company changed based off of revenue goals. The goals at Verizon has been increasing over the last two years because the company has been over spending. The retail industry is dying industry. I have worked for Verizon for over four years and compared to two years ago, a sales person has to work 33% harder to just hit their base commission. I have been through three commission changes over my four years and each time the change has only directly benefited the company. Verizon is paying employees less and raising goals."
good,really bad with no discipline in anything. People have no clue just know they have a job. Too much outsourcing to offfshore project really created bad work culture.
good,Would not work here if you have a family. Many of their shifts include split days off (with both days being during the week) and shifts that don't allow for time spent with children
good,The job does have flexibility but does not have a lot of part time positions. You can make your own money plus earn hourly. The only major downside is there isn't much growth in the company.
good,Did not feel like there was anyone to help with issues that came up with customers. Customers would ask to speak with a manager and none were available.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon offers great benefits.  They have a great gradual return to work program for mothers coming from maternity leave.  The workplace culture can be very stressful.
good,"the pressure is on! Oh, you did well, now you have to do better in order to achieve a comparable level of compensation. Lunches are always taken 'on the fly'."
good,"I've worked at Verizon for over 10 years.  There is always opportunity to step outside the box and offer solutions as a band 6 or 7 employee, but not many are followed up on.  Without the title to support the employee, there is not much credence given to those outside the director pool.  There is little to no training/coaching provided; what is available, is up to the individual employee to reach out for coaching and training opportunities.  Many have to be done outside of work hours.  The vacation benefits and tuition reimbursement are great adds to the workplace.  The healthcare policy is also great! Unfortunately, the company does not promote from within very much, if at all in many business units.  There is always an outside hire, causing already taxed resources to then train and assist the new team member and/or leader.  It is often joked that if you want promoted, you have to leave the company and come back in 2+ years.  There is also 0 work/life balance.  You are expected to work 10-12 hours a day to get things done; many of which are way outside of your scope of work.  It does grant the employee access to other job functions, which lends to gained experience and skills in other areas across the enterprise business.  There are also, what appear to be quarterly, reductions in force.  Sometimes very few individuals are effected, other times entire groups are eliminated."
good,"Very busy, hectic days.  Management expects unrealistic goals. Many systems issues that adversely affect customer service and ability to meet goals."
good,nothing is ever good enough and the goals are too high. no transparency between upper level management and front line. new ideas are passed over for old ideas that have been used and haven't worked.
good,"Exciting times to be part of the VZ global team.  However, recent reorg has created an unstable work environment.  As a consultant, hard to get your renewals and nothing is definite in your career environment."
good,Pay isn't worth the stress attached to it. They give you unattainable goals. After working there for 5 years and raises every year I still made less money YOY due to higher quotas.
good,"Decent Place.Not a great job to advance your career. Management was run for poorly. It seriously depended on who you know. I think for a sales agent starting in your career, you may be fine, but do not stay longer than 6 months."
good,"Verizon was a decent place to work for.  No complains, managers were easy and flexible with scheduling. Pay was not enough to survive in the bay area."
good,"Verizon has the potential to be an outstanding company. Yes they are a multi-billion dollar company but they refuse to promote from within. There are layoffs every 6 months so you feel you have to keep low every so often hoping your time is not up. "
good,"Everyday was a learning opportunity with Verizon when helping customers with their cell phone problems.  Verizon also provided a learning portal which helped learn about new programs, phones and promotions."
good,"The environment was difficult because regardless of the quality of the work and output, headcount reductions occurred based on net income targets, with minimal basis on performance review."
good,They employed me for years.  I survived many layoffs yet finally was axed.  Telecom has a tiny profit margin.  They underpay their employees on the whole.
good,"Great for future jobs looks good on resume but they killed there own market with free tablets, 50 reps in 1 store and terrible management. But to each his own."
good,"Upper management cares less for the workers and passes that down the management chain. If you have good coworkers it can be a tolerable job. Pay and benefits were good when I worked for them but they seem to decrease all the time. Currently the company is trying to get the union to agree to a contract extension and at the same time telling the workers and the world they're going to disregard parts of the contract and allow outside forces to perform work on their poles and cables. Employee discounts are laughable, for example union employees got a better discount with AT&T then Verizon Wireless. Medical and Dental benefits were good but the company is always looking for ways to cut them, Vision and 401K were ok but other companies have better. They love to claim emergencies and force over time or force out of town assignments. If your ok with being away from your family for weeks at a time then it might be a job for you"
good,Its a corporate job. Thats about all I can say about Verizon. It is not the worst place to work but it is not ideal. Very disorganized and it feels like everything changes constantly and the management has no clue.
good,largely fun with learning new products and technology.  Stress levels are high depending on leadership.  Opportunity to make nice living.  Work life balance lacking
good,Beginning with VZW there where divisions between sales and technical support. In my time the technical support position was eliminated and sale people where expected to shoulder both jobs.
good,"I choose not to comment in this section for public record. I did learn a lot on how to communicate with b2b, and made good relations with people. I wish they gave more work life balance"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,the company was so far gone on their outrageous quota metrics of selling 5 add ons to each device that they forgot that they make money by offering people a service.
good,"The reason I began a job search while still working at Verizon, is due to the very negative relationship between the company management, and its employees."
good,I really needed a job before starting at Verizon.  The hours suited me when I first started there but overtime they didn't work for me and I didn't feel like the job was worth my education so I quit
good,Typical corporation in every conceivable way. You will work hard for fair pay but only as fair as they deem fit at any given time. Month to month pay structure changes to ensure the company is reaping as much profit as employees can stomach.
good,"you were micro managed your whole shift, were required to follow a script when speaking with customers. The hardest part of the job was staying focus and and avoiding burnout"
good,"I wish I would have started working there when I was younger. I worked there after I earned my MBA.  I left because I couldn't support my family on the salary I was earning.  I didn't have much marketing experience and had to start at an entry level position just to get my foot in the door.  Overall, the culture was great and they do hire from within however I didn't have the time to invest at my current age.  If I would have started as a younger man I could justify staying there for several  years in an effort to move up the corporate latter."
good,"A lot of micromanagement. "
good,"I can only speak for my store but there was a high rate of sales consultant turnover and store managers. "
good,I felt underpaid for the amount of knowledge that was required of all the systems needed to fulfill my role. In addition i left during a time when tech support agents were being cross trained to handle customer service and sales calls as well without an increase in pay.
good,Great pay and benefits. Drive to downtown everyday was not really what I signed up to do. Pay for parking daily. Not really a place to move up within company.
good,"Had issues with the night shift. Otherwise, it is ok to work. Have a lot of employee engagements. The hike is also better. Technical learning is good."
good,At Verizon work there is no family life. You need to work 14 hrs a day at least. Awful. 
good,"Great pay and benefits. Very stressful and high pressure. Great company to work for, but very little goes into employee satisfaction or work life balance."
good,"Although the pay and benefits are very good, older people are overlooked, and the first to be laid off.  The location, in Owasso, Oklahoma was very accessible to local highways."
good,The workload was heavy and has lots of time constraints. You are asked to do more work than is normally doable in an 8 hour day so there is usually overtime involved.
good,"Working in one of the busiest store in New York, you learn how to get along with everyone that crosses your path and at the same time accomplish hitting quota with record breaking results."
good,"If you are a single person then this is a great job for you, however working in this contact center the pay was great but the hours were trash.  I would work here again"
good,"While Verizon was a great company to work for, the management locally was less than impressive. There appeared to be a culture of nepotism and punitive retribution."
good,my time working for verizon wasnt bad its just anytime you get in a very corporate setting you have little say in anything and i felt like noone really listened to my feedback on how to inprove when i was the number one salesman at my branch.
good,"lack of communication from management to employees, The change in management in your role, gives less chance to grow with your manager and causes a disconnect between employees capabilities to  new management"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Was going well until new management.  Did not care for his condescending attitude.   The pay was good and the benefits were a real plus. Wish I would have taken advantage of them more.
good,Not an ideal place if you have a young family. They really is no work life balance. One has to be ready to be on the phone the entire 8 hours you are there.
good,"A succinct summary of my opinion appears in the following few lines "
good,"it was not a easy place to work,tough competition,much communication,not much to grow,limited work place culture,good management,creativity,leadership,team work"
good,"Fellow employees become like family,  Verizon ""promotes"" when it comes to ""poor"" or ""unethical"" sales strategies as long as you make your numbers. They fire quality honest associates with excellent customer service reviews while keeping dishonest associates with poor customer reviews only because they make the sales."
good,"As a GM (General Manager) Verizon will work you to your break point, because of the wireless market being so saturated they are wanted you to teach your sales team how to sell more then help the customer, they believe that if a customer that walks in is wanting more from there carrier like tablet or smart watch or a HUM but that isn't true for everybody but because they came into your store you better sell to them and if you don't they will coach you out because you are there to sell and you have quota to hit if you want to get paid from them. This is not a job if you want make friends or better your career. Its a job to make money and stress you out."
good,"Job security was questionable. Every five year there was manpower reduction. If you were not in sales it was hard to advance your career. "
good,"This is a great job for those starting out in Sales and wanting to get experience in sales.  The beginning pay is good and you can learn a lot.  Benefits are incredible and for a person starting off in retail you can't find better."
good,There is no typical day of work. You are cross-trained in many different things. They send you where they need you. Often mandatory overtime would rule and managers would stand outside the yard and tell you to go back to work. Verizon killed our union. They hired contractors instead and paid them peanuts and we all got laid off.
good,"You have to work hard to sell and push sales, and go out of your way to get product to sell for commission. I was in management and before a regular rep and I feel its a waste of time."
good,lack of direct management leadership. Company does not seem to care about their long term employees anymore and moving towards contracting a majority of the work.
good,"When i first started at Verizon it was great, the atmosphere of the employees and everyone around was great. In sales they wanted you to make your quota (which changed monthly of course) sell a certain amount of boxes (phone sales), accessories, ect. And everything is based off a scorecard, that determines your rank on how ""well"" you do your job, it also determines what shift you get every 6 months, ect. This scorecard also changes periodically. Verizon seemed like a happy nice place to work until the end of 2016 when 2 call centers closed down. And ever since then the job was just never the same. I get is sales changes but when I started they would allow us to waive a $30 activation fee if a customer was to purchase $90 in accessories, that slowly started escalating. They wanted us to start selling $300 in accessories and not waiving any activation fees. Even customers were upset, I mean Verizon is expensive already for just the service now you want them to max out BTA just because the upgraded a phone? You also don't want to make a manager or higher up want to fire you, because they will, even if its based on a 1% error on your part. And at Verizon if you want to make over 50,000 a year you have to live at the office an extra 10-15 hours of OT should give you the paycheck you want."
good,competitive & stressful. frequest lay offs.. every one  has afear of job secuity so ppl work in silos trying to prove themselves. no team work or knowledge sharing
good,I enjoyed the customers and taking calls to route them appropriately. The co-workers were very nice as well; we all seemed to learn from one another with our varied skillsets.
good,"Coworkers were very nice, friendly, and helpful. The uniform is very modern, dark blue jeans with Lands End sweater, shirt, sweatshirt etc. Prepare to be micro managed, managers stress you about hitting quota at the end of the month and up selling to every customer. Schedule was never consistent. Your scheduled time or day to show up to work would change a day or two after being released, which resulted in no work/life balance. Mandatory meetings at unreasonable times. Customers were very rude for the most part and had a sense of entitlement."
good,"Working at verizon's call center was a high paced, stressful environment.  Training was in depth, but once you were done with training, expectations were high.  Weekly call reviews with supervisors.  Job was rated with a check-list, rather than overall customer experience.  Extremely coporate environment where employees are treated as just a number vs a valued person. Atypically there is the ability to advance, but there are often higher freezes."
good,Work days are pretty slow. Some days we do not get more than 5 customers a day. I only wish that days were more consistent in terms of business. I have learned to value my time and to manage my time much better while being here. Workplace culture is very relaxed. The hardest part of the job is sitting without business many of the days. The most enjoyable part is interacting with all types of people as customers
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The hours were anywhere from standard days to intense overtime. It was a typical retail job. Moving up into different positions is not easy. If you have the skills and degrees, it is a good place to work with advancement."
good,"Great opportunity for people looking for an entry-level career in sales.  Fast pace. decent salary and benefits, however, work-life balance is not great."
good,"Daily pushed to focus on administrative items which overwhelmed you and took focus on building our product.  Hardest part of job was perceived focus from leadership to look for negatives in team without highlighting and building on positives.  The close knot community fostered in construction was great in comparison with other departments.  Outside of construction, the view of safety was somewhat skewed."
good,A typical day at Verizon is handling customer accounts and using in-house tools to prospect for business accounts. With customers that come into the store you were helping them with service issues or getting new phones. You demonstrate a line of other products that Verizon offers besides phones that might benefit them in their lives. I learned a lot about the retail and the business it was the first time I had worked in retail and I actually prefer other types of sales. In retail I was very surprised at the narrow range of knowledge management has I'm coming from a background where I worked for many years and the investment markets however. The most enjoyable part of the position was setting people up with new phones and seeing their excitement. The most difficult part I would say is dealing with difficult customers face-to-face people that come in continually with issues.
good,Company has decent benefits.  Drained your soul. Individual managers can be cool.  When I first began working for VZW they seem to care more about the employees.  Prior to closure employees were the last priority.
good,"While the compensation and benefits are good, working at Verizon can feel very impersonal and work can be very tedious and boring some days. Overall it was a positive experience but I did not love my job."
good,"You take multiple calls back to back, no breaks in btw calls. Troubleshoot mobile devices, while providing excellent customer service. Stats are based mainly on customer interaction."
good,"Competitive salary+commission base"
good,Interesting and challenging projects. Many teams are involved in building enterprise apps. Tends to be a slow moving process. Technology stack is decent but hard to get open source approval.
good,No loyalty for tenure. Company has engaged in a campaign to drive long time employees out of business. Almost everyone I have spent 20 years working with has been let go
good,Nice place to work.  Hard to move from retail level to corporate unless you know the person hiring.  I did enjoy working for the company but was part of the frequent lay offs.
good,"I worked for Verizon for years, and yes I made a lot of money in sales, but I was constantly concerned for my ability to keep my job. If you disagreed with mgmnt at all , especially on them breaking ethics, code of conduct, etc, you were punished. Encourages you to be cut throat in your day to day operations."
good,"Good environment, however as a store manager had to go through store closings and 3 different district managers in one year. the store closed and persons were laid off even though new stores were opening."
good,My current manager has made me not want to work for the company any longer. I refuse to put my ethics to the side when making decisions. Unfortunately people leave leaders and not companies.
good,"I worked for Verizon when they opened the doors and it was a great place to work. People were happy and calm. By the time I left "
good,The hardest part of the job is a mix between the verbal abuse on the phone and the micro managing of management.  The benefits adn pay are the best part.
good,The benefits are great .  They need to work on promoting and encouraging tenured employees to change positions and offer more jobs or roles with different options to apply or on the job training.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is very competitive, if you are looking for a sales position, and you're self motivated, always challenging yourself, Verizon is the place to be"
good,"Good money, there is very little loyalty however. The job security is not very high either. I also believe in seeking with integrity and that is not always the case there."
good,"Great benefits, good pay.  Little training in U.S.  Employees are not treated as though they are important.  Layoffs at least once if not twice a year for the last decade"
good,"job is very demanding, management oversees all conversations and customer contact. highly regulated laws and rules constantly changing added to a very stressful environment."
good,"My Contract Job was not representitive of employment at Verizon.  I was off by  myself doing a very unique job but from what I saw, this would have been a good place to work at."
good,"It was a great place to work for and helped with growing my skills as a top notch customer service representative. I enjoyed the fast-paced environment and being able to solve customer complaints in a more than timely manner. I was frequently called upon to deal with customers who were particularly upset, in order to quell their concerns, assuage their fears, and more importantly: solve their issue."
good,"I work for Wireless Zone that is a authorized retailer and as much as I love serving the customer and helping them. The pay isn't much, management doesn't seem to have interest in investment and the hours aren't consistent."
good,"Verizon really wants to be a tech company, but can't seem to muster the budget or patience to actually do that right. Until they get new leadership, and commit to fully funding projects for a number of years, they'll continue to burn cash and have nothing to show for it..."
good,"Opportunities for advancement has at stalled in the last few years. Even with the great tuition assistance, unlikely chance of finding a job in your the field of study."
good,"Its an Ok place to work,  You can make some good money as long as the commission structure is good. Good benefits, TERRIBLE work life balance because of RETAIL hours. And you HAVE to work weekends"
good,Very competitive environment with high level of corporate politics effecting employees daily. The best part about working at Verizon was the experience I gained in sales and service over a period of 4 years.
good,"Overall a solid company, however industry competition is leading to consolidations and layoffs. Upper level management is horrible. They have no heart and give no recognition. They seem to always focus on the negative parts of the job."
good,A typical day at Verizon is very stressful and not worth the compensation or hours away from my family.  Quotas are set way too high in order to compete for bonuses.
good,"Good company overall, local management was unable to meet expense objectives therefore many of us were released only to be brought back at a later time as contractors at a lower salary with no benefits"
good,"It's been over 11 years since I worked for this company, so I don't really know how much (if anything( has changed. But when I was there, it was a commission-based environment, which meant we were pushing products and services that customers clearly didn't need, and that didn't help me sleep well at night."
good,It use to be a secure company to work for but it seems that close to every 6 months or so they would have layoffs. They pay well and the benefits are good. But it always seemed lately that there would be a buzz as to what percentage of employees and which departments would be affected.
good,don't care about people...hr does not walk the talk.  HR does nothing to develop their own people and one mistake gets you in a dog house you cannot get out of
good,"It was a relatively fast paced place to work, management was not the greatest they did not fully train and was not consistent. It was a relatively easy job but the pay was very low for a wireless industry job."
good,I would handle inbound calls in the sales department. A normal day would include answering 50 calls and presenting the most suitable phone and or accessories to the customer.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,You would think you would make more seeing how Verizon is the most expensive wireless provider in the U.S.  The pay doesnt comphensate what's expected of you.
good,"Verizon is a cool place to work at, but I felt management need to give importance to latest tools and technology , not just follow the old legacy system blindly."
good,"A typical day at work is 8 hours. You stand all day and the aim is to make sales. Commission checks are great to look fwd to on top of your hourly check. dDon't apply for this type of job if you aren't friendly, a great seller, or competitive."
good,"Sales environment is slanted towards Verizon and often manipulates the end user into purchasing products they are not completely explained cost or consequences."
good,Enjoyed new technologies & opportunities to work in the office and on job sites.  Constantly changing direction due to bad management decisions.  Engineers never promoted once they had proven their worth in their current position.
good,"Verizon provides good benefits and a decent wage. You obtain some sales skills along the way. However, the work life balance is about as bad as it gets. If you want to advance in the company you have to go from retail sales, to an assistant manager while taking a pay cut. This is nearly the only route to get into the business channel, HR, marketing, etc. There are a lot of politics involved. You are making decent money but not obtaining outside sales skills which will hurt your career."
good,"Benefits and salary is above industry average, but management and career advancement prospects are very poor. Poor work culture and work life balance."
good,"Typical Day > Respond to customer requests such as quotes, service issues, reporting, assist with testing and demonstrations, marketing  Verizon products, identify needs, overcome objections, align resources needed for projects, assist with project and order management, respond to challenges associated with servicing and supporting an enterprise world-wide network; essentially serve as ""boots on the ground"" for an assortment of challenges and requests to bring to resolution."
good,"You have to be in ""group"" in order to be noticed. Some of the managers were more favorable to others and ignored a lot of good/hard workers.  Many people were over looked for superlatives that they deserved for others who were more popular so to speak."
good,"Verizon I believe is a great place to work, but the contract payment was low for the position.  I had to work a lot of hours for the low pay and the manager was really unreasonable at times."
good,"The noc center is like the post office.  It never stops.  It can be quite stressfull.  There are also layoffs twice a year...every year.  Be nice to your supervisors, because the layoffs are not performance based.  It is a popularity contest."
good,"Verizon does take care of its employees when it comes to benefits but you will work hard. Very little social life bc you typically only have one weekend off a month. There are an overwhelming amount of metrics to meet while satisfying the general public. The better your numbers get, the more they work you. Its never enough with this company."
good,"Finns möjligheter till alternativa roller i ett stort bolag, dock är möjligheterna begränsade till karriär om man inte finns i USA. Saknar ledning i Europa."
good,I learned a lot about new technology at Verizon. There are a lot of great people to working at Verizon. The most enjoyable parts of the job are being able to work with great people and learning about new technology. There is always a lot of variety at Verizon. I really like being involved in all of the different projects that we have going on.
good,"Awards, pay, and overall compensation have gone down. Career advancement is limited unless you're willing to move anywhere. The company seems to arbitrarily decide when to let someone go."
good,The management was terrible.  The pay wasn't good enough for what you had to go through every day. The people were amazing and made work bearable. Learned how call centers work.
good,"I didnt appreciate the way I was let go.  Other than that, it was ok, except for the company forgetting how to treat their employees   They seemed to have lost their vision, and also the way they made their employees worry at the end of being let go or fired was horrible."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,10- 12 hour days   Some really great people some not so much. Management was constantly revolving in areas and job duties.  Had freedom to travel all areas with a company vehicle.  Being upper managers changed so much their goals were continually changing as were ours at my level of management
good,"The company was one of the best to work at a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, the company and the structure has changed. This has a lot to do with staff and company-wide issues."
good,"If you're looking for a career involving advancement, look elsewhere. Verizon tends to buy out other companies then bring in said purchased companies management just because of years-of-service although they don't have a clue on what a managers position entails. Very frustrating and disappointing."
good,"Verizon made news with its acquisition of new tech companies. 5 years back verizon started to diversity to new businesses, but now it is shutting down most of those projects and going back again as a cellular company."
good,VZ is a large beauracratic companyy with constant turnover and reorganization. The company culture is not conducive to long term success. Good regional leadership is offset by poor global communications to the rank and file.
good,I was able to move up very quickly at Verizon.  It is a very hard job because the employees are not committed to doing right by the customer.  Also management discourages processing credits.
good,The experience was great. The training was amazing and the benefits as well. My own business was the only dream that makes me move on after this opportunity.
good,"Verizon's union made sure we had great benefits, but could not have much control over the work environment. Employees were highly stressed due to sales quotas. I did work for them many years ago, hopefully things have changed."
good,Verizon establishes to redefine itself through acquisitions and new products.   The culture is diverse and aggressive to achieve results. The most enjoyable part of working at Verizon is the people.  There is a good network of employees willing to support each other The organizations work well together.
good,"Of course you get what you put in. Depending on your clientele, you will either find it very easy or very difficult to navigate thru the c company. EVERYTHING is based on performance."
good,"Company offers good benefits, 401k, employee discounts. Very competitive sales environment, conflicting information from upper management in certain job roles."
good,"overall good company to work for when you are young, difficult to balance personal and professional life.  Company had excellent benefits and perks.  By all means go and work there."
good,This company was very stressful the last 3-4 years I worked there.  The workload was incredible and all they wanted to do was eliminate employees and use resources from other countries.  It was a difficult environment to work in to say the least.  It was definitely a good ole boy network and most promotions were given to select individuals and not because you worked hard to learn the ropes.  The pay and benefits were great and over time it was worth it.  The bonus and stock/profit sharing are nice perks.  The use of visas and offshore labor is disheartening to say the least.  A lot of companies do it today especially in technology but it drives the labor force to lower pay here and more difficulty advancing or even getting a job opportunity.
good,"Its a call center, if you do good you will have a job.  Very stressful because of the metrics specially with the 3 day repeat.  If customers called back within 3 days of you taking their call it affects you badly.  There is no job advancement you can only move up on the same job field; so if you take calls you will most likely stay there."
good,"Great people and growth in the industry when I was with Verizon.  However, culture was very command/control and top/down decision making which led to a fractious relationship between management and front line employees."
good,"By analyzing guest’s needs and deploying problem solving skills, I am able to effectively and efficiently recommend a solution while keeping the guest engaged and excited. As a team leader, I assist with the onboarding, training, and development of new and tenured employees. Assisting with weekly and monthly inventory counts of merchandise, I have gained vast knowledge of inventory management"
good,Managers tend to have relations with employees so they get all the sales. A lot of favoritism the company does not sell with integrity I was not able to grow as an employee
good,The management don't care about people's family or personal goals. If you earn a bonus they are trying to find ways not to pay you. Always making promises that  they don't keep.
good,To much corporate spending not enough focus on the day to day operations and necessities with up keeping our equipment to guarantee better service for our customers.
good,"Verizon is in the mode of downsizing therefore, not much opportunity for promotion.   Limited growth in business due to competitive nature of the wireless industry"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Constant battles between union and company.  Can be forced to work late or in excess anytime, and it seems to line up more with sending messages to union employees rather than workload.  Moral and ambition is horrible. Referred to as a ""golden handcuff"" type of job."
good,The people at Verizon are hardworking and supportive of each other.  That is critical because the work is challenging and workplace environment is not always enjoyable.
good,While the pay and benefits were good the atmosphere is incredibly stressful. People were taken to the hospital weekly. I cannot express how difficult it is to survive there much less while being healthy.
good,It's a great place to work. Work/life balance is something that will be hard to accomplish. They require so much of your time especially managers. The time spent daily will take its toll on you along with the sales commitment and constant reminder of daily sales goals.
good,"I enjoyed my time and I am thankful for the friends I have made. The mobile communications industry is very competitive, so you must be strong enough to handle the job requirements."
good,I do not have a review to write. I am putting this because I can not skip past this page. I attempted to put nothing and was forced to put something in here
good,Always seemed to change the pay structure so we would end up making less.  Worked a lot of hours with sometimes no actual breaks because we were very busy.
good,"Long hours are expected and some management have little regard for employees. Some positions pay well, but you will be putting in long hours and have no life."
good,"People were either really nice, or cut-throat. I liked my job most days, but dealing with some of the company expectations was not fun. I did not want to push things on people, which was sometimes asked of me."
good,There are times that working at VZW is awesome and other times that it needs to be totally changed into something that is family friendly and not so hard on time.
good,"It has good benefits and good starting wage. Good place to start but terrible work life balance and the quotas you need to meet are hard, they change depending on location to keep them hard so no location as an advantage."
good,Verizon is a tough place to work but if you are willing to sacrifice morals then it's perfect. Great team environment. Work family fun but lacks the balance of home life.
good,the benefits and pay are awesome. there is not much room for career advancements most promotions are temporary and they are selected by the management
good,"High pressure concerned about meeting numbers. They used to care more about customers and employees. Last employee feed back we were told "" Yes, we read your concerns but we are a numbers company."""
good,Working at Verizon has been pleasant for the most part. There are many opportunities for advancement. The managers are helpful in advancing but the process can get confusing.
good,"It is a crazy cut throat company. Everyone is fighting to be number 1. The pay is good and while there is room to move up, you had to know people in  order to get ahead. There are a lot of racist people here too"
good,At this job I learned a valuable trait. I learned how to team sell at a productive and efficient way. if you are interested in a position with uncapped salary potential this is the job for you.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon offers fantastic benefits,  Yet job restructuring has been going on for years with fewer employees and more job duties added each year.  Opportunity for advancement in your own department but moving to another department is difficult.  Great tuition reimbursement and medical benefits."
good,Short term focus - daily / hourly results.  No clear communication of strategy.  Senior leadership more focused on keeping their jobs than running the business.
good,"Warm or Cold call customers."
good,"I used to enjoy working for the company when you were actually compensated pretty handsomely for the work you put in. Now, you will literally give your blood, sweat, limbs, skin, nails and heart to this job and get chump change in return. They constantly adjust and change the commission structure which in turn always results in lower and lower paychecks. The company has laid off countless people at the drop of a dime, and I'm talking people who have been with the company for 10+ years, all because their position didn't ""fit"" the vision of the company.  The retail channel is dying very quickly. I see job postings but I don't know why they're pretending to be growing when they're just going to replace stores with automated kiosks anyways...."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers understand their phone and show them the benefits of what such device does and see if they need accessories to go with it.  Work with them to pick a plan that suits them and find out if they need any extra lines for relatives of friends. The work is easy if management would let you do your job as intended by code. The most enjoyable part of this job was customers they would make you laugh, cry and feel anger sometimes, but over all customers and coworkers made my day.  I've learn so much thru out the years I worked with Verizon."
good,"I stayed at Verizon for 32 years and enjoyed by job which was telephone customer service however, I found the issues with scripting and collection quotas placed somewhat out of control. I was in collections, customer service but there is a way to treat customers to get the money owed. I was unable to do that as I felt fit. Much of our calls were scripted and that is not possible unless the company scripts for every situation which is impossible. This was a good job as far as benefits and pay structure and enjoyed the fact that we were unionized which helped in some of the issues the office had."
good,"You are expected to be a robot. I never felt as though the company cared for any of its employees. The pay and benefits, however, were very good. High chance of burnout."
good,"Verizon was an excellent company to work for.  However, they have had way too many layoffs and high turn around in the past 15 years.  The jobs and compensation are fabulous.  But, job security is no longer valued."
good,"If you have the numbers, kudos, but otherwise you will be cut, this includes centers closing and them outsourcing to 3rd party vendors albeit inside the US.  These 3rd party centers do not care and will transfer everything simple after they mess up the account.  This is a money saving tactic, and I can not agree with the direction that the company has headed when it comes to this sort of thing."
good,"Verizon is going through a transformational phase, from a Telecom to Telcom-tech company, which is a challenging process.  Time will tell if the new direction was worthy."
good,"Employees are often expected to be available during non-working hours and generally work work under pressure.    Training is encouraged.  Verizon provides their employees with alot of inhouse training on a host of different topics  Due to a number of recent layoffs and more threatened, employees are insecure.."
good,I used to love to go to work and I really enjoyed working for Verizon. The company has made several decisions that have made me concerned that they no longer care about their employees. I have worked for Verizon for several years and they have always been a wonderful company as far as benefits and work life balance. However in the last 12 months there have been some company wide decisions that have decreased my commission. The new policies are making it harder to do my job without sacrificing my integrity. Integrity used to be key to my position now it has taken a big slide backwards.
good,"Culture is down and job security is risky for many. Typical days can be very busy and stressful, especially for their solutions specialist and management. They recently laid off 6000 employees and are expected for more to come."
good,"Verizon is a large company that offers great benefits to its employees. I have grown tremendously over my 17 year career with them. The environment is very quick paced and demanding, so if you're considering applying be ready to work."
good,"With the unions and bad management I would not recommend anyone to work at Verizon.."
good,A good company but retail isn't to good  if you are looking for a long lasting career to advance. The company have a lot of cut backs in employment. It is also hard to advance in the company in certain districts. The hire up seem to only want to grow the employees they feel are better equipped for the job which the over time decide to leave the company or step down in management.
good,Starting pay is pretty low considering they require a 4 year degree. There is a lot of micro management. A lot of metrics to hit and if you don't you will be let go.
good,"Was super excited to start out there. A company with a credo, one that seemed to care and take care of its people, I was on cloud 9. As the time passed I could see more and more that the credo they preach was just that: preached but not strictly practiced. But, its a big corporation so I suppose it was ignorance on my part. Sure, you get compensated well, but there is always more being dumped on you. There used to be lots of recognition, and the sky seemed like the limit, but one quickly learned that would not last long. The glass ceiling comes quick. The security factor is certainly something that adds to the stress of a field where the goalpost is constantly being  moved out of reach. The hours are long, and the candle gets torched at both ends. You can never do well enough, and most often if you aren't catching flak from one end its being shot from the other. You could be a top store, and still feel like you are terrible at your job based on communication received from above despite leading amongst your peers. It is a mentally taxing job, Not for the feint of heart or thin skinned to be sure. I used to recommend working there to friends, but of late I don't even think about it."
good,"One of the most difficult things about this job is balancing your life and the demands of the job"
good,"Unfortunately, an inordinate amount of time was spent in meetings explaining the projects one was working on.  The same information was asked for multiple times throughout the duration of the project."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"When working there in 2005-2010 it was great, however after transferring to different dept, things begin to change drastically.I was happy with my job until I transferred to technical support in which I begin to notice that no matter how hard I tried, it was never enough."
good,"Loved it when I 1st started, not the same company at all anymore."
good,Disorganized with lack of direction and specific goals. Near constant change. Accusatory and finger-pointing culture. Not much mentoring or positive feedback. Hard to advance from within.
good,Great place to learn sales experience.  Work/life balance is not so great due to the job being retail sales. Compensation is competitive due to commission structure.
good,"I worked at Verizon Tech Support for 2+ years, and I can say that the company is a good place to work. I only ""left"" because they decided to shut down the entire call center I work at and consolidate their customer service centers. Pay is really good, education benefits, healthcare is awesome, annual bonuses, 401k matching, work environment is ok. It was a call center so the stress of that type of environment is obvious. Verizon also uses A LOT of business process outsourcing firms to handle a bulk of their inbound customer care calls. A lot of those centers are awful and you do spend a lot of time cleaning up their mistakes, dealing with their BS. Verizon most likely will move completely away from in house direct customer care and outsource all of it. They cut 3000 last year alone. I would not recommend joining the company on that fact alone."
good,"Good job for field technicians,excellent benefits and salary."
good,"You are expected to work almost around the clock"
good,You won't have time for anything... they expect you to bend over backwards but if things happen and you need to transfer good luck... also if you don't lie to people you won't make enough sales and they will find a way to get rid of you. like most big business they don't care about you unless you are the top sales person
good,"I learned a lot at this job, but it was very stress inducing and not a pleasant work environment, but some people were great!  The commute was long and harsh."
good,"We called it the golden handcuffs were the reason why nobody wanted to leave because everything else about this job sucks! Management is scared of their management so they don't want to make the wrong move, everything is what upper management thinks. They've taken away the human factor. my co-workers were the only reason i showed up for work regularly.. then they became washed up because they had to look good for upper management if they planned on going anywhere in the company. as far as the job, well i hope you don't mind getting cussed out every day. on top of that they are to busy to train people so hope you're good at ""utilizing your tools and resources"" because you're pretty much self taught there. make sure you have a good body and a nice rack if plan on moving up in the company."
good,The company is decent overall but does not protect their employees rights as well as I would like in a place of business. Overall they provided great products.
good,The problem is no matter what this will always be a sales job. The cellphone industry is hurting badly while at the same time your goals increase. Your schedule will always fluctuate. Unless you are the top dog than your job is never safe. If you are a manager than you will really be putting in all the work.
good,my time here was good at the start but the  company made leadership changes and became somewhat unethical. life ishard here not uncomen to leav work at 9:30 or 10:00 and have to be back to open.
good,"The actual job was very interesting and I was able to learn a lot from by experience.  "
good,"Extremely busy call center work. Very tough calls with often times belligerent customers. Support for reps is mixed. Management is generally friendly and supportive but don't be fooled, it's a iron fist in a velvet glove. Verizon's customer support system is massive and varies wildly in quality so dealing internally with other Verizon departments can be massively frustrating. Lots of ra-ra corporate positivism to distract from the glaring problems that we face daily. Verizon does not skimp on training, however, and you can learn a lot about cell phones and the cell phone industry."
good,"Fun atmosphere, with a productive environment. Very hard to move up in this company, you have to know people in order to move up. As a whole the company has GREAT benefits."
good,"Work life balance can be hard to management with kids. Educational advancement is not easily attained due to the daily demands of the job even on off days. Working to get the next level can be challenging pass the Store Manager level. Depending on our DM, overall experience can be favorable."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The company I was working for at the time was purchased by Verizon.  I liked the company I worked for better (Alltel). Verizon was a stressful job
good,"Due to the time of my schedule 11pm - 730am the workload can be a liteam at times which leads to long nights.  However, this does give me an opportunity for alot of training."
good,very productive work place if placed under proper management. very  friendly work environment with the opportunity to move up in the company.difficult to maintain a steady income because of consultant commission changes
good,"Manager of store micromanaged or didn't manage there was no in between . other managers didn't know what they were doing, or selling, some were not even aware of some of the transaction rules. Verizon in itself was a great company and I would probably go back if I needed a job but I will never return to the location I was in ."
good,"Money is good, stress is high, management can be off. Don't promote your best sales people to managers for being good at sales. Different district manager every year seems off, as well."
good,"The calls are always coming! Very difficult job as most customers are angry but it is very much still a sales environment. You resolve the issue, while finding ways to sell. Easily the most aggressive sales environment I've ever been part of. Not much in the way of freedom as management are constantly monitoring you on and off the phone. A very rewarding job for those willing to stick through it. Great pay, amazing benefits."
good,Good ob experience and good cultural to work in. I worked at Verizon for almost 13 years and if someone had the chance to work at Verizon I would recommend that they take the opportunity to do so.
good,"the pay is good, but the work life balance is non existent, and promotions are often available for those who management prefers more so than who is qualified."
good,"A company that is very fast paced with goals like shifting sand. Goals change quickly and often times with little to no explanation. Management from on high lacks follow up and follow thru with little to no communication. "
good,"Verizon was a okay atmosphere to work in, the employees were awesome, just needed more floor support. The management there were great, just not consistent. The hardest part of this job was talking on the phone all day. The most enjoyable part was meeting different customers all over the world."
good,"The people that I worked with were great. The managers were great. The company no longer wanted to do that type of work."
good,"Work was fast paced and well balanced. My knowledge came in handy to supervisors, as they were somewhat clueless to some ways of the operation of the job."
good,"I worked at Verizon for 5 years. The first 2 were great but due to constant upper leadership changes the company failed to maintain a consistent form of operating. They change pay structures and commissions on a whim and over hire people to weed the weaker employees out. When I came there was only 5 sales reps per location and last I heard there was 13. The benefits were great! $20 deductibles at the doctors made having your family on your plan very easy. Holidays are the worst, you can't enjoy Thanksgiving or Christmas without having to be in the office the next day at 6 or 7am. Forget work life balance when you work for this company. Great for single people coming out of college but horrible if you're a family man/woman."
good,"Get in and get out.  The pay is the lowest in the industry but the benefits are good.  You will learn a lot if you apply yourself, but it's best viewed as a stepping stone to other things.  Not the place you want to hang around for many years."
good,"incoming calls for billing, and technical support, overall great training, wonderful benefits, but company has unreasonable expectations on supervisors and this carries down to staff, there is little ability for movement, and the company does not encourage an environment for loyal employees who stay for years, after a short time employees cap out on their wages and can no longer receive raises unless they move to a new position, which is not possible."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of training or putting together training's for either New Hire representatives or seasoned reps.  Also, staying up to date on campaign specifics.  I learned that team building is very important with new reps, because this brings friendships and partnerships.  Parts of the management team was not the strongest asset to the company due to lack of communication.  There are some management members that would try to keep you in the loop, but they also have tasks to complete.  Being part of Leadership we all got along and would put our minds together to collaborate on ideas and processes that could benefit the company.  I can say that there was nothing hard about my job.  I loved what I did, which made it fairly easy to complete tasks.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing reps that I have trained or mentored succeed and move on to bigger things within the company."
good,"Very long hours, lots of time away from family and very greedy C level folks. However, excellent benefits, 401k package, and great teammates."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,the work environment was horrible was forced to always push products on customers to make sales whether they wanted it or not. Only me and my manager cared about customer service district managers and owners told us numerous times to forgo customer service and just push products to get sales.
good,"Fair company to work for. Great product. "
good,You get to meet a lot of people. A lot of money can be made. Only thing is when there is good in retail there is a lot of bad. Work environment is ok depending on what location you are working at.
good,Extensive knowledge of Verizon products and services. Provide customer services by analyzing their needs and presenting positive solutions.  Ensure customer has basic understanding of the functionality of products and services.  Support daily business operations which includes processing transactions and auditing customer invoices. Use outstanding sale expertise and building customer loyalty by delivering exceptional customer service experience.
good,"Very nice people and generally a good place to work. "
good,"I've enjoyed working here, mostly due to the people on my team.  Management has no concern for the staff, however, and advancement is non-existent, at least in the groups under the AD I worked with.  The department I was in was poorly organized and managed and my contract actually ended because they decided that they just didn't Business Analysts anymore, that the developers could just do ""all that stuff"". But 90% of the development staff is contingent and has no knowledge or background in the business or the processes that this team supports, and over 50% of that staff is offshore, and even more disconnected from the industry and market here in the states.  With that being said, however, it was the nicest team of people I've ever worked with, who were always willing to go out of their way and above the call of duty to get things done, which is good, because that was pretty much required 100% of the time due to the poor organization and management of incoming projects."
good,Very stressful work. Management doesn't appreciate work. Most enjoyable part of work is that you get to work in lot of new technologies. Co workers are helpful.
good,The company has been sold and the benefits and wages are not the same.  Demands on time management is difficult. Many changes to come.....
good,"The Job Culture and Work/Life Balance is not the best at Verizon Wireless.  it is a stress-filled environment with unrealistic demands, deadlines and tasks. Because RIFs are frequent, there is always the concern about job security."
good,"Overall a fast pace environment.  You must keep up or be left behind.  Not the safest place to work as the culture changes on a yearly basis, but the benefits are great and they provide a ton of resources."
good,Good place to work for a few years.  No longer a company that retains employees or older workers.  Lots of layoffs on a monthly basis.  Get in learn then move on.
good,Verizon (Cellular Cells) Each day is always an adventure. Most of the customers are really cool  and very friendly. They make the job really fun. You will learn a lot there. The co-workers  some really great to work with however you do have the other type who aren't so friendly and because they are not as personable it can make the job a little frustrating.  The  hardest part for me was setting up a phone  and for whatever reason the system doesn't recognize the phone so your not able to activate the phone  and sometimes transferring information from the old phone to the new phone. I Enjoyed my customers the most they made my day one customer made lunch for me.
good,"I feel given my personality, education and past experience I will be a great fit in contributing to a company’s growth platforms."
good,The store and its manager was great to work for but the company itself had many problems with paying employees on time and pay the correct amount earned. Had to contact HR multiple times to get my pay check and to get my pay check corrected to the correct amount.
good,Verizon is focused on Share Holder value. No longer Employee focused. No longer a fun place to work. The we ar ethe best and the customers will come at any price attitude is catching up with them
good,Great people and great company.  Very fast pace environment. Lots of current changes within the organization. The next few years Verizon will be an even stronger company.  Hopefully the last man standing among Wireless/Technology firms.
good,I had planned on working at Verizon my entire career unfortunately it did not work that way. It was a tough place to work from the position I was in. For the final 8 or so years that I worked there the company would lay off workers once or twice a year like clock work. This put a heavier load on us remaining employees (which we all had no problem handling) but it wasn't fun wondering who was next to go. That environment was not a good time
good,"Management was very poor when it came to training and overseeing employees. I had the experience of getting hypothermia on the job, just for the manager to tell me I was taking too long. We were rushed and rarely were given the equipment needed to do the job correctly. We were encouraged to cut corners for higher production rate."
good,"This job (customer service / technical support at Verizon wireless) is geared more towards a younger generation. Good position for RCG's. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Compensation is great, you can make alot of money with Verizon. Be prepared to have zero work life balance and be micro-managed everyday. Stores are always packed so you will stay very busy. High pressure sales environment. Schedules are never consistant. Nights and weekends required."
good,We can learn many technical things. But very poor management policies.Work culture is good .. If you people in high management you can get good promotions.
good,Benefits are good the rest I didn't care for. I would suggest looking at a more forward thinking company.The company is old and has a lot of old ideas and approaches to things.
good,"This company is in constant flux as it works to meet its very aggressive earnings projections in the highly competitive wireless market.  Senior leadership rotates out of their roles (or mysteriously disappears) very quickly, so things are often not executed as planned.  Verizon lays off Directors, VP's and SVP's every 18 months which means the direction and vision changes every 18 months. People just disappear as though there's a trap door under their desks.  If you want job security, Verizon is NOT the place for you.  The pro's-- they're flush with cash which means employees are paid handsomely and you're able to work on truly innovative projects.  If you manage to avoid those trap doors, you'll be well compensated.  Your coworkers will be wonderful.  Your cellphone will become another appendage, and its never ok to not check messages."
good,"Very fast paced, changing, customer focused company.  Forced overtime without compensation.  Long term, dedicated and loyal employees make up a small percentage of workforce today."
good,"Well compensated, fast paced demanding environment.  Mandatory excessive hours create a frustrated, overworked workforce.  Forced overtime, without compensation.  Very limited opportunity for advancement or growth. This company has changed drastically in the last 10 years with a very loyal and focused work group."
good,"Very sales based, less customer based. Extremely difficult to advance unless you have connections. Great coworkers. Little to no work-life balance."
good,"The upper management has yet to use the company's resources in a strategic way."
good,"It was long hours for a small commission. You had to be at the office at 10am, on the field at 1pm, off the field at 9pm for a post-shift and I didn't make it home til 10pm. I really enjoyed meeting people. I had a lot of fun but I couldn't have a personal life with the job because they constantly wanted you on the field all day and night."
good,I already wrote a review on Verizon. For some reason the computer asked me to do it again. I left for personal reasons but I did not like the direction the company was headed.
good,"Location of the office and working environment was great.  Our immediate Management were all supportive and needless to say were always backing you up.  Furthermore, there was not any type of micro management."
good,I answered calls and set customers up with Verizon Services. I was top in sales. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers. I enjoyed the incentives we get for being the highest sales associate.
good,Management was poorly educated on policies and procedures. Heavy volume calls and not enough employees. Work was busy and management was lost.
good,Great experience for me to further develop sales and customer service experience. 100% commission based position in inside and outside sales. Ability to set your own schedule and work as much or as little as I liked. However to be extremely successful long hours were required. Had great group of coworkers that created a great team atmosphere. In the end I had an opportunity to get back in the construction field which is where I am extremely passionate.
good,"Working for this company caused me major health issues, and major emotional and psychological distress. Would not recommend to anyone."
good,"The challenge with Verizon in general is the culture and lack of overall strategic direction from Verizon leadership. It is only about getting the numbers at any cost and reporting metrics. Building customer relations are not at all relevant to Verizon leadership. Just get the sale and drive whatever sales metric leadership needs to get an uplift on for that specific month or quarter."
good,Alot of transition was going on.. Management was not very stable. Co workers had great team concept.  Hardest part of the job was having to adjust to the transition of upper management and the expectations that came along with each personality.
good,"Location open seven (7) days a week.  Shifts vary Work/life balance is limited.  Coworkers are like family, they fight and makeup.  The customers I served were the most enjoyable  part of the job.  Ensuring they were satisfied, therefore gaining trust for repeat business was essential."
good,face to face customer service and sales demanding to hit sales targets. great compensation but demanding hours and very hard to balance work and life balance.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,About same as all call centers not a very fun place to work .  Everything is micro managed down to your bathroom breaks. I am sure Verizon the company is fine but not much can be said about a call center.
good,I would assist customers of verizon. Had great co workers I learned to be able to communicate with members and able to position a conversation with a customer
good,verizon lacks good management but the benefits are awesome. Its a means to an end for now. overall its still a good job if your going to school or looking for a new opportunity.
good,"Work days always present opportunity to achieve and exceed expectations. Demands high, and do offer the rewards of a job done well."
good,handled inbound calls and assisted with account management. offered additional products and services. verified service and worked closely with management on several projects
good,"Verizon is a very fast paced environment. Constantly having new information via email everyday with new promotions and sales. On a typical day as Sales Associates at Verizon A Wireless we usually check our emails first thing. We have to be current on all our promotions/ rebates, as they change constantly. I would also have to say that would be the most difficult part of the job. All the employees at Verizon are taught the same so it is a good work environment. The managers probably have the toughest job of all, which coincides with any (sales type job). The best part of the job for me would be the personal interaction with the customer. I enjoyed assisting the customers with there new phones or just questions."
good,"If you need a job, its a good starting point. You definately ldevelop customer service skills. Pay and management not that great."
good,"Because of the Union at Verizon, the pay and benefits are very good. The management is petty and wants to micro manage your every minute. If you are more than 3 minutes late to get to work or return from a break or lunch, you will be written up and if you get several tardies, you will be fired for this, no matter what may have caused them. "
good,"I worked at Verizon for 10 years in a variety of roles including System Analyst, Architect, Project Manager, and Manager."
good,"good money, work life balance is bad. "
good,"Employees are well compensated. However, the company take the concept of an ""at will"" employee to the extreme. Be prepared to be relocated or terminated if you do not relocate.(no, this did not happen to me). Very little upward mobility."
good,"Come in the beginning of your shift, log into your station and headset, take inbound and outbound calls pretty much all day with one hour lunch and 2 breaks of fifteen minutes in between. In the first 5 years the training given was very enjoyable because were practice in separate rooms with a trainer and all but after that time frame Verizon started only with online training on individual basis which were very disappointing in the manner of not interacting with any co-working at all."
good,Clean facilities. Treated with respect. Promotions based on physical location.  Over the top political correctness.  Prefer lifers to new ideas.
good,"The benefits are awesome, you may be able to move all over the country if you have that flexibility.  If you are in corporate its an even better company to work for if you are not a front line employee."
good,They are constantly badgering their employees and changing company policies out of fear. I was harassed several times by the continuously changing management team. They hired some of the most uncool and unprofessional people. Myself and others had continuous issues with most of these people. I started off with a non sales role but after a few months they started pressuring me to hard sell their over priced products and services. They are greedy. Work for another telecommunications provider.
good,Capped pay but a good place to start if you want to get into the Cell industry. The pay is over minimum wage but the goals are unrealistic most of the time. Also the company charges each employee all shrinkage. This is unavoidable.
good,"If you are a person who likes stress and politics this is the place for you. Verizon wireless doesn't promote by performance but by politics. A typical day can vary from customer service , sales ,to merchandising, and to trouble shooting phone issues. How to trouble shoot a cell phone. If you have a good team environment its great. At store level management has no control. Leaving work."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I worked for Terremark Worldwide, Inc.  Verizon purchased Terremark and eventually implemented a Reduction in Force (RIF) of all Information Systems Security management within Terremark.  Hence, security management is being managed out of the corporate office in New Jersey."
good,"Led project teams, and worked with some great people that helped as a team to overcome challenges, long, (and sometimes excruciating hours) as necessary to meet strict deadline commitments, and establish quarterly goals for customer satisfaction."
good,I enjoyed going to work and being able to have a strong support team.  We had a team that was always willing to help one another.
good,"Verizon is a nice place to work as far as technolgy and people as concerned, but it is not a very stable place to work career wise.  There has been 3 layoffs in the past 8 months.  I left a full-time permanent position on the premise that I would be hired after my 6 month contract was up, but instead my contract was extended."
good,"Not that great but ok , work life balance not that great either , there are good people , but thats about it if you like being a hustler this is the way to go"
good,Start at 0700 end 1800  Crew meeting. Assemble tools and supplies as needed for job. Arrive at job site start work per print. Complete construction work per print. Notify supervisor when done. Arrive back to yard.
good,Lots of great people with many years of experience who will be happy to help you anytime. Many opportunities are available in different areas.
good,"I don't but still managed 4 years of this place. Management is high pressure, high expectations and up tight environment. Competition is fierce so be prepared. Pay can be good, or it can be pretty mediocre. Mostly depends on your location and level of competition in the store."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work, there is good work life balance, career options available to make lateral moves, can work your way upwards."
good,"ask you to do more than possible with deadlines that are not realistic with staffing in store. not bad for a first job, will be able to meet people depending on your personality. Lunch breaks are given regularly, hours and work life balance are not good as you will spend a lot of your time here"
good,Good learning experience. Learned how to network. Co-workers good.
good,Was a great starting point to the telecommunications industry
good,"Our motive was to help each and every customer who would walk in. We had a certain amount of commission each month that we had to reach, by doing so we had to promote different products we had in our store and match it to the needs of our customers. Maintaining the cleanliness of our store was very important. Every day there was always a new goal set, I learned how to motivate myself enough to achieve any goal I set for myself. I also learned how to maintain calm when a customer is disagreeing with a technical situation, I have learned how to improve the situation. With working at Verizon, the location I was in, we did not have a store manager. Without a store manager it was difficult, we did not have certain things to maintain our store like every other Verizon store, such as cleaning supplies, phones, and our schedule was not scheduled correctly due to no manager. We had one employee who was not trust worthy, but we managed to be able to work with one another. There was a couple of parts of the job that did make it difficult such as, not having a manager it gave us more responsibility on the whole store, we did manage well. Our location did get closed down, another hard part was when I got transferred to the Tolleson location. Being transferred was very hard because I lost many customers that I had built close relationships with as I helped them have a great experience with Verizon. I also lost my team, and had to adjust to a new one. I did enjoy working at my past locations creating new friendships and meeting tons of different people. My past location was very far from home,"
good,"A typical day as a Sales Consultant typically includes dealing with customers, and tending to their needs. This entails, customer service, selling devices and equipment, bill pays, and technical issues. The hardest part of the job is overcoming obstacles that the customers bring, for example, indecisiveness, and unsatisfied customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer comes in with an issue and is clearly not happy, and when they leave satisfied, and with all their issues fixed and with a sale completed."
good,Good customer service representative experience. Not many benefits. Mandatory long holiday overtime.
good,"Management will spend a dime to save a nickel."
good,private cubicles for direct uninterrupted conversation with customers...friendly co workers.great overtime offered
good,Earlier incarnations of the company had some great people and purpose with shared goals.  Not sure about it nowadays.
good,"a typical day at work was quiet and not many customers "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Working for Verizon Wireless requires thick skin and the ability to adapt to new environments at all times.  The company is ever changing and daily tasks can be altered on a day to day basis.  The company offers great benefits including a 401K and health insurance.
good,"Work/Life balance was terrible.  Was told that you have extreme flexibility by working on commission, but that was far from the case.  Having to work regular retail shifts, while working on 100% commissions.  So, if you don't sell anything one day, you waste about 6+  hours of your life and having to deal with unfriendly customers complaining about their phones all the time."
good,"Contradicting messages from management. "
good,"This job is busy and has a decent level of disconnect from the big picture. There is an ability to work throughout the country which is good if you want to live in different locations, but bad if you want to work with your teammates. Even if you work in the office, you'll see 3 of the maybe 25 people that you interact with."
good,"Very high quota and push products on customer.  Use shady sales techniques to gloss over rules to get the win now.  HR is a not on the straight and narrow.  There is an old mens club mentality, very hard for women to be successful without doing more than men.  Now that it owns itself fully, company is trying to find ways to cut sales compensation.  Great benefits, great training, a lot of bad managers, must be a self starter and self reliant to get yourself all the info you need.  Leadership will constantly put you in positions to break the rules, constantly push you for more, and wipe their hands with you if your break the rules."
good,"If you do not mind being abused by leadership in order to get good pay an benefits, this job is for you.  If you work in the retail area, you are given high goals to achieve for items which are over priced compared to their authorized retailers.  Rebates?  Yep, only the retail stores and not the authorized retailers.  Only impulse shoppers really  buy the bundled packages."
good,"I would come into the office approximately 2 hours early to lead 1 on 1 development for new and veteran employees regarding sales and leadership practices. I would then conduct meetings and lead role-play and development classes, overseeing development and execution of sales practices. After conducting meetings I would oversee a territory of leads for door to door sales for Verizon Fios residential. Often times accompanied by new employees for training purposes. I learned time management, carrying out effective critical conversations, sales, how to motivate employees, and how conduct interviews."
good,The corporate culture has changed over the last five years.  The focus has changed from providing optimum service to meeting scorecard objectives
good,"Following the purchase by Verizon, the majority of jobs were eliminated or moved to New York."
good,"There was a ton of work, but not enough time to do it all.  A bit more thorough training would have been nice."
good,Like most jobs work was a grind. I was with the company for roughly 10 years and seen alot more smiling faces earlier in my tenure than i did  towards the end. When I started the center was one of the best nationally performing centers Verizon Wireless had but as culture slipped you heard more about wishing a decision from the top would be in the employees best interest. By the end of my tenure we the center was performing in the top  2/3 and was closed. They also closed THE top performing center at the same time so there must have been other factors.
good,"Verizon has great benefits, and provides good salary over time.  It appears that management advancement is not based upon accomplishments or technical ability, but more on who has best idea to save money, off shore jobs, and ways cut benefits."
good,"Verizon aimed at developing Guided Selling Gadget, in order to enable Verizon Small and Medium Business Portal to enhance offer optimization through the utilization of business rules and product recommendation capabilities of the Guided Selling Gadget for sales and campaign improvements. "
good,"Job culture was a soul-sucking, cubicle farm, nightmare. Management is out of touch and old-school. You're expected to work 24/7 and are only recognized when you go exceed insane expectations and goals. Benefits and compensation were decent (Sales)."
good,"taking calls to assist wireless phone customers is resolving device issues. I learned that no matter how small an issue is in the scope of what could be wrong, the matter is of great importance to the customer and needs to be resolved. management in most cases , co-workers felt needed more training.  co-workers were just trying to make it through another day due to the feeling of lack of support. there was at least to me no hard part to the job."
good,Great opportunities to make money if you put in max effort. Poor Management and only way to be promoted is to know someone.
good,It requires long hours that reward you based on ability and willingness to apply yourself.  The job is demanding and requires an enormous amount of personal fortitude.
good,This is another review for Verizon. Great place to hone yor communications skills.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,come in for moring meeting and then handling sales. i learned teamwork as we as how to sell our products and services. my co workers were great. managament was not good at all.
good,not much structure to day to day for government accounts team. Management lacks direction. Large turn over ratio has lead to a weak team structure and support.
good,Recruiment hiring targets have increased for the year. No additional comments.
good,"Too much regional feeling and no fair promotions. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers! Listening and resolving their issues, from technical problems, activations of phones, broadband cards, SIM cards, modems, etc. Also, on swing shift after a certain time, besides technical support the job converted over to customer service for accounts.  Had to maintain confidentiality for business, and government accounts. Also, enjoyed most of the training.  Most was educational with all the new products and technology changing or coming out."
good,"Nice place to work, but retail hours made for a bad work life balance"
good,"In a days work I would talk to small to mid sized business owners that switched off of the Verizon network and win their business back for there telephones, internet and television services. I had sharpened my communication skills I had been trained on from my previous job working door too door sales. The hardest part was the workspace was in a call center with no face to face interaction. Because it was all done over the phone. I most enjoyed the people in my work space!"
good,"Exceptional benefits, however union based environment does not care/cater to employees health and needs. The daily routine of answering customer assistance calls is repetative. schedules include split shifts which make a employee work four hour splits with four hours in between"
good,"Excellent place to sharpen sales skills, flexible schedule."
good,"Able to connect with people around the world."
good,You will deal with different things each day. You will learn a lot from this job.
good,"Worked hands on with production, media planning agency and the client. Great experience."
good,"We open at 10a and closed 6pm Tues.-Sat. We sold Fios. My office was a good place to work. My co-workers and my boss were terrific. A typical work day consisted of helping people with billing issues helping with bill pay machine. We did new connects and disconnects. We also distributed and accepted fios equipment. We'd assist customers by phone and trouble shooting orders that didn't flow through system. My boss was the best, very knowledgable,"
good,"The owner was way to involved in the day to day operations. He need to let his sales reps do the sales, instead he would jump in the middle of one and ruin the whole thing. We where hired to do the selling he just could not trust the employees that he hired to the work. That is why his company is now going under,"
good,"Provided assistance to callers requesting telephone listings; and inquiries for driving directions, movies, restaurants, weather and sports. Typical day at work: finding mostly phone numbers & listings for cellular phone users. Management is an Ok bunch, but not very empowered from upper management above them. Co-workers, a motley crew, great to be around. Hardest part of the job: changes that come from the decision makers whom never took a call or have forgotten. Most enjoyable: Location of worksite, co-workers, working with the automated systems & the national directory programs."
good,"A great place to work, however the politics or bureaucracy is what brings the company down."
good,"Verizon gives good benefits and pay and you will work for it. High level of accountability, stress, and expectations that push you to the brink. Be ready for what you sign up for"
good,"If you stuck around long enough to learn the job and manage to make a few sales then management generally would leave you to your work.  That being said, too many customers were being sold phones which were far beyond their ability to comprehend the use of and the authorized seller vs corproate store argument was constant."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"monitored everyday but mgmt. listening in to conversation with customer's. Had to stay on line with customer's until you had ""closed time"" - which sometimes would be only 30 minutes a day. This time needed to call back customer's, other depts., implement orders into system."
good,"A typical work day included opening the store, reviewing quotas and progress towards different attainment values, assisting customers with any and all inquiries, inventory management, and closing the store.  I learned a lot about the sales process and how to treat customers for good referrals and customer retention.  Discovering customer needs is very important to ones success in sales.  Discovery is questionable the most important part of the sales process in order to maximize on each sale.  You never want to be an order taker in a sales position.  I strive to uncover hidden needs in order to recommend the products and services the customer didn't know they could use and create value for that customer.  The hardest parts of the job are surely the pressure on quotas (job security) and handling customer escalations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was exceeding quotas, hitting multipliers on commissions, and having loyal, satisfied customers.  Despite the struggles of the job I have always tried to make the best of a bad day and enjoy the company of co-workers and customers."
good,"Sale, Sale, Sale. That's what ended up being my only responsibility that mattered at Verizon Wireless."
good,Verizon is an okay place for someone to work. Quotas are excessive and they always allow overtime.
good,"They say once you have worked at one call center you have worked at them all, Not with this one. Things are constantly changing, just when you think you have learned a system they change it on you. It did get frustrating at times but it also kept things interesting."
good,"The leader in wireless technology"
good,"Maintained Sales Goals every month and increased sales goals by 75%-100%"
good,"Great benefits.  Management in flux, poor culture for customer service."
good,"Able to work from home is a huge plus. Ageism is an issue."
good,"coaching and managing a sales team to hit quotas for mobility"
good,"I would have enjoyed the company if I was given additional training to enhance my skills.  I was initially hired to handle customer service calls but, I ended up also taking calls about tier 1 tech support.  I don't have a problem with helping the customers but; at least, compensate me properly."
good,"Working for this company was okay, alot of hours and stress if dont hit the quotas. Good money."
good,Was a great stepping stone into the retail/sales world.   I enjoyed working in the cellular industry but found another avenue to pursue.
good,The job was fun and exciting. There was never a dull moment. My co-workers were great.
good,A typical day at work was very fast paced from the time that you clocked in.  This job has taught me how to have compassion for others.  The hardest part of the job was not to get emotionally beat down.
good,"In this job one will perform opening and closing procedures, drive sales by motivating and influencing sales representatives. One will hold sales representatives accountable when they do not perform. One will learn how systems work for selling and account maintenance. One will learn how to lead diverse teams. The hardest part is the work/life balance and leaving work at the office. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits and compensation."
good,My experience includes managing a portfolio of accounts receivable which includes credit approval and collections.  I am experienced in managing assigned portfolios with a good sense of maintaining a high quality of accounts receivable while maximizing working capital and minimizing risk and bad debts.  I understand the importance of the Sarbanes-Oxley requirements and how it relates to financial reporting.
good,Not someplace I ever thought I would want to leave. Has become a much less desirable place to work over the past few years.
good,"You are expected to be on phones all day, very little offline time. You have to do things their way or you will be on the highway. I think Verizon Wireless is a great company but I was not satisfied with the work environment/ ethic they created. Management was poor and only cared to look out for and save themselves rather than have your back and defend you, with the exception of less than a handful. The shifts you have to work were not suitable to maintain a work/ life balance. I have two kids and rarely ever got to see them except for my two off days, they always offer overtime which helps make up for the low yearly salary capped at $25,000 plus commission."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"As soon as I sit down, it lights, camera, action."
good,"-I would take peoples cable away if they haven't paid their bill. I would be able to sell cable packages to people as well."
good,The hardest part of your day will be dealing with verbally abusive customers
good,"When I started there, the company culture was:  ""We don't care about what you've accomplished any place else, we only care about what you do at Verizon."".  To me, that was the height of arrogance because the Verizon way of doing things wasn't/isn't necessarily the best way of doing things.  That and it really sent the message to their employees that our past experiences and knowledge wasn't valuable to Verizon.  So to me that meant that I would be stuck in the position that I was hired for and although I only took the position as a foot in the door because I had applied for other positions that I was better suited for but I was never able to get a response from Verizon.  Suffice it to say, because I don't play politics, I've been stuck in this entry level position and although I am considered a ""leader"" in my segment of the company, because of Verizon's arrogance, I've lost skills that could have really benefitted the company."
good,Pretty fast paced depending on your location. Coworkers tend to take your sales. Management did not work well with you. Basically don't work for a retailer.
good,"Excellent benefits"
good,High stress level and turn around. Co-workers were like family.  Excellent benefits.
good,As a independent contractor for Verizon Wireless there was a lot of freedom to choose your work schedule and  flexibility. The most challenging part of an independent contractor for Verizon is that you are financially responsible for all returns and disconnected accounts. Many times this brought a challenge with commission. The best part was dealing constantly with customers and servicing companies with service.
good,VZ is a corporate machine. Upper management became disconnected with front line management & employees. Culture changed and became impersonal.
good,Great pay performance based. You have to work smart to fully max out. 
good,Analyze customer accounts in order to sell ALL available products and service
good,"A typical day consist of taking inbound calls regarding technical support issues for wireless devices."
good,success is what you make it there.You have to work hard to achieve what you want.
good,Great company to work for with plenty of options for overtime and hard work!
good,Spent 13 years at Verizon Communications.  A rewarding experience with constant changes and new technologies being added everyday.  
good,I hate to be negative but the organization still operates on the legacy of unionized phone company. The union mentality is just keeping this organization from going anywhere. If it wasn't for its network (wireless which isn't unionized by the way) Verizon would've folded long time ago. 
good,"Working at Verizon was a good experience in sales and customer service.  It teaches you the motivating factors of decision making and will help any young professional begin their career.  However the upside is fairly low, moving up in a franchise location is easy but there is a low ceiling on earnings and moving beyond a store management level."
good,"Worked at Verizon for 5+ years and it was great. The first 3 years were wonderful, great place to work, great compensation, and the feeling of the company was optimistic. But in the last 6 months that has all changed drastically. Management is all brainwashed by upper management, and care not of the front line employees. Advancement opportunities are dwindling as stores are closing. Most importantly the atmosphere has gone away from customers and employees first, to what are you going to do to make the company a buck. It is unfortunate to see this change in a company that I did greatly enjoy. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"We got after it when selling cell phones on a daily basis. Verizon is not that big in the area, so we had to push for the market share in the area to grow it. "
good,"The company benefits are good, and the pay is decent for a call center.(this is my first) "
good,"never a typical  day exciting moments everyday."
good,"This job began as a great job.  It was the customer care position for Verizon Wireless.  Inbound and Outbound calls concerning their service.  Included payments, technical questions, billing, product information.  The project was outsource and changed their pay from a great stable pay system to activity based compensation where we were paid per call which became a problem especially on a slow day where you didn't take may calls."
good,The job was very challenging and stressful. The challenging part was the most exciting part of the job but with the ever changing economy came the stress with outsourcing and cost cutting taking place.
good,"Limited inventory caused low sales. When working off of commission, and a family to take care of, this company is not for you!"
good,"Great benefits, but horrible managers and HR group. Often not kept busy, had to fake it to look busy although there wasn't enough work. You are low on the totem pole, don't expect to advance, as nothing is done to assist you."
good,"In my five years at Verizon Wireless, I worked in both customer service and sales. My first year was the most enjoyable. I worked with a group of colorful and energetic customer service reps and had a management team that pushed us all hard to acheive our personal and professional goals. My last four years I spent working with a team divided by those I would trust with my life, and those that I questioned everything they did. The company changed focus so many times that it was hard to keep up with their demands, let alone understand thier intentions and expectations. I am still a customer of Verizon Wireless, even after my departure, but every so often I am reminded of their desire to make a number before their desire to make satisfied workers and customers."
good,"I Left this company to gain employment with att, was told that i was being promoted to being a store manager and ended up working at a kiosk inside the now defunct circuit city in garden city, many positions were split into two different employees each getting half of one said employees salary."
good,Apply here if you want to be stressed out....and want to become depressed...you work terrible hours ....for example...wensday-sunday from 2:30pm-11:30pm with a mon and tuesday off...kiss your social life and family time goodbye. Management is phony and unprofessional...they care nothing about you...you will be stressed everyday to the point of no return with all the pressure they put on you to maintain perfect surveys and manage call work...etc.etc...a bunch of stress. The pay is decent and you may be able to move up if you kiss the right people azz and wait about
good,"Coworkers are awesome, management is skewed. Example, there are 7 people on my team, and 5 supervisor/managers. We are needled to death and get nothing done reporting to all those people! The tools we are given to use are not integrated so we have up to 20 different software suits and storage locations to use to troubleshoot one error.The job is high stress."
good,"Expect to work hard and expect high expectations from managers. As a call center representative, expect to deal with all types of customers from different walks of life. Don't take anything personal. You will experience irate customers who are rude and unpleasant. Always remain professional. Verizon wireless does have great benefit and education assistance programs."
good,"There is always something to do at VZW. As a sales manager, your day normally starts anywhere from 6:30am to 8am, depending on what time the prior days sales performance numbers populate. You spend the majority of your morning communicating the results to your team, peers, and upper management, and the effect those numbers have on you that particular day, the rest of the week, and month, etc. You then carve out your gameplan with your management staff, and try to relay that info to your team as quickly as possible. You are then constantly sending updates to both your team and upper management, covering hourly stats, celebrating victories, and coaching to gaps and behaviors. Some team members accept coaching better than others, and depending your staffing for a particular day, you may need to spend more time interacting with employees than customers, or upper management more than employees. Once your store is closed, you send your closing numbers to your DM and depending on the day, may spend anywhere from 30-90 minutes talking about what you need to improve on. The most difficult part of being a sales manager with VZW is the attempt to balance work and home. Just because you have put in a 10-12 hour day, does not mean your day is over. Leadership (upper management) expects you to be available 24/7/365. It can become extremely stressful, not just on the employee, but on their immediate family members as well. The pressure to always ""get 1 more sale"" never ends. Industry standards change constantly, and you feel like if you have one bad day, the whole world around you will come"
good,"You have to be in the right click at the right time, more attention paid to power plays then to employees. quality sometimes took a back seat to being first on the block with a product. which in the long run hurts customers"
good,Healthy competitive working is appreciated. Helpful and hard working team.
good,"Always very busy and new challenges daily. Loved this as my days seemed to go by fast. I learned so much from Verizon as I started when it was MCI owned and spent 16 years of my work life there. Met great people / co-workers that I still maintain a friendship with outside of the company. The hardest part of my job was not knowing what kind of day was ahead of me and the challenges that I would face. However, I would have to say that was the best part as well I learned something completely different new each and everyday."
good,"A typical day at work requires an enourmous amount of risk management. I have learned that any system or operational change are only as good as the processess in place. Verizon has a lot of complexities related to the merger of several telecom companies. Verizon has aggressively downsized over the past several years and promotes outsourcing oversees to in Supply Chain Services. There are some good qualities mostly related to the workforce that remains. There is not a lot of people in the workforce who are just collecting paychecks. This company has downsized over the past several years and there are only the best of the best remaining in the workforce. Unfortunately, they are doing the work of more than one person and quality of life suffers."
good,Many merger and acquisition transitions still occurring resulting in reductions 4 times yearly.
good,Worked with DOD and Civilian Agencies in 4 states on the West Coast. Proposed highly technical networks and strategic solutions. Learned how to negotiate and sell on GSA contracts and other government contracts for procurement of VZ services and solutions the Federal Government. This group had many experienced sales engineers and contract employees to assist with getting things done. The hardest part was they had the wrong higher management in place and we were going thru the fall out of 911. Upper management was not experienced enough to know how to handle many things that were impacted by this situation. I really loved working with the Marine Bases. They were truly a great bunch of folks.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"My experiences based on current employment with Verizon Wireless have been positive to say the least. A lot of it depends on management, and location, which for me, now, are a concern. New store location with very little to next-to-nothing traffic, equals low morale, and no potential to generate new business with foot traffic."
good,"Job is fine, pay is low, benefits are good, management fails to avoid recurring layoffs, no growth opportunities."
good,"Verizon is always changing policies and ways to sell, but are never consistent with their own rules. They focus hard on one or two things and after you are getting used to them they change it up and make the things you were working on obsolete."
good,"non-stop 10 to 12 hours a day, as a manager I learned alot about working with people, employees and customers. Hardest part, dealing with a unionized workforce, but that also was the most enjoyable at times. Working with my direct reports and customers was the most rewarding part of the job. Most difficult, working with upper management. Always a battle over daily results, with very little tools or support provided. Most enjoyable, providing support to my fellow mangers, at my level and above."
good,Productive and fun place
good,It's an ok working place. But stressful especially being on the phones 8 hours or more a day with surveys.
good,Work days consisted of a fast pace sales day. Trying to get appointments with existing revenue accounts and develop new business. selling print and internet products was a great challenge. Training on a regular basis to keep reps up to speed on intewrnet products. The hardest part of the job was to maintain print revenue and create new business to cover lost business. I enjoyed sales and the challenges it presented.
good,"A typical day at work is fine when dealing with the customers. There is constant training that keep us current with the competitor as well as updating us with ""National"" information regarding processes put in place to assist with improving the business. Management and my co-workers are engaged in there day to day activity. Currentll, the most difficult part of the job is inconsistancy and broken process which can cause the demise of the department. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work witha diverse group of co-workers as well as assisting my customers with any problems that have not been resolved as well as to provide them with a customer service experience that changes the views of us as a company."
good,"Employment with Moorehead Communications started off as a decent employer but after the honeymoon stage the reality set in that day to day activities became repetitive with no want to grow or increase sales, corporate sent out ways to increase revenue but none of it was implemented due to lack of communication between employees and the different stages of management. I had some great experiences with some of my co-workers while some of the in store management I didn't agree with, but I have to admit the interactions day to day with the customers had to be my favorite part of being employed there."
good,Verizon was the first job coming out of college. Overall a good learning experience and went through the GTE Bell Atlantic merger which was also good experience.
good,"The team you work with is great. They make it worth all the angry customers and managers that don't know that they are doing. There is a lot of selling and quotas that have to be met. Overall the company is good to work for, however due to management working in the store down here isn't what it should be."
good,unrealistic expectations set by disconnected leadership
good,Contracting for Verizon was interesting. Many times as a contractor one feels as a pair of hands. Not interested in difference makers. Just seem to want the job done. But a dynamic work environment change was daily and challenging.
good,Having the ability to help customer everyday was the best part of the job.
good,the work place was ok at times. My typical job duties were to answer phones in the repair call center and handles our customers problems with their home telephone service. It did get challenging at times and you have to have the right mind set to deal with irate customers which is what I have.
good,"Needs new leadership team, management needs more training."
good,"I worked for Verizon Wireless for a little over 3 years. I was hired for an Apprentice program, which sounded very promising in the interview/by the recruiter. I worked all three years in the Retail channel. I started out as a customer Service Rep (for about 10 months, then moved to a Sales Rep (for about 10 months), an Assistant Store Manager (for about 1.5 years). The pay and benefits are better than most jobs out there, considering that you can start with little, to no experience and do not have to have a degree (although they do prefer it now). There is the usual grind of working in retail, late nights, early mornings (most of which are back to back shifts), and of course the holiday season. Verizon does promote very quickly if you are amongst the top performers in your region. Commission structure is very lucrative and gives the opportunity to make some serious cash. The recruiters/HR will tell you that there is every opportunity to apply to other channels or transfer, because Verizon is such a big company and has so many types of jobs. However, when it comes down to it, it is who you know, not what you know. HR works very closely with the Retail Store Managers and Retail District Managers (who never want to give employees up, because retail has such a high turnover) so it makes it difficult to get out of the Retail channel once you're in it, especially after getting used to the money."
good,"Although the benefits and pay at the time were very good, the micromanagement gave me ulcers very literally. I was 5 seconds too slow on my call times and even though I had one of best customer service records they still threatened to fire me. I had to end up quitting because of the health issues mentioned above."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Fast paced, stressful. upper management does stay in contact with lower management. The hardest part of the job is not having the support or security that one would expect."
good,"• Highly organized (multi-tasking, project/workforce management)"
good,It wasn't the best place to work. You have to listen to people scream at you all day long.
good,Work is constant and sometime overwhelming depending on the position.
good,Constantly struggling to meet unattainable goals and expectations.
good,Company has changed alot over the years and believe they have lost their way.
good,"The benefits are excellent. Hours really did not work for me. (Single mom, working 2:30-11:30 off on Tuesday and Wednesday.) Tried to get assistance from different members of management, to no avail. Ended up resigning. There are opportunities for advancement after you've been there for a year and your numbers prove you are a good employee. Verizon Wireless could be such a good place, but I feel they could work with employees a little better. Great co-workers (for the most part.) I did work in customer service before Verizon Wireless, but not in the same capacity. Never in a call center. I didn't really know what a call center was. I felt deceived once I actually began working there."
good,Working for Verizon was not and enjoyable experience. Verizon required many additional training class which is fine to futher your education and knowledge in the Verizon enviroment. However you were also required to do your regular job. I feel Verizon did not have their customers best interest when making decisions about customer service.
good,Here I learned how to manage large groups of people of all ages and walks of life.
good,"The benefits and compensation are good, however, the schedule is never consistent, the customers can be abrasive, and management is required to punish employees if a customer gives a survey rating of anything less than a 10 or 9 from a 1 to 10 rating. Even if it is for something beyond the employees control. The management style is not one that promotes positivity."
good,-Good benefits/salary.Stress filled
good,"compensation is okay but i work for an indirect agent and its straight garbage, i am and have been the top producer in the company and the security is not their, its very biased, and havent seen anybody make advancement towards management"
good,Multiple acquisitions have taken the fun out of the workplace
good,"At typical day involves answering 46-56 calls per day. I have learned how business run from an office perspective. Management is very inconsistent, my co-worker are people whom are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is answering to irrate customers. I enjoy solving someone's issue preventing escalated situations."
good,"As a Stability Manager, My Team was responsible for determining and documenting root cause of any Enterprise Systems down times, tracking application availability and performance over time and implementing preventative measures."
good,"Working in a retail environment as a tech support/ Customer Service Representative consists of a multitude of tasks. Generally, however, I am responsible for customer-account maintenance troubleshooting smart-phones, internet devices and laptops. I have an excellent managing staff, I attribute a large part of my personal growth to their leadership. I have an excellent relationship with with my co-workers and genuinely enjoy working with them. I have developed a myriad of technical and professional skills during the time I've been employed by Verizon. I find the most difficult part of the position is the growing need to educate people about recent technologies. The most enjoyable aspect of my role is the ability to interact face to face with new people through out the day."
good,"A descent company to work for, with great benefits and a very diversified work force."
good,"Verizon provides a great service its main problems are the management style and higher management belief. The people who run the company aren't interested in service or customers anymore, this attitude has a direct affect on the associates who normally do have an interest in both, the over all morale has dropped to many employees are apathetic and the customer pays the ultimate price."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"If you are looking to work in sales, the base salary is ok however you can make very good money considering commission."
good,"competitive quota based sales job, with retail schedule. Fast paced environment that includes nights, weekends and holidays."
good,The company had great benefit package and the pay was good and my coworkers were great to work with.
good,"Verizon is a potentially perfect place to work. Their overall compensation package is wonderful and the nature of the work is interesting and ever-changing. This is, however, my first experience with a union shop and, well, the jury is out for me on pros and cons here. Not sure how it is in other places but it makes for a constantly strenuous relationship between corporate and union members and the dynamic is so adversarial that it really outshines all the good that comes with working at the company. Very unfortunate situation."
good,"I have only worked for this company for a year. I like the job, but it can be stressful. Goals are set high and they are hard to achieve. Managers arent very helpful and feel as though they have earned the right to be condescending."
good,"The majority of the people in every department I worked in and with hated their job, but loved the money, so they didn't leave."
good,"When I started working for Verizon I found the job somewhat tedious but the overall package was worth the repetition. However as Verizon's business model changed so did the job, and not for the better."
good,"Verizon was a great opportunity to network, build relationships, and gain advanced skillsets. Originally there were great opportunity for advancement."
good,"Verizon Wireless has great pay and benefits such as health, dental, vision insurance as well as 401 K however its a fast paced environment. Everything is number's driven and can be very stressful."
good,Verizon can be an ok Company to work for. It depends on the DEPARTMENT you work in...the department I was in is very stressful. Management was not the greatest.. you always had to watch what was going on around you.  85% of the time you could not trust Management.  You always had to document what was going around you.
good,"Verizon  is a great place to work."
good,Verizon is definitely a corporate environment that attempts to make the environment fun. It is hard to get people to ignore the reality that it is all about the numbers and everyone is in their section of the cubicle tied to a telephone all day.
good,Difficult to find growth opportunities that are not considered part of your current role/salary. 'Stay in your lane' type managment with no incentive to grow beyond role (meaning no equitable salary bumps for work product).
good,"Verizon is extremely focused toward a customer driven company. "
good,"typical day at work, if working under pressure isnt for you then dont apply. Management is not the best. Almost no consideration for scheduling, it is what it is"
good,"The company has very competitive pay. There is room for growth, as it is a very large company. The culture can be challenging, especially in the divisions where there is union representation."
good,"Contractors are indispensable, temp to perm they say, after years they will keep saying that. Management will say ""Due to the headcount, etc etc"" a lot of excuses. They rather spend more money to hire new people and re-train them than keep existing talent. Very much a backward walk considering their new move to a more ""inclusive"" Verizon. Managers have no idea how to manage their employees."
good,"Will I work in retail ever again? Nope after 20 years in retail I am done forever. Although Verizon was a good company to work for, employees always were on edge about keeping their jobs. Constant job cuts and layoffs."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Lots of pressure working sales and very unethical things can occur. Management often pressures you into doing certain things for the sake of a sales metric.
good,"The only constant is change.  Accounts, quotas, territories, and management expectations can all change month to month.  You must thrive under pressure to enjoy a job in business sales at Verizon."
good,"My experience at Cellularsales Verizon was decent. The duration of my employment was effected when the stores volume continued to suffer. Sales goals began to get further out of reach and almost unrealistic. I personal believe that at a corporate location maintaining high numbers across the board are would of never been an issue, plus management was poor at the time."
good,When I worked there the potential to make really good money was there if you worked hard and pushed yourself to not except no add an answer. They gave since laid off many employees and the commission structure is much more difficult to make good money.
good,Stressful Call Center Environment. Too much of a workload taking calls from different departments. Unrealistic expectations on sales and retention. People would leave in an ambulance due to the stress
good,"Great benefits, tuition assistance, bonuses and fun meetings. Employees have great perks and vacations options. The goals were unrealistic and those that were promoted typically did unethical practices to meet goals."
good,"Corporate mergers and acquisitions changed the management styles.  Corporate culture has taken over, was more like a “family” when it was Nynex.  Micromanaging has ruined the associate/management relationships."
good,Worked in an area that required Agile transformation to align the group with the company's overall strategy and development structure. The group was diverse and challenging but we were successful in achieving our goals.
good,"Being a customer service representative at Verizon requires requires a lot of knowledge and flexibility.  Always expect the unexpected.  Each day is a challenge and you definitely learn something new every day,  if not every call."
good,working for Verizon is not bad...its not really a bad job...its a good job but no one should be there longer then 3-4 years...you dont really get to learn much things just remain the same. day in and day out...your job really doesnt shift...or adapt...you just work with the machine known as Verizon.
good,The job task was very easy once I got used to it. Downside of the job was the management and tough customers that will scream at you until they get what they want.  The call center had a lot of lawsuits against it due to neglecting to pay employees for all of their time.
good,"Great place to work if you do not live too far away.The commute can be a hassle but overall it's a good place to work. The benefits are excellent and the paid time off is more than fair . There is a lot of opportunity for growth in Verizon and at a quick rate , depending upon one's individual progress."
good,Very fast paced with deadlines to install equipment. Cutting wedge technologies for you to learn. There is never a dull moment. If you like to be constantly learning and busy this is the place for you.
good,Very stressful environment! Low pay and mandatory overtime. Also the shifts were not that great . Happy to find new employment! That was not enough money.
good,"Difficult place to work because of the business/management structure put pressure on you to deliver value daily. Job culture was poor because there was a lot of contractors who usually did not stay around very long. Lots of collaboration was required because of teams also being based offshore in India. This meant more time on phones.Not a lot of team activities or team building. We were supported do training for growth, but were not given time"
good,Repetitive work and no room for advancement.  Preferred to focus on general ledger accounting rather than invoice validation.  Upper management was poor.
good,It was fine as a student but hard as a career because location matters significantly. The commission is better if you aren't working for a third party Verizon as well
good,"I enjoyed my time here, it was a decent place to work. Just a lot of standing and I had some issues with my health at that time. they were not willing to accommodate at all."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work for benefits and condensation. Hard place to work for work/home life balance. Sales goals have increased into outrageous amounts over the years, hard to make good money."
good,Verizon has slowly slipped further and further away from its employees and morale is at an all time low.  Agile did not remove silos because the people in these organizations didn't allow them to be removed.  When more people are willing to change then things will improve for Verizon.
good,"Verizon is a fast paced company that is always changing. Unfortunately, they have begun to outsource many jobs which made culture difficult to work in and you always have to worry about job security. Advancement has become almost impossible."
good,"Verizon was constantly ""right-sizing"" and selling off departments. Instead of hiring someone else to take over the work of the other people, it is dumped on those left behind. Soon there is too much work and between conference calls and changing priorities, there is no time to do the work. If you are a hard worker, be prepared to take up the slack of other team members with little to no recognition. And if the union goes on strike, be prepared to relocate for an indeterminate time to work 12 hour days, 6 days a week.  Money is good on those assignments though..."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is the benefits and salary. There isn’t much work life balance, you’re stuck on a set schedule every 6 months, customers are spoiled, not much morale in the center. They also made it seem like it was a lot of room for advancement in training. Only 1 or 2 people I know from my training group have moved on to another position. I am currently seeking other employment with a flexible schedule that will allow me to go back to school since they won’t let you alter your schedule."
good,"Upon joining the company they sold themselves well, but when I arrived I learned that veteran sales reps were looking for a way out. Saturation of products and services forced the company to tighten the commission structure, which continued aggressively while I was there. Each year I found myself working harder to make less. This eventually forced me to accept a salaried position that was ultimately doomed. As with countless positions there before mine, the job was eliminated in cost cutting measures and my responsibilities were  forced upon those who received no extra compensation for them. The sales job is demanding and erratic. Many hours of the day are dead slow, then change to unbearably fast. For all the work you do, no commission is guaranteed or may not even amount to anything."
good,"The workplace culture changed over the years in Finance.  The best advice is to focus on your own career development and be willing to move on when the environment no longer serves you.  It's a large company, so you tend to be just a number."
good,"large organization with personnel world wide.  Primary locations for IT are in NJ and Dallas, which is where senior IT leadership is based.  If yo want to advance in IT leadership Dallas would be best location"
good,The center  closed after 11 years. Company  downsize.   Limited options for employees once company  decided  to close  that location.   I do not have anymore information about this I can state in writing per my agreement with said company.
good,This position is a sales position and you are expected to meet daily goals selling fios. The system used to do the job is not functional and it actually makes your job much harder. if you love a great pay and don't really care about the job then this is the place for you. The salary is extremely high and your will get some joy out of that.
good,"On balance a very good 8 years from 2000 thru 2007.  I learned a great deal from upper leadership - Directors, Senior Directors and VP's.  The last 3 years under the final manager was regrettably about 2.5 years too long."
good,"typical retail job, can be hard if you want to have time for family and events. overtime is to get but can burn you out, raising quota to make sure payouts aren't large or consistent can be frustrating"
good,A typical day at work comprised of leading my project calls and continuous follow up of open tasks. I learned that you can never be to prepared and should always plan for risks through the life of a project. My management was very supportive and were hands off unless we required assistance. The Workplace culture was positive Most of our team worked remotely across the country. We held monthly staff meetings via WebEx to allow us to see each other and engage each other as if we were in the same conference room. The hardest part of the job was lack of job security. One never knew from month to month if their job was in jeopardy. The best part of the job was working with different external customers and implementing new solutions. Each project was different but one had a sense of satisfaction delivering what the customer ordered.
good,"I learned a lot working there. Friends that still work there say it is a nightmare now, however. People are in positions that they are not qualified for so others are completely overworked and constantly stressed."
good,Great benefits and competitive pay.  Be prepared to work hard under stress.  Dealing with the customers is the easy part however even if you’re a top sales rep you are constantly criticizing and told you should’ve sold them more which is discouraging. Sometimes speaking freely about ways to improve processes is frowned upon and will put a target on your back.  If starting in sales it’s best to find another opportunity within the company when eligible to see the full benefits Verizon offers.
good,Good benefits. Decent pay. Environment is extremely stressful and unnaturally competitive. The supervisors and managers call out and take 'stress leave' from the place as much if not more than the call reps on the floor. No signficant resolution to complaints to human resources about all forms of harassment. It's all about the numbers.
good,"I have worked for the company for six years and feel like I have not progressed any. Its not that I have not tried, but there are a lot of politics to getting positions within the business side of the company. This is the first company I have worked for where my skills, meeting and or exceeding company metrics has not afforded me advancement opportunities. The benefits are great."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Data entry with making land lines phone work.  Advancement was a little hard to get.  Did trouble shooting for techs and T2's and T3's.  Mostly Monday-Friday, some Saturdays, schedule was any where from 6am-Midnight."
good,It was alright but I feel like just about any sales job there's alot of people that stretch the truth to get a sale and I didn't really like that. The people I worked with were pretty cool and I like them.
good,"You want money or more money your going to have to work for it. I drive a hour to work if there is no traffic, 95 at any given day can be crazy and slow your day down. Get to work check on the team, make sure the store is clean, make sure the team know the selling guide and all inventory is checked in. The front of the store is clean for customers coming in. Culture make sure employees seem happy and ready to work for the day, start helping people, do some calls back if there is down town. Help reps that are doing poorly with numbers for the month. Close store"
good,Not much room for advancement in the company. They have been downsizing for the past few years. Depending on which department you work in the company will determine the culture.
good,VZW is directed to online sales . Verizon is laying off and closing stores very fast and handing it over to auth. retailers to take over retail. Not hiring for retail anymore.
good,"I stood all day at work, stressful to obtain quota and lead unteachable employees. Upper management wasn't fair and work life balance was sub par. It was hard to move up."
good,Onsite Gym is the only thing I miss after leaving the company. The gyms has great instructors and it is included with low membership fee. Gym shower is clean with heated water.
good,"If I knew half of what I know now, I probably wouldn't have taken the job. This job is not for me at all. The schedules is my biggest issue. Also the rude customers and how we go about handling them. Let's not mention the way they go about putting you on teams makes no sense. Imagine out of a 5 day week, only working 2 business days with your supervisor. Makes no sense right? And reaching out to other supervisors isn't a guarantee, so get used to every man for themselves a few days out the week. EVERYTHING is number driven : the amount of calls you take, upgrades, lines you discount, surveys, revenue per call etc. You can bust your butt and perform well but the fact that more than half of the center has been there their entire life you will get a creepy schedule. Prepare to altar your ENTIRE life to be at work. Let's not mention the nasty customers you deal with on a regular basis. You'll get called everything in the book, some may not want to talk to you based on your ethnicity and more. And keep in mind ""the customer is always right"", is something Verizon will say. The customers are beyond spoiled and they get what they want, so you get walked all over. The money is not worth the stress to me at all. I deal with stress and anxiety and I didn't have either issue prior to taking this job. I am truly unhappy working at Verizon and the only thing keeping me is the fact that I have something to pay my bills and offer benefits. Just put a lot into consideration because your nights and weekends will be ripped away with this job!"
good,"A typical day consists of a rotation that includes greeting customers at the door, showing customers around the store, discovering customer needs, recommending products and services, and encouraging the decision to buy today."
good,Not a good culture . Very scripted. Few were happy. Pay was very good. Insurance was also good. Management didn’t care much about employees. Hours were not good
good,"Great pay & benefits, no work life balance."
good,"My day includes finding a cubical with a chair, speaking to customers regarding there wireless and landline accounts. I learned a lot about other companies comparing theme to ours and trying to assist customers with making the right decision for them and there family. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep irate customers calm and happy. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I helped my customers make the right decision and keeping them Verizon customers."
good,"Verizon upper management only cares about profit at the expense of their employees and customers. While a public company, any blatant abuses are addressed, the company suffers from a culture of greed and cronyism."
good,"It was a fun easy job, you could go get lunch and wasn't on the clock.  There was no traffic in clinton and hard to sell on 100% commission without scrubbing old accounts."
good,"Lot of new technologies to work with , but lack of work life balance."
good,"Verizon was a good place to work, day to day and year year is always changing so you have to adjust. There is training and support but not much room for career advancement unless you are willing to relocate."
good,"Overall, a good company, yet, moves very slow. A lot of levels of hierarchy in order to make a decision. The people are nice and overall the culture is positive when an employee skills meet the immediate and future needs of the company."
good,"Working for Verizon Wirless in Account Management for the most part was a thankless job.  The company itself is pretty decent, however, there is some work that is needed on the culture.  As much as they proclaim work/life balance, it is not truly a consideration.  Hiring practices among management could use improvement.  I found that much of the hiring was done for internal political reasons rather than based off capability."
good,Benefits were great! The most enjoyable time was interacting with my customers. I would have to say metrics were unattainable and unfair. Quality does not mean quantity.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The people are great, management is a different story. It's definitely a culture of how is liked versus actual skill for advancement. If you don't mind kissing up, and being a ""yes man/woman"" you will do well. Benefits are the best I've had, but have declined year over year. Schedules don't lend to a healthy work/life balance."
good,There is no job security.  The company has been going through staff reductions since I started the position.  I was fortunate to survive after each cut.
good,"Verizon Wireless really cares about the bottom dollar more than their employees. You can learn how to sell which is beneficial for every job but don't expect long-term. The atmosphere can be very good, but requires a very high pace atmosphere and a constant adjustment to new promotions. if you like a job that commits to mostly sales over everything else and you have a high work ethic this will be the perfect fit for you. If you are not very good at sales and you do not have a student mentality this will not be a good fit for you."
good,"Work in different department, while I was there.  Coworkers were nice. Was able to cross train in different dept. Great team leaders, willing to train you."
good,Verizon is good for the young who are just out of school . but once you have tenure and you start making good money they will look to replace you with younger at a third of your salary. You'll never retire from there... All about returning the value to the stock holders
good,"Numbers driven company, offers great benefits but has little understanding or concern when life can sometimes get in the way. Results 100% buy freedom"
good,"Generally speaking, it's some of the brightest minds in the industry fighting some of the worst designs in recent memory. Things have been slowly degrading in the process as employees take on more and more responsibilities as the population is cut quarterly. Quantity is quickly outstripping quality in value and it's a slippery slope to the bottom from there."
good,"Poor upper level management, no direction, just go figure it out. Very broad based statements with no clear direction."
good,"Fast paced environment with challenging job requirements. Enjoyed my time there, until difficult and unethical decisions were asked to be made. Then i had to resign"
good,"Earlier it used to be a good company and people thought it might be retirement job. But things got real bad after December 2017, with wrong management decisions. Joining Verizon should be the last option."
good,"This is not fair, I should I not have to rate or discuss proprietary information about a former employer for any reason and the fact I'm being cornered into doing this will lead to my termination of your service."
good,My biggest complaint is increasing quotas and decreasing commission pay outs. The stress level and time off are not balanced. The pay is decent but your life will revolve around Verizon
good,Customers always calling in yelling and cursing at Verizon products. Rated performance is based on whether a customer disconnects account or how often the customer calls in
good,"great company, very good environment where you can grow career and skill set . They also offer a great work life balance for families,"
good,"Very good importunity where I learned about micro-services."
good,It was very different from what I've done in the past. Seeing as how I have always worked the food industry. It definitely showed me a new way of working and how to interact with customers.
good,"During my tenure at Verizon, I was covered a variety of roles, from operations to management. Dependent upon the role the day to day activities varied. From scheduling installation/repairs and facilities locates as a Local Manager this required a review of daily tickets submitted to the queue and assigning staff to perform work. In addition, time was spent performing quality assessments of work, and follow up on safety inspections."
good,Management intimidates employees. Most be apart of the in crowd to advance. Call types are stressful. Good pay but not worth all the drama. This specific location is super cut throat.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon delivers the absolute worst customer service on the planet. It's like they go out of their way to ensure their customers are miserable. That said, their training is top notch. No other employer has prepared me as well for success somewhere else. For that, I'm grateful. If their leaders were more collaborative and trusting with their agents and team members, it could be one of the best places to work in the world and deliver amazing customer experiences as well."
good,"Verizon is currently going through a restructuring.  Things are going well for me, but I will be outsourced.  The restructuring will be good for the company."
good,Most teams are aware of and focused on clear goals but there can be significant conflict or competition between middle managers. Best to switch teams if you are uncomfortable. The company is having difficulty deciding what they will be doing in the future.
good,The job was ok. Management wasn't as strong as I assumed. The training at the time wasn't up to par. I've been in the wireless industry 6+ years and that was the worse training I've received. Things possibly have changed since I worked at that location
good,"I was hired at the same time that Verizon was merging with a major engineering company and as such, the opportunities for growth became non existent.  Thus the reason to seek employment elsewhere."
good,"Not enough manpower on hand to get the job done right. Employees stretched to thin. "
good,Technology is exciting and fun to learn. There is a  nice discount and good benefits. Verizon is not good for work/life balance.  Verizon had a CEO change and the company is downsizing now.
good,"For nearly 10 years, I worked with a talented group of professionals dedicated to providing the highest level of service supporting the E911 system for the City of New York. The 24x7x365 schedule was demanding and many OT hours were required, but the satisfaction of keeping the 911 system running and ultimately saving lives was well worth the extra effort. The integrity of all members of the NYC E911 made it an honor to be a part of the team."
good,A great company to jump start your career and create stability for yourself. The majority of stores in the Columbia area have great leaders and awesome store cultures.
good,"The most difficult part of the job is handling the two lines of thinking within the company. The transactional versus the focus on client business outcomes. I prefer the more strategic focus and helping the client comprehend how to grow revenues and understanding business outcomes, risks of change versus no change."
good,Enjoy the Benefits and pay but very stressful. I feel that there is a slack level of management.  You are on your own they dont have your back but claim you have decisions control
good,"To much emphasis was placed on receiving positive surveys. It was your fault if you got a few because customers did not respond w surveys. There were times when I asked for help and was told to resolve it on my own.  To me, it was a hostile work  environment."
good,Deadlines were unobtainable and always adjusted as milestones were not met. Unnecessary certifications mandated to be obtained on your own time.Flexible hours.
good,"Metrics were primary evolution criteria. Management created a very tightly controlled, stress environment. Customers generally upset when calling in. Extremely fast paced. Almost impossible to get a day off for holidays as it was shift bid based on seniority."
good,Verizon pay and benefits were great. advancement is very slow and / or nonexistant. some of the managers aren't the best while others become your friends who you are happy to work for.
good,You have to be mentally strong to deal with some of the customers but I need an upbeat job a job that doesn’t require sitting down all day I get bored easily
good,"enjoyed working took early retirmment so i could go into business for myself, day at work, 8-5 met with supervisors, designed accounting accounting systems for computer"
good,"When I worked for Verizon in 2015/2016 the money was great. It might have been my specific location, but the business practices were very shady. I like the company because of the service for phones but I feel certain people within don’t act morally"
good,"management often switched goals and commission structure around. Often had to try to switch and constantly look for new shifts if you got stuck with all night shifts. Overall it has some pluses, like work life balance."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"At the end of the day, its an entry level with great pay. Which hurts you when you want to advance your career. Because you may face a pay cut. It's VERY micro-managed by your supervisor, upper management, and the systems."
good,fun place to work but seemed political with not much room for growth. the pay wasnt great and we had no benifits. it was part time though. i loved the people i worked with.
good,You work with some great people’ coworkers and customers. Because management is allowed to vary based on location overall experiences and expectations will vary.
good,"good pay and benefits, can be a good place to work but management is all over the place, you switch shifts and supervisors every so often and your supervisor can make your job great or miserable,tends to be luck of the draw."
good,Managers do not stick up for their employees. And verizon will fire you with no warning. The overall pay is not beneficial for adults with bills. We earned $2 commission from a $800 product.
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace and the knowledge I gained from company with technology.  The only way you were treated fairly is if you were making the store money, if you helped keep numbers high even if it meant doing wrong ethically and professionally. Most people that were compensated were the ones closest to management on personal level."
good,Your day would start with a brief meeting. Metrics were highly stressed. Calls were very demandind and had to endure customer abuse. Teaches you how to communicate with all customers
good,they just don't pay well in commission anymore. the wireless world isnt like it use to be and they want you to drive traffic but dont want to pay you when you do
good,management works with you to help you out but it is a numbers game and with that it does change on a monthly basis.  One month X is what you need to do and next month all the work you put into X will not hurt you since you did too much last month and so on month to month.
good,"I worked as a sales representative and then an assistant retail sales manager. The pay was amazing when I started back in 2003 but they continued to change the commission structure so over the years I was working as hard as I always was but my commission check would continue to decline. It is a fast paced and stressful environment and you usually work overtime. You end up seeing your coworkers more than your family. The company has done alot of changing since I left and alot of the tenured employees got wiped out due to decline in store sales. You will be competing against authorized agents, telesales, and online sales and all of them can offer better pricing on equipment then the retail stores can."
good,Overall good company to work for but work gets overwhelming for the pay. Too many conference calls and meetings and no time to focus on the work that needs to get done. Overwhelming reports and databases that never function properly. The company is good about paying tuition expenses and offers continuous training to employees for personal development.
good,company makes you feel like CEO or personnel management does not care for you or what you do. You are just a # unless you are pretty or they like you. Saw favoritism and unappropriated flirting. Coworker were upset as well.
good,"I worked there for about 10 years, I got to learn a lot from everyone working in that industry training was always a must. Management wasn't the best but some are ok"
good,"While upper management has a strategy and shares it regularly, all jobs really come down to the day-to-day managers. Some are great and some really are not.  Trickle down management -- i.e. doing what your boss says because he/she says so regardless of how much sense it makes --  and high expectations with little reward don't do much to inspire.  That said, the CMO has vision. It will be interesting to see how the new CEO changes things and maybe someday, they will overhaul the take one for the team work/life balance -- i.e. NONE. I was literally told I should take my phone to the bathroom with me and the expectation is that I respond to email after hours and on weekend and vacations.  There is a feeling that when you come back from vacation, you are in trouble or missed something and your stock just dropped.  I wish I had other managers I see who seem to have teams that really love their jobs."
good,Be prepared to have a manager breathing down your neck for your 8 hour shift. You are going to work nights and weekends. You will hardly ever receive a weekend day off.
good,We were expected to hide the truth or lie so we got the sale. Then they come back in store with their bill and cant help them. Very stressful and dishonest.
good,Verizon Business strives for excellence.  Verizon Business constantly makes sure that quality control is number one priority for each employee to prevent any delay in service delivery and outages of any kind.
good,"It was a great job opportunity with amazing benefits. Some of the managers were unprofessional. Call center jobs typically are that way, so it was to be expected."
good,Generally good to work for. Company culture has shifted poorly and work life balance has suffered accordingly. Managers that do not fit the company mission are promoted and instead of those who follow the company values.
good,"Verizon is not the company it was years ago. Sales are declining so budget cuts and layoffs are common to show profitability to Shareholders. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Verizon.  It was an aggressive position where you needed to be ambitious and go-getter for sure in order to move up.  I learned a lot!  The training aspect wasn't difficult in my opinion and I wasn't in the learning process alone I did have coaching.  The only downfall was there was a lack of structure and organization at the location I worked at."
good,I liked the company but they need to employ more direct hires. I was a contractor and left because I was offered another full time job with better pay and benefits.
good,"It's a job you show up you work which was good but then they wanted you to up sell to everybody you spoke with "
good,"A typical day (staff manager in HQ type role) often involves many meetings/calls.  A lot of managers seem to be involved in project management rather than detailed work."
good,The job and career they push do have a great livable feeling. but unless you are the top rep or someone that already has half there family working there you don't get much help to improve your ability to make sure you can get a better job or a way to move in the company.
good,"Verizon is obviously a solid company. pay was good."
good,"I worked closely with the business from a technical perspective to brainstorm new ideas and ensure that support was provided as needed."
good,"Doing business was much too complex.  Multiple acquisitions with little systems integration.  Much too complex.  Typical day was full of finding the ""knowledge worker"" who could help you achieve a task."
good,"Not bad place to work at. management was not very good. "
good,"Comp plan when I was there rewarded those that chose to be average, and penalized top performers, to stay within budget with ""win fall"".  Over quota by 300%, you get paid less, 400%?  Less."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work if you are not a parent, or married. If you are up and coming and single and just want to make money. Then Verizon Wireless is your job. Great salary with commission, but you are there it feels like all the time."
good,"The Department's managers think they run empires."
good,"Verizon is continuing to undergo a rebranding effort as steps are taken to redefine the corporate image to be one of a strong technology company. Workplace culture continues to be an area of emphasis, yet the definition and direction tends to weaken and deviate based on the silo of the business."
good,"Great company but too any obstacles to do business. Everything is a process to get what you need to complete your day to day tasks. "
good,its an ok place to work. there are far better corporations out there mind. senior mgmt political and drink coolaid for breakfast. those that dont dont.
good,Looking to assist customers with their wireless needs. Building customer relations is the most enjoyable part of the job. Knowing that you have a solution is very rewarding.
good,There were peole who had been there for years who knew a sale when the pulled up and if they were not a sale they did not want to help them. Also these people also would steel other peoples commission as they would log into all the sales computer and ipads with their ID so they would get other sales reps commission. Company wanted us to push phones that were cheap because that's what made the company more money.  They did have good benefits.
good,"Phone calls every second. There is no work lie balance. Time off is slime to none. Eventually you get worn out and no longer are excited about the new job, but it pays well"
good,"After attaining customer advocate, I interviewed and was hired for tech support. The workplace was very nice, and the job paid well. The vast majority of employees were wonderful to work with."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Not a job for a seasoned professional looking to move ahead. Political advancement only. It is not what you know but who you know. This is the cause of the downward spiral of VZ currently.
good,heavy micromanagement and horrible travel policy.  unreasonable/unmeasurable goals set then not even counted at the end of the year.  good bonus when they pay all of it out
good,"the benefits are great and there really is awesome people that work for the company but if you want to move up, its who you know. Quota also jumps up every single month. There is no work/life balance and the company will make you feel like its an amazing opportunity to be with them and there is no life after Verizon. News flash. There is. And a calmer one. You get forced to shove HUM's to the elderly people and the accessories goal keeps going up while the company always have layoffs. Good for college kids. Bad if you enjoy time with your family. It is retail so you get retail hours and the customers are sometimes horrible."
good,"My summary says it all. The facilities Chief Engineer did not let me assist, especially on equipment I was experienced with, and I  felt dissatisfied with my role. This was especially true after a re-org of my department leading to a scaling down of my responsibilities/"
good,"typical work day consisted of a pre-shift meeting, followed by a barrage of angry customers , yelling and screaming because they didn't want insurance , yet they broke their phone and want YOU to fix it. Then, you get counseled because your sales aren't good enough , even though you lead the store in ARD and new activation."
good,"Work life Balance was pretty good besides crazy hours that were not consistent, yet we had emergency personal time. Moving up in this company was a joke. i couldn't be promoted unless i was in my same position at the same store for a certain amount of time. Yes there are many departments to move around to but it wasn't the easiest to find out what was available and when. Management changed so often it was hard to maintain a good relationship with them and half the time managers didnt agree with one and another anyways"
good,"Fast paced and very numbers driven.  Sometimes the numbers mean more than the employees.  I made life long friendships in the company, but the stress that came with the company takes its toll."
good,"I had a long career at VzW and had a good time for most of it.  Product management changed from CEO perspective to fire drills and presentation building.  Good place to get experience, not a great place for advancement if not a minority or a woman."
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked for/with but I did not enjoy forcing people into non beneficial situations and pressuring them into buying more products when they do not need it just so I could make enough money to support my needs. Otherwise, overall good work experience."
good,"Like any corporation there are different types of hard bosses and I ran into a few in my time there. As a large company it has a strong legacy culture, and as such it is a very headquarter-centric company."
good,As a manager the job was stressful but that is typical of a sales based career. The company spends a lot of money on training their employees. I would have retired from there but the company decided to divest all the stores in my area and allow an authorized retailer take over the stores. That's a shame because I have 11 years invested there.
good,"I didn't work for a cell only, it was not a cooperate store. I wish I had know the difference when I accepted the job as I would have opted to work somewhere else"
good,"Verizon was a very lucrative job. Mandatory overtime, essential employee. Not very flexible on schedule. Management was very well, benefits were amazing."
good,"This is a SCRUM/Agile shop that conducts 3 to 4 week sprints."
good,"Verizon is a great company, but a bit more concerned with corporate greed than the actual happiness of their employees.  Depending on your department, the work/life balance may not be so good."
good,"worked a tough low income store. Not the best customer base. They really made us push home phones when no one in their right mind wants a home phone any more, not even the old folks."
good,Work life balance is an issue along with very little flexibility makes it hard to balance.  There is room for advancement. Each department is run differently with very unique expectations.
good,Verizon has provided a good support for me and my son for the past 10 years. Verizon provides excellent benefits for its employees. It can be stressful at times. Sometimes management is not the best. Its not the worst place to work at.
good,I loved working for Verizon. My coworkers were wonderful. Customers were always great to talk to. The manager at the time was the worst. Very immature and unfair.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I truly enjoyed my time with Cellularsales. At any job you will have your good and bad days but overall it was an amazing experience that I will take with me everywhere I go.
good,"I was employed there for almost 22 years but with budget cuts and after 3 different technical/engineering roles there I was impacted by lay-offs."
good,"somewhat unrealistic culture, customers blame you for everything and you have no backing from management who believe you can turn any negative customer into a positive one."
good,"Start the day by logging in and sometimes with a team huddle; then taking calls from customers all around the world, some a lot nicer than others. Have to meet certain requirements per phone call, which supervision looks down at you if you miss one thing even though customers try to rush you off the phone or just abruptly hang up on you. The schedule you have per day is very hard to follow since if queues are full its impossible to sign off when you need to, to go to lunch, break, training or just to sign off for the day."
good,"*  Work without excitement.  "
good,Be prepared to be abused daily by customers and management.  This job caused me to develop anxiety.  After awhile telling myself the pay was worth it and finding out that they are closing centers I decided to begin looking for other options.
good,"I worked at Verizon Wireless full-time (More than 6 years) Then laid off at the end of 2015. So, their is no job security working for Verizon. The benefits are great. But at times stressful work environment."
good,Was a great place to work.  Micromanagment and poor pay have caused the good people to move onto to other companies. Mobile offerings are behind the competition.
good,I did not work for a corporate chain so it had more of a personal feel to it. My Manager was very kind and understanding and was very helpful in getting me interrogated with the business.
good,The job can be very stressful if you arent used to being on the phone 8 hours a day and the constant negative feedback from sups dont make it any easier. Great job if you get a lot of offline time.
good,"Although there were many positives to being a sales representative with Verizon Wireless, as a part time worker you receive very little benefit for as hard as you are expected to work. To make a decent commission you must be exceptional and the way people treat you as customers is consistently draining."
good,"The first 10 yeas of my experience with what was then MCI was incredible. Although there were job migrations, they often discussed other opportunities allowing everyone to keep their positions (in advance). The last 8 years of my career was tainted with re-occurring layoffs 4 times a year (particularly during the holidays)."
good,"You learn to see your colleagues as your second family. It can be really slow at times, and out of nowhere it'll get busy. the pay and benefits are great."
good,Working at Verizon was ok. I worked there at a young age so i wasn't aware of the benefits and dont believe i was informed of them either.Besides that working for Verizon was pretty laid back
good,"When I started with Bell Atlantic it was a great job. But as time went on and it changed it's name to Verizon things started to change drastically. More micro-management. More productivity demands. More impact on family life. And the mantra of ""NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS"" became louder."
good,"I work in one of the Business and Government Customer Operations call centers. Having worked in a Consumer center as well, I prefer the call types of the BGCO. Teams are average size, about 12 per supervisor, and I have several touch bases (call reviews and coachings) each month. Opportunities are fairly limited for upward movement in my segment. The only way I can move up is if someone above me decides to quit, which does not look at all likely. I appreciate the flexbility I have with time off options, and definitely like the benefits (insurance, tuition- prepaid or reimbursed, 401k match). Overall, it's an ok place to work, but don't expect them to pay you better than most other call centers."
good,"Verizon is a fantastic company if your into high stress, competitive jobs. They have a grading system of KPI's (key performance indicator ) that you will be measured by, including what they call ""voice of the customer"" which also affects your overall employee grade monthly. get too many bad scores from customer and you'll be promoted to customer faster then you started. "
good,"The benefits you get are amazing, beware that you are hired with a high salary and paid well but you are paid much above market rate so you are stuck with the company in most cases unless you are willing to take a pay cut. There is a lot of office politics, even though management will deny it, make friends with the people that are in the positions that you want so they can help you get them later."
good,"If cubicle farm corporate culture is your thing, then Verizon would be a good choice. Upper management is in a bit of a fog as to what is happening on the front lines"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is constantly growing, changing, upper management is top heavy. Job security is non existent, it doesn't matter what your position is and how hard you work to do a great job, they RIF at least twice every year and cut people by the number not for performance issues."
good,a typical work day depending on the weather was good or could be wet or cold the culture was a bit stressfull toward my last couple of years but all in all made a good living
good,"Most mngrs know nothing about the job or what it takes to do the job correctly, only stress #s. Managements ideas of training is 15-30 video 6months before new product or update is released, useless information that is not retained or it's completely different when ultimately released."
good,"I have experienced many years with Verison/Bell Altantic they have kept me secure and un-secure....."
good,"Verizon is an okay place to work for a younger generation. If you live in a rural state there is very little on the table for job ascension. The pay is very good but the job is very stressful, you kind of get stuck in the job because of how well you get paid and you aren't happy being there. The higher management is very backhanded and just out for a paycheck and rarely taking into account the culture and mindsets of each store."
good,The business Changed drastically over the nine years I worked there. Smartphones did not even exist when I started. The growth of the industry stalled and Verizon tried other ways of acquiring new customers. The new products where great but the micro management was ridiculous.
good,"A typical work day here at Verizon is making code calls during down time, scrubbing old accounts and trying to generate more business for yourself by engaging in these activities; and to not depend on store traffic. Having patience, tenacity, great work ethic to want better for yourself and family.It can be gruesome at times but its all in how you conduct yourself and business. This is a 100 percent commissioned base career, you have to utilize your time and be productive, efficient and have a daily plan and stick to it."
good,Sales is very cut throat.  Every year company seems to make it more difficult to hit sales goal.  If your not in a sales position Verizon is great.  Solid benefits healthcare dental vision
good,The days were fast-paced and packed with new projects. I learned a great deal on the inner functions of talent acquisition in comparison to recruiting for small business. Management was very informative but structures that were constantly changing made it difficult to see potential advancement. Being a contractor also made this a challenge for many including myself. The hardest part of the job was waiting for a full time position to open up at entry level and putting myself in the best position for that. The most enjoyable was the team I was a part of. The TA tea  was all around a great group to work with and learn from while growing as a young professional.
good,"This job required me to work often so I couldnt do anything else with my life. They also cut our commission earnings which made us earn even less while making us work an extra hour every weekday. Management didnt seem to care about the employees and on slow days when we didnt get customers, we would just sit there, not making any commission earnings. We used to make really good paychecks at then the company butchered our commission structure so now we make 50% less than what we used to. I wouldnt recommend this job if you have other things to do in your life."
good,Overtime compensation decreased. Work/life balance sucks. They make it harder to make money and they don't take into consideration your family. Managers were great.
good,"Hard, demanding work.  Quarterly layoffs of management employees until department ceased to exist.  Was then faced with a choice between being laid off or finding another position."
good,"Verizon has a permanent Reduction In Force  for Management employees since 1992.  Since that time, tens of thousands management employees have been removed from the payroll."
good,Great training program.  Company will make sure you have the knowledge to be successful. The location you are placed at can have dictate how you will much money you make.  At a slower location the quota is lower but but you much capitalize on every transaction.
good,"Very cut throat, often sold things customers didn't need/want because we were forced to otherwise we would be fired. The people i worked with were good people. Overall It was alright."
good,Company is looking to incorporate more of a retail style salesman than true business sales reps. Looking at the short close of retail versus a longer sales cycle with B2B accounts.
good,night shift job with fixed sallery. the main reason is the management they are not friendly. the atmosphere and culture was good but not too good employees are also good.
good,"Towards the end the work slowed down, the management was stagnated and the opportunities for advancement were gone. I retired because it was the right time. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the out of control favoritism, and getting a fair chance at the premium work. Seniority didn't matter"
good,"Typical day: come to work, get in your van, go see the subscriber and Install or repair the telephone or data lines.  I have learned a great deal from this job, not only about the circuits I work with, but also the interactions of the many different people.  Managers, co-workers, customers, etc.  The workplace culture is professional, and a bit competitive, which is a good thing, because the benefit is to the customer when we do our job right.  Management is a whole other animal.  They are the hardest part of the job. The first tier managements sole duty is to obstruct, delay, obfuscate the field technician.  They know that they can and probably will be replaced by kiosks soon.  Verizon has drastically reduced their numbers recently.  The most enjoyable part of this job is the autonomy to make decisions and get the customer back on track."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"the creation of Verizon produced a culture of eat or be eaten for middle level management, this led into the necessity to micro manage in fear or Superior undermining your workforce"
good,"Culture can be face pace at times when busy. Typical day at work is 1 person manning the front desk where customers can come up with their laptop issues which can consist of email, login, network and internet, bootup, and software issues. Other members of team are handling tickets in the ticketing system and/or helping out at front desk when it gets busy."
good,"Initially working at Verizon in the retail environment things were fun and exciting everyone work hard and reap the benefits with excellent pay and healthcare. I think the most people particularly if you're single working in a retail environment you will not find yourself to have any issues when it relates to work-life balance. I think once you decide to want to start a family you should really think hard about how you will manage the time with your family versus Verizon."
good,"The management can be difficult sometimes, and customers are always demanding. It can be very stressful and competitive, but if you can handle it the pay is worth it."
good,"start a 730 am, load your material for your load for the day, call you customer, then get the job done in the appropriate amount of time,"
good,You work like a slave through the holidays which is pretty much any retail position though. District managers are hit or miss and can make or break your attitude and stress level. Advancement is usually just a title and not financially a promotion in more cases then not.
good,"Verizon offers a top notch compensation and benefits plan, and there are many training opportunities. It's a great place to work for folks early in their careers (less than 10 years out of college), but not so great for people looking to advance to executive levels."
good,fast paced sales job it was a job basically payed the bills . if u enjoy a mindless repetive job you will fit right in. only real down side was micro management
good,Overall a typical corporate company experience. I hear pretty much the same thing from most of my friends at large companies. It is very bureaucratic and typically there are large layoffs once a year.
good,"Very good pay, but very stressful in many aspects of the job. You are now working under the layoff threat every 6 months, no fun anymore working at Verizon"
good,"I made a lot of great friends and learned a lot in a lot of different positions. This is a very stressful, competitive place, so if you don't do well with change than this may not be the place of employment for you,"
good,"Overtime is mandatory during busy times, optional at others."
good,Ever since the commission structure changed it went down hill. Monthly quotas are unrealistic and if you do hit  it expect less than a grand for all the hard work. Managers get talked down like they are garbage and take it out on the reps. They don't care about their employees and will fire you in a heart beat. All the ops that worked there got laid off out of no where.
good,"Lay offs yearly, can not trust the management.  Because of bad reviews lack of talent in the teams.  Process around software development process is not efficient."
good,"Verizon is an entertaining company to work for. Nothing about the job is too challenging. Verizon has a great way about hiring friendly and enjoyable employees. Management is hit and miss. For the most part I have personally experienced solid leadership. Top producers would stand to see a significant decrease in salary in order to receive a promotion. Though, with recent adjustments to compensation, it is getting closer to a lateral move in regards to income. Whether Verizon promote or just simply hires the right people for a very close knit staff. I would have to say that would be one of the most enjoyable parts about the job. That, plus the constant changing and advances in technology that you get to experience first hand."
good,Financial strain on the business making it not a great place to work these days.  There are layoffs every 6 months.  It used to be very stable but those days seem to be over.
good,To many layoffs. not good for overall moral within the company. most folks fearful of getting let go. not much room for advancement within the company with current financial state.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"long working hours , old style working and  too many documentations to keep."
good,"Great company to grow with. There is a lot of opportunity working there. They do have pretty stringent policies and procedures, very demanding and stressful. They offer nice working facilities. If you have a good manager great, if not it could end your career."
good,"It was an easy place to work with alot of great helpful team members, only downside is the 100 percent comission base and the standards you are kept to"
good,"Company is successful, culture is changing.  Change is constant, which is refreshing.  Central New Jersey, location could be better.  Cafeteria on site."
good,"Great benefits. The culture is simple, however.  I believe the management is all in for themselves and do not care about the individual.  Outside of that and general daily customer interactions that are rough, it is a job that requires patience."
good,"I worked for a premium retailer so, there were a lot of things we couldn't do as far as disconnecting lines and giving bill credits or doing exchanges. I didn't like that working alone was part of the job."
good,Verizon does offer opportunities for growth depending on the line of business or region.  During my tenure with Verizon I was able to move from one line of business with ease as well as get promoted working on issues at a national level.
good,"Unless you love customer service with a passion, it is a glass ceiling... its a great place to start and it is truly what you make of it. However you must be completely flexible."
good,Verizon is really a strong product and something that you can really stand behind and be proud of. The management in this small college town made it stressful to be held to such high sales expectations in such a saturated area.
good,"Typical day at VZW, answer calls providing top Customer service."
good,"Verizon is constantly going through ""Transformations"" as they call them which they will hire you for a role and then no matter how well you perform make you reapply for your own job 2-3 years later in the name of ""Transformation"" which creates extremely low employee morale."
good,"Can be stressful daily with regard to meeting the requirements and help customer needs."
good,"Good starting job, with some chances to work your way up. Very number oriented with countless metrics to achieve. Can be stressful at times but the busier you are, the better chance you have at earning more commission. Overall, the treatment was not was the greatest from upper management but not awful. The work environment as a whole felt unprofessional, not a lot of structure."
good,"Overworked, under-appreciated, quotas are missed and then increased. Unreasonable asks. More and more is shoved off on managers, leaving your with little to no time to actually drive results in the store."
good,	To ensure any client processing tasks assigned are met according to requirements. Ownership as indicated by assignment in the Client Relations public task folder.
good,"The one thing that this company does well is advertising. However, when it comes to employees it starts to go down hill.  Working with them in the early years it was great but as the years gone by. They started adding more queues and more hats and they wanted to you to be this universal rep. It wasn't just Customer service or Tech Support. they wanted to combine multi department with no pay increase."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Decent company.  Very good compensation.  More formal work environment than I like.  Essentially, the business end of the stick (think ""no fun aloud"").  Huge bureaucracy feel.  Unionized and you are obligated to compensate for this if there is a strike (and there have been lots of them).  However, they usually don't mention this until you are onboarded:)."
good,"Worked here 4 years.  Thought it was the most awesome place to work ever, for about the first year. I was only a number, nothing matters but stats. Can only advance if you are willing to kiss butt and forget about the fact that you have a family."
good,Compensation is competitive but you will work very hard for it. Culture is excellent and exhibited and practiced from the top down. Benefits are excellent and cost reasonable. 401k match and profit sharing. Lots of training and professional development opportunities. Can advance if you're willing to relocate.
good,Things changed when my manager changed the replacement manager was defiantly racist on the low the staff knew I was getting fired before I did which is very unprofessional
good,"The company is not staying competitive in this market, retail is loosing money and they are cutting expensive reps. Too much choking middle management. If you don't care about the people you work with you can make a lot of money."
good,C-Level Management is very knowledgeable and moving the Company toward a consistent vision.  IT VPs are lacking leadership ability which is bringing the Company short of their goals.  Most IT VPs were programmers promoted straight into Sr. Management without any Leadership Experience and they are struggling.  Benefits are very good.  Work/Life balance is non-existent.
good,Numbers Driven company! If you do not hit your quota you will be on the chop and block but if you kill it they will kiss your butt. Typical quota sell job not bad but can get burned out.
good,"I absolutely loved working at store level, taking care of customers, learning about and selling new products. Almost every single store manager I worked for was fair, motivational, and effective."
good,I was able to learn quite a bit from this place. I had the chance to travel to different cities close to the city I lived in to cover shifts and I enjoyed that a lot. Bad location. Closed due to low traffic.
good,It's not a bad company to work for. The pay and benefits are good. But your not appreciated and the management staff is something to be desired. Commission structure is based on previous year and everyone has cellphones now.
good,The only complaint I really have for this company is that they do not pay well in commission. The commission and hourly pay structure is constantly changing. Other than that the management is fair and they do work with your schedule. On a good month you could make pretty okay money.
good,"Company offers generous telecommuting opportunities. "
good,Verizon as a whole is struggling to change its business model to be competitive in the wireless market which is oversaturated and full of churn.  It will not be long for salespeople to make a decent living with their structure for pay.
good,"Verizon is  great place to work for , but need  a company that has potential to make more money and for growth within the company...I have been employed here for 3 yrs and 8 months."
good,Verizon is a very good place to work with many benefits but also very demanding on the quotas. When one quota is met they give you an even bigger quota the next month so it's never enough.
good,"Its a good place to work at .Workplace Culture is pretty good . "
good,"Typical work day for a sales rep is being briefed on monthly sales goals, current promotions and what items to sell. Through out the day and during each transaction, the sales rep is micromanaged on how to be creative when selling."
good,"As a contractor at Verizon, I can't speak to their benefits or compensation. It is a high-pressure environment, with management requiring a lot from employees in work and time."
good,You have unrealistic goals that are wanting to be met. The hardest part of the job was the customers and management. I had a manager that would tear you down mow than help you.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Its a good place to work if you like fast paced and stressful deadlines with a lot of hours and lost of problems to constantly fix .Good benefits .Lots of goals and qoutas to hit both daily and monthly with a manager constantly reviewing your performance and giving you feedback
good,"This particular franchise branch of Verizon wireless was sued in 2016 for negligence, taxes, employee payments etc. I wouldnt recommend working under them however VERIZON WIRELESS is a great place with wonderful benefits"
good,"Verizon has many skilled and dedicated employees, but the prevailing management attitude is dated which limits the value employees can provide to the company."
good,I provided conference services to a number of businesses as well as government branches. Services included scheduling conferences and leading them as operator. Typical features were Microsoft Live  Meeting and spread sheet reports of participants.
good,"In a transition period so a lot of uncertainty right now.  Great benefits, great comp, not great leadership."
good,"It's an ok job, but  i didnt like how i had to force products on people i knew fully well did not want them nor would they ever make use of it so it made you feel bad when you had to rip off a 70 year old lady (or you could potentially get written up for not throwing the right product) just to increase your numbers so you stayed out of trouble."
good,"I worked customer service in store and the company doesn't really offer that anymore."
good,"Verizon as a representative is a great place to work. They are protected by the union and the pay is great. Management however, are the first go to go during cuts. They reward consultants with a job well done"
good,I happened to work for a short period of time consulting.  The team was aggressive and was working on a data warehouse project. Enjoyed the performance tuning challenge.
good,"Typical big company. If you like the big company benefits - dell, ibm, etc - verizon is perfectly fine for you. If you want a small company feel, this isnt for you."
good,Fun working for the client verizon but am working through a staffing agency and my contract period was geeting an end so am looking for a another contract or full time job
good,"From working here, I realized people are promoted based on favoritism over work ethic and knowledge. Since I've been working here I have been in over 3 learning programs, which are only given to people who have to be exceeding and/or leading in their current position."
good,"Verizon is a typical corporate employer. They provide the usual benefits of health insurance, 401k, vision, etc. They're compensation is also typically at market level, possibly could say above market levels."
good,"Typical day at work consists of providing solutions to customers communications needs. The hardest part of the job is meeting your quota while dealing with customers personal issues and sometimes they will come in and take their frustration out on you, but it is up to the representative to handle the issue and try to provide a solution that meets their needs. This includes accessing the customer's account and offering new products and services that can benefit them in their personal and/or professional life."
good,Great Pay - No Job Security.  Constant reorganization and lack of focus.  Several layoffs have lowered the morale of the company and productivity has decreased.
good,"Very stressful environment. You have to bid for hours every 6 months. You have to change mangers every 6 months making it hard for those who do not do well with change. Time off when needed is not available unless they post time that they say you can take off. Parking on the facility grounds is a mad house"
good,Benefits and compensation are good. Routine layoffs at least once per year...watch out whenever corporate announces acquisition of another company. Advancement opportunities are few unless you are able to relocate. Time off is dictated by service levels in call center environment.
good,"Over my 7 yr tenure as a contractor for one of Verizon Wireless outsourced Call Centers, I have had a chance to experience great management teams that I respected and thrived under as well as sub-par management teams. One thing that I can say is that when the management team is well structured, with strong communication skills, unbiased( no favoritism), truly has the vision of one band, one sound, and believes truly that an individuals work speaks for its self instead of who you are friends with in upper management, the location is a powerhouse and a force to be reckoned with."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Customer service was fun and had opporunity to learn about all different products. Coworkers were great to work with and always willing to help. It is hard to balance work and home life
good,There is no limit on what you can make in sales with Verizon.  You do work weekends and nights but the money is worth it.  Great coworkers and customers
good,"• Part of shift team to provide high quality technical support to Verizon Business’ customer base by performing fault identification, diagnosis and correction on customer reported faults and technical requests. "
good,My department work became stressful and not rewarding.  No work life balance.  No down time.  No valuable time off.   Never met my manger.  No face to face meetings.  No travel.  Not enough adequate training
good,For several years my job was enjoyable until upper management changes moved the direction of the company away from customer service to only worrying about the shareholder profits. Job security went out the window and they didn't seem to care about the employees at all. My coworkers were fun and knowledgeable and always ready to give technical advice.
good,"The company only cares about money, not loyalty. The money is good, benefits are good but work life balance really isn't there and you have to work overtime to hit quota in the Florida market."
good,"Not much of a work life balance, but pays extremely well. You will have an enjoyable 1st 3 monthes with guaranteed commission. After that you will work extremely hard to make it."
good,the days are long but are very fast paced. always must me accessible. must hold employees accountable while chasing numerous metrics on a daily basis.
good,Ready for the next step to progress in the field I am looking forward to finding a better job and making more money The commission structure is designed for the company to win not the employer
good,"I think all depends on who you work with, management is usually really good in fact we were running on one with a group of 15 just fine. After hiring a lady from the outside it went down hill, she wasn't friendly with any employee, very bossy. Just not a good way to handle people at all. She told many lies about employees and gossiped a lot. I think they company at the main office is great but out in the field not so much."
good,Everything you do is monitored. Its a tough job with no guarantees. You are paid very well for what the job requirements are. Its a fast passed and you have very little room for advancement off the phones
good,"you learned a lot meet a lot of individuals. very political, the benefits are great kept you up to speed the latest products and services. Very good with training employees on new devices and products and services"
good,"Verizon is a good place to work, and generally pays above market, with great benefits. The culture changes as initiatives change, but overall, the management and the people are dedicated."
good,Coworkers were stressed and avoided any interaction outside of assigned projects.  No collaboration or knowledge transfer. I'm sure this wasn't the case in other departments but it reflects my experience.
good,"If you want to work for a company that nags you for sales more then you mother nags you about life, then Verizon Wireless is the company for you.  Pay is very good for retail, however unless you can slam products down customers throats then you'll do better to find a job somewhere else.  The company ""culture"" is nothing more then endless propaganda and corporate rhetoric that goes nicely with management breathing down your neck."
good,"Overall the company has good benefits and pays their employees well. The company is not big on work/life balance like they say they are. I worked in the retail store for 13 years and there were several times I had to compromise time with friends and family because of the needs of the business. The retail store is very busy and does not have enough employees to handle the traffic. This makes working there very stressful and makes the employees and the customers unhappy. I did receive a lot of training while I was there in sales, management, and they also do tuition reimbursement so you can get a degree."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Was okay while I worked there, but company restructuring forced a layoff. The company layed off large portions of employees over a three year period.  Poor management at upper levels, which lead to unsustainable business practices, created this issue."
good,Technology advancement with product suite is always exciting has been the most enjoyable part of the job. A daily change in environment is always appreciated. The most challenging part of the job has been the culture over the last few years has been changing as a result of the corporate realignments in the business.
good,job advancement was bad. turn over rate is horrible. many unattainable job requirements in sales in the very slow stores that should have been closed..
good,"Verizon pays well and has great benefits, however these do not always outweigh the really rough and cutthroat work culture. Managers care only about sales and do not provide real support for customers (unless they are buying something)."
good,"Corporation has moved from relationship, value added selling strategies to a more cellular transaction based approach.  Customer service has taken a secondary position to revenue generation at all cost."
good,"Toward the end of the time when I worked for Verizon Communications, they purchased a telecommunications company called MCI and because of this there were a lot of duplicate jobs and they seemed to only let the Verizon employees leave.  I did work there from 1979 to 2007."
good,"After reviewing your call, the supervisor will give you feedback.  90% of the time the call is always bad. Every 6 months there is a schedule change.. Your new supervisor will tell you you are doing everything wrong.  You'll have to adapt to their way of call taking.   The most enjoyable part is the money, but that still doesn't want you to go to work,"
good,"Overall good company to work. Take every opportunity to learn and diversify your skills. Keep in mind that there is only one thing that is constant , change, and you will succeed,"
good,"The company has a great talented pool of people, however, that talent is wasted by the lack of focus from senior leadership and daily fire fighting that everyone is involved in."
good,"Verizon is a fast paced, highly competitive company to work for with great benefits.  There are lots of opportunities in the company especially in marketing and IT."
good,"Fast paced environment with a with a technology forward attitude being command by the generation of customers and its growth to provide revenue to stakeholders.  therefore, management primary objectives are to enlarge and  retain costumers base."
good,"The best way to honestly describe it, so many different ups and downs and the leadership in the northeast area needs the biggest improvement in comparison to the rest of the nation. It was as if it was a company within a company."
good,"I enjoyed being able to promote positivity to unsatisfied customers, also working there  is a life learning experience,  the incentives rewards are nice."
good,"Lot of perks with working for this organization, which is why I say great company over all. Great Benefits, and great training opportunities. Retail hours can be taxing"
good,The pay is not consistent unless you are at a popular store. They are more interested in making money and winning awards than they seem to be with employees. Lots of false promises and over hyped situations that would work out in your favor in the future.
good,"- competiive pay and bonus"
good,"Some great employees with poor upper management.  Stress is high, always pressured to do more with less and low morale.  Direction changes often with out a cohesive plan.  Lack of communication and co-operation between departments.  Herd mentality with upper management treating everyone like cattle. Poor decision making, lack of funding for most things and constant layoffs. Get to work with some cutting edge technology in a complex environment."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,answer and making calls to build a relationship with the customers. selling new products and services as well. things I learned that people really want to grow their business and want help. management to be supportive and give information to the front line employees. workplace culture should be the customer then family and life balance. not focusing on management. the hardest part of the job is office politics. the most enjoyable part of the job is solving the customers program. helping them reach their business goals and grow their business
good,"Then you can make good money"
good,Job that requires not much from you but just to listen and find solution for the customer. There is no challenge for you and there is no type of social gatherings to make you talk to your peers you walk in walk out sleep and work. Very routine like day great place if you like that.
good,Sales environment.  Base plus commissions.  Competitive salary.  Finding different sale tactics and ways to market your business.  Providing excellent customer experience
good,"Working at Verizon Wireless is a great experience. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement and training, but the work/life balance can be detrimental to families. The management at Verizon can vary from a relaxed environment to high stress overseeing. It is all dependent on the season. The hardest part of the job, again, is the work life balance. The most enjoyable thing about Verizon is the culture of excellence."
good,"Pay and benefits are good.  "
good,"Walked in every day wondering if today is the day I get fired. Company always pushing sales and customers screamed at us most of the day. Miserable, miserable job. Some of the people were great to work with, but the pay and perks are why the majority of employees endure every day."
good,Work is demanding and constantly growing. Company has a lack of direction on where they ultimately want to be and it shows throughout the entire company.
good,Excellent training programs and work benefits including health and vacations.  Flexible but long work hours.  Various teams work well together.
good,Good paying job but the politics and management..... If you don't know how to sell don't bother applying.  The company is not the same as when I 1st started.
good,Lots to learn. Decent pay and benefits.  Very exciting to be able to play with all the phones that would just come out.  Lots of perks with sales.
good,"Great company, however, the work life balance is horrible. They have great health benefits and have programs to help mold you for the career path you want. Also, you tend to change supervisors and teams frequently with little to no notice. Quite frustrating when you don't know where to go fir support."
good,Work life balance is a weakness with the company. Not much room for growth. A lot of managers are inadequate when it comes to helping the reps become better.
good,This job can be very difficult to do if you want to have a life outside of it. There will be alot of times where you will have to stay past the time you have to leave no matter what.
good,Great Pay and great people. Just need better work lif balance. The management staff is a little rough around the edges and could use more training. Other than that great company to work for and great benefits
good,Was good at first but pay scale changes against your favor constantly. Working on commission can be an unstable source of income and expectations increase every year.
good,I was young when I started here which was perfect I was completely flexible with hours.  But as soon as you have a family things change.  Your barley able to spend time with them you work long hours and its a very sales driven job.
good,"Does not communicate, horrible benefits. Doesnt care to relocate anyone regardless of commute. Works employees and managers beyond reasonable amounts."
good,"I worked for Verizon DSL USA for more than a year.  It was a good experience of my life to help US people with their queries regarding their BB , mail or their PC performance. I have learned a lot."
good,"When I started with Verizon Wireless it was a great company to work for. I believe it is still a great company to work for but the people they have in place for upper management I feel do not have the best interest of the company, customers or employees."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Do your job and u should be fine, unless some manager is looking to suspend some one just to prove his/her worth to company"
good,Company doesn't always provide work and home life balance.  Integrity not consistent thru out company.  Promotions not always in line with employee performance.
good,"The overall job is okay, they do have great benefits that come with the job.The managers are chill for the most part and it is like any other corporation that expects you to hit sales goals. If you like sales and don't mind dealing with extra headaches and retail hours this is great for you."
good,"Customer service and support. I troubleshooted and activated mobile phones, greeted customers, scheduled and taught hundreds of wireless workshops to help people learn how to better use their devices."
good,they had some good training and learned a bunch of new technologies.  the work was very busy and lots of long days and weekends and overtime or after hours woork.
good,i worked in customer  service  then  tech  support. I gained  lots  of communication skills through the  on the  job training. The schedules  did  not  work  with   my  work/life balance.
good,Good training that is actually not conducted by Verizon butcontracted by Xerox. Fast paced enviroment. The down side is that it is a volume business and they seem to care more about quantity not quality. Management is hard pressed to make their numbers and that is bottom line. Co workers were great and so were the facilities.
good,"Fast paced job with opportunity for growth. Paid vacations, 401k, fair pay based on experience. Must be health occupation oriented. However, if you are out on medical leave you are expected to look for jobs everyday just in case your position gets filled."
good,The pay was good as well as the benefits. The culture of the company has changed a lot and not for the better. My co-workers were great as well as most of my foremen. It was upper management that was a problem.
good,"Worked here as a contractor for a very short period of time. Therefore, it would be unfair to provide a detailed comment on the company. All in all, it was nice."
good,"For me, the largest downfall of working at Verizon was the imbalance between work and life. This was the very thing that lead me away from this job. You can make good money and the benefits are great, but it comes at a price. The workday falls throughout the middle of the day as do all retail hours working 10:30a to 7:30p on a Saturday is part of the job. Management is usually hit or miss I knew managers who were great to work for and some who weren't so great among the many stores. The job itself is not difficult, there is no ""hardest"" part. You can make a good living here, but you must be diligent in your work everyday to earn it."
good,"The management is very strict, everything is to the book, you have to meet you performance agreement or you will get wrote up, you get very contradicting information when you need help or clarity, dress-code and rule have gotten strict as well. There isn't any room for growth like they tell you in orientation and the managers are very strict."
good,I worked for Verizon for almost 10 years. It was great in the beginning but it really started to get out of hand when job security started to get scarce.  It's a union job but the union doesn't do much to help you but you pay dues every week.
good,Management is constantly changing and making decisions based on the needs of the management and they are constantly changing. So there is no consistency.
good,"As a large corporation, Verizon has difficulty recognizing talent and instead uses others' skills without allowing advancement in the organization."
good,management didn't really have the best training and nor could give the employees below them any much training either besides telling them what there doing wrong and not the right way to fix the problem but if your a quick learner and can teach your self about phones and sales then this job is fine
good,You learn how to sale to a variety of people. You pretty much control your paycheck based on how driven you are. The commissions structures change a lot and could take a while to get used too after each adjustment. Managements claim it's to give you a bigger commission check but that is never the case.
good,"Sales and equipment repair reviewed and adjusted accounts to fit the customers needs great team atmosphere learn something new everyday fast paced job, making sure all customers leave with pleasurable experience."
good,This organization has taught me a lot through culture and diversity and am glad to receive those tools to advance me into my next stage of my career.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I enjoyed working at Verizon but not much room for growth. There was a lot of unfair promotions and employee treatment. Benefits were good but compensation was low compared to industry. Hopefully they will get more caring for  employees
good,We work a lot of overtime. The hardest part of the job is working in the rain. The most enjoyable part is working with my co-workers and taking care of customer's needs.
good,"This company makes millions per year but is not willing to expand its best product, FIOS, execs keep trying to cut benefits while severly restricting employees ability to care for the customers."
good,"Verizon is an good company to begin a career with, they will provide adequate industry training. You will get good pay. But Verizon has been on the down slide towards employee care. Verizon wants to eliminate job security and move jobs to over seas, lowering quality of service."
good,"Fast Paced Call Center Exciting Products,  Resolves Customers Wireless Phone and Smartphone Questions, Billing and Technical"
good,Every management job will require you to create processes and procedures.  You must be creative and effective in your assignments and not expect much assistance from anyone.  If you are a self-directed employee you will succeed.  The most enjoyable part of my job was understanding how talented I was as an employee.  I also discovered that I mastered new concepts and applications quickly.  I felt there were too many chiefs and not enough cooks.
good,Manager micro manages you and jumps in the middle of your interactions with customers to pitch a product.  Work life balance is missing.
good,"No comment"
good,Great position for people fresh out of college. The environment is political. It's about who likes you instead of how good you are at your job that will get you the promotion you need. Enjoyed job responsibilities which came easy because the company trains wells.
good,"Benefits are great, management could care less, stressful and call center environment can be toxic. Its all who you know in order to advance"
good,"- OK company to work for. "
good,Fun at times but high stress and manager pay makes no sense at all. you will latterly get payed less to promote yourself. so insentive to move up if you're a high performer is very low
good,"Making progress in the culture and organization, but still a very mechanical, hierarchical organization."
good,"Great pay"
good,"My time at Verizon wasn't bad but wasn't great, the location was in a secluded area and barely had any traffic not to mention the pay was low."
good,"I would rate the work average.  Little room for advancement from a clerical position.  Generally, the people are great to work with. d"
good,job security is questionable. The money is great. Too many hours and constantly forced overtime. there is No Employee appreciation. work and work only
good,Installing fiber optics to customers premise. Learned how to fiber splice a fiber optic cable. Coworkers are apart of a union. There really isn't to many hard parts to the job
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Then, everything changed when the Wireless and Wireline units merged. Everything became a race to the bottom.  Transformation after transformation happened while we were still adjusting to and starting to get benefit from the previous one, when the obvious reality was that they were deep in debt and needed the money, even if it meant sacrificing quality and U.S. employees."
good,"Great for people new to sales, rewarding company with great training and benefits. Retail hours, but very rewarding. Can be difficult to advance."
good,New Executive Leadership from Verizon Corporate starting the long haul to transition this acquisition to the Verizon Corporate way.
good,My typical day is 10am to 6pm at a cubicle. Taking calls from customers for implementation of Verizon services. If not capable for implementation provide information to team that is able to do the work via email and/or verizon intranet databases.
good,"Coworkers are helpful and most are friendly"
good,For the most part working for Verizon has been good. The only bad thing I would have to say is there are always layoffs! Also there is no work from home policy
good,"A typical day at work could be different everyday. I first started getting qualified leads from beginning to cold call door to door business to business. I would take notes on each business that I would go to then figure out which employees could be potential deals. Then I would go back to them try to set an appointment where I could meet them for a meeting. After this I would go to the meeting and try to close the deal. if I closed the deal the client and I would fill out the contract and set an appointment for the technician to install the product. "
good,"As a Technical Program/ Service Manager with Verizon I supported large enterprise accounts with post sale support providing technical support for implementation projects, service outages, monthly service reviews, service inventory management, problem management and ensuring contractual SLA’s are achieved."
good,"Very nice place to work and learn but not necessarily to grow professionally.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,Worked here in various roles for the last 9+ years. Recently was forced to move to the HQ team as a part of the organization restructure. All the keep telling us is that we are lucky to have jobs and we should be greatful. I was assigned to do the work no else on the team wants to do and I have zero impact on the business. I'm supposed to feel lucky? The company needs to figure out what they want to be when they grow up so they don't keep doing this to their hardworking employees.
good,"A typical day is very interactive with customers, staff and employees. A very fast paced environment with a dynamic culture."
good,"I love meeting different customers and really helping people. There are many different goals to meet so even if you are well rounded, it just never feels like enough. Depending on your location you can have amazing managers or awful managers. Corporate jobs have their perks but there have been layoffs in the past so I don't know how secure it is to work there. In retail, it is very secure."
good,Not a bad company if you don't mind working an all types of weather conditions and going door to door. They lied about the position. I applied for a Administrative Assistant position but when I was hired I found out I was really a door to door sales person.
good,Great place to work. The management and coworkers are supportive.  Being able to help people resolve their technical issues is a great benefit. There are a lot of issues trying to work together with different departments though.
good,its an ok job if you want to move on to another job in the future. I would recommend it if your trying get your feet wet in a first time job. They had a ping pong table which everyone enjoyed.
good,Micro management and fun workplace. Works on onshore and offshore basis.The most enjoyable part of job was taking the challenges and get learning from them while applying real time implementation.Senior management and salary review are not as good as other product based company.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for if you are not on the phones doing customer service.  The job is extremely stressful and management pressures you to sell and score perfectly on surveys. If you are not a person that can take receiving 50 calls a day where half of them are customers screaming and cursing  you out then this position is not for you.  The benefits on the other hand are amazing.  They prepay tuition and the health and 401k benefits are amazing.  They use these benefits to keep the employees.
good,"Big company with big ideas and big budgets.  Always evolving, always changing - exciting but challenging.  Challenged always to do more with less.  Culture is very tiered depending on the department and title - employee development is on paper but not in practice."
good,"If you want to work for the best communication company, you should work for Verizon. Employees are well trained in service and technology. Competitive"
good,they expect so much out of you for you to keeps stats up and so if your a single mom or you have no one to help your kids when they get out of school don't apply cause they do not care if you need time off and you don't have it available.
good,Management was not supportive. I did not like the vertical restructuring due to the chaos that was inevitable. You were asked to streamline process to the extent you worked yourself out of a job.
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people and helping customers when they needed it most, but the company as a whole I didn't like. I don't feel comfortable telling a customer lies just to get a sale or make money. I'm a honest person and I live by treating others as I so wish to be treated."
good,"Benefits were great but what was always promised, never came into fruition. Says that they help you get into school but makes you pay it all back later."
good,"Being a employer at Verizon Wireless. The most enjoyable part of my job was communicating with my customers,listening to their needs and making sure that what I've done satisfied the requirements."
good,"The work environment was amazing. great co workers and atmosphere.  it was a management training program, learned something everyday.  Door to door sales not the best job in the world.  long hours and no time to enjoy family outside of work.  We worked in harsh weather conditions.  Money wasn't enough judging the hours we put in six days a week"
good,Enjoyed working with my customers. I learned a lot and enoyed my time there. But no time for family. Just part of the retail culture.
good,Good pay and benefits/time off.  Not much job security unless your wireless and even then it depends on location.  Need to be in the Northeast.
good,"Though the company boasts itself as number 1 leading telecommunications company, it doesn't feel that they value the employees as much as other 'lesser' rated telecommunications companies do. Though the company is vast with many various options and routes for advancement and benefits, at times it feels that the very difficult process of getting hired is the exact same way you are trapped out of any career advancements and compensations, as the job itself is very paperwork intensive which could cause problems for a new employee later down the road."
good,"its an ok company to work for about 3 years.  take advantage of the perks and then move up, or out of the company.  the company's unwritten policy feels like they will chew up people and spit them out if one does not move up the ladder fast enough, or is complacent to be at the bottom."
good,I love my team. Fun working environment. Great culture. Nice coworker. Mgmt is easy to get along with. Company provides training whenever needed. Great company to work and grow in.
good,"Very stressful on most days. You will go home and have dreams/nightmares about this place, literally. If you have a problem with time management then you won't anymore after being here. 2 minutes late and you are written up. You always had the fear of being listened to by team leaders and management on your sales calls. If you missed one word or did not properly close the call then they would call you off the phone and write you up. After training, you started at the bottom which meant your hours were 8:00a-4:30p with MANDATORY overtime from 4:30p-6:00p every day. You get vacation days but NO SICK DAYS!! It is a union job so if you are fired for any reason than you had a good chance of getting your position back if the union could fight for you. This job has made it difficult for me to want to try another phone position."
good,"Compensation in the cellular industry was very good back in those days for high-performers--which made working there much more tolerable.  Management, however, generally operated from a ""negative reinforcement"" stand point."
good,Verizon is a great place to work except their sales department.   I worked in 2 departments but sales treats you like slavery.  The pay is awesome the perks are great but you are treated like a slave.  The stress is not worth it!
good,working at this company speaking with the customers of all walks of life was very educational and I enjoyed it learning from the customers as well as they would learn from me had some smart co workers that I learned things from about the bussiness
good,"Work Culture in this organization is not that great.Typical of organizations with growing pains there are legacy employees that need to move on to the next chapter in their career. Verizon has helped with this, especially in Atlanta"
good,"Used to be enjoyable & had much pride in the job.  There was movement within the company.  Now pidgeon-holed in the same job for years. Unless one wants to quit and be rehired at starting pay. Outsourcing everywhere. Benefits are decent, as is the pay...but that is dwindling.  Typical day: sitting at a computer, with every moment scrutinized, including time you are in the bathroom. Managers are decent, but under a lot of stress, and that trickles down. Some attempts at morale boosting, but it falls short when the big things are the issue."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"My schedule has me working open to close on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, giving me 39 hours of full-time employment guaranteed. "
good,"A good place to work,very rewarding, must be dedicated and willing to work after hours and weekends and holidays. A wonderful group of co orkers"
good,"I worked for Verizon for 13 years and did anything from sales to operations specialist.  I worked on phones, installed bag phones in vehicles.  I was in charge of stock coming in and going out.  I was responsible for all the inventory.  Stocking phones and accessories."
good,"was in call center for 1st time In my life. worked 10 years but is not the work and environment for me. co workers were great, I thought management were just place holders and yes people my most enjoyable part was helping customers."
good,Vanuit directie benadert om projecten vlot te trekken en deze naar bedrijfsvoorwaarden uit te voeren.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of contacting the customer to see when they want their circuit activation on Verizon's network, after having tested through from the local telco end to Verizon's demark. Activation would include ensuring all components, including CPE, modems, routers, WIC cards, etc., were correctly installed and tested, concluding with the customer acceptance of equipment and circuit."
good,"A typical day included trying to juggle multiple priority 1 ""Put this above all else"" requests and then asking why each one wasn't done in whatever order they decided to change it to without informing the employee.  The management system started off fine for a while until the point where three levels of your management structure are all assigning you different priorities without discussing them with each other and leaving the blame on what got done when on you. The co-workers were the best part of the job as they were often in the same boat and we would all pull together to try to satisfy every level of management. Even though it hardly worked out that all were pleased, we did have a great relationship with each other."
good,"Nice enviorment to work with.. Everyone is helpful.. u gets breaks in between to refresh u, supervisiors take effort to make u feel like home.. very open minded and health cautions too, give u healthy lunch including fruits, shakes and juices.. The part i miss is a tea time..in the evening.. take your time to work.. no rush.."
good,"Different Shift every day"
good,"Listens and responds appropriately in all interactions with customers, works to establish rapport with"
good,Its was okay a really terrible call in systems and really close setting seats with other employees...They have good vacation time if you have work there for a year and no incentives because they take it back out your check in four pay periods.
good,"The general manager is one the coolest  and calmest  person under stress I have ever work for, he set the tone for relax, yet fast pace working environment. He is very professional in his job duties and I admire and respect that  about him and is why I like working at Verizon."
good,"pay is not as high as advised, and there is no work life balance at all. attendance is very strict and they do not work with the days off requested and your working every weekend"
good,"A typical day is back to back phone calls. Some management is great--others are very two faced and it's hard to know who to trust. The co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is passing surveys, you can't make everyone happy and when you get a bad survey that manipulates your performance and ultimately your pay and your career development."
good,This is a very good company with a lot of good employees that work very  hard every day.
good,"Every job has its benefits and drawbacks. The main benefits that I enjoyed and kept me at the company for so long - healthcare, flexible in work hours, telecommuting, and the relationships with my co-workers.  The main drawbacks were lack of communication from my direct manager and no opportunities for advancement. "
good,"Professional setting, mixed emotions with co-workers with the work  that was being required of us with very little training. Quantity was more valuable then quality. Management was split between 4 teams. Some manages knew more than other managers and were there to assist in anyway possible. Most enjoyable part of the day was knowing that you were able to assist your customers/co-workers and meet your goals with the quality as well as the quantity. The hardest part was having to assist up to 3 customers at 1 time within the allotted 12 mins per call."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The benefits were great! Excellent and very professional management training program.  I have learned a great deal that I am able to use in my current position, and I appreciate the job shadowing offered.  "
good,"I would go back for the pay, benefits, and the friends I made there."
good,"I worked with awesome, fun, and knowledgeable co-workers. My local and regional area managers were great. Upper level management has no clue.  They are worried more about production than the quality of work.  Just get it done and get it done quickly is the new motto.  They advertise that they are all about the treating customers great, but they aren't investing in the old copper infrastructure, or rolling out any new fiber. "
good,Good commission but all commision.  You better bring your A game.
good,"Hardest part of job is adapting to consistent change. As tmobile and sprint suffer with selling price price price, Verizon and ATT are left to combat pricing vs the network and having the best network around. People dont care about network, its all about price to most people. You get what you pay for. "
good,"Their time off is very lenient but difficult to keep track of, one program would say I had 48 hours left and another program would say I had 53 hours. Never knew which to go by.If you go over at all whether it is the last day of the year or not they will write you up and if you are late or call in one more time after that they will fire you."
good,Strong company with a good brand name. The business side of the business is not funded well and is not a high growth segment. A lot of false starts and reorganizations can be disruptive to the day to day business. Is not very nimble and is extremely risk adverse.
good,"Verizon Wireless customer service duties dealt with a lot of high volume calls and incoming calls, answering questions for customers calling about discounts on their accounts. Very loud call center"
good,Verizon was a fairly simple job. It was not a career opportunity. It was a way to make some ok money with excellent benefits. Great and competitive environment. I enjoyed the monthly commission checks and bonuses. Co-workers for the most part where great and had been there for a while. Management was the weakest I have ever encountered but nice. I learned cell phone technology.
good,I can not understand the promotion that has happened in the past year.
good,"The typical day was fairly routine. I would go in each day and work with both business and consumer customers, assisting with finding a technology solution that fit their specific needs. I learned a ton about current technology and how it can impact a business greatly. The management, overall, was helpful, with a few that made the role less enjoyable.  My co-workers were all very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was having someone look over your shoulder at every single thing you do or say. I realize they have their own things to accomplish, but it is very difficult to focus on assisting your customers fully with someone standing over your shoulder."
good,My Co-Workers at Dish were great the job  was easy. Management sucked at communication.
good,n/a. Would prefer to discuss in person not online.  I worked in billing and collections.  Excellent customer service.
good,"As a key holder part of my duty was setting registers count money and making sure that the store its ready for customers."
good,"A Typical day at work was always fast paced the day always went by. Adhering to my schedule wasn't easy because of lack of help with the job I was taking about 200 to 350 calls per day when it should be like 100 to 200."
good,"The job is simple enough to perform. Greeting customers, selling products, and creating business relationships. I enjoy my job, however there is very little room to grow or expand within the company."
good,"Good benefits but you will be worked beyond your max... day after day after day. Extremely stressful environments in retail, customer service, management, and in the corporate departments."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,alot of the skills you learn here you find youll be able to use in other industries
good,"Fast pace"
good,"Overall, Verizon has been a good company to work for and I have built most of my career and skills working for them.  Leaders are very engaged, and they truly promote from within.  The only real down side to Verizon is that there is no work life balance.  If you want a good work life balance, you won't make an income that can support a family."
good,"It's retail. However, you will be asked to stay longer than normal, you will be asked to work overtime, you will be asked to come back from lunch early. Customers food the Verizon stores. It isn't normal. It doesn't matter how many reps you have in the store at one time, you will get slammed. I have had people throw items at me, I have received a phone that was once in a portojohn and I even watched a woman get tasseled in front of me because her actions (customer). Cellular retail is not for the faint of the heart, it will break you and you will be exhausted. It is a great buffer to a resume but I would not make it a career."
good,"high fast pace environment time zips by, management could be a little mmore supportive in terms on proper training. the hardest part of the job was requesting time off"
good,"Nothing was ever good enough. No matter what you said or offered the customer, it was never good enough. Management always looking for negatives, never positives.  I learned a lot about customer service. Co-workers were great."
good,"Bad work environment.  "
good,"Compensation used to be awesome, and when it was it was worth working somewhere that was a corporate disaster, the money was worth working somewhere that you hate - it sucked you into staying with the company because of the high compensation.  But, everyday we (the sales reps) would complain about how much they hated this place, couldn't stand management (most haven't sold anything in years, but still keep their position because of tenure and favoritism), if you have anything negative to say - keep it to yourself, or you will slowly be pushed out; premise female manager is a horrible leader with no coaching skills, or sales ability - she just micromanages everyone, threats to fire you if you don't hit budget - yet, has no advise on how to do it, very demotivating place. After the compensation plan was cut in half, it was no longer worth it to work in that environment."
good,worked 12 hour days and in bad neighborhoods . company had great benefits and lots of training available .
good,"daily sales meetings before your shift starts, greet customers and try your best to get them to add lines, upgrade, or buy accessories no matter what they came in for.  after each transaction your manager comes up to you to ""criticize"" how you could have sold more to the customer.  I did like working with the technology, and it was right up my alley to show people new things about their device that they didn't know before, but you don't get paid for that.  This position is all about sales, which is why most customers that came in for tech problems got mistreated.  It's definitely a dog eat dog environment, with tons of cherry pickers that make most of the money.  I will say that Verizon does invest a lot in training exercises and their intentions are somewhat pretty good to help their employees feel like the company cares about them."
good,"very good benefits, including 401K generous package and health care,and likable co-workers. But they do not like you to use your sick time and will try to talk you into coming to work if you're ill, to the point of harassment. Also management doesn't like you to use your sick time to visit a dying close relative in the hospital and will give you trouble for calling in sick to do that. All of my co-workers were also harassed when they tried to use their sick time, so this was not only me. They are very anti union and in every meeting, they urge their employees not to join a union, even though I worked there for six years and was never, not even one time, approached to be in a union. Lots of sales pressure, even if you didn't know that your job would be doing sales, it is."
good,I found this job to be fun but the pay could be better. The probability to advance is not always there. They typically hire within so that is a bonus.
good,Is the picture they paint - its one giant bureaucracy.  Benefits are great and if you don't work hard you may get promoted for no reason. Good Luck!
good,"This is a great starter job, however it is not a company in which you will retire more than likely."
good,VZW is a good company who pays the employees for their performance.  They provide extras for the employees on a monthly basis.
good,"I begin work with mourning meeting for workday overview.  Begin the day by getting supplies and getting truck the days job.  Next is to travel to job site and perform the necessary requirements to complete the job. After completion of the job,  one of the best parts of the day is to see the satisfaction and enjoyment on the faces of my customers.  Even though there is very little interaction with other co work,  the end of the day there was some interaction with other co workers and that would help break up the hard part of the job."
good,"0 - Techinical Learning"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Call center, fast paced, constantly changing. The pay and benefits are the best thing about that place."
good,"This job has a lot of great benefits and you are able to make some decent money but it takes up your whole life. Verixon wants you to live and breathe their company. They start off by saying how they believe in work life balance but once you are out of training they work you 9+ hours a day even if the store is slow. They say they are willing to work with different life situations but being a single mom they have not tried to work with my schedule with daycare at all. I close almost every day I work. This causes me to have to pay extra for childcare and I rarely get to see my son."
good,"Currently I am working on special team called the Network Evolution Group. My primary function is assisting customer who are calling in to report trouble with their phone or internet service. My duty is to try to convince the customer to migrate from copper service to our new fiber optic network. In addition to repair calls I'm responsible for inbound calls regarding billing inquiries, product/service information and payment arrangements. Responsible for having thorough knowledge of phone, internet and video bundle packages as well as pricing. Principle link between company and consumer must be able to exceed the customer expectations."
good,"I started out as a customer service consultant and enjoyed taking calls from customers and answering their questions or solving their complaints, directing them in new services or transferring service because of a move.  There was time allotted to complete orders and notes, which meant few errors or inconvenience to the customer.  But through the years, it became a sales position and before long, an unattainable monthly goal.  It became part of our job to try to sell elderly customers questioning a slight increase in their bill a package with DirecTv, high speed dsl and a long distance plan.  We had to overcome their objections twice and work with the knowledge that any manager could be listening to you at any time from a remote area only to critique and warn that you had to do better.  Other employees started to be suspended or terminated for not meeting sales goals.  It was an environment of low moral and stressed workers that became almost intolerable to endure.  I once had major back surgery and was suspended upon the day of my return for my absence.  I later filed my first grievance against the company and won, reimbursing me for my time without pay.  The most enjoyable part of the job by far was the vast amount of lifelong friendships made and the wonderful people who worked there."
good,Best Place I ever worked. Nice People in Management.My Co-workers were nice and very helpful.
good,changes in the company made it hard to do your duties at times.
good,"try to get customers to buy as much as possible "
good,Weekends and evenings are not required but are a must to meet sales goals and earn better compensation. 100% commission based pay. Co-workers are a great group of motivated and fun individuals. Physically non demanding position but can be mentally exhausting at times. Hard to maintain a personal/work balance due to customer calls and long weekend and evening hours. Recent changes have proven to be a plus and the local market seems to be benefiting from that change. Overall a good environment but the lack of a guaranteed salary can be difficult with high and low months. Recent changes to certain pay aspects have lowered potential earnings.
good,The benefits are the greatest thing about this job.  The work itself is not ideal especially seeing as the management commands perfection in an imperfect system.  Very stressful!!
good,"I worked for 5 years at Verizon Telecom and I must say the first 2 years were some of the best an employee could ask for. My last few years of employment were not ideal due to constant changes in protocol and contract disputes that stripped away benefits that fellow employees worked and fought for years to gain. The benefits and pay  scales is some of the best in the business. Though the work environment and culture is lacking for a Multi-billion dollar company, you would expect them to show more appreciation for their employees. Especially since they do not pay taxes yet are able to claim a return each year. During my last year employed by Verizon multiple employees were given an option to take paltry voluntary termination package to leave or risk layoff with almost no compensation. Effectively placing employees between a rock and a hard place."
good,Verizon Wireless is a good company to work as a Sales Representative for if you thrive in a high-pressure sales environment.  Management is extremely numbers-focused and is not particularly concerned with the customer experience.  Management varied from excellent to very poor depending on style and location.  Low job security as the company is rapidly downsizing.
good,"Imperative to my job is that, in the least, I am building client relationships through face to face interaction and uncovering needs unknown to the consumer. I then match these needs and desires with company product and services."
good,"This was a very stressful job. You can forget having a family life."
good,Extremely busy call center and highly micromanaged. Make sure you know a good stress relief counselor!
good,"it was great.  incompatibility with current manager, but all previous experiences with the company were positive."
good,"Verizon was a good place to work for, although their focus tends to wander from true cost effectiveness, more concerned on the dollar."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I was told what I wanted to hear to get me into a position on third shift by management. They don't train you on something until you are written up.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with management.  They expect people to be ""experts"" in 3hour training sessions. Most enjoyable part is the crew on thirds. Very easy going."
good,"Working a sales position can be a rewarding one, however working for Verizon Wireless has been a taxing one indeed. This is due to working in Verizon's retail channel. Having to deal with the inconsistencies of working a retail schedule can be hard on anyone, but it is especially difficult for someone trying to go to school or raise a family. "
good,"•	Software Developer with Verizon Network Systems portfolio"
good,"Contacting existing customers to retain service and also adding additional features to their accounts. Following up with my business clients to add or renew service items. Creating promotions to increase company revenuer while boosting employee moral. Also assisted my peers in staffing, sales and following up on current promotions. Making sure the sale representatives are excited and educated on the most current services and continue to accept change. Keeping up with the direction of the companies change and challenges."
good,"A typical day at work consists of a 10-12 hour day packed with meetings."
good,"Good compensation, but you will work for it. You will learn everyday"
good,Enjoyed motivating and developing my team. Learned a lot of great skill sets for future careers.
good,I personally worked with a great bunch of people.  I learned to be patient and understanding with customers.
good,"Daily work is enjoyable. A different situation arises each time a new customer walks through the door. A great place to learn patience and different sales practices. Most of the employees were friends of mine before starting the position which has made/molded us into one big, happy family. The toughest part of the job is the hours spent away from my family. Love my wife and children, just would desire more time to spend with them. Most enjoyable aspect is the opportunity to build relationships with all different types of people on a daily basis. Like I stated originally, you never know what will walk through the door next!"
good,In the area I worked in you were on the phone and computer the entire day. You are measured on everything and it can be quite stressful. Even the time you us to go to the bathroom or stretch is monitored and counted towards your daily stats.
good,"I get to work Between 2:30 pm to preparing for the day. Many times there are upper-management and mid-level manager meetings scheduled during this time that I attend. At 4:15 the IT Techs prepare to start work. Most of them want to chat a little bit before there shift start, during this time I ensure they are in a positive mindset and ensure that they are ready to focus on the tasks they need to accomplish. While They start getting ready to jump to the phones I make sure I have listen the calls they handled yesterday to make sure that I identify any gaps in knowledge or skills and address then quickly and during my coaching sessions with them. During lunch times, I do follow up interactions with each team member to again judge their attitude and mindset and correct negative mindsets . After lunch my main focus is on performing call quality observations, technical trainings, performance evaluations, and also handling escalated customer situations. Sometimes there is more work than I can accomplish, but the secret is to manage my time well and the job always will  be done, even if I have to put in additional hours throughout the week. I get home Between 1:30 a.m. or 2:00 a.m., I prepared myself a sandwich eat alone, my family is sleep by time. Next day morning I start doing my school work Typically Takes Me from one to two hours to finish it. In some cases I have to type up a test, study guide, worksheet or paper and it take a bit longer."
good,"The work life balance is next to impossible with anything other than an opening shift, the standards for leading and performing are extremely high and add a lot of unneeded stress to the job."
good,"Very fast paced retail environment with ever changing challenges everyday. I get to meet and help different people with their wireless solutions."
good,Very upbeat atmosphere with constant customer contact. Sales were completely self driven I was able to control my own paycheck. Management tended to be slightly repetitive. Hardest part of the job was the the lunch schedule being completely controlled by customer traffic. 
good,"The job is very fun and rewarding, yet very challenging and demanding.  Upper management seems to have lost touch with reality, placing extraordinarily high demands on employees.  Commissions have been cut therefore work is increasing but pay is decreasing.  Work life balance is a big challenge."
good,As a long time employee of six years which in sales years at Verizon is considered a long time I can say that the company has taken good care of me for most of that time.  The company has excellent benefits good pay but it is retail and the hours and time off you have will be poor as expected.  You are married to your work you will here management and employees often say and in some cases you have to be.  Overall its a good place to start but depending on where you work it is very difficult to move up the chain of command.  The company is very aggressive and they need to be in order to remain the biggest and best at what they do.  You will be held to standards most may not be suitable to deal with but if you do as you should and work hard they will do their best to compensate.
good,"Friendly co workers"
good,"A typical day at work includes managers going over new products and services that are or will be launching, checking the sales floor for any price changes or product movement, taking customers that come in for all kinds of reasons like phone trouble shooting, billing questions, upgrading to new phones, and so much more. with each customer that comes in i try to build a good relationship with them to find out about a typical day in there life so i can see if i can find any need for our other products and services. Dealing with a customer escalation is just another part of the day, it could be billing or phone issues that upset customer where i handle the situation by finding out the problem and fixing it when it is in my power to do so if not i will bring in a manager to help in getting to a resolution for the customer. Also understanding how to use and sell a large product line up of phones, tablets, home services and accessories that go with all of it. maintaining my goals for the month and the day."
good,MCI was a great company
good,"This company overall was a great place to work for. However it is very bureaucratic. After starting in the call center and advanced quickly to tech support, from their my development was halted. I then moved over to retail sales, and was advanced quickly again, but came to see the nasty side of the company. The retail side of the business is a group of individuals. The management does little to encourage their employees to succeed, but ensures their failure. There are no continual metrics, and everything resets month to month. The company hemorrhage money left and right. And instead of adjusting this over site they demand higher sales from the top line employees. Lastly, the company says it operates by a ""credo"" however the actions of every employee at the company speak a different story."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Over the past 15 years I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to work in a customer service call center, provide training to other associates, lead a team of workers offering FiOS services to Verizon's premier HOA community, perform ride-a-longs with technicians, work with engineering assistants in the copper and fiber units, and be an advocate for customers that have filed complaints with the Local Franchise Authority, Attorney General, Better Business Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, and Verizon Executive Offices. A typical day consists of handling multiple tasks so it is imperative to be able to manage my time. My work is done with minimal supervision and our team of 8 will seek assistance from each other, when needed. The most difficult part of my job can be handling the workload of 4 people at times but the most enjoyable part is when I have completed all my assigned tasks and have made a positive rs.difference for the company and for my customer."
good,"The work is not difficult, though it is demanding. The compensation and benefits are actually quite good. My co-workers overall are extremely intelligent and hardworking. I have enjoyed the work for the most part over the years I've been there, but it has become exceedingly obvious my opportunity to advance can no longer be accomplished through hard work and a good work ethic. I came to do a job, and have risen through the ranks through distinguishing myself from my peers; no easy task given how the majority are as I described earlier on. I have hit a limit, however, on further growth opportunity. I do not play office politics. I come to work, and I simply ask for recognition when I do well."
good,"Overnight dispatch supervisor for the NDC, responsible for the proper operation of all Verizon central offices in New Jersey. Ensure the proper personnel per qualifications were dispatched to troubleshoot the indicated problem(s) a central office would indicate it was experiencing. Also was WFA-DI administer for the New Jersey. A system that monitored the alarms in each central office and compiled reports using statistics and an exclusive logo-rhythm that I would organize via coding into legible printouts."
good,"I learned a lot during my years there, as well as made great friendships that continue through this day. We did good work, and were and are proud of that."
good,I liked the co-workers. The benefits were great for the company. Management really need help in the company. Many managers lack management skills and drive a lot of employees away. I love the company itself its incredible. The work schedules are horrible as you have to bid on schedules. It is very hard to advance within the company. I was there over 3 years and did my Job exceptionally well and still stayed in the same position. I enjoyed talking to customers. The hardest thing about the job was working the not so good schedules bid after bid.
good,No real support for the staff. Workers were not happy about working for the company
good,"I worked for verizon for two years, the company was poorly managed. more or less i stayed just so i could pay my bills. I eventually found better work and gave my two weeks notice with a smile on my face."
good,"Connecting with customers on a cultural level, would help my team and I hit sales goals and satisfy customer needs more accurately. The reason I know this is because our strongest relationships established with customers in our demographic area, were loyal customers who would bring in many referrals and new business. By honoring a customer's culture, you are empowering them to use our devices and technology to communicate globally. This was the true value of our product at Verizon Wireless. We knew that by fully uncovering and understanding our customer's needs were the key ingredients for success. I learned how to manage a mid sized team and create a fun work environment. One that allowed our employees to transfer the fun they were having and educating our customers on the countless capabilties of our devices. Customers were grateful to see their loved ones overseas, especially military families."
good,"As a CSR in a structured call center environment, I provided excellent customer phone support. Provided tech support to customers with cell phone devices and their needs. Evaluating, and negotiating contracts and bill fees, selling mobile devices."
good,"A typical day at work is to approach Verizon wireless customers that enter the store. First, we are to loop the customer to determine whether the customer has existing Verizon home services of not. If Yes, then it's my job to let the customer know if there are better promotions that are available for the customer. If Not, then it's my job to show the promtions and bundle offers that are going on with the line of service. Also, to build my relationships with the Verizon wireless staff so I can recieve some referrals from the reps (and vice versa.) The hardest part of the job is working in a state where there is a high level of saturation and very little expansion. The most enjoyable part is the relationships that I've built along my journey with this company."
good,Great Co-Workers
good,I would always have ustomers upset and calling me names over the phone when techs wouldn't do the job right or wouldn;t show up at all.
good,"Multi-unit Manager responsible for five locations with five location supervisors and 30-37 sales consultants. Staffing Coordinator for two Orlando Districts consisting of 42 locations. Responsibilities included: HR liaison, recruiting, interviewing, hiring decisions, scheduling of training and travel/hotel accommodations"
good,"inbound call center with a great training department and benefits. Too corporate and ""by-the-book"" for its own good"
good,"A great marketing development program that allows new marketing professionals to rotate through different marketing departments to gain a breadth of experience. However, with less placements for marketing, there are fewer opportunities for advancement."
good,"Verizon as a place of employment is a demanding environment. The company is continually working to increase productivity through reductions in work force and reorganizations, as well as major changes in support procedures. Depending on what group you may report into, there can often be some flexibility in terms of allowing remote work (e.g. work from home, either some days/week or in some cases FT remote work). Benefits have been honed back over the years, so they are not as good as many other companies. Pay is fairly competitive, if annual bonus is included (bonus runs usually from 7-10% of base pay). Opportunities for advancement within the company are somewhat limited."
good,I enjoyed working for verizon although it was a temporary assignment.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Good job overall. Management is there to help and will when available. At times management does have a lot on there plate and as a result brush off employees. Hardest part of the job is the repetitiveness. Constantly going over the same contracts same pricing structure. Most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with clients. Must be a people person in order to handle this occupation.
good,"Verizon offers outstanding pay and benefits buts Thats about it. it is a highly rigid company submerged under bureaucracy. They preach flexibility and adaptability but they micromanage heavily, and are not open to new ideas frequently. Too many managers and very few leaders. The life work balance is horrible, there is typical none. Verizon does not respect personal life..its all about work all the time and that gets old."
good,"Typical day consisted of answering heavy inbound call volume,"
good,typical day at work. Training is fun. Not flexible at all when it comes to schedule.
good,"What to say - inbound call center- high stress-can not please the management staff no matter how well you do. The company has great product, but beat up the employees"
good,Company's benefits and work/life balance are great. Company offers medical and dental benefits. Tuition Reimbursement available to allow you to further your education and training.
good,"A typical day consisted of taking inbound calls from existing customers who have service, device, and/or billing related issues. Working in the call-center taught me a great deal about working with tough to please customers and I acquired a wealth of knowledge regarding wireless technology. Management within the company is extremely inconsistent and lacks accountability. The hardest part about the job is adjusting to the shift scheduling. All new hires upon completion of training work from 3pm until midnight with no weekends off. I worked for the company for over three years and still worked the same shift until midnight which included weekends and holidays."
good,This company has really good benefits but the supervisors don't want to do their job properly and favoritism is showed toward supervisor pets
good,A typical day was good got to meet a lot of people. I learned how to communicate well and sell products. Management was poor.
good,"Professionally speaking, Verizon is not a bad company to work for if you are motivated. Management started to move around in my last year working there. Wasn't entirely stable and there were times of insecurity. Metric focused culture. You will be let go if you do not perform. More pressure on the sales team, of course."
good,hard to manage personal and work life in retail. Learned the consulative approach to selling. upper management can set unattainable goals.
good,"The Verizon FSC is a prototypical call center environment. It's a union office, so many items for the associates are non negotiable. The salary and benefits are outstanding which is what drives the majority of employees. The office had an issue with morale and remained that way for many years as the management team started to push the numbers over behaviors."
good,"Fast pace job, Commission bases and hourly"
good,"It used to be a great place to work, when Nortel was doing well. Worked hard and took care of our customers accounts with pride and"
good,Compensation and benefits are good. Employees are rewarded for high sales numbers. Work life balance is poor.
good,"A typical day involves generating customer's when foot-traffic is low using different resources, such as cold calling previous and potential customers, Flyer handout at local shopping centers, E-mailing customers for referrals. When customer's are in the store, I am to assist them in every possible way. This may involve customer service regarding troubleshooting damaged/defective devices or assisting certain Billing problems. The most important skills i have learned from this job is enhancing my sales skills and my ability to persuade customer's to maximize my sales. Using different techniques such as emotionally connecting to customers, i have learned how to get the customer to buy more. My co-workers are amazing people who have taught me the value of working with a team. They have helped me grow and develope my skills as i have helped and develop theirs. The hardest part of the job is generating traffic. The goal of each day is to never ""Zero"" out, or in layman terms avoid not selling anything that day. There will be times when times are slow and customer's do not come in to the store. It is those times that make the jobs hardest. The most enjoyable part of the job is my ability to work as I please. I have earned my position as lead representative at my store by repeatedly meeting all quotas, therefore I bear the most resposibility, which I have come to enjoy."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I work directly with the customer's. When customer's are upset, I am the one who puts out the ""fire"" by creating unique solutions to complex issues to ensure that our customers are satisfied."
good,"Sales with VZW is tough. Customers treat you lousy and the schedule is never convenient. Benefits are fantastic, and pay is pretty good... work with all kinds of different people and very competitive"
good,"Although the appearance is one of an open door policy very little is done with suggestions from the front line in making the behind the scenes work better for the customer and associates. The company offers wonderful benefits and salary which is needed for the many emotional, mental and physical breakdowns. New procedures are set in place by those who are disconnected from the customer and the employees that will utilize them. New procedures and processes are communicated almost monthly by those who are thinking of ways to prove that their jobs are essential instead of looking for ways to make the work flow."
good,"Verizon was a nice place to work when they offered long term incentives. They seem to be cutting back a lot over the years, and they change commissions almost annually. You usually work overtime especially during the holidays with a retail sales job. This wouldn't be the job for you if you cant handle rush periods in business, and customers that cuss at you and blame you for company policy. You definitely learn to not take things personally, can be stressful for some due to quota. Overall people higher up come up with these silly policies which can be very awkward when applying to your daily job. But they try and make you almost robotic like with all this specific terminology they want you to use with every customer every time. Its just too repetitive. Verizon also makes you take dozens of online trainings throughout the year to stay up to date on phones and company changes. Co-workers for most part are great except for the ones that try and steal your sales or b-back customers. Its almost like caring for immature high school students depending on which location you work at. People wont clean up after themselves and you most likely will not like going to the Friday Morning meetings or calling customers/ businesses on your day off to a small business get together that actually doesn't exist."
good,Verizon is a great place to work and offers great benefits. Work day is typically 8 hours but there are opportunities to flex and complete overtime.
good,Enter the job site sit at a work station and get ready to take 800+ calls from customers a day. Learned about 411 Operators and how the companys that post there information dont always use the same names people see outside their stores. Management seemed all about their numbers and making their quotas to get their bonuses. Management rarely seemed to care about the employee and how they were doing. Co-workers at the same level or so were quite nice and understanding since we all dealt with the same stuff and could talk about things. Unfortunately management does not like us bad mouthing customers that have been making our day overly chaotic. Hardest job day was having management take us aside to discuss customer complaints that in most cases were lies about us and what we did or did not say. Enjoyable part of the job was at least having one and getting paid for our hard nerve racking work.
good,High turnover. The company is excellent but customer care has no soul nor heart.
good,"If you like helping people then you will both love and hate this job. The management is wonderful and they make every effort to support the employess and to make it a less streeful environment. The main problem is that they can't. The very reason it is so stressful is the customers. They are the reason you have the job and the reason you come to hate the job. Spending 8 hours a day being a designated punching bag takes its toll. If you can handle being screamed at, called various crude, rude and demeaning names, being treated like you personally ruined their day AND you can keep a smile on your face, then this might be the job for you."
good,"Union job with good benefits. Learned to perform quality job and satisfy customer. Hardest part of job was working out in the elements, particularly rain. Most enjoyable part was the seeing customers truly satisfied with my installation efforts and quality."
good,"average , always a learning experience,you however have to be liked to get promoted and the HR department does not defend the workers, many supervisors and directors have no idea what they are doing , they just know someone to get their jobs. Morale is at its lowest always"
good,Good learning experience. I met some good people and learned the wireless industry.
good,Good benefits - too much change and no growth within Marketing
good,A typical day is setting out to cover a portion of Southwest Georgia working with business owners in all categories.
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company but it really depends upon what department you are in. You can fare well in just about any department but Customer Service. I know too many people that left and when to various positions outside of service and the difference was as big as night and day. The benefits are good and the phone discount was excellent. I left the company to move on to greener pastures and I wish you job seekers much luck.....do remember to stay out of service
good,old fashioned real customer service is what I do best ... I believe you can still look out for the company all the while make a customer completely happy... that is a win win combination and I don't believe verizon believes in that standard of service
good,Non stop customer situations. Management is there to help as much as possible. Expectations are almost unattainable.
good,Depending on who is handling the call for the end consumer there is no definitve rules. Customers are treated differently in every call center of every day. The Customer Service reps have the right to give or not issue credits and depending one their attitude some customers have extreme hardships.
good,The company has very good medical and dental plans. They also have a yearly bonus which is nice. The company also pays well.
good,"However, it's kind of a young company, needs sometime to growing-up and mutual. It's QA menagement team needs to be re-shape it up."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good Benefits, very fast pace, advancement opportunity not quick."
good,"My impression of the larger company as a whole is very good; during my time with Verizon in my particular job the scheduling demands were extremely difficult and shifts changed unpredictably every six weeks, making this an undesirable position for me."
good,"This is a great company for the young adult to start a great career in customer service. If you love working for a forward thinking company, this is the place for you."
good,High turnover and no appreciation for employees. Customer service employees are made to feel that they are expendable. Employees are fired for trivial reasons. They are constantly advertising for employees because they cannot the ones that they have.
good,Growth opportunities very diverse laid back I enjoyed working there but the micro managing could be better. If you looking to get some head start experience I recommend this place
good,"While the culture isn’t bad, our culture and crew teams truly care about inclusivity  employee morale is sinking due to high stress levels. The company promotes growth, though it isn’t practiced often."
good,"The company was promising of inclusion and growth. Told hard work resulted in opportunities, but when the center I worked for closed the opportunities shrank to nothingness and the remote representatives became castaways.  The company needs to find a way to balance it’s initiatives between brick and mortar and the home bound agents."
good,My overall work environment is good.  I really like my job but there is very little flexibility. I really like the CEO and Management.  My peers are very nice.
good,"Pros: work at home, JUST ANSWER CALLS, great discounts "
good,I worked at Verizon for several years.  Employees were always treated with respect and their opinion mattered.  They administered an annual employee opinion survey and the results were taken very seriously.
good,A good place to start your career but once you are in the project the pressure gets to you. Management is very old and not up to date with technology so they rely of juniors to deliver. No proper Org structure
good,"Great Benefits for everyone who is hired within the company!"
good,"From a contracted employee perspective, they could be doing more to ensure a full integration into the lifestyle and vision of the company. Communication is poor, and there are no resources to allow you to gain traction on any of your projects."
good,"Verizon is truly an okay place to work. Compensation is great for the job, it does come with a lot of mental stress that not everyone can deal with. It feels like everyday there is something new added on to your plate of what to worry about. Verizon does its best to assist employees. Each manager will be different and trigger a diff response from workers."
good,"There is a lot of opportunities to move up if you desire. It is a sales environment mostly that can tend to be cutthroat. If you are ok punching the clock, this is a good fit"
good,A typical day at Verizon was not typical.  Variety of tasks kept the job interesting.  Collaborating with others in the group was a great experience and everyone behaved in a professional manner and yet were easy going and willing to contribute and participate.
good,"(I worked at a corporate location)"
good,"Good company to join. However, my experience in last year, the interview process or the selection process is very slow. Over phone, they call for an interview.Once interview is cleared and they say don't have budget for the the 40 percent hike."
good,"Collectively, Verizon can be a rewarding and fun work environment, provided one regularly meets the required sales quota each month. The atmosphere is intense and very competitive, which may be exhaustive at times but it very much helps to cultivate ones composure."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon Wireless is a great place to work  if you are just coming to work and work only. I  would not get involved in anything else at all.Do your job and take care of your family.
good,hard work did alot of walking when your outside. Work very long shifts day in and out 7 days a week stress could get to you and managers wouldn't help out much
good,I worked there when it was directory assistance and pay phones were still a thing. It used to be very fast paced.  I started when it was called Bell Atlantic. I liked getting paid every week.
good,"12 managers in less than 9 years, work/life balance is sometimes balanced...other times not so much, culture trying to reach millennials but sometimes losing benefits of an experienced workforce."
good,Too Many changes in the company. Commission lacks. best for entry level people not a career. Goals are that the company are going for are unreal and will not happen for all workers which then put their job on the line
good,"I would love to say that this was a great place to work, however, that will not be the case.  This job required incredible amounts of personal time and they kept demanding more and taking more time."
good,"I enjoyed working on the front lines with the Solutions Specialists as a Solutions Manager. We worked long hours without taking breaks or lunches as it was not encouraged for us to leave the sales floor. Upper management created opportunities for tenured employees and did not value performance based metrics as basis for promotion."
good,"Great benefits, high call volume, must be able to de-escalate callers.  Flexible, PTO, Vacation and sick time.  Call center hrs 7am-9pm.  Shift bids est every 6 months."
good,"Work/ Life balance is less than desirable. Long hours, extended shifts. Good benefits with medical, dental, 401k. This is a retail job so that comes with some difficulties dealing with the public."
good,"I worked in marketing for several months and enjoyed the experience. I wasn't able to get more involved with the team, which was unfortunate and hindered my capability to do my job."
good,I feel the company as a whole took great care of the employee's. As a contractor I felt like an outsider compared to the employees. Coworkers acted like was trying to take their job when I did a good task. The company itself had a great atmosphere and seemed to really care about their full time employees.
good,Good work environment.  Office was nice.  Lots of independent work with high expectations.  Constantly changing priorities.  Fast paced environment...
good,A typical day at a retail location includes informing customers of products and different services Verizon offers and technical assistance with guests devices.
good,"As a sales rep you will be constantly under pressure and at times you will feel uncomfortable but is part of the challenge , the organization is very good and supportive and it all depends on who is your manager and Assistant Manager. I had great managers but my ASM since he also work on commission was rather competition than willing to help."
good,Verizon Wireless is a good company to work for.  They offer good compensation and benefits.  There area of opportunity is in their work life balance.  They have an opportunity to step up with the times like Apple and Google and offer more work from home jobs.  The workplace culture was kind of all over the place.  My first few yrs at VZW the culture was great however it changed over the yrs.
good,Verizon has a lot of potential if you dont mind hustling. Use your time wisely while you work there and you can make the best of it. The one key thing I do not like about it is that your arent really compensated enough for the work you put it. They need to pay their frontline employees more especially now they have to battle the internet and fight off its present. If you want it you can make a decent living here.
good,"In the capacity in which I work, the duties of the job are fine and the work itself is fine. My consternation comes from the culture. I'm sure it's not like this in throughout the company, but there is definitely a culture of fear manifested within my slice of the organization. It makes an otherwise enjoyable job hard to enjoy."
good,They have great benefits your hours are based 50 percent tenure and 50 percent performance you bid for a new schedule approximately every six months be flexible
good,"Get the benefits..... you will ultimately need them. Several times a week  the paramedics were at the Columbia SC location to scoop someone up off of the floor....... usually alive; a time or two dead.  Hyper stressful. I am no longer on three different medications once I removed this stress inducing job from my life. You’re paid well though, until you die; but even then your family gets 3 times your salary minimum"
good,"It’s hard work, and can be cut throat, but they pay well with great Benifts. They value you but they would get rid of you in a blink of a eye . I’ve seen them do job cuts to people that have been loyal for years and years.  But everyone has a Expiration date."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I helped customers with phone plans while guiding them to a new phone that I felt best fit their needs, and after about a month or so, I would reach out via CRM to ensure they were happy and understood their purchase. I encouraged all customers to come back and see me with any questions or problems I could assist them with. I typically opened alone and worked the store by myself, helping up to 3 customers at a time while letting my customers waiting in line know that I would be with them as soon as possible. It was very typical to have higher management and corporate higher ups around, making sure we were helping our customers to the fullest extent."
good,Worked in AL and SC and both jobs had people in management positions that shouldn't of been in that job title. Fun place with great benefits and events keep you going
good,The job was interesting but was enjoyable because of the customers that we knew it was a great experience and a even better learning experience I enjoy sales but was having a hard time with previous owners of the buildings
good,"Commission Driven, Customer Service is primary responsibility. I only worked in the position as a part-time sales rep. during my senior year in college."
good,"Typical retail sales environment with better than average benefits. You can make a lot of money, but work/life balance is poor. Must give up some of your morality to hit sales goals and make managers happy."
good,Working at Verizon is a great place to suceed in future endevors.  I learn to be more patient and listen to my customers as well as my supervisors. Great company for epansion.
good,"Customer Service and Supervisor Experience. Reducing company losses while maintaining great and courteous customer service. Successful at managing and implementing process improvement. Detail oriented and proactive with strong communication, interpersonal and time management abilities."
good,"It was a good job, i just feel that my skills can be put to work in a different environment. Sometimes it can be overwhelming and i didn't have the support needed."
good,"Good company to work for but at the same time micro management is their downfall, Very hard for advancement, college degree may help with jobs like engineering"
good,"Verizon was a great employer to work for.  I learned a lot over my career at Verizon.  "
good,"Had better days, up until 6 years ago. It became a very stressful environment with what I felt lack management support. Every employee is overwhelm with their work load and it impacts the quality of work being deployed. You also never know when your last day of employment will be since they are constant layoffs. Most of the onshore folks are great to work with, but offshore is a different story."
good,"Working for Verizon was a challenging and productive time. It's great having an established brand identity that helps to land customer meetings. However, it is such a large organization, innovation is somewhat stifled."
good,Fun place to work but every workplace has its issues. Here it was the compensation and the quota demand which lead to a lot of bad habits to be formed within the staff.
good,No review of Verizon is included in posting this resume.  I was not there long enough to provide a complete review of Verizon. I did not have enough engagement during this time
good,"I worked at Verizon full-time Great opportunity to work with top echelon people and cutting edge technology. Competitive pay, 401k match, good vacation allowance, yearly bonus, profit share, monthly phone bill discount, tuition assistance."
good,"i enjoyed my time in verizon i got to learn alot from them , thanks to them i am the man i am today . thank you for all the knowledge without it today i would be lost"
good,Enjoyed the job but people made the environment tense.  Sales driven store that was competitive between the consultants.  Bonuses were sometimes hard to calculate so we’re often not what you expected
good,"Customer service ,sales environment. Also experience in call center, very team and goal oriented. Very fast learner, leadership driven. Team player..."
good,"Work life balance is good. You are punished for your success. When you work hard to get great results, your targets will be raised that results on adverse impact to your compensation. Local leadership is good. Can't trust senior leadership to take care of their sales reps. Due to recent organizational changes, we lost half of our accounts and yet quotas went up."
good,"Very much enjoyed my experience, would highly recommend.  If you are going to work for the company, I highly suggest making sure to work in an office environment as opposed to a remote employee so you are more connected to the company as a whole."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Usually a faster pace high demand job. expected to work on tight schedules and in all types of weather conditions. maintaining a quality of work and good customer interaction and satisfaction
good,"Good job fun environment cool managers, pay started to decline over the years. But still fun. The rewards for top performers was really good too. A lot of trips taken"
good,"I do not work for Verizon, I work for a third party administrator for Verizon which is Conduent.  I do not see how processing this information will assist you."
good,"Verizon gives a lot of lip service to how much they care about their employees, but when push comes to shove top performers get treated like royalty and anyone who can't hit their insane sales targets is going to have a hard time."
good,Direct management is the best. It’s the management that’s over them that is not so good. The company does compensate ok. However they raise monthly quotas so you have to work harder to make the same money.
good,"I liked the job, loved the hours and the location. I had hoped to stay, but after 2 months, I was released via email due to ""parameters and dynamics."""
good,Contractors aren’t treated fairly. A lot of work for small amount of pay and more responsibilities are added on down the road with no extra compensation.
good,Good company but the climate change is for the worst. The company has been lowering the pay scale for the lower employees while high end corporate employees tend to get all the raises. Benefits one continue to get worse year after year.
good,"Was an educational workplace that taught me a lot about sales, was tough on goals and expectations. Would recommend for first time salesperson and those interested in retail sales."
good,had a lot of fun here but would only have a complaint about how many sales websites there were to make a sale as far as using these websites to see if client is eligible for certain products.
good,They want you to sell no matter what it takes. Not afraid to screw over the customer for sales. Only hire people with good sales number for managers even if they aren’t qualified.
good,it wasn't boring work it had its positives and negatives about it.the managers were pretty cool and laid back.the work environment itself wasn't hard at all.
good,"Nice healthcare options, believe company pays 82% of total cost.  Great bonuses for IT.  Yearly headcount reductions, with each cut more work falls on those that remain, company no longer mentions work/life balance."
good,Compensation plan had changed and made it difficult to make money. Industry and culture was changing and made the environment less appealing to work for.
good,"Advice to Management"
good,"Started sales career here. They were open minded even though I had zero experience. Tough option for a long term career as entire Cable TV market has already been tapped, so not much new opportunity."
good,"Stressful inbound call center, must meet your numbers or will not keep your job long. Pay and opportunities are good. Company provides a lot of benefits and amenities."
good,"Good company to work for.   Fun culture and atmosphere.  Reasonable goals,  relaxed dress code a d good culture.   Would recommend to a friend.  It was decent."
good,"long hours, out of hours work, no life balance, overworked, more with less, outsourcing IT, Stressful, used to have good people, layoffs every 6 months"
good,Excellent benefits packages and time off but very political.  The work environment was very technologically advanced.  Work from home is available and supported in most cases.  I was wrongfully terminated by management because I couldn't make it in to the office (documented reasons) and I had a full-time telework arrangement in place that was approved all the way up to the VP level.  New management came in and had a target on my back for 6 months.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a good Company to work for.  However it can be a pressure cooker type environment.  They can regularly expect the work and production of several people to be done by one person.   It is normal to be on your cell phone and laptop well in to the late night after you get home from work.
good,It’s was a nice learning experience nothing great they don’t real my train you on the operating system and expect you to learn everthing on you’re own
good,"The management always wants you to sell even though sometimes it doesn’t make any sense, like for example, someone wants to pay a bill and has a new phone, they try and have you sell them another add-on like a tablet or Fios"
good,It was a great place to work most of the time. Verizon wireless did have a great benefits package. I enjoyed learning state of the art technology. And helping explaining this to the end user.
good,Verizon is a very liberal minded company that does not treat all employees with respect. They claim they do but do not. It's hard to keep a balance between your personal life and work life. They go back on a lot of the promises they make to you in the interview. But if you don't mind the stress of high quotas and constantly having more expected out of you without the compensation to go with it then it's a great place to work..
good,"A great company to work for, team oriented, competitive great work culture, fast paced great benefits, great leadership and management always room for advancement."
good,My position at Verizon required a very self motivated person. I worked with them for a very long time and never had a problem with management or my coworkers.
good,"nice place to gain customer service skills, learning technology and a place to ineract with other people. the work - life balance is very good and u make good commission"
good,"I worked on the retail side and really enjoyed working with the Verizon team. While the culture was nice, there wasn't a lot of opportunity for movement."
good,"Lot of stress work with production changes during MW."
good,"While many people working for third party retailers are ACTUALLY nice people that care, it is VERY likely to find a rep who has to rely on sales tactics to make their paycheck. It is kind of sad how far some relatively sane individuals will go to secure themselves financially in this establishment."
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for in terms of benefits & compensation, but the stress can be a little much sometimes. With the amount of pressure they put on the employees & managers, if you're not getting the help you need, it can be very overwhelming & stressful."
good,"Our contract was with Verison (EMS) and it was a rewarding atmosphere,beacuse I was relied on for many various functions,and was very much appreciated."
good,Treated as a number and not as a person who knew what their job was. Managers running across the office yelling at you to sit down when you had to go to the bathroom
good,"You’re treated as a body that sells. Not a human being. If you follow their at times deceitful ways of selling you can get paid very well. For me, it left a feeling like I was being sleezy."
good,Been there 3 months. They just change over and next we don't know what will happen. They got a good plane just need to manage right by the right person.
good,"Deadline driven"
good,"Coworkers were awesome, most supervisors were helpful and kind, i learned that technical support is not as easy as it seems. The hardest part is dealing with elderly customers and angry customers on the line."
good,I'm a contractor so I am not aware of the benefits.  I haven't spoken to anyone who has benefits so there in nothing I can say about the subject. The people who are employees seem happy.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Work environment is flexible but difficult due to the ratio of work to employees.  I enjoyed the work, but burnout is common.  It is also stressful to be fearful of your work status from day to day."
good,"The one benefit of working there were the benefits such as 401k match, health, dental, and vision.  The negatives were that it's a call center job where there was no room for advancement unless you knew some of the higher ups on a personal level.  There were some nepotism and there were manager hires from outside the company that were questionable at best.  Instead of hiring from within to someone who knows the system and the process, there would be people hired to supervise employees that knew more than the manager.  This did lead to a lot of discord on the team as they would lose respect for the new manager."
good,"MCI was a great company to work for, Worldcom not so much.  Verizon has good pay and benefits.  Verizon has a very good culture of staying up to date ion current technology and training employees."
good,It opened me up to the call center world with the good bad and the ugly .  The training was basic and the break room could’ve been better . Met some great friends after they quit or got fired .
good,"Fast pace and fun work environment. Help customers to get a better understanding of their mobile devices and mobile plans. Promote sales of  technology throughout the store, especially cell phones"
good,the job isnt bad but the customer base is largely rude and its a job that takes its toll on you so I advise that you make a box in your mind to put rude folks in and not let it bother you.
good,"they pay well, but the job isn't worth it. was there for 10 years and couldn't get a decent schedule. the people you meet are amazing. the benefits are great, bu after 10 years it wore me down."
good,"Working with Verizon was an overall good experience. Its the perfect entry-level job position. Working for the company for 3 years, you do get to see a lot of the inner workings of the company. Every year the commission checks got smaller and smaller through the overall restructuring of the company and cutbacks.  In hindsight, Verizon reps still make more than the average person."
good,"Good company, good benefits but the work is too stressful and management unfortunately didn't support employees when they have issue at work  with other peers."
good,Co.pany offers great cellular service to most of the country.  The location I was at handled business and government customers. They recently let a lot of their higher seniority worker go with a severance package.
good,Very good benefits competitive pay but they have been doing lay offs for 4 years straight. Started with non commissioned reps and as of last year started management. I worked there for 12 years and they just cut me loose with no warning
good,lots of training available with great people to work with. Very productive working environment. The compensation is competitive and management is great.
good,It was an overly stressful environment with high turnover. Management was overly strict and did not get paid enough for what was wanted to be done. Do no recommend working there
good,"Ok place to work, people are great, fantastic, willing to help, respectful and professional. But unfortunately some the leaders (CIO, a few directors, etc.) are the reason for high turn over rate and inability to attract good talent. any of these leaders are progress averse. This leads to a culture of silos, where innovation is stagnant. Managers compete for tight grip control on their products. Also management does not encourage or mandate quality standards, therefore quality of software is sub-par (not speaking for all teams, some are good, but some business critical apps have no unit tests whatsoever."
good,If you work the main corporate building in Alpharetta its better then through Alorica. You will have insurance and quarterly bonuses. Keep your area clean so you wont get sick
good,"Verizon was a great place to work when I started, but I’ve somehow made less every year even though my hourly has gone up and I’m hitting the same percentage in sales targets. They have cut our commissions A LOT and do everything they can to drive digital sales. Currently looking for another job after five years."
good,"Good company, but high risk of layoffs. New direction is helping to redirect goals of the company (which is good.) Needs more flexibility about promotions and where they can live."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I like working autonomously.  I have 30 plus years as an Outside Plant Engineer.  I design large public requirement jobs and project manage until construction complete
good,great place to work if you are ready for a fast paced and competitive sales job. The drawback is the flexibility on time and scheduling conflicts due to forgetfulness
good,"The company really helped me while my wife died of cancer. Other than that the company destroys its workforce. The reduction in force that comes every year usually took 10% of each team. I hired a stellar group of people, all of my 40 people were better than their peers. When the RIF's came, I had to give 10%. So I was laying off people that were much better than their peers. It would have been a good idea to lay of the 10% lowest performers and then divide my team among the people that actually laid people off. But no, we got rid of good people. There is a mission statement and we used that for reviews, but only in the sense that we logged things for the yearly review. Other than that, the mission was just words."
good,Great culture. Low pay.  Well-organized company with minimal direction. Will pay for one degree; used to be able to get multiple degrees.  Do not come to Verizon to get paid.  It wont happen. Get your basics from Verizon and move on is the best path to success.
good,"Company has great benefits and salary but job security is not secure. Flexible work schedule, and decent paid time off plan. Some positions offer remote work."
good,"OK place to work.  Call center closed.•	Interact with network services, software services, systems engineering, and applications development to restore service and/or identify and correct communication problems.  "
good,its a consistent work place with a steady income somewhat fast paced for the calls coming in fun community to work within loud and need to be ready for complaint calls and escalations
good,"There is a good amount of selling to get done. Only if the customers come in. Other than that, it is not a bad place to work. It is just very inconsistent with the guidelines and customers."
good,"Enjoyed working in the fast pace IT arena supporting some of these largest clients in Verizon's base.  Led PMO organization for wamu, then set up a d managed their Manila based Service Desk"
good,"Job consisted of maintaining Verizons N.H. Fiber backbone and all customers connected to it. Also included travel throughout N.H. to offnet cust. for BEAS installs, and assorted CPE installs.  Full spectrum of Telco knowledge needed as job not limited to one particular job function, but multitasking the many functions it takes to run a Network."
good,"a great place to work to learn about new tech and meet new people and build a network."
good,I have worked for Verizon for many years. The pay and benefits are great. Retirement package was wonderful. The management was easy to wrok with. I would recommend.
good,I enjoyed working there but the start out pay was low. The schedule was not was it was use to due to the evening shift. The benefits were excellent. I would recommend VZW if you were single and didn't mind the night shift. Management lack communication especially when your management was on leave it was like we got pushed aside and didn't really care if we succeeded or not .
good,hit you with goals that are near impossible to hit but they don't care. managers can be hit or miss some are awesome and some are pretty terrible five
good,"The business says it's very big on work life balance but that was never evident.  If you wanted balance, you needed vacation and there were restrictions on that.  I learned a ton and had many exciting opportunities but my time there has run its course."
good,"When it comes to the sales force with Verizon Wireless, there has been a sharp decline in commission attainment.  There is a new Verizon 2.0 initiative that has started with the new CEO.  Lots of rumors that commissioned sales may go the way of the dinosaur."
good,"They are a good company but the work quotas are very stressful.  Having to keep up with all technology is stressful."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The atmosphere at the call center was great, all of the co-workers were very friendly and the managers were helpful."
good,"Verizon sadly doesn't value Experience and there is no work life balance in field operations. There is no real growth opportunities and individuals are mislead to believe there is. If you are a director and above, you are truly disconnected from the business and typically disconnected from reality of the day to day operations. Compensation changes at that level so its understandable but ignored that this separation of church and state actually causes a major disconnect.. "
good,"I do not wish to provide an employer review."
good,"•	Communicated with customers to identify needs, conveyed product knowledge"
good,Too much red tape but overall a good company to work for! I am not able to say any more than this due to my voluntary separation agreement............
good,"Do not expect to get any recognition in anything you do. I had more recognition from other companies than Verizon. You go into your cube and do your work. That is about it. There was no break room so if you wanted to relax a little bit, you had to do it in your cube. They had a refrigerator and a coffee maker but you had to bring your own coffee. The nice thing about it is that it was Monday through Friday with Holidays off."
good,"Hours are longer IF you are not a part of the ""in"" crowd and are actually required to do all parts of your job which means your days, if you work in the field with technicians, are anywhere from 10-16 hours if you know your documentation has to be legitimate."
good,Performed at top level at the company earning Presidents club honor.  Company decided to eliminate my channel.  Very disappointing to have to leave company instead of being offered another position
good,In the customer service department there is little room for career advancement however the salary and benefits are excellent.  Job security is iffy due to lack of contract and weak union.
good,A typical day at Verizon would start with me signing into my station and began to take calls. The majority of the calls where to make payments or changes to the account whether it be a new telephone number or add services to the existing telephone lines or cancelling services on the profile.  .
good,"Amazing benefits if you have a family and planing retirement. Recruiters are well suite for the job. Long hours and long shifts, no team work, everyone was a island."
good,"1 Sales Solutions Specialist in the southern region of the United States. Increased store profit by 23%.Solutions Specialist is responsible for having a rich understanding of Verizon technology and services; this knowledge and expertise is used as leverage to provide the optimal solution to consumers to maximize profit."
good,"ok company to work for, and great benefits. looking for something with more pay and flexibility. Work life balance was stressful during peak times of the year."
good,Was with the company for 20 years. Changed a lot over the years. Very different company than when I started. Not really able to recommend working there now.
good,High energy workplace.  Very structured daily activity. Learned teamwork and collaboration. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers utilize technology to improve their business.
good,"Great team members and management. Work culture is tiugh to adapt. Learned great techinologies. had fun with new technologies."
good,"Verizon is great company to work for in regards to benefits. Great staffing, I miss my coworkers the most. However, the company is very stressful to work for and there's no work life balance."
good,"Shouldn't be a required section. need to fill in more characters. evidently there are also ""quality guidelines"" which need to be met. Shouldn't be a required section"
good,The company has challenges in the legacy telecom business (customers are canceling wireline services) and opportunities in the fiber and mobility business with the launch of 5G.
good,"It was nice working with Verizon. Good experience. Learned a lot which is helping me every day. Definitely, Verizon can be a great place to work and learn new tools."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The job is is good if you need to pay the bills but beyond that not worth working at due to being told to do one thing then turn around and do another
good,"I personally didn't mind the actual 'job.' It was more due to the extreme turnover between management I felt that my skills and progress were always being overlooked and sometimes postponed. As the new manager would take over, I would essentially start over in the eyes of said new manager."
good,"Keep to yourself. DO NOT TRUST ANYONE ....definitely communication company...peers & management love to gossip. Go do your job, go home. I stayed for paycheck & benefits to support family. Hope that your family stays healthy Verizon does not care & will not let you use time off for their care or doctor appointment (although they say they will). Management depending on supervisor can be helpful if you catch them on a good day."
good,Working for Verizon (c/o Alorica) it was ok. I was a job not a set career for me. The pay was not comparable to what should of been paid out. Wish the benefits and bonus was more.
good,Large range of opportunities. Company is willing to help promote from within the company. Big on training and very nice work environment. Must be ready to work long hours.
good,"Its okay to work for the company but dont expect to be treated equal."
good,Productive but stressful workplace. Good Benefits. Teamwork is a must. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people I get to work with every day. Hardest part of the job is training.
good,"Verizon has a lot of benefits, including tuition payment, great healthcare, and great pay.   The down side is that if you're unable to relocate, you usually get stuck in the same position and upper leadership is far disconnected from the front line employees (including retail reps and management)"
good,"Unrealistic sales goals"
good,"This survey does not really apply to me as I did not work directly for Verizon. I worked for an authorized retailer that provided customer service for the people that purchased devices at one of the many stores. "
good,Verizon is like most big corporations. Will pay you less so their investors can make more. You have to continually sell more to make the minimum amount.
good,I would say Verizon has the misfortune of treating wireline people like pariahs. Leadership seldom promotes people out of there into Wireless or another sector
good,"Conference calls consumed about 3 hrs per day.  The calls were a lot of regurgitated material.  I would run for the front doors on  Mondays for the first 18 years.  The last 3 not so much.  The management team the last three years was extremely cut throat and lacked ethics and morals.  Never minded doing discipline and coaching but towards the end was being forced to discipline when it wasn't warranted.  The company paid well but treated its lower management poorly.  We would be advised at end of day to be on conference calls at 8 and 9 pm last minute.  Company was not concerned with management family issues what so ever.  Verizon gave me a good living for many years the last couple not so much.  When I was reduced in force, It was a wait lifted off my shoulders."
good,A stressful job with an excellent honeymoon period but deteriorating corporate culture and growth. Management is overwhelmed and often in meetings. Corporate philosophy is all over the place and tasks become confusing or encourage poor standards with little consequences save for you.
good,"When I first started Verizon I went in with the intentions on loving it. Although the pay, benefits, and PTO were great; the job it’s self was very stressful. It’s a call center so of course you’re going to have annoying customers, but little by little they started changing our metrics and it became unrealistic. Everytime you get a survey you get coached and even tho you got a 10/10 on your survey, you still got coached on what you could’ve done better. The thing that bothered me the most was the micromanaging. They would have 1-2 sometimes even 3 people at a time listening to your phone calls and messaging you telling you what to say on top of trying to listen to your customer, navigate the system and typing in your own notes. I was told going to the bathroom was taking me out of adherence so I needed to let someone know each time I went. The cool thing was I could have my phone out and they would plug music so it helped when you were getting cussed out, but the work life balance wasn’t there for me. You had to be there 3-5 years to get a good schedule or even move up to a position that got you off the phone and then if you got a schedule that you loved.. it didn’t matter because it changes every 6 months because you have to do a shift bid. This was just my personal issues with it, some people love it and are there for 10 years or more (still sitting on those same phones) BUT in all honesty I was just tired of a call center"
good,My personal experience was not the best. Managers hired the people they hung out with and this would lead to favorable shifts and benefits.  You always had to watch your back because fellow employees would sabotage their teammates to gain an advantage in sales contests and promotions.
good,"Fast paced environment, worked with multiple groups to achieve work. Worked for Government agencies for requests and order processing. Also, completed audits every Fiscal Year."
good,"Definitely became a better leader with all the training on coaching, leadership etc.  Downfall is when Vzw has gotten bigger and basically #1 you can see the commissions drastically have fallen."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The managers I had were power tripping, controlling, liars and manipulators who did anything to cover their own butts and throw anyone under the bus they didn't like, whether they did anything wrong or not. Not every manager was like that. And my general manager started off really nice but she was really rude and disgusting later. The company is great though. Great benefits and pay if you can sell and have great customer service."
good,"""Cellco Partnership, doing business as Verizon Wireless, is an American telecommunications company which offers wireless products and services. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications. Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless telecommunications provider in the United States"""
good,"it's a good job, but they are cutting back on expenses and RIFs are normal these days. It was great at one time, still good but could be better. I dont want to tell any more"
good,"Management rewards us for hitting targets. Friendly team of sales associates. A typical day at work would be upgrading customer phones, collecting payments, and helping customers with plan changes."
good,"Alright company to work for. It used to be awesome, from awesome it went to being stressful. This was due to they never promoted from within, they brought in new management who were not savvy about the projects or products we were working on. They simply did not care to understand."
good,It was alright. Not the best company to work in as it relates to IT as the company is made up of career people. People do things the way they always have without trying new innovative approaches.
good,"VZ as a large, multi-layer techno-bureacracy, it was welcome to work with long-term managers that see the big picture. Strong technical contract team supported overall project objectives."
good,While working in Verizon It was a great place to work. They have great training and help if you still need it. I really enjoyed my time working with Verizon.
good,Working for an independent office was a learning  experience. Having Verizon as my phone service i knew what to look for and how to explain my problems when having to call customer service.
good,It’s a great company to work for if your starting out. But can be very stressful. Your job depends on customers opinions. If you fail a survey your job might be in jeopardy.
good,Outside sales. weekly meeting the goal was 6 to 10 face to face appointments with customers per week.  cold call in areas of scheduled appointments. Ark for referrals
good,"You can do the best for your self, by self-starting on all activities.  Do not look for your manager to manage or understanding or look out for you.  Only those you network for and befriend will aid you.  Beware the 'yes' manager.  They only care about what they can get out of you. You can break all records and they will still look for negatives to be negative because they are looking to aid the bottom line by cutting your position as soon as possible."
good,wow are you serious i actually need to type something here? this job was not worth the effort required for this survey. it was not a good job. is that enough?
good,High pressure to sell service and accessories.  Work schedule was not flexible at all and open on most holidays.  Work shifts were very weird and worked a lot of over time.
good,This position was laid back as far as culture however the salary and job advancement and security was not up to par. There was never any initiative from management to seek better pay for their employees.
good,"Like many customer service jobs, dealing with people isn't the best. Verizon was great when I started besides the retail hours. As the years went by and tenured representatives left, they were replaced with young inexperienced ones, which was a general trend of the company with my assumption being to pay them less. Due to this, they also became much more strict in treating the sales reps like children rather than adults due to being terrified of any sort of liability for employees actions. The benefits at Verizon are definitely solid, with full medical, dental, vision, and tuition reimbursement plus a competitive 401k. The pay can be good if you are a decent rep, but they have changed the commission structure so many times that the expectations have become much higher to make the same money I used to."
good,but became more about fire drills and powerpoint presentations toward the end.  I enjoyed my career at VzW but it could have been better if executive management had more training on basic management skills
good,"Typical work day in sales includes 2 in-person meetings a day, but have the option to work remotely in between meetings. You get what you put in - if you're willing to work hard and with integrity, you'll have no problem succeeding."
good,Learned a lot about customer service and sales working for verizion.  Hi expectations but support was pretty good.  IT issues fixed quickly.  I would recommend
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Verizon, they believed in flexibility and advancement.  It was nice to be able to move to other groups to learn other parts of the business."
good,"Do your best to delight, provide proper, accurate, and courteous information  znd you will be able to succeed. Manager are able to remotely listen in on all your calls, which can be a bit nerve racking."
good,"I think overall Verizon was a great company to work for when your starting your career. This was not a company i seen myself with in the long term, the enivironment reminded me of rush hour on a highway at 5pm."
good,I have work for Verizon 12 years and company relocated my family from Ohio to N. Carolina 5 years ago and completely paid for the move . Move our cars
good,"Outside of the regular things you deal with in customer service, some Verizon customers tend to be a little more high maintenance then most other environments I have worked in. It can cause an increase in stress having to deal with it for 8 hours  day, but if you have any experience at all working in customer service you can most likely handle it with little issue, while sometimes even coming away with great experiences in customer interactions."
good,"The location was great. Most of the people were great to work with. Management did not seem to have the control or access to warrant much. The main reason I would not advise work here is nothing to do with Verizon Wireless as a company, but the job itself in ""customer service"". Customer service is quite stressful as far as interaction with customers. The tasks the job required were quite easy."
good,Sales structures can be the hardest part of the job. Products to what a customer came into the store for may not be what your supervisors are expecting you to sell. Cross sales can be hard
good,"Great for entry level IT, exposure to various levels of network infrastructure. Advancement is possible but requires extensive training and even then requires experience - you have to leave gain industry experience then come back to advance."
good,was a temp postition. tried to get hired on after. Not possible even with an impeccable work record with them. I applied and interviewed and had in A+ interview rating. Still not hired.
good,"Often laid off employees with no explanation, stating they'd have to call HR to get a reason. Lack of support overall, shortage of management, no willingness to move people up into management and support positions to aid customers when it's needed."
good,At the retail level customer traffic numbers are way down and sales targets are way up. This results in an incredibly stressful work environment for everyone involved. Upper management pushed products no one wants just to move a metric and advance their own career when they are not directly involved in the sales process.
good,Verizon offers a productive and competitive environment for the employees.  Sales and service offers are competitive with local carriers who provide similar services.
good,Verizon wireless is a great job opportunity for students and entry level professions. If you are looking to get into managemnet or really enjoy sales it is a good place to work.
good,"Overall a solid company to work for in terms of pay, benefits, etc. There are some disadvantages such as the massive bureaucracy and siloing of departments that takes place in a huge company like Verizon."
good,"Worked at Verizon Labs.   Nice facility, but very little innovation.   Very little diversity.   The entire group 90%  is Indian, and the remainder is Chinese."
good,"Pioneer work! Center of the city with beautiful landscape around."
good,"•	Went door-to-door in various territories in Philadelphia in order to sell Verizon’s internet, home, and TV"
good,Verizon compensated it's employees well and had a robust retirement savings program. The sales environment was very stressful and management was inconsistent .
good,Verizon was a nice place to work and I learned a lot. The call center experience was rather stressful. I met a lot of nice people and I was able to retain quite lot of technical information.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"This is a company to start your career, I would suggest that after your second year use your experience to move on. If you are not able to work as a team or communicate with supervisor professional this is not a job for you."
good,"I worked in Verizon Wireless store and I was a FiOS specialist as well. The pay and benefits are excellent, but you will definitely earn your money, so expect to work hard. I also worked with a lot of great people."
good,Tired of providing review in order to post a resume on this sight . THis should not be required especially since I have not worked for this company in ove a decade
good,Work demands conflict with balancing life events. Retail schedule is difficult. Compensation is great and is well above market average.  This is an obvious trade off.
good,Focused on savings but not its people.  In recent years the company has lost directions.  Company is losing touch with its employees.  Company is losing experienced people.
good,At the time of my employment we have good pay and great benefits. Some issues with management and upper leadership. Moving up in the company was getting harder to do.
good,"Verizon is a competitive work space that can be fun yet challenging. It is not for everyone, as you need the people skills to deal with frustrating customers."
good,a good company overall to work for. Like with any company they have there ups and downs but try there best to make is a decent work environment and try to show that they care.
good,this job was okay. the money was good you get commission. flexible work hours. weird environment. expensive products. a little dirty. good stuff in the area for lunch.
good,it was a good learning experience working with this company. got to learn and explore technologies and functionalities. overall a good experience. ---
good,"Great benefits, but no loyalty from Executives.  Work/life balance was off and I felt very unappreciated and unfulfilled working for Verizon.  This is not the case for everyone, but for me, personally."
good,Once you move up into upper management you make less money and have twice the stress of even higher management bearing down on you to make quota. I wish i would've stayed a sales rep and maybe my career at verizon would've lasted a lot longer.
good,"Great benefits	Responsible for resolving customer issues regarding billing, products and services. Provide basic troubleshooting on service and equipment issues. Provide wireless solutions to best suit the needs of the customer.  Adhere to structured schedules and shifts"
good,If you are in the group that management is looking to reward you will get rewarded no matter how you perform. There are many folks that has no business making decision but they where placed there due to relationships not merit. I could say that for most employers but expected more from Verizon.
good,I learn data entry here and a lot about computers and software. Stay on the phone and computer dealing with customers and there problems with there accounts.
good,Selling products was the main job. Worst part is dealing with angry customers about their bill. Not the best field I thrive in when it comes to overpriced products
good,Working for Verizon you were able to communicate with customers who you as a person could relate to. Connecting with the customers was an excellent way to meet their needs and provide great quality service.
good,"I worked for a smaller company that was bought out by Verizon, so our office culture was a blending of the two.  Verizon offers great benefits and is an enjoyable place to work.  However that is balanced against the constant threat of being laid off, which is done regularly and rather ruthlessly."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Not a healthy place to work at. They always change the comm structure -making it impossible for you to make any money. They only benefit - not you. I would recommend to stay away unless you want to work 30 hours (full time) and make 500$ paychecks every two weeks and not getting any comm.
good,"Not a bad place to work at all. In the wireless game, definitely the most ethically driven of the big 4.  But opportunities are harder to find to move up or develop effectively. Work life balance is absolutely horrible though."
good,Great job for a young person to start due to all the benefits. Plus you can complete your Education they pay for it and bonuses every February. But extremely stressful and micromanaging
good,Enjoy the relationships I was able to create by getting to know people. Also enjoyed the relationships formed with the people I worked with.  Very good job
good,"The managment at Verizon is horrendous. I'm not surprised they have had to close the North Charleston, SC location. Co-workers are great and the only redemption of this company."
good,Verizon is a corporation.  Eventually you become a number.  Once your number gets too big you will be asked (nicely) to leave so you can be replaced with a smaller number.
good,This was a great opportunity for a recent graduate who was looking to get into corporate sales...worked with public and advised them on best plans and products for their needs....good management and opportunity to advance.
good,"Good place to work, fast paced and competitive. Management was good and gave ample opportunities for advancement. Schedule was comparable and continued changes kept the flow of work at a good pace."
good,Verizon was fun as a technician. The management sucked but the team was great. We worked together to help each other. Fun times at  Verizon.  Hard to move up
good,"Enjoyed my time working for the company, hourly plus commission. management was good and didn't provide much for benefits. good training and overall good place to work at"
good,"Verizon is the place for anyone who is eager to set goals and achieve them.  It is also a great place to set challenges for yourself.  The particular location in which I was employed was a nice environment, however, because I was one of the only females hired there during my time, I had a lot of work to do to keep the store comfortable. There were all males working before me so cleaning, spraying the building, sanitizing, etc was a MUST. Management there although very nice, has some special agendas and sometimes his hiring choices aren't based on skill sets or abilities, but his personal choosing which has proven a bad idea in times and is what ultimately caused me to depart.  Pay could be MUCH BETTER."
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for.  I learned and grew professionally in my time there.  The Culture however has changed, and while for a long time it seemed that this was a great place for women to work and advance, it didn't feel this way the past 3 years, as most executives hired were external and mostly male.  Work life balance also took a shift with expectations to work late nights and weekends (on staff roles.)"
good,Managers seem to have no real ability to make decisions.  Most initiatives and or plans come down from the executive level.  This is complicated when you are trying to respond to your own market and the overall initiative is not a fit.
good,"Great benefits and Training. Company provides you tons of amazing training and support but it is a performance culture. If you are not able to develop and reach the numbers they expect, then you will eventually lose your job. Verizon is constantly evolving and that evolution includes lay offs, and hurts corporate culture. Leadership is working to find the right niche in the market for Verizon enterprise and at times front level people lack job security or are placed in situations where they are not able to succeed in their role. Management does work to provide additional opportunities when this happens."
good,"Sales teams are sometimes hampered by a lack of industry knowledge, slow-moving solutions pipeline, and sales management (pricing, quoting, contract) focused on network connection/circuits rather than services. However, Verizon has a great position in the marketplace and is changing quickly for a large company, even more so with a new CEO in mid-2018."
good,"Pros"
good,Continual opportunities for learning.  A fast paced environment with ever changing roles and responsibilities.  Must be good at handling high stress and high pressure situations.  Great medical benefits.
good,I either monitored conference calls or set them up. Sometimes I could be on a call for hours and other times just 30 minutes. Setting up conference calls was typically in 30 min increments.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,There is lot of bureaucracy through layered management and its hard to progress with the kind of organization structure. Hardwork is not rewarded properly and work life balance is poor.
good,I have no ill feelings towards the company verizon or my managers that I worked for while I was there. It was just like any other call center that I had worked at previously
good,Best part of the job is the people at Verizon. During my tenure I had the great pleasure to manage many outstanding engineers who were at the top of their game.
good,Loved working with my team to achieve my goals and to give customers Quilty service.        aEFAfaefeafaefafasefeafassdVASDVASRVFSFEFGAEFGEFESFESFESFGESFGEFGAERFEWG
good,"Verizon offers a great learning situation.  However, it is actively changing on a daily basis.  There is a strong union culture that can be difficult to work with.  The company pays well and has great benefits, However, as management you are expected to be available 24 x 7.  Coverage on weekends and holidays as well as all hours of the day."
good,I loved working there. It’s was great and fun. Always got stressful for the holiday or irate customers. But always managed to make sure they were leaving with a smile
good,"The Verizon culture changed dramatically in the course of my tenure.  It used to be a place where we had a clear mission and your work could be easily tied to the over all goals of the company.  Now it is a culture of ""getting ahead at any cost"" which often means decisions made for political career reasons not the good of the company or customer."
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work. Decent pay and good overall benefits. A great place to start your career and then take the skills elsewhere to continue the growth."
good,New commission structure leads to more shady practices by reps and managers. Managers will turn a blind eye until a customer complains. Quota has reached unattainable levels while we have less customers coming into stores and the company knows that. Morale has been lowered because every one is making less money.
good,Sit/Stand desks make for a noisy environment but does allow for open collaboration.  Senior leadership always seem to have power struggles among themselves instead of working together.
good,My experience in 2008-2009 shortly after the MCI acquisition and just before the recession hit is just not going to be relevant to you if you are considering employment with what is now a very different company.  I liked it ok.
good,"VerizonWireless was a fast paced environment to work in, I like to constant training on our products, I enjoyed to press to continue to stay current on all of the products."
good,"This was a okay kind of job, it is nothing like the corporate store. We did not get the discounts like they did or the benefits. I did make decent money."
good,Consistent downsizing has impacted the culture and the level of productivity.  The atmosphere is continuously changing and with technology advancements.  This has proven to eliminate higher pay positions.
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for, but right now they are going through some changes, figuring out what they want to do next as a company. Will they get out off Wireline?"
good,Verizon is a high pace and stressful place to work. You have to find a way to deal with the angry and disrespectful customers. The working hours were hard for me especially having a newborn and working from 2PM-11PM or later.
good,"AT&T has better executive leadership and invests more in building managed services that include security, IOT, SDN, Voice Collaboration, VPN, and mobility."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Fun Place to work to gain valuable corporate experience. Bad work life balance, interesting people to learn from. Company tries to provide good benefits to employees"
good,The pay is good and the benefits are good as well. Call center life is stressful.  There is room for advancement depending on what you would like to do.
good,J'ai travaillé avec une équipe professionnelle et très compétente.
good,Feel need more developers than managers or atleast technical managers who can give some valuable inputs rather than just pushing to get the job done without any insight
good,"Great Company"
good,"I work for the call cent portion of Verizon and it was a very fast paced job environment, where e had to meat a point system. Managers were friendly and helpful."
good,Verizon is good place to work and allow to work from home if necessary. So employee is able to handle their personal emergency. But job is not secured and every year layoff.
good,"I only worked as a temp for few months many many years ago, I do not remember. It was just a quiet job where I worked on my own. I worked with alot of applications"
good,"You are expected to please every customer that calls even the ones that are yelling and disrespecting you. Managers listening to your calls while you are on there getting yelled at and they don't step in."
good,At this location it is a little difficult to bring in customers and therefore it makes it harder to have a steady commissions paycheck and with sales consultants only allowed 32 hours it makes it harder to make that paycheck stretch.
good,"Nice"
good,"Big company, no loyalty, left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  It was a means to an end - just paid the bills.  Many people were ""managed"" out of a job every time there was a merger."
good,"This was a typical enterprise environment which made growth very difficult. "
good,Good learning experience and introduction with the cell phone wireless industry.  The environment fluctuates and sometimes hampers productivity.  Poor communication and disconnect in relaying critical processes hampers productivity.
good,"The benefits have been great, but the almighty dollar has started to chip away at what is offered.  There is good health and dental benefits with a great 6% match of 401K.  However, with the pressure of a maturing industry there are always cuts around the corner and the pressure has increased."
good,good pay and benefits. But goals are almost impossible to meet. leadership rarely knows what is going on or how to do the jobs that they are supervising.
good,"Working for Verizon was good, not exceptional in any way. They did allow me to expand my regular Customer Service expertise as well as giving me supervisory privileges for the first time in this career field"
good,"Having worked at Yahoo for 11 years shows how great the company was to work for. Great people, innovative business, truly global presence, excellent culture and most importantly great leaders in the Business and Finance organisation."
good,"The employees was friendly, management was not helpful or nice or understanding. Got no good benefits, work environment could be more relaxing not like we are in high school."
good,"Good job but vision has changed as a company, hired a lot of young college graduates that only look at Verizon as a stepping stone now, not a Career. 22 years but now looking for a change"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is metrics focused. This company is focused on who they want to promote not people who're qualified. Other than that opinion they benefits are good and so is the tuition reimbursement.
good,Place to start if you’re a quick learner and decent at sales. They’ll train if you have good customer service skills or a heartbeat and a good smile. Promotions are purely sales driven though
good,Not Availalbe -  A review of this company is not available here at this time. You are encouraged to continue to please seek elsewhere for this information/
good,i worked in a call center in a cubicle had to wear dress clothes and tie everyday this just isnt me im more of a hands on kind of person working with my hands and like being able to have more of a face to face interaction
good,Work is demanding but fun! I had the opportunity to move up in the business with the guidance from leadership.  Lots of other opportunities in other parts of the business as well.
good,Verizon is down sizing and that is causing many to look for other careers.  We are being asked to take severance and early retirement options.  Not sure what the future holds here at Verizon currently.
good,I've been with this company through many mergers and acquisitions; this company changes constantly.  The company is currently undergoing massive restructuring and down sizing.
good,I don’t see myself being a salesman. I took this job because I heard there were great opportunities to make money. What I didn’t know was how long and difficult it could be at times.
good,"The hardest part about working for Verizon was the lack of communication from leadership. The benefits were awesome, and the employees were fun to work with"
good,"The call center offered many added benefits to working there. Cafeteria on site. Fun activities for employees and their families, company picnics, holiday parties etc."
good,"A solid company to work for  Salary is good, bonuses and incentives available  Somewhat stressful and competitive work environment due to certain quotas and measurables you have to meet and adhere to"
good,"Good place to work. Was happy for the most part. but the managers are very pesky about selling certain products and pushing them on people that don't need them. occasionally shady things did happen during sales, hard to look the other way. but are required to."
good,"Don't ever become a manager at this company.  Very few if any raises, never any coaching or developing.  Appraisals are nothing but a joke and bonuses are given on a rating and ranking system, completely subjective.  If you don't kiss up then don't expect a decent bonus.  Those days where you are rewarded based upon your hard work is long gone.  Culture is so so... upper mgmt completely out of touch.  Constant threat of RIFs with no advanced warning.  Continue to have to do more with less.  Extremely stressful environment.  Calgon take me away"
good,"I was a contract worker for the Fraud Prevention Team. The job was very fast paced. The call expectations were set VERY high, at some times not achievable. The process for handling calls was constantly changed back and forth."
good,"changing for the worse, VZW isn't what it was like when i first started . it was an okay job. it was a fun place. it has a lot of good people working from the."
good,"At this point, Verizon is redeveloping itself and cutting it's workforce down of all their experienced employees.  For anyone wanting to get their foot in the door, you could obtain some experience, but for a career, Verizon is not stable enough at this time."
good,Lack of communication and vision within the same organization. Many management does not cooperate with each other because they are scared that new improvement will reduce job force.
good,Great job to start a career straight from college. The people you work with are fun. You will take a lot of calls daily. You may work crazy shifts. You will be sitting in a chair for the full 8 hours.
good,"Too many changes.  Too many conflicting directions.  Some good policies, but very little focus on priorities. Great leadership.  Middle leadership seem unable to move."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,OK place to work for a person starting out in sales. Hard to get into a work routine due to all of the constant changes. Not easy to make significant salary
good,Worked at Verizon for over 1 year. it was a great place to learn about creating a customer experience over the phone. It took a lot to get used to but the training was great!.
good,A typical day at work is fast pace starts off with getting to the store making cold calls to business clients for an hour and then assist the store traffic with trouble shooting or up selling on latest devices.
good,Handled incident requests based on severity.  Provided total ticket life cycle management from creation to resolution and provided follow ups with end users.
good,"I did not like management. I feel as if they did not care about us lower sales people. For the most part, I was paid pretty well. I liked being paid weekly."
good,"I have nothing to say about the organization really, I did notice that they hire more slavic or eastern Europeans more than others. They should look into hiring minorities for bigger roles"
good,"The job was sales driven."
good,"A typical work day at Verizon wasnt the worst. However, Verizon has to do better with holding their customers hands and explain how most things should be done the correct way. What I learned is that favoritism really does exist. The management picked and chose their favorites for promotions. The workplace culture was only determined by the staff. The staff created the warm feel within the location. The hardest part about the job was to satisfy customers and provide 100% customer services without a customer getting into his or her feelings about a personal issue. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. Its the gift and the curse but what i will say is that the customers helped bring excitement within the location."
good,"I use to love working for Verizon until the shift went from being about employee first to COMPANY first..... not any loyalty to us as employees, the company only seem like to be loyal to their pockets."
good,It has been many years since I worked as an outbound telemarketer. While working for a third party company I learned about Verizon and what their sales products are.
good,"Its a good company to work for with alot of benefits. Their are some aspects that are not the best, but most of those depend on the type of manager that is managing your store. With a good manager this is a great job."
good,"Verizon in the early 2000's was an excellent company to work for. Employees received recognition for there work efforts, good benefits,"
good,"I worked for a Verizon call center many moons ago, and I enjoyed my co-workers and the relationships we developed. It was fun while it lasted, at the young age I was."
good,It was a very fast paced atmosphere a typical day was always different with the task and calls. It required several quotes to meet on a daily basis. Your supervisor was always there for support and guidance.
good,"Verizon use to have the tagline "" Make progress every day"". At work we used to say that sarcastically, some days felt like we were going backwards. Some days felt better."
good,It was just ok just a regular job was a little strict no cellphones on the floor very diverse schedules. My schedule was all over the place didn't really like it
good,"do more with less, and less, and less.  Sourcing people are expected to take on more and more responsibilities, while the number and quality of sourcing people have diminished."
good,"Your day is scheduled to the T from time on the the  phone , to your breaks and you are expected to adhere to it as it is one of your recorded stats.  Management is flexible as you are able to find assistance from your team lead or a neighboring one to come up with a solution to problems that may arise. Great benefits package coving health vision and dental!"
good,"A typical day at work was filled with priorities of the job and being prepared for the next customer."
good,"Answer customer telephone calls regarding health plan coverage"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The call center was extremely ""clicky"" and management talks to employees however they see fit. The term ""fired"" is thrown around quite frequently. "
good,"Great job for someone starting out right after college or during college.  You need to be able to take harsh criticism not to heart, and you need to tolerate repetitive coachings that make you feel like you are an idiot.  The benefits are great!"
good,I enjoyed working for Verizon. Working for this establishment gives you an opportunity to service customer with needs for their cell phone service. I would also recommend this place of business.
good,The job is not overly difficult after the training. The downside is the area and how low sales and commission can truly hurt the paycheck. Along with the hours overall the might be a pay cut for some.
good,Not a bad place to work but they are only in the wireless industry now. Union job. They have also sold all of their land lines to Frontier Communications.
good,trainer was very rude but this was a temporary assignment. I wasn't sure of my job responsibilities. Company was downsizing. I was employed by an employment agency.
good,nice job! If the center did not close I would have went back. this was a great place to work. The job was fast paced and I would recommend this positions to anyone.
good,"Verizon was one of the best companies to work for a few years ago but it has changed a lot over time. Incentives for employees are being taken away, commission structure has made it harder for sales employees to make money, no more yearly bonuses and the turnover rate is starting to increase."
good,The money is great but the managers are not the best to work with nor for. I usually kept to myself to ensure that my work would get done and I didn't get written up over something foolish.
good,"Company undergoing significant technology transformation with focus on 5G. A number of users in the media industry are getting their content directly from the internet and through portals like YouTube, Hulu, Netflix etc. instead of cable."
good,"•	Coaching, development and motivation of team members to increase and improve retention, customer service, quality, productivity, and call center metrics."
good,Communication could improve if management took more classes about how to communicate and lead. Verizon Wireless would be a good company to work for if there were more opportunities to move up
good,"This job was a good starting out job for me. It helped me become a better guy. From working in a fun environment with playing ping pong, basketball, or poker on the side it was fun while working there."
good,I really liked Telesales and thought the people were great. I was like family. They were pretty strict on scheduling and seemed not to deviate from anything which can be seen as good.
good,"People i worked with werent bad. "
good,"The 2 times I worked at Verizon the environment was productive, the training was excellent. It was a little noisy for a call center environment though."
good,"Good Company to Work for Big company, navigating through can be challenging. Downside is that it is slow with traditional work culture."
good,"With Indeed, you can search millions of jobs online to find the next step in your career. With tools for job search, resumes, company reviews and more, we're with you every step of the way."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"really bad inter social skills with their employees, never cared what happened to the stores, only mattered the  sales. a store got robbed at gun point and the manager never showed."
good,"Great and hard working every work day. Remote work being merged into it creating a better work life balance, but more needed.. One day is not enough, Maybe make it more flexible as people are coming from >40 miles to this office to send emails and traffic is tough."
good,"good place to work but no benefits, it tis all commission, peer are great, management is not around but you learn a lot working there they are definitely experts in technology"
good,"Great benefits, can be a good job if you don't mind the retail hours and if you can learn to sell anything.  If you don't want to be in the high-pressure sales business than this job is not for you."
good,"Verizon Wireless was an amazing company to work for, I have learned a great deal and was given amazing opportunities. However, with all the cost cutting in the industry, the employees are becoming expendable as the company seems to focus more on where you sit versus what you contribute to the company. RIFs are a constant threat so it makes it hard to stay positive."
good,"Talk to customer all day. Some happy some not.  Limited offline time."
good,"•	Provided customers with information on products and services to fit their specific needs"
good,A typical day involves working with customers to identify their advertising needs.  Then work with artists to come up with art work to be displayed in the advertisement.
good,"A great place with a large knowledge pool of individuals, a lot of interesting project over the years and a great learning environment. a lot of my peers were willing to teach and I was provide an opportunity to also teach"
good,"Excellent and mandatory training opportunities, including tuition reimbursement"
good,Most the pair who work their are amazing. The pay is okay. The hours are not the best if you have kids.  Liked the locked doors. Must have a ton to get in.
good,Position supported cloud clients with SLAs over night weekends and holidays. There was a need to co-ordinate a global support team in keeping clients online and within contract specs.
good,I worked in the call center for Verizon Wireless.  Very upbeat. although the surveys they presented affected your hourly pay directly. For this reason i did not like working for Verizon.
good,Not recommended only a job to have for the mean time . The managers were never helpful. Training was unorganized. not pleasing experience. I would never work there again.
good,"I worked for Verizon in temporary role, but i enjoyed my time there and would definitely consider coming back if the opportunity arose.  Good salary and benefits."
good,"Workload is very structured; flex work hours, and opportunities for growth; ability to  work meet with team working in various states; team meetings to keep everyone update and informed on changes"
good,Fast paced call center environment with emphasis on workplace management and customer service. This ob helped me focus on my attention to detail when communicating over the phone.
good,"Telcom is a good place to start career, but it is a very tough environment that is constantly changing with the cultural swing of how people interact and communicate today."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"fast-paced back to back calls and little help from support staff."
good,Can lose your job for anything. Wrong people in top positions. Good luck with job security. No matter how much you do for company. When customers come in with problems or bills related questions. Try to contact higher power. Anything could be said and you be wrong.
good,"It was great working with Verizon, however, I think the pay rate was a little bit too low for my qualification. The managers of this company didn't care some much for employees"
good,Verizon wireless was a great place to work then the CEO left and someone new took over and moved the call center out of state. I was shadowing to become a supervisor.
good,"Company has changed drastically."
good,"The benefits were the best part of the job. Amazing phone discounts and plan discounts, the medical insurance was amazing... but everything else about the job was painful. The customers scream at you for 8 hours a day over $5. Management can and will replace you at the drop of a hat if they want, and your schedule changes every few months so while you may enjoy the 9-5 work for 12 weeks, next they'll put you on 12-8 with Tuesdays and Thursdays off."
good,Create reservation for customer.  Place both audio and video conference calls.  Crossed trained in many different roles.  Trained new employees.  Worked different hours for overtime.
good,I enjoyed my time at Verizon for the constant new updates to todays mobile devices definitely made me excited to go to work and share the news of the products to customers.
good,"Verizon was a company I cared deeply about, until 2018.  It appears they are eliminating most employees who have 25+ years tenure within the company - for which the majority of those are and continue to be one of the hardest workers.  The environment has changed significantly - its no longer about the people or culture, but more about how much they can save."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work if all you really want to do is make money.  If bureaucracy does not bother you, go for it."
good,Looking to get into telecommunications? Verizon Wireless can teach you a lot about the business and services provided. They have great training programs and make sure you are well versed in the field of work you are going into.
good,"Great Company ! Many benefits , Very stress full environment, Very competitive , only the strong survive type career vibe, The perfect environment for a person who has a very open life and a very open schedule to cater to the company , In return a person can receive a very great career ."
good,"Verizon helped me in variety of ways one which was customer service, being approachable and offering the best possible packages that potential clients would love to hear"
good,The sales staff and management are driven by quotas and sometimes no breaks due to busy stores.  The people were nice but the atmosphere was competitive and the experience specialists were under appreciated.
good,"Normal day at work was driving around to the cell sites checking on the maintenance and alarm issues and repair or replace equipment. Learned about fiber cleaning, scoping it and testing it. People were mainly nice to work with. Hardest part of the job was covering all of the cell sites when on call. Enjoyed fixing an issue to make the system work better. Enjoyed working with most of my fellow workers."
good,Verizon is not a bad company to work for. They provide opportunity for advancement. They have multiple events for the employees monthly for their employees and family.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon was a good place to work when I first started working there. A shift in power with in the company happened and caused stress through out. Jobs were being downsized or duties were being removed.
good,"Good company to work"
good,"My time at Verizon was pretty good for what it was worth. Compensation was ok, work was extremely stressful at times. Leadership cracks down on each other which spills over to higher and sometimes unrealistic expectations of CSR's. Culture was great, they always wanted to keep you motivated to slave for the company."
good,I dont like working in a call center enviornment. It wasnt the best job I had. This was my first call center job and I needed to work ASAP. They hired me on the spot for Verizon.
good,"sales environment, micro managing. strong coaching and learning environment. company pushes you to upsell and be shady if need be. decent pay and benefits."
good,"its a learning experience you get the learning you need to be successful, management is not fair all the time , it can be a great place to will go back"
good,"I enjoyed some of the people I worked with. I did enjoy the perks, such as the bones we would get yearly. Also, the percentage off our wireless service."
good,"So if you want a possible career then Verizon corp is a decent place. Stay away from the authorized retailers unless you are looking for a temp job. The pay is good at corp, and terrible in auth retail."
good,"lots of layoffs in recent years, which makes it a bit tense in the working environment. Hopefully things turn around for the better in the next one or two years."
good,Highly motivated sales organization. Many goals to achieve with every single sale. There is a great team selling environment with peers and management.
good,"Verizon can be a very fun place to work. All you have to do is make sure customers are happy, your team is happy, and everything will take care of itself as far as sales are concerned."
good,"I wired up phone service and DSL lines in the central office, by myself, it was fine. There was a ""Reduction in Force"" so I had to take a package. Indeed wants 150 charaters"
good,Good work environment.  The corporate locations are scattered so you will be working with others at different locations.  The benefits and pay are competitive.
good,The job rewarded high sales numbers and ignored the competencies necessary to be an effective manager/supervisor. I would often observe people with poor people skills being responsible for the development of others. sales at the expense of integrity are also a problem. quit prematurely due to poor management.
good,"Early morning set up of new marketing retail products, setting up marketing collateral shipped by the regional marketing team, recommending and selling products, features  and services., and traveling to other locations as needed."
good,Verizon Wireless is a good company to work for if you are into technology I'm not a tech person. I would recommend the company to someone who prefers that field
good,"They clearly spell out for you what numbers you need to hit. Management is very focused on numbers and will do A LOT to ensure their store is hitting those numbers. Your other salesmen are guided by their own sense of morality and integrity when it comes to their dealings with customers and sometimes you'll have a return customer upset at you for something they did. If you're good at math, good with people, and don't mind potentially screwing over your customers, you can make a lot of money here."
good,"Given quotas to reach each month, this sales environment was built around promotions, sales and new customers. With great training, your confidence is grown to dominate in the sales industry. Learn how to challenge yourself with new adventures and customers everyday. Grow as a leader and help train others to produce the best results."
good,It was ok working there. HR takes their time if you need assistance with any kind of paper work for a leave of absence. The managers were ok tho. I think they would have people working longer if they pay more.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I worked on the front line for 15 years. It is clear to me that the executives do not care about it's retail employees. I would not recommend any work at this company.
good,This is where I officially discovered my ability to serve customers and make great money. i sold Fiberoptic Internet contracts with TV and Home Phone packages. I would sell an average of 4 contracts a day and have even sold up to 24 contracts in a single day. I was ranked 6th in the Country for most sales and 1st in the Country for highest non-cancelling customers. This position is no longer available on account of Frontier purchasing FiOS from Verizon.
good,"n/a- So I've gotten through both the phone and in-person interviews. My application status has went from ""Recruiter review"" to applied after the interviews. Am I still in the running? Or is this normal before knowing wether or not got it?"
good,After working for a company for five years never asking for time off they accused me of lying when it came to my grandmothers passing because her last name was different from mine. Company doesn't back their employees and very abusive environment. No opportunity for advancement . Benefits for insurance are amazing ! I will give them that much. Would not recommend for someone with a degree looking for a professional working environment.
good,really nice place to work again and work with other teams and share knowledge. i used to work there has a contractor we learn some new things. and other teams are very cooperative.
good,"Good Management, willing to help.  Alot of changes happened quickly.  Friendly management and willing to help out when needed.  The training was very helpful"
good,"Overall an ""ok"" work place to practice and gain experience. Chance to work with multiple tasks. Dealing with customers is also a plus to improve public speaking."
good,I worked at a Gowireless location and it was extremely unprofessional. The company have great potential but needs to be more specific about hiring sales reps
good,"if you are looking for a good first service/sales role, this is it. Good pay, good benefits. Hours aren't terrible, but can definitely run longer than expected."
good,"The culture is positive and productive.  The training was beneficial ."
good,I enjoyed my time while I was there. Management is mostly fair and just. The relationships I formed while there is what I will miss the most. Hopefully having them on my resume will help my job search efforts.
good,The company takes care of its employees with great benefits and good salaries for the type of work they do. The issue with the company is the middle management has a lot of issues delegating tasks with a clear message. We have to many avenues of targets with little guidance of the bigger picture.
good,"Call center was ran like a high school. I worked here to get experience for AT&T. Management didn’t know any more than I did, and if they were knowledgeable they were rude with the info. One of my worst jobs ever"
good,"Everything was fast paced with no training on new technology, Management could have been better lot of changes happened from when I started to when I left.  Work was fun , team effort ,then last 3 years since we became one company there was a lot of changes with new policies and responsibilities which was happening day to day.  Looking for more enjoyable work place, where I look forward to go to work."
good,"Too much outsourcing, behind the times and living in past glory years. Definitely do not recommend if you are starting your career. IT has to worry about constant layoffs."
good,"you are monitored very closely. Micromanaged is an understatement. you have 7 minutes per call. you get in trouble if you don't have the call completed by then. management barely steps in when you have an angry customer. training classes need to encompass more of the real types of calls someone will get. also you have to put in shift bids. YOU will have to work a 2-11 shift. even though they say that most people pick up that shift for a differential pay, they don't."
good,Good people to work with. Quiet work environment. Challenging daily work. Learned a lot about networking and Cisco and Juniper routers and switches. Memorable experience.
good,"Call center environment with flexible shifts for 3 to 6 months. Handles multiple accounts inside call center. Handled tech support for fiber optic bundles of phone "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"In this company you need to work more hours that you plan, very stressful environment, you have a lot of responsibilities and constant change the management."
good,I would go in around 10 am and customers would be waiting outside. Customers were often upset and rude. I learned to be very patient with people. The manager was good to work for. But it was draining to be around negativity so often.
good,"Good company to work for. Upper Management always new and always looking to clean house with new employees. Daily duties open store check inventory, set daily goals, make bank deposits, have one on one with employees."
good,Compensation was good but work environment was somewhat stressful and constantly changing with regards to performance requirements. Company also gave incentives when performance levels were met or exceeded.
good,Overall experience is good. Worked enthusiastically for my project. Colleges are also very helpful and friendly. Location for the company is also good as I love NYC.
good,Verizon had great work diversity and friendly place to work unfortunately they sold off and know longer offer business products and services they are now Frontier.
good,I have learned so much from working here I recommend anybody starting off in sales try it out. One thing you got to do is talk to a lot of people and if you like meeting tons of different faces this is the place for you.
good,"good experience learned how to work under high passed environment. I had many sales success and awards. The hardest part of the job was the hours, lots of overtime but sometimes you work 12 days in a row. That really made things challenging and burn out rather fast."
good,I Like that they really give the correct training needed to preform your job.  The job could be a bit stressfull when we are short handed and calls are holding.
good,"Very fast paced,unorganized, cooperative team friendly, Supportive managers,Poor salary, contract ended without abruptly, Great first year IT experience"
good,Orchestrated successful sales strategies and marketing initiatives designed to increase store revenue. Able to learn and work independently on multiple tasks and projects. Received two “top sales producer of the moth” awards.
good,Working here is not something that I envision doing for the rest of my working career.  I am not a person that is sedimentary.  I like moving and there is not much chance of that with this position.  I love helping people but there is too much information and not enough compensation for what Verizon wants an employee to do.  It may be good for some that have that knack but I am not accustomed to the type of pressure they put on a person.
good,Verizon had to sell to Frontier to keep afloat.  The last year working there was brutal with ongoing layoffs and departments shut down.  The work environment was stressful never knowing when the company was going to close your department and lay you and your team off even when we had good results.
good,The experience of working at Verizon was by minimal standards an average experience.  The benefits were competitive.  The management was not personable.
good,"Professional work environment. I was a contract worker and not availed the opportunity for full time work. After 6mths, I was not given an offer of full time work."
good,"productive and hard working.To start with, the most amazing part of this company is it does not let you feel like you are a employee. It feels like a family. Work is good and great seniors to guide. You feel you are in safe hands."
good,"working on account to correct money posted errors and also make sure account was current you shouldn't make a person fill this part out with info due to h"
good,Stressful working with disgruntled customers with minimal downtime.  Shift availability was lacking.  Any advancement meant lower shift bid and start all over.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"No comment at this time. I really do not have anything good to say about working for Verizon Wireless, it was very stressful with poor upper management."
good,"learn how to sell phones and other wireless devices, such as tablets, and watches. pick up and drop off location for fios cable boxes. Heavy traffic. We also sign customers up for fios service as well as port over people to Verizon. ."
good,Working at Verizon allowed me to experience support different locations and have the ability to visit those locations as needed.  I covered stores all over the Vegas valley including the lower portion of Utah.
good,Management was bad. I wish I had a better district manager that will support the store no matter what happens. That way all team members will be motivated to go above and beyond.
good,"Experienced in a variety of roles impacting corporate performance by analyzing numbers, streamlining and optimizing processes, and driving the changes necessary to move companies forward.  Add value to businesses by driving profitability while reducing audit resources. Leverage strong interpersonal skills to drive key partnerships."
good,good pay for most sales position although very competitive and cutthroat at times. it is at times hard to remain morally conscious while management is on you to hit certain metrics and quotas
good,There was a lot of learning while I was at this job. Colleagues were helpful and friendly and helped me adapt. It was overall a pleasant place to work at.
good,"Never got the same information from the trainers,  training was user friendly or prepared a new rep. ready to start taking calls for such a high status company in the correct manner.  And help was scarce."
good,Answered calls from the customers in usa to resolve any issues they are having about their phone or services provided to them. Some calls extreme but other then that I resolve the problem and continue  on to the next call
good,"Verizon Wireless was a easy and relaxed work environment.  It gave a lot of opportunities.  The management was not good because the company kept changing upper management.  This made it uncomfortable  as far as job security goes.  The constant thought was if they can easily replace the management, the regular employees don't have a chance."
good,"You have to like a call center environment to work at Verizon.The hours often changed, everyone started on evening shifts.  stressful in terms of sales."
good,"was there long ago,......good management.......much has changed I understand........very few there I knew or worked with........very big now and has changed"
good,"The Verizon Leadership Team lacked clear vision. Company is very ""silo-ed"", and company re-organizations occurred every 6 months. "
good,"fast paced environment that has lofty sales quotas. the sales quotas made you feel as if you had to toe the line of integrity and pushy sales. overall sub-par career, stressful"
good,The management for Verizon was not in tune with the needs of the local client.  Was pushing sale of products not required in the area at the time making it difficult to meet quotas put in place.
good,Typical call center - metrics driven. Most people & supervisors are as inexperienced as you. Expect you to learn on the fly while on calls but do give you the basics like how to work the programs needed
good,Too slow paced of an environment for me.  Made it hard to stay competitive or maintain a drive.  The beginning of the experience lead me to believe it would have more potential than my what i have experience at the job thus far.
good,Very fun and competitive environment until bankruptcy took 401K and Verizon purchased company and outsourced Commercial Collection Department to third party agency.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great experience to be a part of market leader.  The chance to have a role that made a significant difference in attributing to success is vital.Good store locations.
good,I was doing summer intern with them. I could not generalize the experience that I had with them. It was a very short period couple of months before I moved Full time in a different firm.
good,"Directory assistance- gave phone numbers to callers."
good,tons of pressure for gains even management willing to throw you under the bus to protect themselves. Management does not help increase sales on add busy work
good,With the integration of wireline and wireless the culture has changed and quarterly employees are worried if they are being laid off.  In the past you were an employee not an employee number and that has changed.
good,"I like working here for the most part. Hours were good. Pay was awesome when you made sales. Manager was amazing, she always tried to help us when we needed it."
good,Ok if you are looking for something short term and do not mind working long hours. Can be rewarding if you are willing to be an aggressive rep or you do not have a conscience.
good,I spent 9 years providing customer service and putting my job first. I loved my co-workers and the pay was GREAT. Some of the managers were young and the job title went to their heads.
good,Strictly commission based. But the training was excellent and they had weekly outings for the staff. If you like sales then this is the job for you the only thing you should know is that you get paid off of installs not the actual sale.
good,"general office work, customer service, sending reports, interacting with inter-company  employees in other buildings or departments was the usual.  I learned a lot about phone service and equipment and how busy certain cities are.  I liked the great pay and benefits.  It was hard being compared to other employees who didn't work as efficiently, then being averaged together."
good,"Normal work schedule on a team covering 24/7. Worked many shifts for the needs of the team. Incredible work environment, learned many new skills due to the ever changing technology. Management team seemed very detached at the time of my departure which drastically affected morale. Most difficult time would be the cut-throat mentality close to the end of my time there, no one seemed to want to share their experiences or what they discovered or learned. A very diverse and talented group of people did make the job enjoyable."
good,basically you are selling phone taking payment handling customers accounts creating new account.  great getting to meet new people each and everyday.  ok
good,"My career at Verizon has grown gradually, the team was very collaborative."
good,"Good company, good people, decent pay, decent benefits. Shifts were changeable, which was nice. You also get discounts on certain things which is nice too."
good,Getting Laid Off is an unfortunate tide of things to come in the telecommunications industry. I wouldn't have ever left unless I was forced to. I  loved my job. I was happy.
good,Great job to have and management is very supportive and encouraging although there was a lot of room for a more fun culture in the office environment. Customers can be both stressful and enjoyable in addition to excellent benefits.
good,Promotion of people in leadership roles that have a lack of knowledge or ability to get things done. Management known to steal work and pass off work of employees as their own. Very unethical behavior when it comes to promoting individuals on their true merits. Attempts to hide behind made up reasons on why not to promote or let go of their employees to other teams. Resorts to calling hiring managers of other teams interested in hiring of employees and circumventing the HR hiring process.
good,"High volume sales and customer service. Greeting customers selling and demo products including cell phones, tablets ect. Gizmo pals, fit bits, speakers ect"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Long hours and weekend work expected.  Constant downsizing and restructuring due to mergers and acquisitions left no job security as most IT positions are taken off-shore.
good,Worked for an authorized retailer and it was horrible. Only good thing about the job was my coworkers. Verizon corporate is supposed to be better though
good,"turns out that the G.C. Services company was laid off and doesn't exist anymore. However, the company was a stickler for fast pace work and little attention to accuracy. I found myself trying to maintain fast work while devastatingly ignoring away from detail accuracy; in order to stay in good standing."
good,"provide technical support to fiber optic customers in  a call center environment,  long hours of prolonged sitting infront of a computer screen dealing with frustrated customers"
good,"Too stressful to achieve goals. working weekends and holidays. too much pressure to achieve goals. Good compensation, benefits, insurance and 401K. good employee discounts."
good,Decent customer service training job. It helped me pay my bills for the time I needed the job while in transition to another career field that pertained to my degree.
good,"Growth opportunity, great leadership, great management, workplace culture is amazing. the most enjoyable party of the job is identifing needs. you learned things on a daily basis"
good,"A highly stressful work environment. Up to 50 calls per day. Various department cross training. Supervisor support. Credo concentration. Troubleshooting device or billing issues with customers can be challenging, but resolving is rewarding."
good,"Workplace culture is very fast paced and ever changing. You must change your selling style to match the needs of the companies focus. Typical days at work are training new employees while selling to customers. Management is mostly numbers bases, they go over your strengths and areas that need work. "
good,Typical work day.  Very competitive environment.  Training was provided for customer service reps but attrition was high.  Management was concerned and played a part in operation.
good,Has all the technology you need. The perks are really good. They provide tuition reimbursement and a great medical package. In fact the Health insurance premiums rarely go up because of the size of the company
good,Verizon is a competitive workforce where you are in charge of how much money can be made for yourself. a competitive team not only motivates you to try harder but teaches you skills that will be helpful in this competitive type of environment
good,"On a regular day you come into work punch in and go into a meeting about what is expected that day. Then you spend the next 4-6 hours working with customers, take a lunch and finish your shift. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management, the pressure to perform is very high and the consequences are equally stressful. You will be required to push products/services that customers more often than not do not need and do not necessarily want and you are expected to push this on every customer especially the elderly (sickening sometimes). The most enjoyable part of the job is honestly interacting with other coworkers. You will be compensated nicely but for someone like myself, I want to be able to sleep at night and this job doesn't always line up with that."
good,i worked for them for a little over a year. management seemed to be lacking. friendly people though.good pay and available overtime. lots of pushing the buck though.
good,"Working out of an office in a shared building, while supporting a National Program of a Worldwide Company isn't exactly what you'd think of when you explain you head the Public Relations Demo Program for the whole of Verizon Wireless!"
good,"Wasn't a fan of Verizon partnering with Comcast. Comcast is continuously rated as one of the worst in any industry for customer service, year in and year out.  After that partnership became final, I began looking for my exit. I was never comfortable in pushing Comcast services."
good,"My typical day included a lot of data analysis, quality assurance and training development.  The employee's were eager to learn new things for the most part.  Some managers not so but for the most part management was interested in learning new ways to improve their team processes."
good,"Worked in integrating 27 distinct company applications due to the purchase of so many companies and hardware used to run, control, operate, manage, network manage all of the different vendor hardware and software products."
good,Use to be a great place to work....   Hours are terrible but at least we use to make good $.  Customers are rude and ignorant for the most part and quotas are ridiculously high
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Decent work environment. Life and work balance is OK.  Chances of growing are there but not straight forward to reach. People are generally nice and easy to work with
good,"Fast paced, we did have a lot of overtime so that help a lot as far as the pay. I work in the call center the manager were very nice to work with I like working there."
good,I was a single mother who was forced to shift bid every three months and that did not work for me having a very young daughter. It was not family friendly at all.
good,"Clock in go through emails to fix any past orders or information."
good,it was third party verizon not cooperate wasnt a bad place to work but i rather work cooperate than third party because of the better discounts and things like that.
good,Great place to start a sales career and gain experience. Long hours if you want to make decent money.  You have to be very patient with some customers as they can be extremely rude.
good,The independent stores were difficult to run & make money. Not enough foot traffic or stock on popular phones. Management rotated monthly due to turnovers
good,"A typical work day at Vz can range from 8-10 hours, at times high paced and high stressed enviroement while ensuring outages are kept to a minmimum."
good,The company is pushing towards the future with Fios service. A lot of jobs in the company have evolved from Fios being available in many areas now. Some areas still don't have the service but that is constantly changing.
good,"I love my co-workers and my manager"
good,"The benefits were great however they started cutting back on those along with employees. Had a good work life balance, but you were treated like Number."
good,"fun work place, great mentors always willing to teach you. Get to preview the greatest tech before it gets released. would recommend to anyone who is interested in not only cell phones but new tech as well."
good,Management needs to be better. Overall it was a fun experience just didn’t care for my manager. Would leave constantly during work and leave me and my assistant manager to cover. Great company though.
good,The management team was not strong and you could sense disgruntled people. This was caused by the acquisitions of other companies and lay offs. Most looked out for themselves.
good,Good Process and Procedures.  
good,Verizon provided a warm and friendly work culture.  Management was open minded and was not just concerned about your job performance but they cared for you as an individual.  A great place to work for a person with a family.
good,"this is a good company to work for. this is almost the best company in the world, well not always but maybe. you should try to work here someday it may or may not be good for you."
good,They treat employees horrible and do not care about you at all. They will make up a reason to fire you just to do it. They will say you did something that you didnt just to get rid of you because they want too. If you are not management you have no job security
good,As an employee at Verizon you are paid hourly and given a performance bonus which is achievable to reach every month if you apply yourself. you need to be very knowledge about the phones and stay up to date with all the new phones.
good,Was a great place to work at. There where loads of different project to become at part of while I was there. There was a great team presents in working with out teams.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,For the most part Verizon is a pretty good place to work.
good,rewarding work with many areas of the business to experience.  need the ability to quickly get up to speed as the business continues to change and grow.
good,I enjoyed working with the talent at Verizon.  Very intelligent group.  Learned many things and made good friends.  Was able to work with the latest technologies which helped make the position very enjoyable.
good,they treat their employees like slaves. They set high quotas and make it almost unattainable. The managers are lazy and when you need them to help they either ignore you are hide.
good,"While Verizon Wireless treats their employees well, be prepared to work hard. No shortcuts with this company. They really want the best customer service."
good,"the job is okay, just no real chance to make any money here. other locations are great. but they have 2 store not even on opposite sides of the road 3 minutes apart same side of the road"
good,Verizon is a good company as far as array of jobs and benefits. Management is okay. Some good and some very bad. Just got laid off in another annual round so job security is shakey.
good,"This Company is on the downtrend, too much individual politics are ruining the company. The Company has now turned in full mode on revenue only a cutting back on all value added stuff just pretend and polish is left."
good,"GTE was a fantastic place to work with supportive management and many opportunities."
good,it was a great experience and cool people. working for commission was really dope.  one complaint I had though is that it is a huge pain to get any time off approved.
good,i can't give a review for a company i was  not a permanent employee i was a contractor and moved around in various departments and cities so it may have changed
good,"Not the best company to work for, pay structure changes frequently. Company seems more concerned about its client base than its employees. One positive is they do match your 401k on what you put in"
good,"High Energy sales environment . There is opportunity for growth if you enjoy the retail enviorment. There is much room for improvement when it comes to work/life balance. "
good,"outside work was uncomfortable job was commission"
good,"N/A"
good,Worked at Cellular sales. I like how you could pick your hours. I also liked being able to help the people coming into the stores. The job itself can be rough.
good,"I was the customer service agent selling phone, internet, and TV services over inbound calls. The pay was great if you started with a four year degree. You actually work 7 hours and 45 min exactly in a days work because as long as you are off your phone, they will beep you and remind you to stay on. They only allow 15 min for restroom use throughout the day."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"When I worked for Verizon Wireless, I enjoyed going to work. And raved about the company but since our merger with Verizon, we have seen layoffs yearly and have adapted to the Verizon mentality and the company is now going downhill."
good,I left the company for better opportunities.   During my timeframe with GTE/Verizon Wireless I was seeking employers that offer advancement opportunities and team players
good,"I worked at an Agency that had the Verizon Wireless account. Always worked with nice, dedicated and hard working people who were based in New Jersey. It was a very busy retail account with a massive amount of promotions that appeared in all major newspapers."
good,"learned management and new technology. It is working good If you have a family.  Good benefits Company supported,  But need to work harder it depends on your project"
good,It has been almost 15 years since I was employed at Verizon but culture was good when I worked at the company and it was a decent place to work. Room for advancement.
good,Very fast past environment with little breaks. It can be long hours with sometimes no breaks or late lunches. Some management can be very pushy which and want you to continue to push your customer. Benefits and 401k are the best
good,"I loved how the work environment was very diverse it was a huge melting pot. they really valued their employees, I loved it there. I have met a lot of good people"
good,If your looking for quick money and a fast paced work environment you got it.  It is constantly selling things the customers don't really need.  It has  long hours too.
good,"bad work environment, commission structure sucks, goals too high, how they had the hours set up was not employee friendly, not a fun place to work...."
good,Laid-off for budget reasons.  Seems almost unbelievable in hindsight.  I had 29.5 years.  All attempts at rehire were fruitless due to location issues.
good,The job was alright.  The benefits and pay are a plus.  There are advancement opportunities just ensure that you know what they are and be focused on the steps to move up.
good,"I was responsible for the software integrity and performance of certain subsystems of the overall order entry and provisioning system for Verizon's fiber capacity.  I usually worked on new COBOL development and enhancements but did a good amount of maintenance as well.  Some days maintenance issues took priority and I managed my own time to resolve them quickly and get back to development.  "
good,Verizon Wireless is a very huge place. Your work environment depends on the group you join. Just shop the workplace before you commit to signing on there.
good,This is a good company if you want to learn about the communication realm.  Good training to do the phone call reviews and to handle issues wit the customers.
good,"Advancement and promotion is possible without a degree, but a degree in any field of education is preferred and give a better chance to succeed. Must able to handle a high amount of stress."
good,"The digital world promises consumers a better, more connected life, and we’re the ones delivering it. We make it possible for people to stay in touch and businesses to connect with their customers. We’re also bringing technology and hands-on learning opportunities directly to kids who need it most. Our goal is to inspire tomorrow’s creators to use technology to build brighter futures for themselves, their families and the world."
good,"Steady and productive work, fair wages and good health benefits, safe clean environment. Various shift hours, tuition program. several locations with good access"
good,"Only worked here for a short period of time, training was 12 weeks long. You have to bid on your shift every so often. Upper management was fun and take the time to help and support you."
good,"the  job is a great way to start off in your career or even just something to do in the meantime. It's very fun, you get to help and meet a lot of people."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,verizon is a terrible place to work and they are not good to their employees. they work you to death and have no respect for anything except their own profits.
good,Verizon was a great place to work. The downside to it was the revolving door in management. IF the districts were realigned that meant new management would be coming in to the location. This was hard to gain momentum in trying to move forward with the company.
good,I hope no employer sees this because this is ridiculous....this company no longer exists and has been closed and no one is there why do i have to do this for EVERY ONE!!!!!!!
good,Benefits are great and pay is awesome. Set schedule. Didn't like that each manager had their own idea of rules and how things should be done. Never knew what to do on decisions. Managers are suppose to take over calls if customer gets too belligerent. Many managers would not and leave you to be abused by customer.
good,"Minimum wage + barely reasonable commission with high quotas and expectations. They put a lot of pressure on associates to sell everything they possibly can, even if it might not be in the customer's budget, and if the associates don't, then either they are written up, or fired. Also, the company does not have enough staffing to the point where we are working and not being able to take lunch and they write us up for working pass our 5th hour."
good,Benefits are great. The consistent movement of employees and management makes it difficult to get settled in and really work your way up with this company.
good,"I have made some amazing relationships with a lot of people who helped me sharpen diverse areas of my skill set. One major drawback at this time is lack of local growth."
good,Verizon (Victra) is an up and rising indirect company associated with Verizon Wireless and has a lot of growth potential. It was a competitive work environment.
good,Having Good Experience in Agile Testing and Automation testing and also good expertise in working on hybrid framework. Having Sound knowledge on health care domain.
good,"I took inbound calls for VZW and it taught me how to have patients. This job was the job where the company would allow the customers to talk 2 you in any way they wanted to at the time. However, I love how it taught me other ways of getting my point across with out being rude to my customers."
good,"Freedom in the job  out in the field most of the time. self managed for the most part.  Fun to train young, inexperienced sales reps.  decent pay and benefits."
good,"The work day consist of 7.5 hour work days with great pay and benefits, as well as job protection thanks to CWA Union. The hardest part of the job is having to offer customers services after the customer has expressed a need to lower their bill due to financial hardship and we are expected to increase each customers bill by $15-$20 to ""grow revenue""."
good,The day is pretty relaxed since there are no managers are on the floor but Policies should be updated and enforced. Cellular Sales culture should definitely change.  Ive always done sales but my knowledge has definitely grew stronger. Management should touch base more often with employees and the best thing i enjoyed about my job are my coworkers.
good,"Stable environment, they give you great benefits, commissions are dwindling but overall a solid gig.  Tuition reimbursement is nice and should be taken advantage of.  Management pushes and expects a lot because they are under the gun as well.  The most enjoyable part is closing a deal, as I find in most sales jobs."
good,A typical day at work is knowing how to provide the best solutions to our customers. We listen to their needs and give them feedback on what will best interest them. I learned how to become the best solution specialist. Management helps us whenever we need it and coaches us. The hardest part of the job is the far commute.
good,"Nice place to work."
good,"Your co-workers will mostly be either nerdy or deported gang bangers. The nerds were fun to be around. Management are heartless pricks, with exception to the one I had in DSL was a nice guy."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Small Business and Consumer sales"
good,Working at Verizon and developing a positive vs negative view of the company depends to a large extent on the call center location.  The company itself is highly motivated to succeed in a competitive environment.  Representatives are expected to adhere to company policy and to understand the necessity of working within the confines of a large corporation with various personalities and levels of management.
good,Verizon was a great company to work for.  I was able to grow a lot while I worked at Verizon.  The work environment was excellent and you had management support.
good,The company Verizon is big but the DoD IT department was small and was not well managed by Information Technology managers. It was not a place to think of growth.
good,"Verizon is a good company to work with."
good,"I interned in a retail store for Verizon. All of the employees are commission based, and as intern you are not allowed to sell anything. There is no set program for the internship and at the end of it you are offered a job in the store."
good,During the beginning of the day it is slow but sometimes customers come in waves and the store becomes very busy. It is a very fast paced workplace and must memorize in detail about what verizon offers its customers.
good,My time at Verizon was a good job and most days were filled with activity for customer service and issues in the field for customers that were solved and fixed by my crews.
good,its been so long I do not remember other than it was a call center who depended on knowledge and skill to problem solve. I learned how to provide customer service
good,"the company has good pay & great benefits,  however,  there is no work/life balance unless you're in management and show up when you please or unless you've been there 15+ years... hours are long & during holiday just forget seeing your family period! I was in sales operations & my position was cut after several years with no explanation or reasoning... if you enjoy sales & are good at lying to customers & sticking them with products & services they do not need, nor did they ask for them Verizon is the company for you!"
good,"Verizon is not the best place to work. However, it's a job the will help feed your family. Mangement is not the best and does not support staff. Pay is not the best."
good,The is would have been a good place to work if the primary objective was to offer good customer service and not to make a sale no matter what.  This created a very cutthroat and dishonest atmosphere.
good,"Working in a call center is tough. There are always several people, maybe hundreds, that have been there for many more years than you and are therefore theoretically higher on the list to get advanced. That doesn't always happen and I've seen people work the worst shifts for years only to get passed up by some young new star that was friends with the right people. Corporate business would be fine if it was equal. I'm content when someone with a masters degree and 5 years experience gets a position when I have a bachelors and 3 years experience. I don't like when I make my own way to shadow and train and take advantage of the continuing education offered by the company, and there are no opportunities after all that work. I can't work in a call center all my life, so I'm looking for new opportunities to grow."
good,"it's a very demanding job. very needy as well as having to give up holidays with family, weekends. high pace and high quota with lower pay each year. very helpful."
good,"I usually worked alone during my shift.  I was responsible for keeping the store stocked with merchandise, activating new service, trouble shooting problem units, billing issues for customers."
good,"Things were always changing, which made the job exciting. It was a great experience being apart of a company that was growing and is well respected. They also paid for my school, which was awesome!"
good,I worked for an indirect dealer. It was a little different than a corporate store. It gave me more of an opportunity to learn faster and be promoted quicker.
good,"In call center environment it is always fast paced. You can not take customers concerns personal.  They have valid concerns and they are calling for assistance or to be educated,"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,This is an excellent position for employees who crave monitoring and structured work life.  Union environment with a good relationship with management
good,"It's your typical sales job. You have monthly goals, depending on your location, that you have to hit. Immediate managers were always nice and understanding."
good,"very fast paced busy cell phone store you know how it is."
good,Was a great job with a lot of micromanaging from the top down but paid well and offered great benefits.  Had to relocate or I may still be there today.
good,Cool place to work. I enjoyed it while I spent my time there. Cool environment and nice people. Saw the same customers more than anything. It was ok though.
good,Benefits and salaries are good. Forced downsizing is a constant threat to career stability. This also causes a significant stress on those remaining who must pick up the workload.
good,"Decent job"
good,"The working environment can be a bit slow-paced and the the overall vibe is very relaxed. However, for what is being expected of you, a little bit more pay would be a little more reasonable."
good,"working for Verizon, you have to travel most of the time from place to place, there  is a set salary, no commission, and if you don't make your monthly quota they will replace you."
good,"I learned how to be patient with customers and have good listening skills. Management was supportive. But the hardest part was the shift bid. Since you were required to bid on a new shift every 6 months to a year. Which meant you were changing your schedule, not a very good work life balance. Especially for those who have families or are students, or just have other things in life to do. I most enjoyed speaking to customer from all walks of life, hearing their stories, crying with them when they're sad and laughing with them when they're happy. Also connecting and building relationships throughout."
good,Taking inbound calls. pay and benefits are great but the job can be very stressful. Metrics based and most times your hands are tired as to what you can do for the customers which then affects your metrics which affects you schedule.
good,"Starts with opening the store and making sure that everything is neatly stocked."
good,started in accounting dept working various jobs.cash unit as deposit clerk...service order dept ...and mail machine operator sending out telephone bills...in 1979 started my career in computers...then printer dept then computer operations
good,"Started at GTE Mobilnet in 1994, then became GTE Wireless and then merged w/ Bell Atlantic and became Verizon, transferred from wireless to landline division in 2001 due to family illness and worked for landline until taking early retirement package in 2015 due to sell to Frontier Commmunications"
good,"Nice place to work.  Good people and good managers.  Corporate Verizon has no loyalty to hardworking employees.  They will lay you off if they can cut cost,"
good,"As far as call centers go the pay is most I have ever made but the managers and policy are a mess. No one is on the same page and the metrics they set are crazy , The teach you to do one thing and they ask you to do something different."
good,"Fast Paced environment calls were back to back, hardly had down time the management are micro manage it wasn't the customers that were a problem but it was the internal.  The hours you had to bid based on senority"
good,"typical work day, but it can be very stressful at time there is not enough management to help the front line employee. I had been there almost 9 years and if you want to up in the company it is best to be mobile"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good place to work, job security but pay needs to be more, total compensation is lower. good health plan. Time to improve on management styles. High talent people tend to leave."
good,"Excellent culture, fair pay and benefits, but being transferred long distances from my home was a challenge. I loved the people I worked with and the ability to enhance my skills."
good,"I worked for a verizon franchise store, which was a good starting job. I have not worked there for over 14 years. verizon currently appears to look like a good company to work for."
good,It was strictly commission only since I worked for an authorized dealer called Cellular Sales and not corporate Verizon. You would have really good months and some slow months depending on when phones and tablets were released. My management and team was awesome but it was difficult to advance within the company.
good,"work life balance did not exist. when life events happened, you did not always get the time that was needed to take care of those events.  many would be let go due to re mapping of the company."
good,"Call center environment. Fast paced. Poor management with exception of a few. Career progression is poor, no room for growth as upper management does not remove poor supervisors causing employees who are outperforming to leave the company."
good,good place to work. Supervisors are very helpful and lots of incentive programs for those employees that meet sales quota. Training program is very good.
good,Not able to give accurate review due to being subcontractor. I do like the products and services offered by Verizon Wireless. Would like to have the services offered to employees.
good,"Productive and fun place to work with ping pong tables..."
good,The benefits and time off were great. As a CSR the position was stressful due to the metrics and management. I worked in the call center and handled customer service and sales calls.
good,"You have to be in this company so you can see for yourself. N/A"
good,"The company is a good company to work for, depending upon the division you're in. It is a typical corporate telecomms environment. There is evidence of a meritocracy, but it seems that Sales dominates any conversation with little forsight on implementation."
good,Diversity on a senior leadership level and fair movement and compensation is not practiced. Work life balance is not good. Job advancement lacking. on all levels.
good,Work/life balance is an issue. The hours are very long and days off are hard to come by. Upper management is helpful and available. Compensation package is good for management.
good,"Extremely stressful, managers push for strict metrics. Employees are monitored to within an inch of their lives. The call monitor process works on the assumption that there's always room for improvement somewhere, on a 10 out of 10 call monitor score you will still be left feeling like you personally are responsible for the downfall of the company."
good,"The manager I had didn't know how to train me. He didn't use my strong suit. He was only able to see what worked for him individually. "
good,"Its cool especially if you love technology and an always changing environment, so must be able to adapt quickly. Extremely lucrative if you want to make money."
good,"I've been working for Verizon for 14 years now.  I've been in the same department for 7 years.  Unfortunately, there is seldom an opportunity given to promote morale.  Many of my co-workers do not like each other which causes tension and animosity amongst team members.  On top of that it's clear to me that upper management is aware of the tension in the group and does nothing to rectify it.  The typical work day is always busy and because of they type of work I do it's always interesting.  There is always an opportunity to learn something new.  The hardest part of the work is dealing with the stress amongst team members."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,version is stressful if you ave to be there often. the work environment is childish. The good part is you get to see events. Short term it works but not long term.
good,It depends on the manager or supervisor you have. The first two supervisors know how to treat you with dignity and respect. They also know how to correct your faults without trying to embarrass you. The last one -whole different world.
good,Worked for 30 years and enjoyed my job.  Only part I can complain about is that I don't work there any longer. Made some good friends and will be thankful to have had the opportunity to work there for as long as I did.
good,"I worked for an authorized retailer, not corporate. Overall, it's not a bad company. They do not pay very well and have a lot of turnover because of that. Managers don't make the money that they deserve for the amount of hours required."
good,"I really respected my VP here, great guy.  The processes and procedures in place are tedious, very time consuming dealing with back-end process, over-priced product."
good,Commissions are constantly being adjusted and you seem to make less money year over year for selling double year over year.  You are constantly micro managed as well.
good,"The benefits and high compensation are what deters most people from leaving the company. However, there are about two major layoffs every year, and without job security, it has created a highly political and stressful working environment. I found that the aged system of inflexible work weeks and prohibited remote work, has hindered production and enjoyment in the work place. Although the company is trying to make improvements esthetically, the culture remains the same from the executives trickling down to independent consultants."
good,A typical day would consist of going in the office and standing all day so no one falls asleep and to practice our pitch and go over goals. Then we would go out into the field and walk around signing people up and having fun as we went. Finally we would come back to the office and talk about how our day went and how to improve.
good,A typical day at Verizon is crazy. Management is not helpful and they have their pick of people that they like working with. The hardest part about this job is their is no room to grow with the company.
good,Left with the ability to do the tasks assigned with minimal supervision. Held to a standard that was acceptable and expected but yet not limited to my abilities.
good,The company grew to fast and produced a major lay off that lost most of the real experienced  personnel.  Good people to work with and even with the corporate mentality it still was a nice atmosphere
good,"Great company to work for"
good,Great place to work as a remote contractor.  FTE resources seem to get worked to death.  Management is fairly mediocre with most being lifers just hoping to make it to retirement.  Don't look for innovation or any kind of leadership or mentoring.  New ideas are not well received .  This is essentially a sales organization and it's immediately evident through lack of operating processes.  It's also a giant company where silos are plentiful and the environment is fairly dog eat dog.
good,"Overloaded company structure to big to provide a sense of involvement."
good,"Maintaining a professional environment should never be an issue, but when management and employees are not on the same page it is hard to keep moving towards the same goal."
good,everyone was very nice to work with. over time was available. it was in a great location. the only down side was i don't speak Spanish and most of the customers spoke Spanish so it was hard to under stand them
good,"Wonderful place to bring the Family. A great place to enjoy basketball, hockey, arena football, concerts and more. They also hold conference's and other spirtually events as well."
good,"On the phones all day, decent pay but strict rules. Break areas left a lot to be desired. For the most part management was approachable, very odd outlook on late/absent."
good,"A fun place to work as long as you have the proper leadership in place. The benefits (medical, dental) are first class. The company as a whole seems to care about their employees."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,A typical day at work is working with customers trying to resolve their issues. The workplace environment you are dealing with very nosey people. Everybody is sitting on top of each other.
good,I worked in a sales and service call center tethered to my desk. Verizon isn't for everyone. I need to move about and interact with the public in person. It was a great experience.
good,"The company was not prepared with an infrastructure to move into the Healthcare space."
good,"A typical work day includes potty breaks only. "
good,We no longer focus on performance but on budget.  Due to two consecutive years of layoffs promotions have become a bit stagnant due to lack of backfills.
good,"Managers are given almost absolute power and can terminate you for any reason or none at all. I thoroughly enjoyed the compensation but they want you to sell products to sell them, not because the customer needs them. They want the mix of products they want even if you're a high performer. I'm still hanging on but looking.."
good,Everyday brings a new challenge.  Verizon thrives on the challenges of the competitors.  Verizon prides itself in being the number one wireless company.
good,"Liked working there. Work overload was a bit much at times with busy store and mostly understaffed. Breaks were not scheduled properly, expected a lil' too much out of sales reps, especially hours and meetings, making it a long long work day with sometimes little balance with life. Benefits and pay were fantastic."
good,"Rate this company"
good,"I did two internships and they always felt so rushed, yet that I didn't learn or do anything related to my intern title. Since it is a big company but some offices are much smaller, many interns get different benefits and it makes the dynamic weird. Both work environments were nice but there was not much opportunity for me to move up based on my degree. Also they have bad recruiting techniques, after my second internship I was in contact with someone to try to get a full time job, and after I hadn't heard from them in a few months I emailed them. The person had moved on from their job and no one had let me know. Then, the new person assigned to my profile/helping me didn't answer some of my emails. I didn't really want to work there anymore so I was fine with it but it made me a little upset that they dropped me like a hot potato without even expressing their disinterest in a different way. My boss had told me had suggested they hire me, too, so I didn't understand why they didn't care so much."
good,"focused on achieving profits for the organization"
good,"very little direction, new products very slow to market, always playing catch up with competition. Overall culture is good especially with some extremely talented people."
good,can be a fun enviroment if you are doing well and picking up training quickly. have to have the patience to speak with angry customers and  not let them get to you.
good,"This was the most competitive workplace and work culture I've ever been exposed to. The pressure to perform was nice at times, but the company's virtues and mine did not align, which made it difficult to perform my job. The organization within the district was also very disorganized and caused a lot of chaos and confusion amongst the stores and its employees."
good,Leadership is a little fake. A lot of beating around the bush and nothing ever is a straight up answer. Benefits are great and opportunities in growth are decent
good,"The company has excellence benefits like tuition reimbursement and prepay. However, there is a lack of job security, the supervisors are unprofessional and often times don't know how to do the job that they are monitoring. So how can one evaluate you on something they know nothing about?"
good,"During my typical workday, I am responsible for processing various customer orders. I  help other co-worker with any issues they may be having. I followup with and internal third parties to insure completion of order is a successful.    to complete such as doing mock-ups or securing rights to songs. I keep in touch with clients, update them on our progress and make sure they are satisfied."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Cool place if you don't have kids and don't mind working all the time, when its good its good but when its not it is NOT. Hourly and commission a lot of changes to the job so be prepared for that"
good,had a good time working and with my coworkers.  the pay was good and the work environment was fun.  the company knew how to drive there sales and make the working want to hit their goals
good,"Verizon used to be a great place to work until they started acquiring other companies and losing money. All that mattered then is shoving unnecessary products down customers' throats that wouldn't be able to afford it later. Their whole culture has changed to making money instead of caring about its customers. They laid off so many people because of their poor business decisions."
good,"The sales side of the business is fast-paced and competitive; the operations side is very gratifying. There is always plenty to do, and the work is engaging and requires an array of skills."
good,"I enjoyed working at Verizon.  It was a large company with a small company feel.   Again, I hate that I have to keep adding more comments before I can move forward with my job request."
good,It was fine. Like any phone store youre micromanaged and watched from cameras through out the store. no leaning on anything having to stand straight up and try and call customers from the street to come into your store. sell sell sell
good,The company is extremely sales focused and uses very aggressive tactics to achieve its sales goals. If you don't mind a high pressured sales position with decent pay Verizon may be the best place to work.
good,"Great job 5 years ago. Great 401k! Great health insurance. You will work hard and be help to high standards. Watch your back, make a mistake and there will be a knife in it."
good,Fast paced and constantly changing environment but a great place to learn about the tech industry and grow as a professional. Typically work cross-functionally with multiple organizations so communication skills are important.
good,"I am not able to complete this portion, due to the fact that the company I currently work for (CenturyLink) partners with Verizon and I sold Verizon products on their behalf"
good,"Verizon takes very good care of their employees as far as benefits are concerned. The problem here is with most commissioned sales jobs. The management is constantly encouraged to micromanage by higher ups and breath down your neck on every sale. You are treated as a child and if you don't pitch each of the 20 current ""targeted"" products with every single person you work with you are yelled at and sometimes documented that you didn't bring it up. The problem is that they make you decide whether or not to feed your family or abide by their creado. Most the successful sales people are extremely shady and will lie to customers to close a sale. After the customer sees their next bill and calls in to complain, management just credits the bill. A person who is making the managers a lot of money gets no punishment for this as they are showing high sales numbers each month. Once someone who isn't doing well does one thing like this they are pulled into the office and screamed at. If you say that .... does this and never gets yelled at, they will say that the conversation is about you and not them. But then are quick to compare your results to everyone else. Do not work in sales! It is miserable unless you are willing to lie to customers faces"
good,"It is great line of work for someone starting out in the Sales world, It is something you can do while going to school. St. Louis market is highly saturation with Verizon stores though."
good,"Hated the job itself but I really enjoyed the company.  The only problem was their stats were hard to get good performance with.  You were measured by average calls per day, 3-day resolutions, and surveys. I was good with my performance stats but they are sticklers about adherence.  I took time in between my calls to provide info for my customer and that was not ok.  I've never before had a company monitor if I needed to go to the bathroom or go on a break and they do that often.  The company tries to give employees incentives and good benefits but at the end of the day you are just a number."
good,I had fun there the people were all nice and helpful if you needed help with anything...I wouldn't love to be able to go back and work for them again.
good,They will tell you one thing and do the total opposite. I was informed when I got hired that there would be room to move and get hired in better position that never happen. They went behind my back and hired someone else.
good,Working for Verizon I was able to learn a lot about customer service and the ability to control a phone call. De-escalating irate customers and ending calls with satisfied customers became a norm for me here at Verizon with the great training they provide.
good,"This is an extremely stressful place to work. The direct management at my store did not care for employees the way they should have. This made it very difficult to enjoy your day. I loved what i did, but the management made it unbearable."
good,This is a great place to work.  They have great benefits. Lots of training. Competitive wages. Flexible schedules. Paid vacations. Great environment..
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Love the job and the company atmosphere. They have great benefits and friendly staff. Laid back but fast paced environment. Our managers strive to want us to be the best!
good,"It was an okay company to work for. However, I have went through a lot of district managers and store managers as well. The company is not for its employees"
good,Management is decent if they were employees at one time. My peers are excellent and always willing to assist one another  to resolve issues we have with the computers or system issue
good,Verizon Wireless provides excellent benefits to their employees and good pay.  Also gives good bonus but they put alot of stress on their employees.  Customer Service Reps usually tap out at some point.
good,"I worked at verizon for about 2 years. The pay structure allows you to make decent money ,$50,000+, for selling cell phones that sell themselves. Customers are dumb. Technology has outpaced intellect and you will deal with demanding people all day."
good,I was always told that if you do not have anything nice to say do not say anything at all. The only reason I am filling this out is due to the fact it will not allow me to proceed unless I do
good,"Excellent 'Wellness' staff (Gym personnel) "
good,"If you start as a retail employee the ability to get promoted can take years. The pay is decent, the time off is great, the benefits are great, work life balance is terrible. No real job security, can be replaced at any time."
good,"Great benefits.  Wish I had not gotten laid off."
good,Worked for Verizon Wireless for about 11 years. I have met and gained a tremendous amount of experience during my time.  Management was great and the culture was as well.
good,Never ending re-orgs and shifting executives makes it a challenge. Was able to learn a lot and had a lot of autonomy in my current role. Upward mobility can be challenging since management shifts very often.
good,Verizon good place to work.  It is unfair how they terminate managers without a cause.  It is also unfair how you are black ball from getting another job because a manager does not care for you.  if a manager does not like you they will write information about you that is not true.  you are not protected at verizon as a manager you really get a bad break in life.  If a person get terminated because they disagree with a manager and have an opportunity to seek employment elsewhere
good,"Making a quota of a certain number of calls daily and a 2 week quota of sales revenue.  High stress but I learned a lot about the sales call process.  We had a lot of meetings, it was a high stress corporate atmosphere.  When Idearc spun off from Verizon the culture changed rapidly not for the better.  I did enjoy the perks and commission from exceeding sales goals."
good,Decent company to work for. Good benefits. Logical place of employment for someone looking to be in a high energy sales environment. Treat employees fairly
good,"I have hit the top end of the indirect chain. I have worked here for 5 years now and while I enjoyed my time, I do not think this is a job that is fit for anyone that wants a more balanced life style. The pay is pretty decent though."
good,"Working at Verizon can be very exhilarating at times, but also frustrating based on constant change in the retail environment. You have to be well versed in many different products, and services."
good,"Day to day assistance with the functions of a retail store in a fast paced and changing environment."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great opportunity to get into a large company with many benefits that enables you to take care of your family. Nice opportunity to move between departments once you get your foot in the door.
good,"If you dont do well on your sales numbers on a regular basis, you'll be let go. You will be expected to upsale every customer. Sometimes your numbers will be low out of coincidence rather than performance."
good,if your going to work for anyone go work for the corp locations and not a franchise owner. not all franchise owners are bad. I loved working for Verizon corp
good,Poor upper Management. High employee turn over. Recent company change has caused senior employee to leave for another job. Poor training and Managers tend to play favorites.
good,A great way to make money in sales. You off the latest technology and plans and or options directly with clients. Sales goals were great as you could make a lot of extra money.
good,This was  agreat place to work in the 90s to early 2000s. The industry evolved which made life in and out of the office unpleasurable. The company did not take into consideration an individuals family life.
good,This company is very intimate and each assoch associate gets seems to get preferential treatment from senior management. This flows over and shows in the customer service that all of their customers receive.
good,I went to Verizon in mind that I heard great things from my friends but when I became apart of the team I started to see that this business isn't really about the custom service as I thought . Long story short I got laid off because I didn't want to lie to the stuff about there service in order to get a tiny sale I rather do it right an get a big commission
good,Great people good place. Has mountains of learning experience. What you learn here can be a great way to advance. Benefits can be great depending on your needs
good,"Verizon has provided me with a long, rewarding career.  However, with recent downsizing the last several years there is little room for advancement.  ""Do more with less"" is increasingly becoming the corporate mantra of the company.  A typical day can consist of 12 hours or more and include weekends.  I enjoy the comraderie and challenges presented on a daily basis but am ready to move on to the next level."
good,"As you would expect for a call center, you're always waiting for the next call to drop from the que. Answering sometimes difficult questions as well as remembering to pitch a sale. Management was often not supportive more of an us vs them mentality, with an aggressive sales goal the culture was intense. What I enjoyed most was the different people you meet over the phone."
good,Its good working experience in Verizon.I have learned new technologies and tools used in the team for troubleshooting and daily maintenance issues.Good working culture.
good,Working for a service provider means that all systems must be available 24/7 regardless of outside forces.  Servicing customers on a daily basis is fulfilling.  Working with an internal team of dedicated associates to ensure customer satisfaction is rewarding.
good,"I can't really say from the perspective of a full-time employee, but from what I could tell it seemed like a lot of overworked employees and a lot of organizational issues."
good,"I have learned a lot about technology and how it can improve peoples lives.  Every work day is different, as customer flow varies.  The hardest part of the job is when we are slow and we don't really have anything to do except clean.  The most enjoyable part is that I work in a small store so we are like family. The only reason I am looking for a new career is to be challenged again."
good,"This was an easy job, especially for a first job. Made a lot of money, hours were great, close location to where I lived, and lots of opportunity for advancement."
good,Verizon wireless is a great company to work for. If your interested in working as a team and can reach monthly incentives then I would highly recommend this company.
good,Excellent benefits and great training! The only downfall I had with the company is the second shift and weekend hours even after  being with the company for 10 years.
good,this a great place to gain experience but I have some other needs like more income because I have a family this company is very organized and it is a great school for customer service
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Testing & Development. Checking emails, responding emails. Applying code against new development, validating existing bugs and root-cause analysis and fixing bugs."
good,Not a bad job for a young person with limited education but loads of stress involved in the work. The stress of management is by far the worse. This is a company that cares about money i.e. not their staff.
good,"Its a good company, but you must be prepared for change.  It comes very quickly.  It is what you expect from a big company.  But if you are comfortable being a very small fish in a very big pond, then go for it."
good,"I started as an Independent D2D (Door-To-Door) Contractor to market Verizon Fios products was promoted to General Manager in March 2010; where I successfully coached and managed a sales force for our Central New Jersey office.  In May 2010 I was given additional responsibility to manage our South New Jersey office.  In January 2011 I was appointed launch Manager for Austin, Texas to develop a sales team marketing AT&T U-verse D2D.  Sell and promote Verizon Fios products with focus on video, 50/25 internet and phone services.  Increase penetration through winning back former customers and acquisition of new customers."
good,Calling center for inbound calls in the Dominican Republic where I learned great customer service and multi-tasking skills.
good,"The basic idea is to sell expensive things to people who don't need them. Talvek through all concerns to close the deal on smart phones, computers, accessories, and higher plans to drive your commission. You can make excellent money with repeat business and commission multipliers if you have the right aggressive mindset."
good,"Great place to work and undertook course challenging role great team. "
good,On the sales side the company asks for a lot with not enough incentives. Advancement is too political. After working there for 3 years with a very strong sales record and high positive customer review I could not get transferred to a closer location and management advancement was very political.
good,"Good company to work for who value their employees. "
good,Good company to grow in. Various locations and work hours. Good pay scale with good benefits. Good working enviorment.
good,Wireless company leader of great quality service and products. Training classes that are in depth with coaching the methods and techniques that takes you far in a sales career.
good,"You are free to learn telecom products and its processes. Though work life balance is given up for the sake of Onshore satisfaction. Management wants the team to do something , without saying what is needed"
good,Being a temporary employee sometime was ignored by permanent employees.  Did not feel like I was part of the team.  Felt excluded.
good,A typical day at Verizon is taking incoming call from guest to assist with their mobile phone service.  I took about 30-40 calls per day to ensure resolution on the first call. This was a very micro-managed environment.
good,"Because I was management, I was expected to be available most of the time. Responsibilities were many and demands from field technicians were great also. Because of constant streamlining, managers were expected to just take care of everything thrown at them. Again, salary and benefits made us kind of deal with it. Stress was high because we had to keep jumping through hoops to get the cheese at the end. My peers were great and we had each others backs."
good,As a sales person for Verizon you would think my favorite part of the job would be the sales part...but it wasn't. My favorite part of the job was actually helping customers who weren't so tech savvy to learn their new product. The appreciation the people had for someone to take a few minutes out of their day to help them and offer patience to them is what actually made me enjoy being a Verizon employee.
good,"Worked for Verizon wireless for almost 10 years, in the call center in Rancho Cordova before the closure. "
good,"I had many ups and downs at Verizon. While I enjoyed my job, It definitely took its toll on me. Working in a Verizon call center, it is very hard to have a work life balance. Mainly in part to the constant stress you are under!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Cette entreprise doit se munir de managers compétents afin de guider les employés et atteindre les objectifs.
good,"I worked for Verizon Information Services, which focused on the print and online version of the directory business (yellow pages).  It was a challenging product to sell because their print and online directories (SuperPages) were new to the market where Dex already had strong market presence.  The print medium was dying quickly and the online search function was somewhat restrictive."
good,Working in the Central office on various shifts was very educational and intriguing. I was able to gather new skills and sharpen other skills. I worked with other technician and also acted as support for less knowledgeable technicians.
good,Frontier bought out Verizon in the state I worked in.  Frontier has a completely different business model than the previous telecommunication companies I worked for through acquisitions.
good,"Extremely stressful and doesn't do as corporate trains you and wants them to do, so confusing. No work life balance especially around the holidays, and did I mention stressful. I have been in management almost all my life and I thought this would be less stressful, but no."
good,"manage many internal accounts that support day to day operations,  saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars keeping suppliers in check, and internal staff in check"
good,Nice place to work if you are interested in telecommunication. The benefits are not the best but the work atmosphere is not bad.
good,"it was cool and fun, job had lots of traveling but was not compensated. Did not like job at all too much headache and pressure"
good,it was very stressful and high turnover rates due to bad ratings. if you like call center environments this is one to stay away from.
good,"Fun place to work, sales wise. At times, very difficult to please higher ups no matter how well you do. Has potetional if you are looking to move up in retail."
good,"The hardest part of the job is cross functional communication amongst different geographical located teams to ensure changes are identified and addressed, synchronization for work tasks, and non-duplication of effort to get the efficiencies of the project deliverable. I am creating processes and maintaining them to keep chaos organized as we quickly deploy technology throughout Georgia and Alabama (i.e. small cells, Dark Fiber, Smart Antennae, etc..). I enjoy the challenge and of the technology across the various locations and working with the various types of teams/people. The senior management is very supportive, very demanding and fair."
good,"""Verizon will deliver an exceptional customer experience through superior customer support, next generation services, innovative solutions, leadership, integrity and continual improvement."""
good,"Everything you would expect working in a place like this. Fun and easy. Customers are easy to deal with, but you do learn that most of the contracts Verizon has with cell phone providers are with phones that are prone to having issues."
good,"The company culture is very high pressured boiler room in B2B.  Little bit cut throat, and think management could do a better job dealing with the sales reps and their accounts.  Management needs more training in training the reps in the online software programs. "
good,"Verizon was a very cool place to work,  I enjoyed the customers that I assisted. And learning more about the technical side of the job was also enjoyable."
good,stable company with high potential. Will be a good telecommunication and or technology company for those seeking that field.
good,"Company evolving with the technical market. Started with a regulated public utility job. Ended with a company deregulated, traded, and out dated. The landline service of the traditional local phone company has been technoligised and automated out of favor."
good,Typical day is taking a lot of calls and working with the customers to the best of our abilities and resources. Strong performances are well recognized and rewarded. The supervisors and managers have the best intentions in trying to get every employees performing better and adhering to the company's metrics. Over all a good company with great benefits and recognition program to for all who performs well.
good,being able to work from home is a great thing especially because the department is 24/7.  Also the ability to do overtime is always available and helps during the time extra cash is needed.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Tier percentage really low, takes a lot to build your paycheck compared to when the company was under the previous name, Diamond."
good,Excellent Company to work as far a compensation and benefits a a technician you can work overtime. upper mgmt micro manages.  Tough job installing fios.
good,"My experience was that the job was extremely stressful and the rewards were excellent. My time at the job was for 4 years, I felt that my commitment changed and passion for working with people was more fit for a non-profit."
good,"Not a huge fan on the ""specific"" items you're supposed to sell to customers, but learned a lot during this position. No sick time or vacation time. You have to get someone to cover your shift if you're sick/need to go on a vacation."
good,Work life balance is the biggest con.Great benefits overall between insurance/discounts.It is fun to work with new technology.
good,Work life balance is the biggest con.Great benefits overall between insurance/discounts.It is fun to work with new technology.
good,"It was a job. Created reports with was soul crushing. The best part of the job were my Co-workers. They were great. My Manager was awesome, but that was pretty much it."
good,"You are micromanaged from day one. The culture is not bad , if someone looking over your shoulder at all time do not bother you. I enjoyed working there."
good,"Good place to work with great pay and benefits, however the culture there is the worst. this is typically what you get when working as an union employee."
good,"Over all good company good company to work with, I have worked with the organization in it's early days. the management was good and HR were friendly too."
good,A good portion of the day is spent in analyzing vendors and new business opportunities.Most managers are coaches. The most difficult part of my job was work overload due to few employees. Most enjoyable part was the diversity of the company.
good,Verizon offers good benefits and a security in your position since most are union jobs. Guaranteed full time work and overtime. Good salary. Recommended if looking for corporate type employment.
good,"Responsible for accounts receivable management of outstanding claims"
good,decent place to work. pay was pretty decent. though job was stressful at times. supervisors not always easy to work with.
good,a typical day at work will be making sure material is sorted and distributed to the correct vendor. Satisfying the needs of the customer and interacting with co-workers
good,"Hourly and commission. Great benefits. Hours are your typical retail hours. Very numbers driven. Your managers make or break your job experience. Sales reps have too many responsibilities. You are also tech troubleshooting, customer service, we even have to handle inventory now. It can be very overwhelming and quota can be difficult to achieve with more unrelated responsibilities are stacking on."
good,"Great benefits and great coworkers.  Unfortunately because of ever changing restructuring, the center is closing and over 600 people were laid off."
good,I enjoyed working there while I was pregnant with my daughter. They were so friendly and treated you like family. I would recommend anyone to work there.
good,"the work is good, their training has no real structure, you learn alot as you go, they also do not pay very much, sometimes feels very un organized, met alot of people that i really enjoyed, seem to fire people alot and have a very frequent revolving door of new hires"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,One thing that I learned is that proper introductory into a company or firm is very important in the growth and development of the expected compensation level.
good,"always on time, learned new products and services. There were no  hard parts to any job, just do your job. When it was time to go home because you were on your feet all day. Exhausting."
good,Pretty good company. I believe the benefits is what motivates me to come to work everyday. Verizon pays $8000 per year toward your college education. They have paid my tuition for the past two years!
good,Company I work offers excellent benefits and financial aid options for going back to school. Unfortunately this company does lay off people a lot and is very ambiguous with its employees.
good,It had a great work atmosphere. Co-workers are friendly. Always something new to learn. Bosses are pretty hands on and very friendly. Great benefit packages.
good,if your union you will make a ton of money with good benefits but they will work you to death and breath down you neck 25 hours a day. if your not union why not consider being a manager at mcdonald's you'll make more money.
good,Great company great pay. Benefits are lacking. If you are looking to cut your teeth in sales this is a good starting point. Training is exceptional. Management is great
good,theres never enough staff so it is pretty difficult to get lunches not many coworkers want to help each other out when it is needed. some managers are not knowledgeable on the product as they should be
good,"A typical day at work was repetitious, but you get used to it. Learned a lot about making goals, and hitting the mark, setting the pace for the team. Only down fall of the job would be the fact that you get little to no time off."
good,"If your looking for great benefits and descent pay working for Verizon is great. If your looking for work and home balance this would not be ideal. Verizon is union based, therfore everything is mainly run on seniority so working all holidays, no choice on vacation days and no choice on working hours is a giving if your not a senior employee. This is a 24/7 employment,which means you will be subject to multiple shifts, no consideration for family life. You also would be subject to driving distances for your job location. There are 3 to 4 year contracts with company and union, so there are possible strikes. You don't have to join the union but in Maryland and Washington DC you still have to pay union dues."
good,"Typical day was the struggle to obtain new activations and constantly stay in sales mode. It was hard being only on commission, the owners expected you to always be on your game and always pushing a sale. Which is understandable but majority of our customers really only needed customer service and needed to be taught what they are doing rather than wanting to have a sale pushed on them every time they walk through the door. I enjoyed my coworkers, they were a great support system and was very helpful."
good,"Typical workday starts out with daily scrum meetings to synchronize teams and improve coordination. Meetings through the day as needed."
good,"A typical work day at Verizon is pretty busy. You get  calls back to back in regards to customers calling in to get issues resolved as far as their bills, troubleshooting, and ordering new equipment. The specific department that I am in now is called Customer Service Pro. In this department I take care of the disconnect calls daily from customers trying to keep them with us at Verizon. I speak about the benefit of our company and why they shouldn't leave. My coworkes are very nice and easy to work with they all make the day go buy and very entertaining. The management is fair with the company its not a lot of hands on and you have to go to many different levels if you have a problem. The hardest part of the job is trying to save customers especially the ones that are irate when they call in and its my job to get them at a even ground. The most enjoyable part is being surrounded by my coworkers daily."
good,"A typical work day was fast paced and challenging. The challenge of constantly meeting quotas was a great motivator. However, the hardest part of my job was dealing with other co-workers."
good,This is a good job to work for if you like production take work. I like customer service work. They offer different shifts.
good,"This company is great. I love my managers and my team. They have a direct interest in my well being with the company."
good,"A typical day at work was an 8 hours day with one 30 minute break. There was always a constant flow of customers with different needs. I learned how to better communicate with people, handle registers, open and close the store, and learned backgrounds of different people and how to handle difficult situations and different personalities. Management was based more so of team leads in for the day. Sometimes the general manager was there in store other days I was considered management if someone more tenured wasn't present. My co-workers and I built very close relations in and outside of work making it a happier work environment. The hardest part of the job was definitely trying to adapt to the different personalities in the beginning, but once you got the hang of it it was a breeze. Overall the part i loved most about working at Jack in the Box was seeing the smiles on everyone's faces after taking their order and sharing a joke or two with them."
good,"not much room for growth, changes are rapid, not much of a work/life balance due to retail hours, benefits are okay, salary is decent."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a GREAT company to work for along with excellent benefits, but the management is not the best.. They were VERY inconsistent and not transparent"
good,Was a better company prior to merger with Bell Atlantic. Large pieces of the business is being sold off and many acquisitions made. The overall focus of the company is lacking
good,"The compensation is very good, but there is very little room for advancement.  If you want a position with little or no advancement, and want great benefits and compensation, this is a great company."
good,Great Company. Great Benefits. Overall great company to grow in. In the retail stores there is a definite disconnect between higher management and store management.
good,stepping stone in order to get training and experience needed to move onto a more desirable position. It was an enjoyable experience.
good,Good place to work with a lot of incentives and opportunities to make extra money. Wide variety of schedules to choose from.
good,The management and culture is poor. No real leadership in the building. Incentives are bad. Never a can do mind set. Change is inevitable but the leadership doesnt seem to know how to keep up. And take it out on the employees
good,"Rotating shifts every 6 months that you bid on based on seniority. Inbound call center where you speak to customers regarding concerns about bills, equipment, travel, service issues, technical concerns etc. Enjoyable co-workers and environment."
good,"The job dealt with selling products and services for Verizon Wireless. It was an online sales chat forum. The job was decent, just not for me."
good,Management is in it for themselves. The job is very stressful.but its easy wants u pick it up.love the pay.its a good job dont get me wrong its just the way they changed over the past years is they dnt care about their workers anymore and also customers
good,they treat the people who do all the dirty work like slaves. they don't provide healthy and safe work spaces. they are careless and heartless.
good,This was a very busy working environment at a fast pace. Customer service was a must because you are constantly interacting with customers whether on the phone or in person
good,"Best thing about working for verizon is the benefits. They offer great benefits and match 401k, Great environment usually, but you can be moved around quite often"
good,Sales training excellent. Opportunity for growth and development entirely based on what sales office you are based out of.
good,"A typical day would be helping customers and business clients with wireless device solutions for the home and office spaces. This industry has helped to stay atop of the advancements in wireless technology in the cellular industry. Each coworker shares the same ambition to achieve in selling and creating a positive experience for the customer.The most difficult part of the job is the challenge of overcoming objectives, while the easiest part would be listening, understanding and the having satisfaction in knowing that you educated someone in a way to improve their quality of life"
good,"Verizon used to bend over backwards for customers, a rarity, but well justified when charging a premium. Now customers are just charged a premium and employees are not empowered to help."
good,Learned a lot of skills that apply Quality Assurance.  I also worked with many different cultures and learned a lot about different ways to test.
good,"Busy one day, slow the next.  With so many other companies acquired, there was always a new system to learn.  Vehicle tracking"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"200-300+ calls per day. 9 weeks of training to learn how to operate computer systems necessary to assist customers. Management was very helpful and encouraging. Majority of Verizon customers are just needing to make changes to their account, which in turn made it very pleasant but not to easy. About half of the customers calling in can be very upset at the company, which in turn made it harder to communicate with someone who is upset. As long as you show the customers you care they always seem to calm down, which in turn makes the experience more enjoyable."
good,Its a pretty nice atmosphere and work environment. Each daily job has deferent challenges. Co workers  are great to work with.  Management tries to micro manage. The best part of the job is seeing your customers satisfaction when you are done.
good,"Fast paced & competitive on a daily basis, learned about tech products and the tech industry. Management was very helpful. Co-workers were helpful and pleasant. Hardest part of the job was dealing with demanding and upset customers. The company culture was definitely enjoyable."
good,"great salary and great place to work, working with different department, communicate with different professional as normal task. this connect great social networking with people,"
good,locayion was good and the people I worked with was good but i think the way the vacation was set up that you received could have been better for the employees.
good,No complaints.  Values employees and customers.  Pay is above average.  Lacks opportunity for advancement opportunities. Strategy is a bit nebulous.
good,Verizon is a great company to work for. They really care about their employees. It has been a pleasure from day one. A normal day consists of speaking with customers in regards to billing questions or technical issues.
good,"I worked as a sales representative for this company. The company offered a lot of training and professional development. However, they had very ambitious goals. They would take care of you if you achieved your goals, but dispose of you if you did not."
good,The updated design for their generator is very innovated. the new engines take the product to the next level. Easy on line ordering. outdoor designs reduce cost to customers.
good,"They company itself seems to be an ok company, but the people that are in the office as well as how they conduct themselves can leave a bad taste in an employees mouth."
good,making sure the customer's were satisfied with their purchase making sure the store stayed clean the employees were nice
good,"No regard for family life"
good,Associate Directors of call center rotated on a semi-annual basis so the job is determined based on who you're being managed by.
good,Very good salary and benefits at Verizon but a bad work/life balance.  Always fear of lay-offs.  Work is typically challenging.
good,Enabled telecom internet functions throughout Verizon's central office locations in Western Massachusetts. Management was offsite and relied on employees to carry out workload tasks independently.
good,Fast paced environment that allowed me to hone in on and continue to develop my managerial skills. I trained my team of 20 representatives on a weekly basis. Attended weekly management meetings. Monthly business reviews in which I did a presentation of my progression to upper management.
good,Seems to have completly overhauled managment all around since i have been there move lots of vehicles can make good money expect to work weekends and long days. otherwise fine.
good,if you like dealing with nothing but rude people this is the place for you. every call you take is from someone upset. who call customer service when everythig is good. high stress.. most people leave after 2years at most
good,Great people to work with.  I enjoyed coming to work with associates who were so happy.  I was a contractor with the company and sad that it was only a two year contract.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Currently work here as an administrative assistant.  The tasks for this job varied tremendously, depending on departmental policies and work requirements.  Have worked in various departments, organizations, and attained different levels of skill sets within this company.  They range from administrative duties, to attendance, dispatching, customer care, and expediting work orders for business customers throughout NYC."
good,"You do get paid well with quality benefits.  Given what they expect out of you that is the least they can do for you.  The money is good, just not nearly as irreplaceable as they may like to believe."
good,They have good benefits and provide annual bonus if company goals are met. Also provides opportunity for relocation globally if desired.
good,coworkers are nice and there are lots of room for growth. they had competitive commission package and also it was satisfactory when I see customer walk out of doors with a smile on their faces.
good,"I liked the ability to meet new people and provide a service that meets customers needs . The company, as a whole, is sometimes too large."
good,"Xerox gave me a rock-solid ""buyer focused"" needs based value selling -- sales foundation. I still use those skills to this very day."
good,"When I started at Verizon, FiOS was a new service, and the job was exciting and fun. The workplace environment promoted comradery and the atmosphere was such that no matter what problem you may be troubleshooting, you always knew that help was just a seat or two over. That didn't last very long."
good,"Pros: Good people  small family environment,decent pay, large campus and good benefits"
good,"Good place to learn specific skills quickly, but very difficult to get promoted or advance in your career. Culture is very 'old school' as well."
good,Verizon offers great benefits and a lot of opportunity.  Some of the challenges include the leadership.  The call center environment is like any other call center.  A big high school full of nonsense.
good,"8 hour day helping customers with phone support and billing issues.  Also signing up new accounts and retaining existing customers."
good,I don't have much to say about them I like the company just need to further my career Verizon is a good company have a lot ot offer
good,not very family oriented fun place pay is fine able to advance in company great learning experience co workers are great management is great should be a little more understanding
good,This was a hardworking environment that provided educational and on the job training opportunities.  Verizon provided room for growth within the company.  Verizon was a great company to work for.
good,my review is that its a great company to work for overall they pay pretty well snd the customers are great. always able to assist with ext or pmt holds also upgrades to new service or new phones.
good,This job consist of working with other telecom companies at the time there were dozens that number has now dropped.  Your job function was on the phone talking with customers
good,"its a good company, good pay and they train you well.  The only down fall is it becomes too robotic in the training, does not give much room to create a genuine connection with the customer because there is only so much you are allowed to do."
good,"Great opportunities...Not very good at work life and personal life balance, schedules are not great but I love working here because the benefits and pay make up for the negatives"
good,"A typical day at work is not so typical.  But usually involves managed network support of corporate customers.  Great opportunity to learn, grow and technically advance."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,This position offered a lot of hands on operation with the newest technology. I got to work with a very intelligent team and we had a lot of fun. My immediate manager was very family oriented and very easy to work for and with. The upper management there was very untrustworthy and non-supportive of there teams.
good,"Get Ready to be Yelled At if You're in Customer Service.   If you don't have a thick skin and a positive attitude, this place is probably not for you."
good,"It's a pretty good place to work. There were a lot of good people here and the management was good. I didn't think that the job security was good, a lot of people worried about layoffs."
good,"Verizon is fast paced and offers plenty of opportunities to build customer relationships. This job has helped teach me time management and self discipline. The hardest part of the job is not being able to shut it down, you are working 7 days a week with a phone that must be answered 24/7. Co-workers are great and it's fun to work with a team. Management is tough. When you are working in direct sales as this job is, you are only a factory machine. You only matter when you are producing the highest productivity. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers and selling a product you know and stand behind."
good,Meccano product was originally sold as Erector sets and is currently manufactured in France. I believe that the US distributor has since moved to Canada.
good,All my co workers are very fun and great at their job. Management is very unappreciative of all their sales rep who bring them in a lot of money and give them little.
good,"Verizon Wireless has transformed from a growth company to one which is attempting to maintain revenue streams.   The cost transformation is having impacts on fulfillment, customer service, and network investment.  Growth in support of VZW will likely be found in outside service companies awarded General Service Agreements to fulfill increasingly oursourced functionality."
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work. However they are not afraid to throw their employees under the bus or leave them out to dry."
good,"I opened and closed store, opened new accounts and reviewed previous ones, sold cell phones and accessories, and ran credit checks."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I had a good supervisor a company truck that I got to take home. The Salary was good and the benefits package used to be great but has been decreased over the last contract. I was a Union Field Service Technician and was laid off February 1st 2017.
good,"Verizon is currently transforming its revenue stream from telecommunications/cable to only  wireless/data and advertising "
good,"There are some benefits to working for Verizon. Most of the co-workers and Management are nice people and want you to learn. They are usually very positive and motivated to do a good job. However, a hard part of working for Verizon was they were very goal oriented. I think their emphasis on CHT may have caused employees to be less customer service / Troubleshooting interested."
good,Wireless industry is always changing and Verizon is always a head of the game. It is a great company to work as long as you have the right management team.
good,Great place to start after exiting the military. The department i worked with got shut down as i was leaving. Learned some valuable customer service lessons here.
good,A lot of great people work for Verizon and have a tremendous amount of experience in the technology services industry.  Their employees are their biggest asset
good,"inbound calls, diverse setting, professional, I'd refer a friend. overtime if wanted. 40 hour weeks. The calls could be stressful at times but the support was great"
good,Very nice place to work but they out source to much. Being at this company taught me a lot but I would have enjoyed being more secure within the company.
good,good benefits not sure were they are headed. Never see any enterprise asvertisment only residential and wireless. New product humm?? Do you want big brother in your car?
good,Fun company to work for. Excellent employees. Lots of energy and bright ideas for change. Had a lot of fun transitioning the employees from service to sales.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon was your typical large corporation which seemed focused on their stockholders bottom line. They pay was good, my peers excellent and the benefits above average. I was quite happy there until they moved all of our positions out of state."
good,way to much greed from the higher ups.  Used to be a great company but now its all about making money for senior management. Not much else to say
good,Verizon is a big company but I was the first fios technician which presented me with a lot of obstacles. My typical day at work would be to run cables in and out of attics. It was a hot job especially in the summer. It made me learn how to communicate with a predominantly male environment.
good,I was barred from experiencing what is is like to be an employee because of their policy on contractors. Some strange management changes were happening while I was there in other departments. I was in RF and our team was solid.
good,"Work environment was mainly positive, and fast paced.  Management was flexible with work schedules.  Peers worked together to resolve billing issues and issues found with numerous billing systems that were audited daily."
good,Telecommunication is part of our everyday life. Working at Verizon Wireless comes with meeting new people everyday and building long customer relations.
good,"we do alot of outbounding calling, counting inventory, pushing Verizon products to get more money. Good co workers and sometime fun environment, not for people who get anxious easily"
good,Overall a very good job right out of college! Good hours with flexible schedule. Fun and easy going work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is forming relationships with your members and really getting to know how you can help them reach their fitness goals.
good,"Esprit de Corps."
good,Unfortunately most jobs are part time and it can take quite a while to advance. A very decent discount though and generally fun atmosphere.
good,"A typical day at work is all about greeting, discovering, and recommending the customer the best solution for their situation. I learned how to engage and close the proper way of a sale. Overall, I enjoyed connecting with a lot of customers and being able to be their personal consultant."
good,Not a bad company to work for although it has changed dramatically over the past 8 to 10 years leaning away from a utility and more towards an entertainment company.
good,"Verizon has great benefits. I have learned over the past 20 years with the company that the Verizon culture is changing and where there use to be close co workers and a team mentality it has changed into a ""what can I get for myself"" culture. No more team work or helping out your fellow co worker. I would suggest that anyone looking at Verizon would use this company as a stepping stone in your career until you can find something else more fulfilling. "
good,The industry and company is always changing; which is a good thing. We are always learning and the company makes sure we are up to date with latest trends in technology. The company also offers a great benefit package to all part-time and full-time employees.
good,A typical days work is productive and it has taught me how to adjust to meet each customers needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is forming bonds with the existing and new customers of Verizon.
good,"A lot of work, and a lot of walking, the co-workers and boss were ok, but for the most part, when I was ready to go door-to-door selling Verizon Fios on my own, I was really afraid. It was very awkward and something I wouldn't want to do again."
good,Company has great benefits but no true work life balance. Each month quota gets higher to make it harder to achieve the goals and make commission.
good,"This office took inbound sales calls, so there wasn't any face to face selling. The job can get stressful at times, just like any other sales environment. The hardest part of the job was meeting quota, and getting a higher quota each year."
good,I thoroughly enjoy my time in VSAT and the impact our work has on society.  Great management and colleagues. Nice perks for attending school and adoption assistance
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,except for the late hours at this job it was very fun and educational the people were great and the pay worth the effort put forth i would work for these guys again if i ever decided to go back into this line of work.
good,Great coworkers fun environment made for a great work day. Very little job stability because it was a temp position so we were always training the next one to take your place.
good,"Good job, good benefits, good union representatives.  Working in a call center is very stressful.  If you focus on doing your job you really don't have too much to worry about."
good,"A typical day at work included; phone calls, Fios lookups, cash handling, computer training & customer service along with instore sales."
good,"This company is so ridiculously greedy and money hungry, I'm surprised that its now that former employees are starting to sue them - and that more haven't come forward."
good,Great place to work.  It's not always about the numbers.  It usually is a great place to grow and develop.  Great team spirit and  Camaraderie.
good,"While the job was a good stepping stone our of college for me, the job in no way allowed me to utilize my strong communication skills and entrepreneurial mindset.  As a software tester my job was limited to following set procedures and did not allow for much out of the box thinking.  While I did like my coworkers and boss, my real interest was in a different area within the Information Technology sector."
good,"Appreciated the chance to grow with on-the-job training opportunities throughout my tenure. Was fortunate to work with wonderful people who engaged in true teamwork.  Workloads varied from job to job.  I did not enjoy the 24/7 on call duties.  Periodic drawback was having to fill in for strikers which was disruptive and unpredictable. And every year the threat of a lay-off loomed, especially around the holidays. Benefits are good."
good,"Decent place to work. However, as most giant companies out there, it is really hard to move up the corporate ladder."
good,"This job teaches you alot about how to deal with people and sometimes tell them answers that they do not want to hear. In addition to that you will learn a lot about technology because the company thrives on the efficiency of technology. You will be a sales person as well. The company pushes for you to be apart of making the business profitable. The metrics that you are expected to meet are what can be stressful. Particularly customer satisfaction. Making a customer satisfied is not hard. Making a customer satisfied with a policy that they understand but do not like, is not easy. Many times this is not possible. You must simply hope that they liked you enough. The rating system should make it easier for the customer to distinguish where they are experiencing displeasure. It is stressful when you take a hit for the company and then are questioned about it! Other than that you will learn a lot."
good,"Painfully in the process of revamping the organization. it needs done to ensure the company is successful."
good,"a lot of micro managing on the sales floor.  be prepared to spend a lot of money of your work clothes.  Good pay but with a saturated market, sales quotas can be kind of hard to reach in some months"
good,"I worked in an offline support department, IMT of Resource Management.  The management decided to reorganize and consolidate my department, which resulted in laying off over 800 employees, including myself because I couldn't relocate.  This change has caused a huge headache and more problems for the leadership in the call centers, as well as put a lot more pressure on the Resource Management employees that were able to stay.  It was a terrible business decision.  I was told I would have a chance to go back to taking calls in Technical Support, but when I finally got the chance to talk to my manager about it (after being put off for 3 weeks and only having 2 days of work left), I was told that it wasn't an option because the call center director said she had to ask me to leave the building the day we found out about the reorganization.  That wasn't true, in fact, she talked to me in front of a supervisor friend of mine and provided support.  She even gave me her phone number.  Since then, she is no longer the call center director, but I cannot go back without starting all over.  My previous pay and time with company means nothing.  I really loved my job, but they betrayed me.  It took me almost 7 months to find another job.  There is even more to this, but I don't have room to type everything."
good,Great place to work when starting an sales job.  The company allows you to finish college and make money.  High energy but you have to be able to change day to day.
good,"Started off to be good until after training, then I seen how unorganized the company really was. Wouldn't suggest anyone to apply"
good,"A very fun and lenient place to work. My coworkers are awesome. Also, a lot of room to make more money. My most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers. They help make every day come alive as far as laughing with our customers."
good,Lots of face to face interaction with the general public which can be very rewarding or very debilitating for an individual who is not resilient enough to quickly recover from a verbally abusive or rude client. Management's attitude and demeanor is largely dependent upon the stress he/she is placed under by their bosses and the performance of the store month to date.
good,When i was here times were good. It was a little bit of a struggle with some management but overall a great place to work.  I left before the directory part closed its doors
good,I enjoyed the various types of work on this job.  There were many functions to this position which kept the position interesting.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for but there is no work life balance, you work retail hours and unfortunately advancement opportunities only occur if you know someone or are willing to relocate across state."
good,A typical day at Verizon is extremely busy and I learned a lot about customer service. Management was okay and co-workers were great to talk too. Hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part of working at Verizon is that you are constantly busy.
good,Not a fun place to work. Not much advancement opportunity. Solely focus on sales. A lot of bureaucracy about getting things done on the back end.
good,"Worked in retail, work life balance was non-existent.  A solid job for entry-level."
good,Been with the company over several years and there are a lot of aspects that may be appealing to future candidates but with any job you must know the people you work for and the environment you work in.
good,"Fun work environment and great benefits. However, too much work place politics going on. It is all about who you know and not what you know."
good,"I enjoy the challenges of my job. I get to work with a lot of interesting diverse employees in a call center atmosphere."
good,"Verizon was a good place to work.  However, when it came to family and personal issues the company is not very understanding."
good,"Working in telecommunication is very secure, there is a ton of work that needs to be done. Working at Verizon you are always going to be working on your skills. The leadership of the call center could be better. Meaning less work place gossip. But overall a descent company to work for in terms of business, training, and work/life balance."
good,"While at Verizon I discovered a natural ability to lead helping train new hirers while performing a high level of customer service. This drove me to perfect my sales pitch and allowed me to achieve great success in surpassing my quotas, and building long-lasting customer relationships."
good,verizon cares more about numbers than they do on employee experience. This in turn makes moral decline and puts to much stress on the reps. currently we have 5 employees on FMLA due to stress related issues.
good,Reviewing customers' contracts for errors and checking for system errors.  Proofreading advertising. I loved all the managers I worked with they were all very professional and understanding.  We were always on a deadline and some days we had to work 14 hours to get everything finished.
good,This is as straight forward of a job as you get. Show up take 1000+ calls a day and go home.  Great benefits at the time I worked there.
good,While working there I enjoyed the customer interaction and the opportunities for sales the company gave. There was potential to make good money and move up. I learned a lot and enjoyed my time there.
good,My coworkers were very helpful and they taught me alot about how to handle different customer situations and balancing personal life and work
good,Typical day at work was rather repetitive. We were assigned the calls to for the first half of the day to notify customers what time they could expect the technician the next day. After lunch we were assigned calls to survey the customers whom the technicians came and did work.
good,"very unplanned promotions , bad HR reviews on promotional cases. no major concern about the senior people when you leave the company"
good,"It was a branch belong to the horizon international in U.S.A,"
good,major emphasis on sales and exceeding quota. Not recommended for those who do not want an extremely fast paced environment. Long hours and no breaks.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Position of order managers was often stressful with overload and constant change."
good,Great training.  The company pays well is great if you are good in sales.  Dealing with irate customers can be very stressful.
good,It's Okay. Benefits are great that's about it. Just a typical call center environment. Over better than most call centers though. Definitely going to miss my co-workers.
good,I was mostly micro managed at this job..I was given no work life balance..I would not recommend this job..very poor leasdership..
good,"Little assistance from management to make sales, all cold leads. Must generate sales on own. Pay scale is practically for entry level, those recently out of highschool."
good,they are behind the times. need better fulfillment and customer service. great sales training. and that is all I have to say about Dex Media
good,"It was a decent paying job and my colleagues were nice, but it was still a typical call center and your clients would exhaust you by the end of the day. If I hadn't left to go back to school I probably would've continued working there for two years or so."
good,"Staff should be (and is) passionate about what success looks like for not only the team but for the company.  We currently work a 24 hour cycle to ensure quality internal and external customer service which includes builds, releases to the production environment and making sure that code is managed in a way that can be audited and accounted for during a release."
good,"Verizon was a nice place to work.  The hours were not the best if you had a very busy outside life but they seemed to want to work with those who needed accommodations with hours. Training was very long and not the best you learned more with hands on experience, if training was broke up into sections things might have been retained a little better and not seemed rushed. People were friendly but Management was not always there."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is when we did get customers in, I love to sell."
good,"Many long hours reviewing customer complaints until satisfaction is given."
good,"Policy changes seem to contradict specific goals for your business."
good,"My experience has shown me that Verizon is a great place to work for the money offered. However, workers are unable to stick to one shift permanently as they must bid upon a schedule every 2 months. For those with children, it can be very stressful to work the schedule required."
good,Nice place to work. Unfortunately hard to get promoted. Some supervisors don't support the reps offer to the customer. Consistence is very important and needs to be implemented.
good,"I worked in a store not at the corporate office. Working retail can be trying on a daily basis. Hours can be long and some days a bit stressful, Sometimes big pressures from management. However Verizon operates under a great credo one that runs to greet change and challenge. For however demanding the workplace seems it is just as rewarding. Great benefits and many opportunites to make great money were available. "
good,"I don't know much about RRD, I was part of the acquisition from Moore North America, which of course like any acquisition entailed a lot of change and turnover.  This is when I left the company due to the office closure."
good,"The sales quotas at Verizon are obtainable, but are being stretched monthly. The management doesn't seem as involved as senior leaders would like for them to be."
good,Verizon was a great stepping stone in my professional career.  I learned a lot of great people and sales skills here.  I would recommend working here to gain sales knowledge.
good,Working for Total Marketing Concepts there's some ups and downs. A typical day at TMC is sitting down for about 8 hours a day pushing and pushing to make sales. Everyone is friendly as well as the managers. Coworkers work together to help each other and managers are very understanding. The most enjoyable part of working at TMC is making sales.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I had customer service experience before Verizon but working for this company really helped me develop and fine tune my customer service and sales skills
good,I learned time management and how to maintain healthy co-worker relationships. The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch with my peers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with managers with nasty attitudes.
good,"From my end of the company, I did sanity testing for the desktop applications. The software seemed a bit outdated, but functional. The coworkers where helpful and my manager was very understanding."
good,great customer interaction and ability to learn about new gadgets and upcoming technology. fast paced and highly competitive work environment.
good,I have worked for the company for 6 years. I have had various positions which has given me knowledge about all sides of the business. The industry is always changing so I learned to adapt to things at fast pace.
good,"Assist 30-40 customers a day with billing, technical, and changes to their account."
good,Verizon Wireless provides first class pay and benefits.  Unfortunately you will be stressed out of your mind working there.
good,The management staff and trainers at this job were very nice and knowledgeable.  You could actually advance very quickly if you like the job culture of collecting student loans.
good,"A typical day at work-"
good,"Best place to work. Highly skilled techies and good team work."
good,Help Run CAT5. Help install cable boxes and modems. Co Workers are great. Installed routers. Find dial tones. Learned how to find tones on telephone poles.
good,Typical day starts around 6:30am daily to ensure the technician's day is  filled with 8 hours of work and the right work based upon their individual skills. Constant communications with the field technicians to address any road blocks that may occur. Daily interaction and partnership with neighboring departments such as construction and Engineering to ensure we meet our commitment to the customer. We address the needs of the customer and ensure we are meeting the customer's demand. Our day end around 6:00p.m. daily.
good,"Verizon was formed by the merger of NYNEX, GTE and Bell Atlantic. Most of their customers were residential at the time. In 2006, Verizon purchased WorldCom (post-bankruptcy). That added a huge business market into their customer base and a steady influx of cash. Meanwhile, their wireless division thrived as they reinvested into this growing market. "
good,Attend to the needs of the customers of verizon by exhibiting great customer care and service.  Call center work and customer service as well.
good,"Wish I still worked here, management thought I was too young, but i never got a complaint about my installations or quality of work. I enjoyed my time here."
good,"Upon arriving at the store in the mornings I would ensure that the displays are in place and that the cash registers are checked off. "
good,"Very corporal.  Not that corporal is bad.  I just believe they pushed it to a different level than I had ever been a part of. Money, money, money...............didn't matter how it came.  They had a great long term plan, I just never saw how that was going to benefit me.  I felt as though I was just a number who was going to be thrown through when I didn't do it their way.  My family was never invited, asked to come in, new any of my fellow workers, or asked about.  We had been with the company as clients for over 10 years.  They in theory asked us to lie to get us more money for the company which made me very uncomfortable.  When I brought it up they asked me ""whether I wanted to make it or not.""  My family values do to not include taking other people for vantage who don't know what we are doing.  Overall, I felt uncomfortable."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Continuous work. There is training available and the work environment is comfortable and the other workers are ready to assist if there are any questions.
good,"Working there was a humbling experience. You hit the ground running then when you reach a potential home, a door is there slamming in your face to greet you. The typical day consisted of me arriving at 7 am and leaving at 10 pm. I walked door to door informing customers of our great services."
good,High call volume setting with variety of customers and different duties daily. Some customers were rude and others were very pleasant so it was a mixture of customer service skills used.
good,"Verizon thus far has been one of the best companies to work for. Phenomenal benefits. However, very difficult to maintain a steady work/life balance. Very difficult job to hold for the single parent due to the long and constant changing hours."
good,High pressure sales with no job work/life balance. Even though it was challenging in a good way I feel as though we are not encouraged to sell with integrity which is very important to me.
good,Selling Smart Phones and Plan Changes with Customer Support were the main defining job functions.  The job has a set salary and set commissions on sales.
good,"A typical day at work involves detailed results review, one on one coaching sessions, implementing sales contests, motivating my team, overseeing coaching, creating improvement plans, managing grievances."
good,"Average across the board, experience will vary depending on your peers and management.  Flexibility and Pay wasn't bad."
good,Company is trying to figure out how to reinvent itself and become more of a technology solution company and less of a Telecom.  Tons of pressure to reduce costs to remain competitive.  Sometimes seems like to much and they end up reducing to where they can no longer deliver same quality product..
good,There is definetely room for growth with Diamond Wireless/Verizon.  Managers are groomed and trained through a series of layers of leadership. Never a dull moment in the workplace!
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for because you have many abilities to grow in the company and get paid very well. When I worked as a operator II it was challenging for me due to the fact that I had a toddler and I worked graveyard shift.  My Co-workers were great, and I had no problem with anyone in this company."
good,"Im​pressive multitasking and tech-savvy skills to resolve challenging customer issues including device related "
good,"Enjoyable, excited, day to day to interact with customer.  Assist customer with cell phones. Help customer to set new line of service, transfer contacts, picturtes, set up music.  Assist customer with purchase of tablets."
good,Great place to work with great oppurtunity for money. You are your own boss kind of. There are no managers looking over your shoulder. You have to be able to meet their money requirements. Other than that the average day consist of going in and doing inventory and then helping customers with their issues or helping them get new devices.
good,"There is no balance between work and life. beside the long hours I am already working, even on my off days I still am doing work related things."
good,"Verizon is a good company to work with. They provide competitive salaries and provide opportunity for growth, although at times it can become very stressing and hectic."
good,"Being able to assist a customer in any way was the most enjoyable part of the job.   A typical day at work involved assisting with bill inquires, provisioning new service, billing adjustments, minor troubleshooting and adding on new services for a discount"
good,Be the first to know and experience the very latest in technology.  Be the one to showcase and demonstrate merchandise to customers.  Be the expert!  Can be difficult at times while trying to familiarize new technology to old habits but very interesting place to work!  There is always something new to explore!
good,"The company pays well and benefits are great, but you work hard and long... It's incredibly stressful and hard to balance between work and life. Not for family oriented adults. Best for single bachelor/bachelorettes. I've seen a great many couples break up and get divorced because of the company. I've also seen many with problems with drinking because of the stress. Remember, money doesn't buy happiness."
good,"The economy made the job slightly unbearable, however I do not blame Verizon for that. I resigned from this job once I found Lockheed."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon Florida was an incredible experience. 5 stars. Working for Verizon in the Northeast has not been as desirable.
good,can move up in company but pay in competitive.have to move to different stores sometimes but not often.would work for them again if possible.
good,"selling prof=ducts and services ,how to become better at reaching sales goals, management was fair in the beginning but when a new manager arrived thing s turned sour, I made good friends there and I did not get along with a couple of them as well, the hardest part was my schedule and school combined, knowing that I satisfied the customer at the and of the day and didn't just make a sale."
good,"Normal work hours with in office gym, need to work on better training, and office stability. Excellent benefits and great people to work with, just watch your back for random firings"
good,"Overall, Verizon is a good place to work.  As you rise in the ranks, who likes you and who doesn't means more than your job performance.  You can go from the ""good"" list to the ""bad"" list in very short order."
good,"Limited tools cause a challenge, wireless access is sketchy, no voice provided,  the entire team had to share one conference call number and office supplies were non-existent."
good,As an entry level position it is a good start for a technician. I enjoyed my co-worker and out of state travel. A good experience.
good,Loved the people and the supervisors are friendly. If you want a career as a call center rep this job is for you. It pays really great too!
good,"Ensured customer satisfaction and superior customer experience; Maintained inventories at adequate levels, promoted sales, and maintained the appearance of the store; Completed accounting and paperwork associated with cash receipts and prices and conducted physical inventories; Met assigned sales performance and profitability criteria; Set appropriate individual performance standards for the store in line with company standards; Developed, implemented and monitored a store prospecting plan to increase sales; Facilitated and participated in weekly staff training/educational sessions to increase knowledge, create high levels of motivation, and inspire team to achieve results; Established and monitored store work schedules and staffing issues to effectively manage payroll expenses; Exhibited a high level of leadership presence within all aspects of the business and other internal departments; Analyzed various business reports for trend analysis and strategic planning purposes; Effectively manage a team of retail store employees, including coaching, administering discipline, etc."
good,Verizon required high costumer service standards that ultimately decided your pay rate. A competitive  work atmosphere was encouraged but that made things enjoyable. My job was to receive incoming calls to the costumer service department where I worked hard to solve any costumer problems. The hardest part was dealing with costumers who had problems that could not be fixed.
good,Great environment to work in. At times customers can be difficult but its our job to resolve any issue they have. Coworkers/team members are great to work with.
good,"A typical day included setting up new home telephone service, until fewer and fewer people set up home phones.  Billing and repair issues."
good,"Initially starting the job was fun, I learned a lot about high pressure sales as well as working with a team, Verizon taught me to basically sell ketchup to a person wearing white gloves. The benefits are great and probably the best I have ever seen. But the management is what kills this job."
good,Benefits start first day. They provide training to all employees. We attend annual kickoffs that are sometimes pointless unless you are sales rep. They also provide prepaid tuition for college that doesn't reequire to to stay with company onced finished.
good,Great company to work for with upward mobility.  The pay is above market standards.  Cutting edge mobile technology keeps your mind and customers wanting more.  Mobile data technology is the future!
good,The corporation was going through several transformation changes that impacted employees and in addition there were ongoing re-organizations over the past few years.
good,"Good benefits"
good,"*Prospecting and proposal generation."
good,Verizon pays very well if you me your goals... Some of the goals are very high .... i met them but some people do not... Verizon is an industry leader
good,good company to work for. Lots of opportunities if willing to travel. Could be better compensated in pay. Many positions are not compensated fairly. Got to meet and work with many great companies.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Employment at this position was good experience in knowing how to better my customer service abilities. My co-workers and boss were all good people I was glad to have known and met. The environment was light, but professional to the point that we were constantly going over goals and what was needed to be accomplished. My own failure at this position I place on myself and circumstance. I never worked as a salesman before and many of my potential clients often failed a credit check, as well as a number of possible customers closing the door in my face before I could even get to my pitch despite my best efforts. I wish I had more time to flesh out my talents there but it is a quick turnover rate type of company, however I still find the experience to have been invaluable."
good,"Benefits package and pay very competitive but be prepared to be under appreciated and over worked.  No flexibility and even less job security, but if you are single, young and shady you will be a tremendous success and sleeze your way to the top as long as you have a broken moral compass you will be a great fit."
good,Commission driven sales environment while providing customers with superior customer service. Laid back working environment but at the same time goals needed to be meant.
good,The work days went very fast learned a lot about the cellular industry.  I did not get to know many co-workers. The hardest thing about the job was training my own self in areas of collections.
good,Work at the intersection of cool technology and driving sales. Our retail sales team delivers that wow factor by helping our customers get up close and personal with the latest tech.
good,"enjoyed the fast paced work environment, including wiring with the latest and greatest in technology. Enjoyed the workshops and trainings on the new devices."
good,"Great company with great benefits,  just a little behind the trend of whats going on in the industry. Goals do become unrealistic and do not match what you are paid a commission on."
good,"Less of planning. More adhoc work. No hard core technical work. More of project length. Less of learning. Developing in JS, C, C++. Management hires contractors rather than full timers to get the work done."
good,"I Provided the best customer service above and beyond. Worked as a help desk/customer service tech. assisted customer with internet issues, email phone inside or outside customer home/business I also coordinated for technicians to arrive if needed at customer premise"
good,I liked the job but no career progress and working from home made it harder to interact with my team.  Having a clear path of my career would be a nice-to-have as well.
good,Great job out of college. Good pay. Learn how to sell. Not very good work/life balance. Many managers are micromanaging.
good,"It's tough to judge Verizon Wireless as a whole based on an individual store, so keep in mind this is only my experience at one store. First of all, there's no reason to complain about the hours, because you know what you're getting into. Sure, the scheduling could have been better, but that is just what retail is. I enjoyed the job much more at the beginning of my tenure. I focused on learning as much about the product as I did about my sales skills; being well rounded was important, and I had a lot of success. In time, I had worked to a job referred to as a keyholder, which is a generalized kind of assistant manager. I expressed an interest in moving up the chain later in my tenure, but saw that the only way to move up in the retail chain was to sacrifice working hours my shadowing from store to store, only to take an assistant manager job that paid significantly less money and came with less job security. When I looked into moving to a more administrative role in the company, not in sales, no one was willing to assist in that move."
good,Same as above. Management great. Coworkers great. helping many customers and helping staff to get things done. Creating a positive work environment.
good,go in and make 125 minimum calls a day.   it would have been more enjoyable had the staff been able to lighten up. it became a very stressful environment when the call leads began to dry up.
good,"A good place to work,fun and learning.A nice atmosphere for any professional"
good,"""Verizon Information Services"" was a very under pressure and fast working environment that was constantly giving their employees the tools and training to be more productive and manage their time more efficiently in the calling center.  "
good,Typical day would be to come in into the store clock in. count the resgister start my computer. check the safe for inventory.
good,"Verizon offers its employees wonderful benefits. Affordable healthcare, 401k, paid vacation and holidays. A lot of perks to take advantage of as well including discounted Verizon products, contributions to local charities etc."
good,They need to work on life and work balance.  Managers are promoted from paper not knowledge.  I learned a great deal about customer service and what you should do to provide exceptional customer service.  I liked interacting with people everyday.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I was with this company right out of college.  Good pay, good benefits.  I got to learn about new technologies and built a good knowledge base from all the positions I worked in.  It's a good launch pad for any career.  You get on the job training, tuition assistance, and a wealth of resources at your fingertips.  Some departments offer telecommute options.  "
good,In the beginning it was fun and entertaining getting to work with customers and your fellow coworkers but after some time the job requires you to do more than  you are capable of being paid and they constantly switch your schedule without an upfront confirmation. that could have you missing time from work that is not by your own doing if in someway you did not receive the memo.
good,"A typical day at work was working with my customer through excel spreadsheet Generating, managing and driving flow process for all data, voice, and internet order activity through implementation and installation. I love my manager he was a great person and if I didnt know something he was like Telisha you are smart you will figure it out, I always smiled because I was always a hardworker and love a challenge and love to figure things out so we work very well with each other,I loved my coworkers we all was hard workers.I work Tier 3 support for verizon so I supported over 400 customers so I was a busy person but my drive was so fast, and I always never wanted to fail so if something is a challege I strived to keep my customer happy, I felt if they are not happy then I was not happy , I learn to have a friendship with my customer be there best friend ,you have to know that they can depend on you"
good,I enjoyed working with the public and would be able to talk to people and challenge myself to adapt to how people were. I learned the importance of relating to who I was talking to in order to establish a relationship.
good,OK.company to work for. Retail side is demanding and requires dedication. Hardest part of job is keeping up with the changes.
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for, they have very competitive wages and great benefits. The information one must learn to work there however is a bit overwhelming. The other thing is that working in the Retail Store is commission based and can be very stressful."
good,"A typical day at Afni is I go in clock in and log onto my computer to start my day. After I pull up everything that I need for the day I begin taking phone calls. At Afni you get three breaks, two fifth teen minute breaks and an one hour long break for lunch. Throughout the day you may have trainings scheduled or a coaching scheduled with your supervisor. My co-workers are very nice and supportive and are there for assistance when a supervisor is not present. The hardest part about the job sometimes  is dealing with disgruntled customer, but I do enjoy a challenge so I enjoy being able to flip their mood to a positive one. The most enjoyable part of the job is being surrounded around such supportive people, as well as being able to help the customers out."
good,Focus on high return revenue services and moving away from networking and circuit business.  Strategy is attempting to mirror wireless market in a complex solutions environment.  People were great to work with the change of culture and direction has not proven with results yet
good,Answering incoming calls for billing or technical support in a call center environment and managing the calling que.  The company itself offered plenty of benefits and competitive pay and I have developed many lasting relationships that still continue after leaving.  Constant and dramatic changes occur.
good,"Good place to work at but need change and career advancement."
good,"A call center job where I provided technical support to residential and business customers regarding their phone, cable, and internet services. Very strict job and many guidelines were to be followed"
good,Assist with billing calls and troubleshoot phones issues. This was a call center position.
good,"Good place to Work, It's nice experience and process are good"
good,This job is very sales oriented and sales is what drives your paycheck. Public oriented but poor management. Low compensation for work load.
good,The employees were very nice and got along really good. Everyone worked hard as a team. I became skilled on picking orders and loading them.
good,"Employees work with a variety of teams to accomplish daily goals.  The wire-line side of the business is still not quite on the same level as the wireless side, but that should be changing.  Outsourcing is a big part of the Verizon business model."
good,"New store.  Hired as the store manager.  In the short time I worked here I was responsible for training the staff, making the store schedule and inventory counts."
good,overall is a good company to work for and a true learning experience throughout my career. Becoming a greedy corporation as years come by. It disrespect employees' efforts to produce by targeting them during observations and not honoring a fair labor contract for a long term
good,I enjoy educating people on new technology. Verizon is the best cellular service there is. Building a team and creating a culture of success is awesome.
good,A good job as far as benefits and pay but you will work your butt off to get a good pay and that's still if you make quota. The quota is a very high expectation that you must keep up. I really enjoyed most of the co-workers and some of the managers but be ready to have some serious stress. Work life balance is not so much there either as it is retail.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Morning reports, appointments daily for make overs for brides, proms, skin care etc..  Hardest part of job to me was no insurance, best part of job making someones day and making them feel beautiful..."
good,Very good company to work for particularly its benefit package.
good,"Absolutely loved the job, hated the company. Small retailer of Verizon, absolutely horrible beliefs. If you love dealing with unprofessionally handled situations, this job is perfect for you. If you are still stuck in the ""high-school phase"" (the he said she said, fights, stealing, lying) then this job is more than perfect for you."
good,Verizon is one of the largest communication technology companies in the world. Operating America’s largest 4G LTE wireless network and the nation’s premiere all-fiber broadband network.
good,"Assisting walk in customers with all of their wireless needs.  Expected to up sell customers to higher rate planes, phones, accessories.  Goals can be set quite high."
good,Was a fun place to work until general management decided to stop keeping phones in stock therefor making quotas harder to hit. The locally owned company is now owned by another company so hopefully all is better.
good,"Assisting about 30 customers per day with form fitting the right cellular products to their wants and needs."
good,Taking inbound calls. Handling all of the customers needs from billing to troubleshooting devices
good,"•	Diagnosed, dissembled, repaired, and repaired electronic devices."
good,"YOu constantly have to adapt to change. Unless you work in a store with a good manager, you will not like working here"
good,"RESPONSIBLE FOR RESOLVING CHALLENGING CUSTOMER ISSUES."
good,Verizon provides all employees with great benefits and potential for employment growth.
good,Verizon is a great company with great benefits. my job is fairly easy . I work in financial services.
good,"In retail, it is tough to have a family/work balance.  You virtual work open to close and every weekend.  There are great benefits and if you are in sales you can make a great income.  Point of Sales system is very frustrating to use.  There is change daily with daily goals. Stable company."
good,fun place to work with advancement opportunities train you very well for what ever position your going for
good,laid back management that doesn't care what you do and doesn't pay you for the little that you do produce
good,The environment was what you made it. I always had to come in with  a positive attitude which would rub of on others. You have to stay focused and always ready to assist a caller.
good,The day starts at 2pm and would go to 10pm. The training for this job was very extensive and help greatly when actually taking calls. The management was nice but the evaluations were always very tough and you had to have to make scores in the 90+% average or would be placed on probation. The co-workers were very helpful when time permitted. The hardest part of the job was not letting customer find a way to make you upset. The best part of the job was helping people resolve their problems over the phone.
good,"Downsizing has taken a toll on the company, and the company seems top heavy with senior management in comparison to those in the trenches (director level and below), so to speak."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The technology is always changing so that makes for a nice change of pace, not a job where you find yourself doing the same exact thing over and over again, as every customer is different, with a different situation."
good,"Complete Electronic Attendance/ Time cards, Conference calls, Team meetings, Develop Mops for test and turn-up, provide tech training (OJT), interface with support organizations, deal with trouble escalations and provide metrics."
good,"-Normally the day at the office starts very leisurely around 11:30 , it is a appropriate company for the people who love to start their work late and continue until late evening  . "
good,"Healthy competition between employees, achievement of targets and goals are well rewarded."
good,"the job is not for everyone, but benefits and pay are comparable I guess. I will say its a better work place than a lot of other companies in Charleston, SC."
good,Excellent compensation for meeting quotas. Very professional
good,upper management is horrible! They use tactics like motivation by fear.
good,lower all employees payrate. They did not allow us to do overtime it was not verizon it was xerox that took over acs.
good,"Award-winning 15-year career record of increasing market share, profitability, and leading successful project teams using PMI methodology for a Fortune 500 Corporation.  Exceptional qualifications in leading large project teams managing high profile C-level clients, using agile and iterative PMI methodology."
good,This was a fun place to work and good work/life balance. Lack of promotion potential was the biggest downfall.
good,"* Receive work ticket requests from Customers, Survey the requested work at Customer's location, Do requested work on Commercial and/or Secure phone switch and Order needed equipment for Installers, Assign work task to Installers, Carry task orders to Installers at another location."
good,"A typical day a work with Verizon was hard work, sometimes stressful, but I'd do it all over again if I could."
good,a very busy call center with high call volume calls regarding cell phone center..
good,"In IT side things were a lot better 5+ years ago. Now the corp. is actively merging multiple application systems and thus affecting many employees. Also, many jobs functions are being off-shored, which is bad for locals, of course."
good,"- 9-11 hour days"
good,"Union keeps people in their postitions.  Management is very tough and not very understanding to the employees life styles.  Pay is very good, but you sacrifice a lot for it."
good,the distance was very far. however this a job that anyone can manage.
good,"Great colleagues, difficulty in backing from upper management but understanding of schedules."
good,Had fun everyday.  Coming up with contests to motivate employees as well as new ways to train employees.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"As the Data consultant.  I was responsible for creating and developing data support team, for department of 550 employees.  I created, developed, and designed the data center.  Which housed products for hands on training, as well as developed training curriculum for products and procedures."
good,"There are great benefits, however, the pay is getting less and less as time goes on."
good,"Long hours, less pay, and deal with all kinds of customers!!"

good,Verizon is a great company to work for. Verizon performs a very thorough background check on all employees to ensure only the best people are chosen. I love working for this company.
good,I already did this part. it was an okay job and i learned alot. unfortunately i was mistreated by jealous coworkers and not really valued with hardly a chance for advancement.
good,Greet customers at the door help with sign in process and assist with general questions

Perform rate package evaluations and propose solutions that best benefit the company and the customer. Move throughout the store to actively engage customers, demonstrate products, and effectively execute the sales function."
good,It is a good 9 to 5 job if you are not looking for advancement or improvement in your career. It is very steady and very relaxed but lacks youth and innovation in certain parts of the company.

good,I had an opportunity to complete many projects on time and under budget to help obtain client goals.
good,Wants to be the best wireless provider and doing the right thing and being the best is what they strive for.  Constant change and strategy is what they focus on to be proactive.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon A Wireless but I do not agree with how my departure was handled. I was given a sales quota to maintain, but I was forced to train the new manager and employees which led to me having a minimal amount of time on the sales floor."
good,Inbound and outbound calls collecting money for accounts past due on their bills.
good,"great company for benefits and pay. incoming call center, customers call in to discuss bill, order new service, fix current services, change current service, disconnect service, move service. we had to optimize their media experience on EVERY call."
good,T-Mobile offered a great work life balance and moderate compensation.
good,"design the documents"

good,"little work/life balance, opportunity for advancement if you can drink the koolaid, exceeding quota is met with higher quota"
good,All mangers and trainers are very approachable and willing to help you acheive your career goals. The hardest part of the job is learning how to find the right resources for your customer's resolution.
good,Stressful call center job. All day hours and not a lot of flexibility with the schedule.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Learned to Manage how to manage stress at work place "
good,"The environment isn't stimulating for a contracts manager. What is deemed to be contracts, at least in the San Diego office, is really a combination of finance and program management. Little actual contracts work is performed."
good,"Very poorly built buiding for manufacturing"
good,There is talent but it is not being utilized. Company is to big and upper leadership are scared put their necks out for their minions.
good,Working for Verizon Teleproducts everyday was different. We assisted customers both residential and business purchase the correct phone and called ID system for there needs. Also helped to connect the equipment and program the phone.
good,Verizon Wireless is a place that will push you to develop as a professional and grow you as an individual.
good,Not fun working for 4gwireless premium retailer. apply to corporate.

good,"Performance based environment where you are rewarded for your work.  Potential for advancement is there, must be focused on change management."
good,"Teammates are very supportive, working hours are very flexible"
good,I enjoyed the Environment a lot.I Would  love to continue working there but the pay needs to reach levels of experience..
good,"I worked in a fast-paced customer service call center and excelled because I am able to acquire a depth of knowledge on a wide range of subjects. Equally important was the ability to communicate clearly and professionally with customers, whether verbal or written."
good,"As a Telesales Representative, there is a constant flow of calls coming in for new customers, or renewing existing customers.  During my time there, the sales goals were constantly increasing, and if you didn't perform, you were written up."
good,"I learned how to better deal with the public and satisfy their needs.  Difficult at times and rewarding at others.  The workplace was a great place to work because of the people.  I made some great friendships and still keep in touch.  It was difficult in the sense that you dealt with many people who were always trying to get something for nothing and it hindered your quota, and quota was the key to keeping your position.  I did learn how to deal with many different personalities and how to be as pleasant as possible in all situations."
good,"Received inbound calls pertaining to level two troubleshooting. i.e.: device not able to make/receive calls, text/picture messaging and/or data. Performed trouble shooting to resolve issue. Escalated via submission of trouble tickets when necessary. Issued credits and adjustments when necessary, Processed warranty exchanges when applicable.  Processed rate plan changes, added/removed features per customer request."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Job consisted of maintaining a clean and friendly gym atmosphere and providing individualized workout regimens based on client needs. As mentioned in my summary, downside of this internship was the overall lack of clients. Verizon was downsizing, so employees were afraid to take breaks for fear of losing their jobs. My manager was also a trainer, so we often worked with one another to create the best plans possible."
good,"loved working with customers, solving complex issues. The management was very comfortable to work around."
good,Just not for me...hardest part of the job--meeting all of the quotas and gaining proficiency in systems
good,"Review of prior day results leads to renewed focus to attain goals."
good,Best thing about what I did was to help others to get promoted by teaching them. What I learned is to have patients. hardest part of the job at time would get the hours one works.
good,I t was great working in Europe and working on complex networks.
good,"Decent place to work because of the benefits and advancement if you pull in sale numbers.  I didn't like it because just like most sales jobs, they do anything to get the sale. ANYTHING."
good,Went to residences and businesses to install and repair telephone lines.
good,"Managing operation costs for the location including equipment subsidies, overhead, coaching employees, modify schedules, attending and conduct trainings and meetings"
good,Good pay with great benefits.  The leading cell phone company in the U.S.

good,"A typical day at work consist of helping customers with their billing questions to troubleshooting any issues they having with their device. I enjoy working and providing excellent customer service to a diverse clientele. I learned how to manage and solve different scenarios that being in retail presents. I don't find management consistent. As far as Co-workers, it is  a normal environment, you get alone with some more than others. The hardest part of the job is when you working with a customer that wants the matter escalated to a manager without giving us the opportunity to help them with their needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer comes in unsatisfied and am able to fulfill their needs."
good,"I seeked employment with Verizon Wireless because they do have a wide range of career opportunities, however the time it takes to get into a role in which you studied and went to school for is unacceptable. Fun atmosphere as far as events and coworkers. Job duties however are very stressful and demanding."
good,The typical workday was fun and educational. We were always able to learn new ways to work with our customers and co-workers. We took part in an open door policy were we able to be a work family. The was no real hard part to my job with the help of my co-workers.
good,There is a lot of work to keep you busy and employed at Verizon Wireless.
good,"Verizon was a great job to support my family with good benefits and "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Take 60-100 calls a day. I learned how to take questions from customers. Management were very distant as were team members. The hardest part of the job was explaining to customers their first bill. The best part of the job is that it was non stop.
good,"helping customers with cellphone plans and devices, assist with technical support when needed.  Offer products and services"
good,"Good company and Fun at work"
good,"While the benefits are wonderful working for Verizon, the culture is not what it used to be.  I met some wonderful people while working for the company, but the stress level of sales and the pressure on each person by management can be extremely overwhelming.  You have to be a very specific type of person (a yes man) to get a promotion in this company and you have to do it quickly.  I enjoyed the customers for the most part and my co-workers, but the health decline due to stress was my least favorite part.  There are some managers that are amazing and there are some managers still with the company who can make a person want to quit their job."
good,"A large corporate environment with a strong focus on margin growth. "
good,As a greeter it was the first line to the customers walking into the store. The day consisted of just welcoming the customers and being friendly and keeping the day organized.
good,"Begin the day by reviewing current numbers as well as plans on how to hit goals for the day/month and measuring daily progress made. Meet constantly through out the day with employees to motivate and assist in hitting goals and quotas. During all this, you learn how to connect and adapt your approach to employees and customers of all kinds of different mind sets. Due to transfers, new hires and district meetings there is a constant rotation of new employees you get to meet, learn from and grow with; both personally and professionally. The most difficult part of the job is not being able to anything that so much as resembles a set schedule; between constant meetings, different shifts and almost random days off it is hard to plan your life around work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the always new daily challenges and constant new faces the job provides."
good,no advancement. work more for less terrible. worked for 21  years. laid off
good,"Day was a call center environment"
good,A typical day at work is scattered we never know what we are going to do because the work is not constant so we mainly try to find work around the building. Co-workers are good workers as well as fun to be around but the worst thing about the job is down time which is a lot of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we do have events and we get to see everything run smoothly.
good,Verizon is a great company to work for in terms of benefits.  There was no work/life balance which was a big disappointment.  I liked the job itself but felt like I was not appreciated as an individual.  I needed something that had more of a balance due to family.
good,I enjoy working here. Had a good time with Network Remediation Team.
good,"Verizon had great benefits and made sure all employees were knowledgeable of all new devices, they offered hand on and online trainings"
good,"A typical day is a busy day. Customers are waiting outside of the front doors at 9:50 am. From the minute the doors open, the work environment is chaotic and fast-paced, but fun and enjoyable. I learned how to deal with all types of customers and interactions, whether they be irritated customers or customers with nothing but praise. I worked in management for approximately 5 months and enjoyed working with my team in, watching them grow was rewarding and a great reflection on my own personal management style. My co-workers are great, sometimes upset or frustrated themselves, but always pick themselves back up or ask for help from others. The hardest part of the job is when it is simply impossible to help someone to the utmost satisfaction, sometimes there is nothing you can do, but to do all that you can is key. I love working with the public and getting to know people and create lasting work relationships from those bonds and seeing them return time after time because of how I portrayed the care and diligence of my work and the company."
good,Strong com[pany borderline gray on ethical billing concepts.
good,My position at Verizon Wireless gave me my first taste of the corporate world.  I learned a great deal while working there.
good,"Our call center is currently in the process of shifting cultures from what I am told. I am close to my anniversary there and honestly I have started looking elsewhere. There is a posting for a position in communications and if I am not a candidate, I am leaving VZW. To start, coworkers are great. They have had a shift in the type of people they are hiring. It is clear from seeing people who are 3+ years in vs newer people. Most are pretty educated and have so!e intelligence to them... With that being said, supervisors know NOTHING AT ALL. I AM NOT EXAGGERATING. Its frustratimgmto know more than your supervisor after only 19 weeks of training... The training environmemt is a lot different than the depressing everyday environment.... The benefits are worth staying but, really if you want to go somewhere in that company non customer facing, you need to have the grace of God or a friend in high places.... Really supervisor is the climax in wireless unless you can wiggle into training or quality somehow and are willing to be mobile. I LOVED THE COMPANY and hopefully this new position will be the push I need to continue with the company... But if all else fails... Tuition reimbursement!!!!!!"
good,"Verizon is the highest stress level  job I have ever had. I worked at the call center for a year and a half, started to really dislike the environment. There was no time we could take off the phones to recoup from difficult calls which made some days very rough. After trying to work my way up but getting no where I decided to switch to sales representative. This is my current position and am looking to move out of the Verizon footprint. In sales I have a lot of great coworkers, which makes the work okay. But the job itself, has very high sales expectations. Quotas are difficult to reach. Management is very difficult to work with. We are currently very short staffed because over half of the employees now have left. I have had a negative experience working for Verizon. I believe that the salary and benefits are the only reason people stay working for this company. The hardest part of the job is just dealing with the stress. The most enjoyable part is the employees you get to work with."
good,"This is a very self motivated job requiring self drive and determination to get the job done and meet expectations. I learned to be detailed and patient. The management was great, very helpful and willing to teach. I really enjoyed the customer interaction and face time with each one."
good,The company itself was great to work for.  There were a lot of perks.  There was a lot of unnecessary micro managing that took place.  Towards the end I feel when this was relieved people produced better stats.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"It would have been a great job. Thew only problem was the managers and heads. Pay was great, customers were awesome."
good,"Verizon is a company that I have enjoyed working at for 14 years now.  As an employee,I have experienced many good times and challenges as well in my 14 year career here.  I am looking for opportunities that will utilize my skill set that gives me the best chance for further growth and development.  Verizon lacks that opportunity."
good,the company is to big to keep in contact with what goes on in the lower ranks.
good,"The customers were the hardest part of the job. There were some pretty corrupt workers , too many HR issues. the employees were not all friendly , but i worked with them ."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, it was a great experience. I would do it all over again if I could"
good,Verizon taught me about the importance of being competitive and setting my company's product up for success even if other companies had the same product by simply providing excellent customer service.
good,"Easy days usually with spikes of crowded store, but usually steady."
good,Call center environment is special. You have to be a special person to work in a call center environment.
good,"A typical day at Verizon I would answer telephone calls from Customers and advice them of the progress of their rebates."
good,Good company to work for. Could provide a better work life balance for their employees.
good,have morning meeting then depending on work load for the day may have anywhere from 5 to 7 jobs dispatched on and completed.
good,"Verizon Managed Services is a place where there is most often no time to think, because the work load is truly chaotic, however this is not to say that there are not lull periods in the storm. They are just very brief and must be used for planning and clean up. Most PMs either acclimate or burn out.  The salary and benefits you will receive at Verizon are given to you for a reason.  They expect only great Project Managers."
good,"Handled customer concerns, complaints, billing questions an payment extensions/service requests in a high-volume inbound call center with a deadline driven environment. "
good,Liked the challenge of a 100% commission sales job. I also enjoyed negotiating and selling any and every kind of customer that I was able to approach; trying to up-sell and/or cross-sell every customer at least one item before they left the store.
good,Worked at customer Site deploying SSM (Self Service Machine) Kiosk systems
good,While at Verizon I observed the reengineering of American corporations through computer technology.
good,"I worked for Verizon for a long time and trained hundreds of Customer Service reps over the years. I truly enjoyed the company and the fact that they focused on customer service."
good,"Awesome place to learn the wireless mobile industry. Recent high turnover has been a concern. Job requires a lot of cold calling, but if you are into the activity it can be rewarding. Flexible hours, work-life balance is great."
good,Customer Service took inbound calls for a phone company call Verizon wireless
good,"•	Handled heavy volumes of inbound/outbound calls regarding billing questions and promotional opportunities, long distance, and internationally. "

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"great place to work, excellent employees and even better management to work for"
good,"You walk thru the door setting your mind for beating your best from the day before, I learned to how to re-direct really upset clients and leave them satisfied with company oriented outcome. Your co workers are what push you to do better, they challenge and celebrate you when you do something great. The hardest part of the job was working within a time limit. but the best part was all the rewards and bonus given when you reached team goals"
good,benefits are nice.. work environment too stressful... management has no clue...
good,good if you don't have a college degree. Not for everyone with pressure from commissions
good,"Working in different location,with exciting and new challenges;feels good working with coworkers who enjoy completing task at hand."
good,"Verizon offers exceptional pay and benefits. However, they can demotivate their employees at times."
good,•	Completed 10 weeks of Verizon Wireless Customer Service Representative Training Course.
good,The job is a good temporary job. However its just strictly commission based and it takes alot out of you. You usually spend more than you make with constant driving and the unpredictable nature of the business. Its very stressful and frustrating at times. The most enjoyanle part about it is working in a team environment. The hardest part is trying to stay motivated on the days you dont make any sales. This job has taught me how to work hard.
good,"very hard to move up, a lot of politics a lot of stress for numbers"
good,"Verizon Data Services India (VDSI) has provided a platform for me to perform various roles. I along with 2 managers have setup a department in HYDERABAD starting with 3 applications. Over the last 6 years, we have increased the head count to 100 and the applications to 20+."
good,Overall this company has hard working friendly employess.  I had great management and enjoyed my work as a provisioner.
good,"Dynamic, constantly changing and reorganizing. Strong Compensation and Benefits programs.Great, dedicated, loyal employees."
good,Great Benifits!  They were reasonable priced and had great employee discounts.  I was hired on as a Retail Sales Rep and told that I would be able to move to corporate as a trainer in about 6 months.  I have been with Verizon for about a year and it is very difficult to move up in the company.
good,Hard to make bonus do to a lot of customer service duties that have be resolved when tech support busy.

good,"My typical day included answering inbound calls from the wholesale customer base at Verizon. The group I worked in was a specialized group that supported a website and other applications our wholesale customer base utilized, so I spoke to many of the same customers on a daily basis. My responsibility was to take their issue and try to research and resolve it before opening tickets to our IT group. Researching their issue often included reaching out to other groups with the company and navigating through several different databases. "
good,the call que is so high we were unable to finish up everyone in one day. the people were so rude. but overall it was okay.
good,"Competitive Pay, overtime, shift bids. Gym indoors, nice people to work with."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,Working at Verizon I wore many hats. I was a technical specialist in the DMS system. I also worked staff jobs that analyzed data for the PSC. My last few years I worked in work centers that had technicians who installed and maintained FIOS and Copper Services.
good,they said there would be a lot of work. but i was never given my complete 40 hrs.
good,"Verizon makes for a good work environment. However, there are times when it can be stressful."
good,"A typical day at work involves back-to-back calls, with me being Sherlock Holmes to discover a customers issues and needs, then fixing those issues and meeting those needs as quickly as possible.  It also involves a lot of irritated customers that I must de-escalate and educate before I can do so.  "
good,"This company is good as a second job for extra income. YOu assist customers with various issues from billing to service plans to fit their lifestyle."
good,Verizon is a global company your work hours need to be flexible to meet domestic and international time zones. They require train hour from each employee each year. The hardest part of the job is balancing your work and life schedules. Working with the people and leaning new job skills was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,VZ used to be a great company to work for but not so much anymore
good,loved working as an outside account executive.  Dealt with business clients and was able to travel around to different locations.

good,sold mobile phones 99 to 01 at the busiest store in the county
good,"taking food orders "
good,"Daily we were handed sheets of prospects addresses and had to go door to door selling the companies new product. The job was 100 percent commission. Sales isn't as it easy as it seems, especially when you don't have any prior sales experience. Working here taught me how to be an effective communicator and knowledgeable person. We'd have to work in any form of weather. I remember working during a Hurricane getting rained on as I got drenched from walking around in that weather."
good,"Good company to work for. Very strict, however very well paid and good benefits. Management needs improvement."
good,"Fast paced, steady working all day, constant on the go, loading and unloading trucks, storing & racking pallets of phone books."

good,Compensation and benefits are great. 401k is very generous and on-site gym is convenient. Many opportunities for advancement are available throughout the company if you’re able to relocate.
good,"This is an ok place to work. Great benefits and adequate pay. Although if you work in care, the pay should be more considering all the work you do. Overall it would be a good place for someone starting out."
good,"Working for Verizon Wireless definitely has prepared me for real-life situations, such as dealing with unhappy customers. It has prepared me for the Corporate world and what it means to be professional at all times."
good,"After logging into my work station, I would receive calls from customers looking for telephone numbers. After asking them for the name and location of the person or business that they were looking for, I would enter the information and send the number out by way of a recording while I am instantly connected to the next customer on my line. I had a few different managers over the years, though the last manager did not get along very well with the other employees, including the supervisors. I did get along well with my co-workers and supervisors though. The hardest part of my job would be the schedules. It was an office that was open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There was no specific time of day that I was assigned, so from day to day, I would work any 8 hour portion of a 24 hour day including overnights"
good,"A typical day was sales driven and challenging."

I would interact with a variety of clientele from consumers to business owners.  The hardest part of my day was making cold calls but I continue to work and overcome any struggles.  Every month or quarter a new goal or metric was set in place, procedures changed, etc.  That was also a struggle, but one of the most enjoyable parts of my job; I knew if I could overcome those obstacles, everything else was simple.  The experience with this company has shown me first hand how rapidly the market changes in the technology industry and how to keep pace."
good,Management is very supportive.  Huge incentives for representatives to make money.  Advancement. 
good,Overall it was a good place to work the best part were  my co workers. We worked well together and it was sad when we had to leave. 
good,"Working 24/7 is part of Storage admin's job, when ever critical issues arise whole team is activated to clear issue asap weather it is day or night it never matters.

good,I assisted In opening a collections call center from the ground up. 
good,"The company is vast growing on the latest technology; however, the positions available in marketing and advertising are limited. The work place was becoming extremely complacent. I have learned the technique of retaining customer with great customer service skills. Management was a team of young individuals; more than likely who retained that position once the center it self open. My team of Co Workers where  from different walks of life as in in any fortune 500 company. We all had the gift of communicating in bedded with us, which made it interesting to come to work everyday. The hardest part of the job was the metrics to meet that were based on customer expectations. Every knows the customer can sometime be unreasonable but, we are trained to give the customer what they want or at least make it sound good when we cant offer what they are really asking us for. The most memorable part of my job was team challenges and being in a competitive environment everyone wants to win. At least I know I did!."

good,Have been fortunate to have worked with multiple people who have a diverse knowledge and are always willing to share their knowledge.
good,"I like the team, I learned a lot ."
good,"Work day is full from 8-5 and them some on occasion. I have learned alot of useful skills and had helpful mentors along the way who have increased my knowledge of the corporate world.Direct Management is good, lets employees work independently. Upper Management is sub par. Co workers are great and one of the reasons to stay. Hardest part is the constantly changing management, organization transistion. its more thant most companies go through. The most enjoyable is the work from home aspect . This happens a couple of days a week."

good,"A typical day at work is answering phones, resolving customer concerns, retaining customers. I learned how to successfully sell and please customers. managment was less than desirable, supervisors either didnt know their job or how to treat employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to take care of all of the customers needs and keep the call under 5 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers."
good,good money buy every year it becomes harder and harder to make what you did the previous year
good,"I usually open the store at 8 or 8:30 am daily. Before the store opens at 10:00 I have a long task list I have to accomplish. First, I complete the morning inventory which includes a count of all the devices in the store in every status (used, new, defective upon arrival, and demo), then I check for any discrepancies in the count. Once the morning inventory finished, I review multiple reports concerning the transactions which occurred the previous day: orders completed without a signature, incomplete orders and refund orders. After reviewing the orders I then check the sales floor to be sure that it is compliant to the national standard. Only after completing the morning list am I able to sign into my terminal on the sales floor and count my money drawer."
good,"Answering phone calls, assisting customers with orders, safegaurding personal info, sales, explanations of products and services, etc."
good,"I worked really hard, didn't mind staying later to get the work completed. Volunteered for extra assignments by participating on diverse committees within Verizon."
good,"Typically in a day, I would receive well over a thousand calls for people wanting information. Most of the time, it would be for nationally listed phone numbers."
good,Answered customer call regrading billing or equpiment issues.
good,"Company gives you great experience on the latest and greatest in its industry. Gives any employee great ground work to develop their skill set within their preference of career insights. Like most companies, their is inconsistency in some departments and the moral values that are being claimed."
good,"if your a go getter and get into your job.....and you are competitive, then you might be ready to take this job on. verizon pays very nice, and their health benefits are amazing ( and that usually makes people stay at this job). if your afraid to sell or dont have confidence in yourself in selling then you better not even think of applying to this job."
good,"I enjoyed the time I worked at Verizon. My typical work day consisted selling wireless devices, providing training to customers on how to use there Ipads, iphones, and wireless devices. I also work in Technical support in a call center. The store management was great, but there was a noticeable gap between the corporate management. Coworkers were easy to get along with. The downside is, the call center was closed down and displaced about 400 to a 1000 employees. The most enjoyable thing would be the 401 k and heathcare benefits. There are some other issues you will just have to find out for yourself! (Corporate Sales Management Corruption)"
good,Typical day for Verizon walking up and down all day to door to door hoping you can knock out a sale but 9 out of 10 you won't get a sale cause people think Verizon is to expensive .
good,I am Java Developer.I have 1.6 yr experience in Verizon. I joined Verizon as fresher.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Changing sales environment
good,A solid place to work. Good management team. Nice benefits and competitve pay.
good,Opportunities to learn multiple cultures...Process oriented working...Pre-defined and tested process's
good,A heavily bureaucratic company struggling to do the right things.
good,It is a good Environment Productive and fun workspace.Good Facilities and good atmosphere love to there at any point of time
good,Had a lot of freedom and managed my self for the most part. The most enjoyable was the 10 miles from my house. The hardest part of the job none.
good,"It was great when it was GTE, after verizon took over it down hill. the company did not care about employees at all. I worked nights most of my career, so I didn't see many people. The rest of my career was spent in the supply point. All the guys were freindly, and my boss was a great guy and cared for his employees, but he could'nt much for us because of company policy."
good,I learned a good deal of how the business world works for my first job out of college through Verizon.
good,Answered heavy inbound call volume
good,"Typical Day - managed up to 3 small projects and up to 5 lifecycle accounts at any one time (global), managed virtual and non virtual project teams, managed and produced project documentation (PID's, Plans, RAID logs, Dashboard Reports), chaired project meetings (conf calls & face to face, internal and external), managed escalations (reporting internally and externally), replied to between 50 - 100 emails per day, ran activation calls with engineers (go live, turn up and testing of solutions), updated internal systems."
good,Great employees and management family oriented company. Only letf because i had to relocate out the area.
good,Kept you thinking and a different job everyday. Traveled to different locations for storm damage.
good,"My day began reviewing the jeopardy list for jobs that were not completed. Investigating the reason the job cannot be finished and resolving the issue with the customer, technician and often the business office. I continued the practice that I have leaned over the years. Give the customer a great experience by giving them the best service possible. I enjoy working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is not being able to appease the customer due to reasons out of my control. The most enjoyable part is working with my co-workers and put customer in service or back in service."
good,Typical day includes helping customers with account inquiries and device issues.
good,Verizon is cutting back. Doesn't use the most recent technologies to train it's personnel. Requires experienced folks to maintain its work because it can be frustrating for someone who is too new..
good,Verizon was a good place to work.
good,implementation project management role - supporting the citigroup account.
good,"As I see it, Verizon is fighting to maintain landline market share. First level managers are an expendable expense depending on the budget balance. fight to keep your head above water, to few managers to handle the workload in an efficient manner without sacrificing quality of the product and services."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Co-workers were great. Felt relaxed working there. There was always work to do
good,A typical day at work is answering questions about our wireless products and services. I accept payment inquiries on consumer and business accounts. I work with very intuitive co-workers who possess great work ethics and integrity. The hardest part of my job is not receiving the needed communication from upper management and the appropriate coaching and development needed to meet my daily and monthly goals. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and learning about their daily lives and how important a mobile phone is a part of their everyday routines.
good,The job was just ok.. Poor sales culture made the work seem way harder than it was.
good,The most enjoyable aspect of this job was definitely the employees. It was very stressful as it was fast paced and call volume was high. At times customers were difficult but it taught me patience. Unfortunately security was the worst thing and so I took a corporate buy out and had to find another job.
good,"Enjoyed the pay, benefits and the job until they laid us all off"
good,Doesnt offer the work / life balance needed for a working mom. retail hours
good,The hardest part was not being able to move up a lot. The enjoyable was working with the people.
good,regular day at work
good,"It was a great place to work, always learning new things and I loved my coworkers."
good,What more can you saying when working in yellow pages department. Management has there favorite that they promote.
good,"in bound call center, answering calls on billing, plans available. tech support"
good,"Worked with many great people. Company used to be great. Had taken a turn for the worst the last two years I was there. Corporate greed took over and customers pay the price. There are too many people in positions they shouldn't be in (i.e. top sales guy promotes to marketing manager with no marketing degree, etc.). If you have a college degree good luck moving up on the retail side. The HR Department is worthless, it backs managment 99% of the time unless its a legal issue which they know they can't get away with. Sales Representatives are treated like dirt. Unreasonable and unrealistic goals are set so they can fire who they want. They push unethical behavior but turn a blind eye to it at the same time. As a sales rep there, the company is a joke. As any other job title, the company would still be a great place to work."
good,"Opportunity to make decent money, just have to work around unsteady schedule"
good,"Have the opportunity to make decent money, just have to deal with an unsteady schedule"
good,"I was a member of a customer service team focused on strong customer service; analyzing the needs of customers and identified solutions, accurately managed documentation of customer communications within rigid time constraints and provided technical support to trouble shoot technical issues. I learned to be patient and really listen and identify with customers issues so I could come up with the best solutions that satisfied the customer and fully solved the issue at hand. My co-workers varied from being hardworking and positively contributing to the overall performance of the team and were very personable. While others were negative, immature and more concerned about causing drama with others than working hard at making the team exceptional. The hardest part of the job was satisfying the customer as well as the team supervisor as these two aspects were no-t always in alignment with one another. Additionally even when team members performed their calls perfectly according to the defined standards set by the company, she always criticized the team-members performance and never gave positive feed back. What I enjoyed most about this position is talking to many types of people from all over the United Sates. I enjoyed helping them solve the issues that they were calling about and having the satisfaction of knowing I made someones day better by doing my job well. I especially enjoyed the challenge of helping the most difficult customers, by turning the call around by patiently helping them and having them happily thank me for my help, and end the call on a very positive note."
good,"As a Sales Representative, you are responsible for meeting many sales quotas, regardless if the exceedingly high expectations do not coinside with one's morality and consultative sales strategy."
good,"Great people with a strong vision for the future. I worked there, left for a short time and came back because of the people."
good,The Company overall is a great company but there is a lot of demand on employees for increased performance with reduced headcount and other reductions to reduce costs. There is little work to life balance in the Finance and Accounting departments. The Company delivers cool and innovative prodcuts to the market place. Compensation is generally competitive and the benefits are standard but are getting more expensive to the employee each year.
good,Verizon is a great company to work for but at time it is very stressful.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"if you work in a slow traffic store you wont have the opportunity to grow as a PRO, and you probably lose your job BCZ: SLOW TRAFFIC MEANS NO CUSTOMER AND NO MONEY AND NO QUOTA COMMITTED. you need to work a an high volume traffic store an order to be somebody."
good,"• Included responsibilities of the customer service representative plus additional managerial responsibilities, including but not limited to:"
good,"In a retail setting, employees provdie excellent customer service. Hours follow retail hours."
good,This was the first full time job and I loved everyday going to work. The call center closed after a budget cut.
good,"A typical day would include, follow up calls, online trainings, greeting and helping customers, filling and drafting contracts, checking email, purchase orders, review employee sales goals.The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about the new features and helping a customer."
good,"The benefits and pay are great at Verizon Wireless, along with the training (in some, not all aspects)."
good,Productive place to work
good,worked there seasonal contract. Fun people lor of hours. NOt sure how to review
good,"verizon provides a great service to customers but, is very disconnected from employees and their livelihoods. the company is very large and is known to instill fear tactics into employees as a managment req. the most dfficult part of this job is the constant micromanaging from management. the best part of the job is the comradery of the employees and the work that we do."
good,Great place to keep up with the latest in technology. Did not have a work/life balance.
good,During the summer and christmas season it very overwhelming because for the number of calls that come in. But the company tries hard to make a stressful enviroment fun.
good,"this was a new experience for me, because i had never worked in a sales department before in my life. i had no idea on how to sell a product to a customer without convincing them, so that was a challenge for me, but over the period of times i finally got the hang of it, and was pretty comfortable sellling it"
good,"Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. I have been here for three years now an have no complaints about the company regarding job security and benefits. On the other hand, career advancement seems impossible."
good,"Transactions: greet customers, provide wireless solutions through a detailed usage analysis, activate customers accounts and equipment, spend time teaching customer to use their equip"
good,"Benefits at Verizon Wireless are probably in the top 5%. Handled 30-40 calls per day with customer service, retention, and technical support."
good,Worked at the company for about 1 year. Great co-workers! Great atmosphere!
good,"It was not bad, but it's hard to maintain a balance between work and personal lives at that place."
good,"Excellent company to work for, but job not so great. Training provided to you continuously. Job is mentally draining but pay is above average and benefits as well"
good,"Most days start off very busy with customer's waiting outside the door. Once we open the store there is a store process that has to be followed in order for the store to flow effectively. There is a floor manager that meets and greets the customer and sign the customer's in the sales que for the next available sales rep. The customer is then introduced to the sales rep by the floor manager and the sales rep earn the right to sale to the customer by asking discovery questions and qualifying the customer. After the transaction is completed by the sales rep the customer is then introduced to the customer service rep, who then begins to demonstrate the device to the customer and answer any additional questions the customer may have. Throughout the day, during down time, we are responsible for making effective calls to our customer's regarding information that may be beneficial to the customer. i.e. customer may be eligible for an upgrade. We also make sure the sales floor is presentable and stocked at all times as well as put up inventory."
good,"Every day its just Work Work Work. The best thing to do is get as much learning in as possible before the company caves into the union demands and your group gets axed. Well, they have real weak managers and they are not very trustworthy. Many of the managers have their favorites and regardless of what they say race has a lot to do with things. The only thing hard about this job was working with the other LECs, ILECs, CLECs. The most enjoyable part of the job was the time off."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Handled billing inquiry calls
good,Typical day of work consists of helping customers. Learned the value of satisfaction and loyalty to customers.
good,Good Verizon company to work for. Collaborating with good team.
good,"Typical work day consisted of responding to emails and voice calls in order to get properly set for the day. Some days morning meeting were conducted and or one on one meeting. Followed by cold calling, foot prospecting, or relationship building with current clients. I attended a minimum of 8 meeting a week depending on the internal mandatory meeting at the office. What I most learned from working at Verizon Wireless is the need to be organized at all times. Organization is key to success in an account management role. I thoroughly enjoyed each person I worked with and wish I could bring them to my next position. The hardest part of the job was my territory commute, on a given day it could take in excess of two hours. This time took a lot of my business time and therefore I worked more during my personal time. The most enjoyable part would have to be the connections I made with executives, IT personal, and staff and each and every one of my clients place of business."
good,research area needs. designer according to the needs. prarctice just in-time facility management
good,"On a typical day I meet a variety of different people and I am able to help guide them to make decisions on different solutions that will fit their needs. Verizon is always continuing to grow and expand their employees knowledge with onsite training's, online training's, and one on one coaching sessions. In order to succeed at Verizon working a 40 hour work week is just the bare minimum. Most consultants work between 45-60 hours a week to ensure they are meeting and exceeding their quota."
good,"Data Entry, Support Engineering department to ensure they have all the Necessary equipment they need for the support for customers."
good,"Handled incoming calls to process account transactions with accuracy for customers requesting to add and remove services from their plans, update personal information, educated on financial options to maintain services and processed payments, recognized account issues and resolved them efficiently with one call resolution to satisfaction in a fast-pasted high call volume call center. Efficiently self-directed while supporting my team with contributing successful individual stats working in a constant in-bound calling que."
good,Contract for 2 years expired. Very hectic but learned alot.
good,Not a bad company to work for. However I am not happy with getting paid commission once a month. The location I am at does not get a lot of traffic.
good,Really enjoyed my team and most of all the Tranquility Room which allowed me to relax between well needed breaks
good,"When I first started, I enjoyed my job. A typical day involved receiving automated orders, contacting customers and drawing work plans for construction."
good,"•Resolved complex escalated customer calls from the entire call center in order to provide the most satisfactory resolution for the customer and company, calls required deviation from standard screen, scripts, and procedures."
good,My day included providing outstanding service for customers. It was a good learning experience on how to serve a high volume of customers in a quick period of time.
good,They did not have any clear work for me. Did not knwo what they wanted.
good,Assist clients with wireless solutions
good,I feel Verizon is a good place to work and adquire as much experince as you can. One of the leaders on Telecomunications that cover much of every possible technology.
good,fair working environment- a culture built on constant change..as such consistent training is provided..
good,"I had a good time, but I did not like standing around alot. The management and felow employees made the day great."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Contract position, was not there very long. Very friendly culture, people really nice."
good,"This was an okay company, managers were cool. My manager got fired within my first couple weeks and I was transferred to another store."
good,"Verizon is a company that offers great benefits and salary to their employees. The only problem is they are not that flexible when it comes to personal time, the job is very stressful and all about the numbers. So if your a excellent in sales this is a great opportunity for you."
good,"To much traveling, not enough sales. Coworkers are fun to work with."
good,"Verizon communications was a great place to work, but now it seems that the wireline side is an afterthought as compared to the wireless side. I look for Verizon to try and spin the wireline side off in the future."
good,"The training was fantastic; 4 weeks with very comprehensive coverage of selling points, how to use the PCs, etc. The first month was also nice as your commission was guaranteed, allowed you time to practice and learn the tricks of the trade. After that, it was your typical commission job, the more you sell the more you make. I did enjoy a standard 40 hour work week as opposed to other commission paid jobs, which was usually 12 hour shifts."
good,"These days very political work environment, on the business side."
good,"Very challenging and stressful work environment. Need better management, planning and processes to ensure clarity and better product delivery. This would enable better work life balance to employees."
good,Enjoy working for the company has given me a lot of opportunities and confidence. However past couple years the culture has shifted and has shown not to care about the top sellers and seems to be aiming towards a non commission job.
good,"Contingent worker here today, gone tomorrow.  Project driven with unseen oversight.  Rewards innovation and drive.  Very large contingent workforce.  Nice desks."
good,"I worked here for 20 years and had multiple positions and level of responsibility.  However it is very political and I found it difficult to move past a certain point with very little support for exploring other options.  Once I was in a certain position and very good at it, I did not really have a manager that was helping with planning for the next step.  Then when things changed, I lost that position.   And things always change at Verizon."
good,"Retail environment with retail hours. You are an expendable commodity, although the pay and benefits are good. You will be on a quota system and you will never have the same schedule 2 weeks in a row"
good,Good compensation and benefits. Reasonable training. Management engagement and work/life balance depends on the people and location. Some difficulty in job advancement unless you are mobile.
good,Verizon does a good job of balancing compensation with what they ask from you as an employee. If you come to work and do your best then you are already ahead of the game at Verizon.
good,"I wish not to respond as I do not agree or like to take surveys , This do not give the full scope of a person opinion so I will not be answering the questions."
good,"Minimal actual human reaction, gender-based harassment, co-workers had no respect for each other or property, destroyed and stole items from desks and fridge."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company and I was thankful for the knowledge and the experience that I obtained while working there. "
good,The after call survey suck. Your performance is weighted heavily on how the customer feels about verizon and you as an employee are only doing what you have been advised to do.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Management is an exciting thing. There are always competitive job opportunities but the lack of expereince for the employees does slow the growth down. The job market is a hard one as well as the decision process on the employees. This can be a stressful job but ""Change energizes us""- Verizon Credo."
good,"Amazing benefits and good pay. Work can be intense, repetitive, and good if you like doing the same thing day in and day out. Occasionally there are opportunities to do things outside your normal scope of work. There are many cliques, and you must be aware of how to navigate them to succeed. There are not many opportunities for advancement; movement between groups at the same level is the norm. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to work at home one day a week."
good,"it was a very stressful place to work.  it however did pay very well,  only reason i took severance was that after 11 years i couldn't get weekends off to see my kids."
good,"I would rather not go into details, But Verizon is great with training. But work life balance needs a lot of attention as well as upper management. I enjoyed the people I worked with as well as my experience with the company the structure of management just needs attention as well as how employees are treated."
good,Great pay and benefits. Used to have great work and life balance. Management was good when first started but is at best subpar.  Industry changing rapidly over the last 20+ years and this is common with most companies now.
good,The cultural atmosphere widely varies based on business group and location. Some remote work is supported. Great benefits. Fair interview and development plans.
good,the review minimum is 150 characters and last time i just put dot dot dot and that didn't meet the quality so I'm hoping this will even though I didn't use proper grammar or punctuation.
good,"It wasn't a bad company to work for. They have their pros and cons. They take care of their employees and have amazing benefits. They do have stringent sales requirements, where they want you to do suggestive selling and get good surveys. Unfortunately people gave bad surveys even if you did suggestive selling as per the company's way of selling and non intrusive selling tactics. Also there is no protection if another agent steals your sales. Other than that, it is a great company to work for."
good,"Could be better, needs management to up their game and compete with competitive call centers and increase wages often like other centers to increase morale!"
good,"Very friendly working environment, nice coworker and great benefits. Job was clearly but narrowly defined, but sometimes lack of flexibility. Needs lots of selling and convincing to try new ideas,"
good,Decent place to work with some recent changes making it unrecognizable to the people who have been around for 5+ years. Benefits are really good and the minorities have a voice in the company but it has been more work with the same or less amount of compensation.
good,Verizon culture is very outdated. The people who have been there for 15 plus years are always worried about there job. Everyone is tied to their cube. Good place to work if you enjoy heads down work
good,"I enjoyed working for Verizon for the last 9 years. The benefits were excellent. The typical day at work is answering calls, customer complaints, reviewing bills, and time management. The most enjoyable part of my job is troubleshooting."
good,Working for Verizon was a wonderful learning experience. I met some of my best friends and had phenomenal training. They really took care of me and did a great job as a company allowing me to find my way.
good,Good place to work. Compensation is fair. Sales and monthly quota were tough and competitive. Company offered part-time employment at the time of me being hired therefore work/life balance was great.
good,"East Coast telecom company doing Security. The culture could improve. It is hard to compete with more agile, savvy and progressive companies from the Bay area."
good,"Good company, good pay good bonus. Stable place to work. You can retire in the same position if you chose to but also can advance if you made the right connections."
good,have nothing to really say but it is a good company . I have probably one of the hardest  job at Verizon. it is very stressful. that all I have to say.
good,"Culture needs improvement, most employees appear to be overly focused on being promoted and not collaboration.   The day to day politics is the worst thing about this company.  The company pays well and has relatively good benefits."
good,"while working for Verizon there were many changes that happened, my dept was getting cut back and had to cross train. during my time i was proactively looking at a new position where i found construction."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,They have good job security. The cafeteria was excellent. The drive from my house was nice. I liked that they had a gym in the building so I could go on my lunch break.
good,"working in sales, i am a strong believer to keep team motivate to get success. A good manager who can take better work from employees and to get better work need to keep them happy and motivate. Individual cant win trophy only team can win it."
good,"I have been worked in Verizon almost 20 years, I have learned new technologies. and I met some great friends there. we still have connections after we left verizon"
good,"I loved my job.  The wireless industry is extremely saturated now and you find yourself doing things that are not in line with your character.  Thats to meet or lead in my matrix.  I was either Performing or Leading."
good,"Verizon is a great employer, but suffers from all the same cons of other extremely large companies. They seem to perform yearly RIFs, but if you can survive them, you will make very good pay and get extremely good benefits. If accomplishing organizational change is important to you, I recommend seeking a smaller employer."
good,Verizon is a demanding fast pace job that will test all of your abilities as a manager. The work place culture is conflicting because you are working with a union work force.
good,"If your hard-working and able to consistently take customers the job was fairly straight forward. Management never seemed to be satisfied even after a successful sale. ""Always room for improvement"". Pay is very good."
good,I have been with the company for years but the work that has been asked of me has increased daily and the amount of pay has actually declined on a yearly based. I feel like the older employees they are trying to force out.
good,"Many Type A personalities, and high expectations, but you also learned a lot.  I liked working with the technology teams to shape and test new products."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for. they are always ahead with the latest technologies. The work place is always challenging and motivating. Working in Verizon not only adds a fortune 500 stamp but also gives great exposure and learning experience.
good,"I loved my career, but Management during my last 7 years of working was at it lowest and I have heard it continued with frontier . Management was not knowledgeable and was and still inconsistent with there team in process and procedures they were inconsistent from one employee to other they had personal relationships with the hourly and favoritisms."
good,The job was okay.  Verizon is in a growth mode for the telematic space.  There will be more churn in the area.  I'm not sure how Verizon is to work for since Telegos was bought out and was only part of Verizon for about a year.
good,"Great benefits and pay. Tuition assistance. Vacation, Personal, and sick time. Work from home or call center options."
good,I learned alot during my time with the company.  I appreciate the people and experience. Great benefits. Good business development and tuition reimbursement
good,"I enjoyed working at Verizon, due to the people that I made lasting relationships with some great leaders and mentors. Education and training is ongoing and very well designed."
good,"Typical day is balancing all of the internal calls, trainings, prospecting, presentation building, etc. "
good,Verizon offers decent benefits and decent pay and depending on your position some good work/life balance.  Some jobs have set hours and others have excessive amounts of on-call.  There are lots of opportunities especially if you have cutting edge skills.
good,"Very slow work environment and commission structure was changing to make it difficult to make large commission checks. Lots of down time, and no real good ways to maximize the time."
good,I have worked at verizon more than a year.I joined as a fresher. There is not much work for fresher. But the work and tech stack depends upon teams. Some of the teams have really good work.
good,"We constantly lost the opportunity to support new business because Verizon was never quick or agile enough to meet  changing customer requirements."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Typical day started at 7 am , reviewed emails and customer appointment day calendar, Next , client appointments until 3 pm. Research potential customer solutions from business customers from prior appointments, developed proposals of products and services for oocustomers , answered emails and calls in between and after appointments , prospected in between appointments by visiting potential business customers near each appointment. Management assisted with possible solutions from 3rd party business parties and helped with customer escalations if needed. Also, new product learning seminars or webinars were scheduled by management .Learned how to organize my day and prioritize task by efficient scheduling , learned presentation skills , conflict resolution, deescalation of customer issues, new technology education, prospecting through cold calls and face to face interactions , technical phone support and onsite Technical support, fast pace environment led to work fatigue. Therefore, making time for leisure activity is essential for longevity, clients that wrote accommodation emails were most gratifying to my career experience with VZW"
good,"I really loved the teamwork that there was working there. although at management, at the time, was going through a lot of changes. My fellow employees, as well as myself, had to step up our teamwork to get a lot of the issues solved."
good,"Depending on where the store is located, some targets they *require* you to hit may be incredibly difficult to obtain. Thus, the commission aspect is not always ideal."
good,"Verizon union members get ver fair treatment including wages, medical benefits,  schedules and discipline. Their managment team is treated very unfair and are made to work 24 hour on call shifts without compensation. They also are in constant threat of being fired or laid off. They have to treat their employees much better than they are treated which causes very bad morale."
good,At Verizon they have a solutions manager spot which is one of the most pointless positions I've ever seen. They don't really do much but literally overlook what you're doing. It's a commission job but the managers don't have to sell. Most times they're unrealistically hounding you to sell things that they can't even sell themselves. Verizon also likes you to sell their branded products but offer no customer support on them whatsoever when they stop working.
good,They make it hard to advance and the supervisors don’t have your back. It’s a good paying job but the level of stress may not be worth it. Most of us have to get therapy which Verizon pays for.
good,"Working for Verizon has been a amazing experience ,it has taught me numerous useful techniques that made me into a virtual asset to the company  and mold me into the sales banshee I am today."
good,This place is the best place to work if you can handle all the pressures. Management does not have your back in regards to customers. The make you feel as if you are incompetent. Although the benefits are great it did not outweigh the stress and mental exhaustion. The customers are the worse. They complain like children and are never satisfied with anything.
good,"Verizon will tell you as you walk through the door that this job is not for everyone and that is correct. The pay and benefits are very good, but the stress of supervisors is with numbers that needed to be met are a very high demand."
good,I really liked my manager and we worked well together. Senior leadership was clueless on most decisions that directly affected the front line workers.
good,"Verizon has changed a lot over the past years from an employee-centric environment to a bottom-line based culture, at least on the retail side. Great opportunity to make money, especially if you don't have your degree. Verizon offers many great benefits."
good,"OK company - huge potential. Need to use their people more effectively, International opportunities if you seek them. Good offices, culture was a bit parochial."
good,"No comment , I really have nothing to say about the company. Great benefits and pay and the rest is all opinion based. I left in December to look for different opportunities"
good,Was able to create my own environment for a comfortable place to work. I was employed at Verizon for 10 years.  I lesrned a lot.  Confidence.  Able to talk to people aroind the nation.  Very enlighting.
good,"Good place to work if you have no family or pets to go home to.  Very regimented daily schedule.  Non-stop phone calls so if you like being on the phones, this is the job for you."
good,Felt like when i started working at a time when it was all about customer experience and it quickly transitioned to push growth and sales. Wasn't a terrible job  but didnt like pushing an 80 year old single widow to buy a cell phone two tablets and a mobile hotspot when she came in to pay her flip phone bill.
good,Este trabajo abrió mi camino en el ámbito laboral y en el descubrí las responsabilidades como empleada y la dinámica de un trabajo formal.
good,"I was there for over 7 years and saw many things change within this company.  In the beginning there were many opportunities to make money and advance, now they are slowly downsizing stores for customers.  I would have stayed but only for the benefits since they were awesome.  I have learned a lot from Verizon and will use those tools in my next job.  Be ready to work really hard and always have more and more put on your plate with expectations.  The commission structure changes every year which makes it harder and harder to make money.  Like I said WORK HARD!"
good,great Place to work super diverse a lot of trouble shooting and one on with customers that makes the job interesting. The benefits are great also the managers are really there for there employees
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I had a great team in the store where I worked. Very upbeat and fun competition among the team. However, management can be a little questionable in the ways in which they go about things. Always watch your back."
good,The third party dealer was selling phones for verizon and was trying to reach their mission. although they fell through. But verizon as a company has shown some potential. Given the correct circumstances I would try again to sale phone for the company again.
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to remain focus on developing oneself to get to a higher position. The Districts are always looking for someone to promote but they always select their favorite people and it is hard for people who are actually well qualify to get an opportunity to remained focus. Every day is a struggle.
good,"Prior to becoming Verizon, company was a great place to work. Very little micro management. They seemed to care more about their customers and employees. Since becoming Verizon that all went out the window. They care only about the bottom line and the shareholders. ""Production Quotas"" are handed down by management that has no idea about the jobs. Don't get me wrong, if you can stand it, the pay and benefits are outstanding, but little else."
good,"As the title explains, Verizon treats there interns well in the New York area. If you do well you get the ability to move into full time positions easily. I choose not to go down that road but they seemed to invest a lot in young employee training and development."
good,Extremely busy environment. Worked with many sub contractors and willing to deal with fast pace environment. Management willing to help if they were informed of the necessary issues
good,"The pay was wonderful, but the stress very high if you do not give customers what they want at the end of the day customers hold their job in your hand even if you do everything possible to satisfy them"
good,Verizon pays well and has great benefits as well as time off but the bad side to Verizon there is a lot of favoritism between management and certain employees. its a company with many woman and there are lots of clicks jealousy and back stabbing. hours you are given are done by seniority and the seniority level in that company is 30+ years with some people so new hires are left with hours that are bad. The company has no room for advancement since most everything is going automated or computerized and call centers are micromanaged so you spend many hours strapped to a desk and are reprimanded if you need to use the restroom in between breaks.
good,"When I first began working at VZW it was amazing, however the past several years the leadership has declined which has driven nearly half of my coworkers to leave."
good,Verizon repeatedly and ruthlessly discarded dedicated longtime employees on a whim. Repeated employee strikes in certain areas of the country. No loyalty whatsoever to dedicated employees.
good,Not an ideal place to work. Would have enjoyed the workplace better if we would have been compensated more for the hours that were worked. There is little to no room for advancement.
good,"Verizon started off to were it was very easy to make a good paycheck. As the years went on they kept changing the commission structure to 'make it easier for the associates to make even more money' but in truth, it was just a way to make what we did sell pay us less. The 'higher ups' kept getting us to push things that the customer did not want or need by telling them they that did need it. It went from a sales job where you listened to your customer and responded to throwing spaghetti against a wall and hoping something stuck."
good,"I enjoyed this job, just because of the location made it hard to excel and make the money you need to maintain your responsibilities/lifestyle. It then became stressful. Hardest part of the job was to get the customers to come in."
good,Worked 10 hour shifts and would sell phones and accessories to local customers from retail store. 40% of my job was spent trouble shooting phones. The commission structure needs to be updated to be more lucrative. The amount of money you make is dictated by store traffic so stores in rural areas did not generate as much money as stores in popular area. The store I worked in was a rural area so the income potential was not great.
good,"It’s a sales job with a quota and metrics to meet. He will have fair salary and good benefits.. I sell at 100% for 8 or so hours a day. Depending on your store, the traffic can vary, however with some of the recent layoffs it seems that most reps even in slow stores are at 100% 100% of the time. I rarely sit for more than 5 minutes combined in a day."
good,Great company to work for in the customer service field. The company is very employee aware and strives to make work life more adaptable and exciting for employees.
good,"Serve as customer advocate and primary point of contact for assigned Custom/Complex customers through the full customer lifecycle. Manage internal support services team to coordinate dynamic solutions to complex problems."
good,"Over my time at Verizon, I have seen countless job cuts, funding cuts, decreased commissions due to raised quotas, decrease in store funding for certain items, and an overall lack of spending meanwhile the company's stock soars. When I first started, our location had seven more people than we do right now, quotas were attainable, and the culture was great. Over the past year, I've lost $7,000 in pay in comparison to the previous year due to a new commission structure that is unrealistic in our geographic location. It's not a bad place to work if you're just starting out, but unless you are able to move to a different area, promotion is impossible. The only way up is to move away."
good,"The money was very good; job security is questionable - there are just way too many reductions in force."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Too long ago to rate fairly. Worked for Verizon for 11.5 years. The company provided opportunities for career growth. Learned a lot while at Verizon that I was able to apply to future career opportunities.
good,"not a bad place to work sit around waiting for people to come in and do online classes to better for self in selling, answer Questions and help customers with there phones"
good,"It is a simple and straightforward sales job. It is long hours and intense sales. It can be a fun environment, but stress is always there due to the upper management believe you should sell on every contact with a customer. This disconnection is a big contribution to people quitting."
good,"great company benefits but can laid you off anytime doesnt matter how many years you are working or how good you are ..."
good,great culture. stressfull job. Supervisors hot or cold. Goals consistently changed. micro managed to the extreme. great family picnics. the micor managing thing was the worst part of this job.
good,good first job out of college that had promise of advancement that stopped when managers changed and had their own people that were ready to be promoted.
good,"Quotas became unrealistic. People in 2018 still have no idea what phones are capable of. It's a sales job that requires you to spend more time teaching people how to use the phone their purchasing than the actual sale itself. Verizon cut corners trying to save money by getting rid of customer service reps and leaving all of those responsibilities to the sales reps, on top of their default responsibilities."
good,"•	Maintained working knowledge of all company products, services and promotions."
good,Fast paced call center with intense customer service calls.  I worked with customers who lost their phone service by mistake going to other phone companies.  I learned a lot about customer service and how to talk to others when I have a problem and need help.
good,The day was spent on the phone.  Learned better sales techniques for phone contacts. The management was great and helpful.  The workplace culture was great.  The hardest part of the job was learning the system which was way below the standard of what one should expect from a multi-billion company.  What I liked best about the company was the people.
good,">  Strong and positive corporate culture, but sometimes corporate direction does not seem well planned.  "
good,Lots of promotional events and team building events that made the job fun. Metrics are difficult to meet but it is achievable. High stress. Must be able to handle irate rude customers.
good,Verizon paid well but it was a rather high stress environment with lots and metric. They provide great benefits and offer things like tuition assistance.
good,"-Typical day at work pretty fast pace enviroment and great work place majority of the time."
good,morning meeting check goal and where you are at check new promotions and set yourself up for the day that you can stay on top of your goal for the month
good,Verizon provided a good work environment. Excellent wages and benefits. Knowledgeable staff and decent training. 401K and medical benefits were available.
good,Tulsa seems to be on it's way out.  Be careful!  I wouldn't make a move here for a job unless you have the means to move again in a few years.  They are cutting overhead a lot.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Nepotism, bad supervisors not living up to the values.  Supervisors were the main issue and nothing was ever done to correct them but employees had to be above par."
good,"Verizon offers great compensation and benefits but has very stressful and difficult goals to achieve"
good,This company needs to better work ethics. Management doesnt have it all together. needs better operational organization. Chain of command needs reconstruction
good,It was very social environment and friendlu coworker but very demanding as far as quotas are concerned. It was more of a life style rather than a job you were involved almost 24/7 and traveled a minimum of once a month
good,"Work life balance is ok, however there are weeks where work life overtakes the balance.  Salary is satisfactory and overall benefits packages are good.  Little opportunity for advancement."
good,"I have spent 20 wonderful years at VZ and am grateful.  I have met amazing people, I have grown professionally and value every experience.  Looking for an opportunity to display my work ethic and be rewarded."
good,"I have worked here for 18 years and have worked in several different roles, learning many different aspects of the job and developing life long friendships."
good,"You'll have a chance to start a career and make a living for yourself."
good,Verizon provides room for advancement to management levels by promoting from within. Verizon provides very good benefits and pay while also providing training.
good,Not always sure that your efforts and contributions ensure that your job is secure.  The effort that is put in is not always recognized or rewarded for a job well done.
good,"Back to back meetings with often double or triple booked times.   A lot of wasted time on powerpoints."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Verizon Wireless. I worked at a corporate store and met many great co-workers and great leaders that taught me a lot about sales and customer service. I learned all about team-selling and digging deep into customers needs. I would spend pretty much the entire day on the sales floor welcoming guests in and helping find solutions to their needs wether it was simply troubleshooting their devices, or finding new products and services that helped them accomplish their goal. The best part of my job other than the very competitive pay that we had, was the benefits. We had great tuition assistance programs, great discounts on our cellular service and great discounts for entertainment."
good,I liked working for Verizon wireless for the 21 years but I think that layoff good workers wasn't fair.  Management should communicate better with workers.
good,"The culture of the corporate headquarters tries to be cool and relaxed, but they still expect you to work far longer than advertised, giving up nights and weekends and never far from your email account."
good,I enjoyed working with the people had contact with. It was a very challenging job and the problems were constantly changing. I was in charge of monitoring the old existing network and working with the techs who were replacing the old equipment with new equipment.
good,scope of learning is high.Management was good.Not very good at work life balance.Attarctive workplace culture.Most enjoyable part of the job is gaining knowledge everyday
good,"A huge loss of focus on employee experience, too much focus on share holders. Several smaller companies offer employees free meals, fitness and health benefits, ei classes, programs. Structured classes on promotion, retirement , and employee development training."
good,On your feet all day selling cell phones and other accessories. Fun job. All the employees were fun to be around and worked hard. The hardest part of the job was trying to reach a good quota for a commission.
good,"Install Fios services for residential and business customers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Flexible ours dependent upon your managers decision. Learned that such a large complex organizational structure can be inefficient when it comes to executing in a dynamic market place.
good,decent if you're single and don't mind retail hours. Longer hours during the holidays and high pressure to hit quota's. Good benefits and ability to make decent money.
good,"When I worked as Solutions Specialist I had a great General Manager that was very informative and motivational. He wanted his team to do well. However, when I switched to B2B Sales, there was not a lot of room for growth and a healthy work environment thanks to Management. I was not judged based upon my results or my ability to do the job, I was judged based upon the ""cliques"" that I was (was not) apart of. Very political. If they don't like you as a person you will be out of there. Choose your manager and position in the company wisely."
good,the company expects a great deal of energy time and performance.  and in my opinion the pay no longer matches at an incentive. especially since they are said to be the cream of the crop company in the wireless industry and being the most profitable. the company now tends too consume ones life.
good,"There's no time between calls, dealing with demanding customers and being cross-trained in multiple areas outside of your position.  You also must do well in selling products."
good,"Verizon was a fun job, overall. Without thinking about the stressful clients that were always mad, it wasn't too awful. The people who worked there made it that much better. There were plenty of opportunities for advancement as well as schooling. I am not to fond of sitting for 8 hours a day and the minimum number of calls you're supposed to take is a little unrealistic when you can't always control the old person who calls and takes an hour to figure out what you're trying to have them do. Also, if you have any sort of life or family, do NOT work here. The hours are awful and the seniority takes over."
good,It is a large and complex organization with leaders moving in many different directions. It is sometimes difficult to navigate the political landscape and constant riffs.
good,Enjoyed the F2F interaction with peers and customers. Environment was low stress but metrics was driven everyday. It's all about sales here. Can get dull pushing something that many didn't value.
good,At verizon wireless I worked in different areas of the company. I wanted most of the time in customer service. There were many different schedule options. eb
good,Fun Job the area I was in was very strange. If you could land a job in a big markets is a great career. Retail hours are not fun to work but the job could be fun. Great benefits
good,"A typical work day would consist of helping clients with technical support, paying their bills,answering any question they may have, and teaching them about self serve options so that they will not have to call in if they don't want to."
good,"Verizon Wireless has great Cell Phone service that is the only plus I give the Company. They had a cafeteria, but it was cheaper to go out to get some food. The Management team is a bit lacking, as far as connecting with their employees. Job advancement is also impossible I was told when I first started that I had to get to know all of the Lead Managers of different department to be able to apply for a position in that department that it was not based on my past experience ""but who you knew"".  Verizon Wireless sets expectations per your Metrics that you have to keep at a performing level. Which is attainable.  But when changing the systems, with no introduction or training before hand, you can't meet the Metrics that they set forth, because you cannot navigate a new system without the training.  Which leaves you frustrated. Also Verizon contracts out of 3rd party call centers which leaves the Customer in the lurch because most times they have been lied to.  It also happens on the Verizon Wireless actual employees but it is rare.  There is no Channel of filing a grievance or complaint against that Rep who lied to the Customer, so no accountability,  Sometimes I would say I don't think the Company really cares. ."
good,"Verizon is okay, They Pay well and they do promote from within, but with any company in order to move up you have to politic. Verizon also has terrible work Life Balance."
good,I appreciated my time while at Verizon. The company at one time had a lot to offer. If you worked hard you were recognized for it. The tough truth that has affected employees at Verizon is the endless layoffs and call center closures.
good,"A lot has changed for management employees.  It can get to feel like you work hard but don't see or get the recognition you merit. Some get away with doing very little to nothing. Overall if you do what they ask you are ok.  Its best to get on upper managements good side and not make trouble.  "
good,"The Only good thing is the benefits and pay. The a job shouldn't become over whelming to the point a person is depressed. Management say they care and support as much as they can, Actions speak louder then words."
good,Verizon Wireless is a clean work environment with very productive rules and regulations.  It is hard to advance but job security is pretty well placed. It is a good starting point for a career.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Good company to work for their are just a few things on the management side that need to be fixed. Product needs some work and to be more reliable and treat customers fairly.
good,"The job was stressful and sometimes the quotas were very hard to meet. The work schedule was not great, but the benefits and compensation were competitive. Management was good, depending on who your supervisor was. I was moved to a different team with a different supervisor 3 times during my two years with the company. They offered tuition assistance, and even had the college on site. The training for the job was great and very helpful."
good,Verizon was a great place to work. As time went on and with the ongoing pressure for the company to become profitable every quarter it trickled down to the front line employee forcing heavier work load. Hence changing the culture that was once revered
good,"Verizon has decent compensation, but has excellent benefits.  I joined ""Big Red"" in 2013, but thing are wildly different today.  During my new hire training, the emphasis was put on customer experience and ""setting up for success"" when a customer would purchase a new device.  Now, the customer buys a phone, which is left in the box, and gets a ""slap on the butt"" to get them out the door.  Verizon has little to no loyalty to its employees anymore, which is a shame considering the culture they were building just five short years ago."
good,"Unfortunately moving from customer to service, despite tenure with the company, it didn't matter when they came to offering salary for a sales position."
good,Good Understanding of work life balance.The job roles are not well managed responsibilities are in chaos and different groups do not work harmoniously
good,"Everything was great until the layoffs came. The employees at Verizon create the positive culture. In the end, Verizon is a major corporation with shareholders. Shareholders will always have the final say."
good,Customer care call center is an extremely difficult position. Initial training did not really prepare you for the degree of difficulty. There is floor support but it still requires a very thick skin for the sometimes abusive customer calls you receive.
good,Paid decent. No work life balance. Very little opportunity to advance higher within the company. Quotas seem to change regularly. Technology is always changing and very fun.
good,"Verizon can be a very challenging environment.  Currently there is a great lack of decision making about the future of the company, so there is a great deal of stress about what the company will be, how it will operate going forward."
good,"I was able to assist in the redevelopment of materials, develop my skills and others in training and attend paid ATD conferences. My former management encouraged me to learn new skills."
good,"Excellent benefits, "
good,"Process oriented workplace.  Great place to work and gain experience in corporate culture, as well as sales processes.  Management very supportive of employees."
good,While I enjoyed working at VZW the stress was constant and the push for sales were overwhelming.  I was a sucessful store manager that rose up through the ranks within the company.
good,"Great place to work. People are great. Benefits are top of the line. Only issue is with technology advancements, computers and software are taking over jobs once done by individuals. Cuts to staff have occurred and potential advancement has been very limited."
good,"There are a lot of great people that I worked with but they were like me, workers. Unfortunately, in the corporate world, it's the bottom line that counts more than people. Too often upper management decided to make changes that on the surface sounded good, but turned out disastrous and like always, it was the people (the workers) that ended up paying for it, in layoffs."
good,"Great benefits - heavy on the management."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Typical day varied based on day of week. Weekends were the busiest and customers would come in much more frequent that we would have lines out the door. If you are calm and can manage such work styles then it is fine but if not, its not for you."
good,If working for a indirect agent its very difficult to have success due to poor management customers can legit seek out if your real or if your not the corporate location.
good,Working at Verizon was stressful you get paid according to how many orders you put through and sometimes the order that you put through if they're not accepted by the customer you don't get paid
good,quick paced for the young to learn good work ethics
good,"It was a stressful place to work. The money was good but there was always a lot of pressure to sell. When I didn't sell enough of one item, I had a manager tell me to just put stuff in customer's bags and ring it up without telling them. I left soon after."
good,"Open priced selling environment on all phones and accessories, lots of freedom with this employer. However this model creates alot of opportunity for employees to take advantage of customers, which was often the case and a major reason for my departure from this company."
good,"no comment, I do not wish to review this company I made a change of career to mental health and left Verizon to pursue that career.  I am pleased with the educational benefits"
good,"Very cut-throat sales environment ,and unless you are tight with the manager at your location or unless you are equally cut-throat, you will NOT do well.  Management needs to learn about inclusion and maturity - general management needs to learn how to manage appropriately without being chummy with associates, if unable to separate work from personal lives."
good,good place to work they show a lot of agent appreciation. The job is a bit stressful but it will fine tune you customer service skills. nice location.
good,"Managers are very much dumb founded and are not suitable for the title they hold. The work environment can be very stressful at times given that different department oversee different things but collaborating with folks that are dispersed can be very challenging due to the organization adopting to wrong form of tools. And, most employees are oblivious to the amount of work desired and the output level suffers at the end of release cycles."
good,Best company to learn new technology. Fun place to work. Flexible timing. Managers are more friendly. Usually day starts from 11:30am for most of the people.
good,Paid well and great benefits and retirement........Stressful there were some great managers but some who were seeking ego over employee engagement.....
good,"The benefits are great. Culture is a shock, it has the atmosphere of a highschool. Knowledge is not valued, the only important thing is if you can sell."
good,The boss there are cool. Other empolyees there are helpful.  The leads giving to you aren't the best. Also the training for the b2b position isn't the best.
good,"A Good Company, Good Culture, Managed Work Life Balance.Process Oriented, Employee Friendly most of the times. Need to stretch working hours(60%) and late night work for production releases, Managed because of the manager(is good)."
good,Stressfull quota hard to obtain customer service is never done all about sale good training management good coworkers very competitive lots of pto but can never take
good,The company has lots of great benefits and can be awesome to work for however it can also lead to issues where it seems as though you are working as just one in thousands.
good,"Dynamic company.  Extremely heavy workload, often times on very tight deadlines. Good compensation and benefits package to match high demands. Smart, diverse employees."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon was cut throat in that you had to hit specific goals every month which isn't unusual.  What's tough is how corporate makes in extremely difficult to hit these goals when they contradict their goals with near impossible with policies that made you compete against online sales etc.
good,"Verizon benefits are top tier.  Compared to other companies, verizon offers a competitive salary with great benefits such as a 401k plan, with company match, health benefits, pension and more"
good,Verizon is a very typical large corporation. Projects seem to be high priority need it today and then corporate changes the priorities and the deadlines slip. Decision-making comes from different tiers of the corporate ladders and trickles down to the day-to-day production.
good,Once we reached over goals for month. My team and i go for the dinner every month and i paid for them. When we all get off we played soccer together. In over lunch time play snooker.
good,"Verizon Wireless is a business spinning its wheels and going into debt.  The struggle in the company, which is understandable, is which way the company will toward.  Will it try to be like a Google, which sells ad space and online services, or will it simply be an internet backbone to its customers.  When Verizon figures that out, it may be back to higher profit margins."
good,The job pays an amazing salary but can be vey difficult to take those calls back to back. There's are many opportunities to move up but the requirements weren't really attainable.
good,"great in the early days, not so great anymore"
good,"Verizon Wireless offered a lot of overtime and gave lots of incentives to customers.  Stats are a big deal at Verizon Wireless and can dictate your raises, bonus amounts, and your schedule when it is time to pick your shift.  Not a good place to work if you are a college student because they will not work with your schedule. Frontline Management could use a lot of training on following H.R. rules, supporting their team, and treating every employee fairly. Customer Surveys impact your stats which impacts your raise, bonuses, and stats which makes the job much more stressful then it should be."
good,High Volume call center. Will not get the same answers when asking multiple managers the same questions/approvals. Inconsistent and/or unnecessary micro-manage style coaching. I had great managers and I had terrible managers. Favoritism is prominent. Lack of advancement from certain departments even though you qualify. Training however is top notch. Benefits are fantastic and paid time off is accumulated quickly. You are rewarded well financially for performance.  Opportunity is there but very competitive. Upper management was passive at times. Open door policy was not kept in confidence. Employee morale was consistently poor as a result of the aforementioned reasons.
good,At first I enjoyed my experience with Verizon but over time became increasingly stressed over the way certain parts of the company were handled.  Deep down sales is not something I would like to pursue but I'm hoping that my experience in the wireless world and previous positions with other companies can help me move on to a position at a company that is less stressful.
good,"When the company became Verizon everything changed, it went from a company to where you were an employee to a company where you are just a number, the company was ""Ok"" but not the same, then in 2016 Verizon started buying companies for no clear reason, upper management had and has no clue, T-Mobile had them on the run, OT was cut to Zero (0) Moral was dropping and lay-offs became more frequent."
good,Days were extremely busy. Incoming customer resolution issues. 80 to 100 incoming calls daily. Handled entire footprint for verizon land line service problems. Met or exceeded required time limits and productive dispatches. Always met or exceeded customer satisfaction reviews. All calls are monitored for training purposes.
good,"Talk to customer's all day with multiple issues, from billing to technical support. Retention practices to save customers. Essential employee. Always being micro-managed to ensure the best practices. Hardest part was when you were on the phone for a long period of time until your first break (2-3 hours). Sales driven company.`"
good,I worked overnights which was quite difficult to manage that with real life responsibilities. The team I had was great and for the most part the other regions worked well with my team
good,"It was stressful. Lack of work life balance. Long hours and no flexibility when holiday time comes. Depending on your manager, no development. I would have stayed if my last manager was not inadequate to be in her role."
good,I have not worked at Verizon since 2009. I do not know what the current work environment is or like. They sold all of their operations in Florida to Frontier Communications.
good,Things are constantly changing. If you don't know something ask and you'll receive an answer. Good money to be made but you're tied to the retail work hours especially during the holidays.
good,Compensation is excellent when you work hard to meet sales quota. Management team is encouraging and help you meet your quota. Culture is great at the store level.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Working at Verizon used to be a fun place to work and you could make a lot of money. The last year everything has changed and not for the better. Higher un obtainable quotas, new sales styles and programs from upper levels make it more difficult to make money. Showing up to work now leaves me filled with anxiety and a feeling of no job security. All the while being micromanaged by stressed out managers. What used to be an awesome career I thought would last until retirement, now resembles high school detention. Actions speak louder than words and Verizon dosen't care about their Sales people anymore. SAD!"
good,"Verizon is a great company if you are passionate about sales and take the initiative.The sales goes are very ambitious and limits team selling, however, if you can focus on learning and positioning  products and services, you will be great."
good,"Typical sales job. Make daily and monthly goals to make a commission check.  To move up with the company you have to have a good sales record. Depending on the store, quotas are a bit extreme causing reps to work bell to bell and come in on their days off just make a pay check."
good,"Very interesting work, learning opportunities and good work culture with trustworthy employees.  Great benefits along with different technologies to get into."
good,"A lot of work for low pay relative to two years ago. Used to make strong effort for 4000+ commissions. Now, very hard work and effort makes a 2000 commission"
good,"Reviewing calendar of the day, meeting with my VP to discuss whatever is needed for the day... review emails, respond to inquiries, answer customer calls, prepare for meetings as necessary (presentations, catering, etc)"
good,more duties is added everyday and for the same salary. not family oriented. even though great benefits.lack of growth and advancement. great training.
good,"Overall I loved the job.  I loved the benefits and some of the business travel opportunities I got.  The people I worked with were great, yet under appreciated.  Upper management started to reduce the amount of employees with tenure do to the amount of pay and time off they had.  However, these were the most reliable and successful employees."
good,Company was great learned a lot and Verizon paid for my school getting my Bachlors degree. Wish things went differently but not with Company anymore due to mass layoffs
good,"Helping customers,fixing phones, hardest is learning different plans daily. Hard the move up in position, was a sale  representative for four years and never got the chance to become more"
good,The company had a pretty decent reputation for treating their employees well. Highly competive business with rivals and within itself. It did have a decenct support staff and they made an effort to make each satellite office comfortable for the employees
good,"Verizon was a great place for compensation, and could be a great place to work overall, except there were breakdowns at the management level.  If you were fortunate to work for a good manager you had the opportunity to be successful."
good,"Verizon was a great place for compensation, and could be a great place to work overall, except there were breakdowns at the management level.  If you were fortunate to work for a good manager you had the opportunity to be successful."
good,extremely stressful due to the sales portion this is an atmosphere where members would call in upset and we were expected to turn the member around and offer services and the quota expectations
good,The call enter is very structured but the day goes by quickly since there is so much to do. There is a lot of favoritism from management when it comes to promotion and development. The best part of the job is the relationships you create with employees.
good,I left because I simply could not sit in a cubicle all day which felt like prison.  The company is strong and had good incentives and prizes for sales people.
good,It's a good company. Tough to use benefits if you work in the retail environment (time off with black out days and open 7 days a week) I have worked there for several years and I seems that they are moving in a stock holder first employees a distant second direction.
good,"Very stressful workplace. No help from the management team or from the union. Although the pay was great, you had minimal family life as they made you work 6 days a week."
good,"I completed daily reporting, inventory and assisted on the sales floor"
good,"I wore many hats which was great because the work was never boring. Each day was different. That was one of the things that I loved about working there."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I love the money but i had absolutely no life. This company does not care about the moral of its employees. You are expendable and they make sure you know it. They push quota at you to the point where it is stressful and you have no work life balance. It was the best money I've ever made in my life but never had time to enjoy it. All I did was pay bills and neglect my family. Great job for the workaholic with no life. The money and benefits were amazing.
good,The specific Verizon I worked at was full of nice people. It had a healthy level of competition. I have nothing bad to say about my time there with my interactions with coworkers. I felt like I was somewhat hindered to do my job because of the old computers and tablets. I just think they should invest more in the location so it seemed more professional.
good,"Good company to work for depending on your district.  DM did not really like to promote from within district.  Work life balance was non existent, but that's retail for you.  Company changed quota structure when I was there and it seemed it was unobtainable.  Push the products that the company really wants you to push whether customers want them or not."
good,"Everyday was different. Communication was not always clear. there was no work/life balance. The benefits were really good. Medical, Dental, Vision and life ins."
good,17 years at Verizon was good. It is such a big corporation that it really matters who your manager is. I was asked to relocate twice before looking for a new job.
good,"Began career with Verizon at merger to create Verizon Wireless. Atmosphere was fast paced, exciting, energetic and supportive. As the company grew from a new entity to its current Fortune 15 status, management culture and environmental changes have morphed to a factory like setting.  Attitudes toward dedicated team members with product ideas, management efficiency suggestions, professional growth are dismissed. The new culture encourages  a young, new to market, Google/Facebook atmosphere and demographic.  Think tank settings are being erected, staff evolution is much slower.  Creativity is nearly absent since :can you hear me now"" campaign at Verizon Wireless' inception 17 years ago."
good,"On a daily basis you encounter people of all technological abilities. In this field you are also expected to take every possible step to ensure that there is no learning curve for advanced devices, and always get content moved despite it not being your responsibility. Management drives numbers, not culture. Coaching is inconsistent and often unhelpful, leading to a lack of growth within the associate. "
good,"the pay wasn't the best, but it was a good place to get into sales. some of the goals were very unrealistic and the commission pay scale kept going down"
good,"Overall good company to work for.  Management is currently lacking in my dept. I love the tuition assistance as I am pursuing my degree. "
good,"o	Analyzed and implemented solutions to advance overall strategy of company growth"
good,"Enjoyed working at MCI. I wish I never was laid off when Verizon took over. I loved my job at MCI. We worked as a team.  Everyone was helpful,  nice,  and respectful."
good,"Great company to work for if you love technology, and you can deal with the ever changing red tape and politics of corporate America. This is one company that really should have always been union at its conception. A lot of great people lost their jobs because of it."
good,Verizon would be a great place to work for if the upper managers would not micro-manage then change their mind mid-stream. Director level needs more value added work related projects rather than to micro-mange the day-to-day inter-workings of the union associate.
good,Verizon Terremark was a great place to begin work in the IT operations industry. Introduction to ticketing systems for work reporting and data center environments help with transitions into a more technical position.
good,I was able to get a good nine years of experience before I was laid off.  The work environment was fun and hard working at the same time. l enjoyed my time there and look forward to fresh start at a new company.
good,"Company has a great culture and excellent benefits. pay is very well however with ever rising quotas and market saturation in products it makes it harder to earn a higher commission check, growing your overall annual salary."
good,"Some managers and supervisors are unprofessional.  Not much room for advancement, even though they say there is. Work ethics are not universal.  Too much pressure to perform."
good,Company pays incredibly well with a generous benefits package.  Wireless climate is stressful due to poor upper management and no work/life balance despite promoting such.  Company has been downsizing employees drastically in the last year due to decreased profits and the need to cut operational cost.  Not a bad place to work as far as retail goes but holds little job security at this point in time.
good,"While a good place to work, there was no real way to advance in the division I was in which was security testing with the division I was in"
good,Good place to work at. Very high turnover rate. Was only given two days to make an unreasonable amount of sales. Manager of the store was great. District manager knew nothing about what he was doing. Hired people under qualified. Fired people who were good at their job and knew what they were doing.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"highly stressful job, extreme number chaser, closed building down after being there for over 17 years, very rude customers that managers did not support"
good,"A typical day was calendaring meetings, emailing, helping support the project team leads. The hardest part of the job was a micro-managing supervisor; the most enjoyable part was working with the team lead."
good,"my manager in particular had her little clique she liked and would give them the easier jobs and a lot of time off the board.Especially doing jobs odd jobs. But, the company overall was a good compny to work for especially in retirement. EXCELLENT"
good,Verizon is a good company with excellent benefits. Being relocatable is beneficial to move up. High turnover so sometimes work long hours for store coverage. Need to able to adapt to change
good,Times have changed alot in the past 10 years in the wireless industry. Verizon has great benefits and that is why most of us stay. Pay is good. Your store can be like a family and I am still friends with people who have left the company. The industry changed so much where 10 years ago you sold a phone for $50 on a 2 yr contract to now spending $850 on a no contract unlimited data etc etc....then on top of it selling expensive accessories and pushing HUM and Tablet sales.
good,It has a good technical environment where one can learn and implement good ideas. Its been a challenging and good experience so far.It will be a great platform for new technologies to learn over there.
good,"The benefits are great and the pay is good.  The job is stressful and people are not fun to deal with when they are mad, which is 0% of the time.  Dealing with the public is the biggest issue."
good,"Depending on your position, you may love your life or you may want to slit your wrists. Pay and vacation are very good. Again, if you're in a care or collection position, you may take full advantage of the health benefits package visiting a mental health specialist weekly. So it's more of a monetary compensation for driving you crazy in some circumstances. Not all are bad. There are good positions where you can be happy. If you are lucky enough to find that position, keep it."
good,"I enjoyed working for Verizon. I was among some very intelligent people working in an environment that was inclusive, gave plenty of opportunities to learn new things, and the coffee downstairs was very good. "
good,"Benefits can be made much more attractive. Good place to work and learn. Challenging projects with avenues to learn and grow."
good,"If you are the type of employee that works hard and keeps to themselves, you can work at Verizon. But if shady management, favoritism and repetition is deal breaker, then do not apply. Verizon is filled with corruption. A good check comes with a whole heap of headaches."
good,"Do not work here if you have a family and both spouses work.  The only way this can work is if you have a stay at home spouse.  The job overall is a great place to work.  If you do not like being micro-managed, thin-skinned, or not aggressive with sales this is not the place for you.  Customers can be super brutal to us here.  Most be able to manage time wisely and perform to meet sales quotas and individual/store metrics.  If you do not, you will be miserable. Get good paid time off, but work life balance hours are awful. If you okay with working nights, weekends, and holidays then you will be okay."
good,great job but you will have no life. you work long days and hrs but the pay is great if you are willing to  bust your tail. easiest money of my life but the stress is there also.
good,I had a great career at Verizon until I was unexpectedly laid off.  The company is going through a lot of changes and not necessarily beneficial to it's employees!
good,"putting out fires mostly, plenty of management and direction change."
good,"Working for Verizon was good. The hours were regular retail hours, work some days, work some nights. Compensation could have been better for the demand of work we got. Job security was not good, there was a high turnover rate."
good,"Individual contributor sales role responsible for prospecting, funnel management, and sales. SMB specialists will be responsible for coordination of leads between the Retail and B2B channel. SMB Specialists will support a minimum of 3 stores. This position will support sales both in store locations and customer premise. They will outbound prospect and be available to prospect door to door. They will manage the SMB funnel of multiple store locations and coordinate with the business channel on any handoffs per the rules of engagement."
good,"It was a nice company as far as perks, constant change and new information to always learn and to give to customers.  Long hours and bonus pay for working on holidays."
good,"While the compensation was incredible, the issues that came into play because of poor management and bad communication of actual expectations overshadowed a lot of the good that could have been. Verizon as a company says it prides itself on its ethical standards for selling and customer interaction, and while upheld a lot of the time, when it comes down to the final days of the month, management seemingly does not care about what the customers accounts will look like after closing any sale. They just want every sale closed at any cost."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Since the change to Frontier, the company became less attractive.  Still good for pay and benefits, but less stable and balanced. The people are great to work with."
good,The friendly organization where u have good work life balance. It provides opportunities to explore new technologies and incorporate in the existing projects
good,Work is very mundane and redundant.  The position I am in is typically responsible for tasks that should be handled by individuals with no experience. Management fails to properly communicate strategic objectives and fails to reward successful individuals with adequate compensation.  Too much bureaucracy makes the company slow and unable to adapt as quickly as it needs to.
good,"Salary & Benefits are excellent... Constantly changing & evolving policies, plans, promotions, ideals, etc. to stay current in technology trends throughout the market."
good,"Upper Management is really out of touch with their customers. The front line workers web support, customer service, and technical staff were closer to the customers and their problems. Many times hourly workers felt Upper Management ignored their suggestions."
good,"call center jobs are easy to do once you have a grasp of the system but dealing with rude, incompetent, and aggressive customers is a drain on anyone's mental health."
good,"Lots of great people to work with, but a certain personality is needed to enjoy the work. Competitive atmosphere & constant talking on the phone. Shifts change every six months, while your numbers & time with company determine how well you do in a shift bid. Pay, bonuses, & benefits are very good. Training is exceptional. Management is generally good. They have an employee appreciation week every year with promos & bennies. Facility is impressive with on-site gym and cafeteria plus other things. Work/life balance is difficult to achieve if you don't thrive on this type of work. It's a great place to work if you enjoy talking on the phone for most of your shift & appreciate a competitive attitude."
good,Compensation is great. Culture is good. Have to know the right people to advance. Offers excellent education reimbursement. Micromanaged at times. Great benefits. Can have good work life balance Job security may not be the greatest with divestitures and mergers.
good,"Verizon has an energetic culture. Overall, it is a good company to work for. The health care provided is top notch and the 401K benefits are fantastic. "
good,Verizon had great benefits and salary was great.  The work/life balance was great with vacation time but schedules weren't good.  The culture was worse as time went on and meeting the demands of customers vs. company metrics were difficult.
good,"The actual job was great. I enjoyed helping customers. Verizon offers good benefits. The only complaints i would have is their PTO (paid time off policy), and non PTO. The company gives you 5 paid sick days per calendar year. If you get the flu or get sick more than once a year be prepared to work with a fever or whatever virus you have. The management is not compassionate at ALL. You will get fired for being literally ONE second late."
good,Great place to learn sales and customer service skills.  There are opportunities to grow and the training courses are very good.  Will pay for your education.
good,"Management was always great to work with and supportive.  Would learn something need everyday whether it was from guests or co-workers. Everyday was a new adventure, every guest that came in was different than the last.  This job is doable as long as you are a people-person.  Verizon is a good company to work for, but doesn't have a set schedule.  Pay is great as well as the benefits!  Scheduling is becomes frustrating if you have a family."
good,Some have you need to complete the work. There was no training for new technologies. Compensation is fair. Could able to pick up many different job related experiences.
good,Verizon is a very large international company with multiple layers of management.  It could be very challenging to complete simple tasks when communication was required with other departments.  However  Verizon encourages employees to continue their education and has a terrific program to assist employees with their education/training goals.
good,Laid back but numbers driven retail hours and holiday season are not fun but the pay with base / commission and benefits make it worth it if your okay with spending more time with your co-workers then loved ones
good,"During my time, there were a lot of unrealistic expectations for someone who has never worked in a commission based sales environment. While still learning the ropes, I have been talked down to, pressured, guilted, indirectly threatened for not meeting my numbers. Phrases such as ""i don't make money, when you don't make money and I have a lot of bills to pay"". Also, management expected their employees to drop everything on their days off to make it to a last-minute meeting. There was also lack of communication, which was extremely frustrating. Also, inconsistency in what we should or shouldn't be telling our customers. I am all about customer service and doing all I can to make sure the customer is satisfied and happy, management don't like to make much of an effort to satisfy their customers....yet they pressure their employees to make sure their customers give them a 10/10. The worst of all is that Verizon takes 40% of your commission."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,A typical day as a Verizon FiOS employee consists of visiting several new and existing FiOS customers and creating a strategy to implement the fiber service/equipment into their home or business. The management team is heavily involved in the day-to-day activities and every moment of your time on the job is a metric which is accounted for daily. There are many hours of training and coaching sessions involved while working here.
good,You will have the ability to be cross trained in multiple areas and put your skills to use. Days will usually be fairly busy.Little to no downtime. Ability to travel
good,"Title tells all. I'm on 3 medicines because of this job. The pay is great and the benefits are AWESOME but some of the supervisors have a problem with favouritism. They will treat some of their employees like gold while micromanaging every one else. All calls are monitored and recorded and scored. You're expected to collect on every single call and ask for money same day multiple times in the call which only angers the customer even more turning your call into a 10 minute call trying to calm them down. "
good,"I have seen multiple layoffs every year I worked for this company. The only jobs that have any security are commissioned jobs and that isn't even guaranteed. There are constant restructuring of the company which means jobs become liquidated. The pay is incredible, especially the sales representatives. I don't know any where else where someone straight into a job with no education or previous experience can make between $50,000 and $100,000. But after the sales rep position your job is never dependable."
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for. It helped me through tough times. even though it has its issues of changing too quickly, working there as a nice experience."
good,"Was able to advance my sales and customer service skills through the 3 years that I was at Verizon. Loved the fast pace environment, however the work life balance was not there. Many weeks you would work 6-7 days for long hours."
good,"Worried about direction of retails operations, This has been an outstanding experience, is a great company to work for, just not sure where it's headed."
good,Working at Verizon made me familiar with the ins and outs of cell IT support. The only issue I found was the marketing of data to customers. ..................................................................
good,"Great company but, has a lot of individuals in positions of leadership that really should not be. The job is great with working to ensure you work and family life remains balanced."
good,"GTE was a very good place to work. Job security and a good wage. As the culture changed (Verizon)with new management, it was no longer family oriented. Sales was the name of the game and sometimes that was hard. To advance in the company, it was who you knew."
good,"The hardest part of the job is that it is sedimentary so you need to make sure you take your breaks and lunch to exercise."
good,"A customer-oriented culture demanding results, quick turnaround and proactive problem resolution as a public utility and a leader in the telecommunications marketplace."
good,"I am a contractor, therefore don't have much to say."
good,the work was demanding but rewarding.  worked with people from all different backgrounds.  and people were willing to help each other out.
good,Verizon is a good company to work for. There's always room for advancement.Sometimes they are willing to work with you & your schedule. My job was fun
good,The day to day work of ordering CPE for businesses was acceptable as far as work conditions. Too many systems were involved in making it a smooth operation. Lack of understanding from upper management as to how certain departments worked together led to poor decisions regarding company structure.
good,Organization and diligence is key to success. You must be flexible with what hours you are available to work. You may not always work same location. Good work environment.
good,"Good company with a lot of potential."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good benefits and salaries but I would not say it is a ""fun"" place to work. Co-workers are great. Job security is not great. Company direction changes hourly."
good,Verizon sales is very high pressure with very little work life balance.  Benefits and pay are very good but opportunity for advancement is limited mostly to sales employees who are in good with the managers.
good,The company as a whole is solid but in my particular office the management team is fairly apathetic and make a lot of promises they don't keep. Compensation and benefits package are fair and the culture is terrific.
good,"Needs more work/life balance, they give you an amount of hours you can use anytime which is cool, just don't go over them or else you'll get written up"
good,There is a lot of pressure to produce numbers. You are expected to complete several metrics each month or it will affect your paycheck. You take care of customers on a continuous basis as well as make cold calls to businesses.
good,"It's all moving to wireless and I was regular Wireline telecom.  Enough said."
good,"good company to work for, good pay and benefits--- but beware --tenured employees  -- layoffs occur frequently --  although they give a compensation package - nothing is worth loosing your retirement benefits."
good,Competitive sales in the wireless industry and leading top company to work for. Great work/life balance and wonderful benefits. Must be energized by change and unafraid to set set personal sales goals.Demanding schedule.
good,"I would have like more opportunity for job growth. I would have like to have been able to advance in the company.  I found it very limiting. However, it was a great job that supported my family for 20 years."
good,"Verizon was a great place, I loved helping customers as well as learning the tech at the same time. I just hope Verizons commission pay standards have gotten better than they were."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced , I've learned patience , and how to better people skills. My co workers  are awesome , and we work as a team and help each other  out . Not all management were always on the same page and it became some what unorganized at times . The hardest part was learning how to deal with escalated  customers . The most enjoyable art  were the people here and  incentives  to show appreciation for the employees."
good,"My position at Verizon was very enjoyable during daily tours. I interacted with many different customers, working in their business or homes. Co-workers and management were awesome   I learned a lot but unfortunately the bad part about the job was the uncertainty of job security. This inevitably led to my departure."
good,"My typical day at Verizon was filled with different tasks ranging from database maintenance to rush projects. I learned many things including project management, database administration, and how to communicate effectively. Management was OK depending on who you had, some really cared about performance of their team and their development while others only cared about what could be done for them. The co-workers for the most part were great. The hardest part of the job was working for managers who didn't care about my development or didn't tell the truth about their actions. The most enjoyable part was the majority of the people I worked with there."
good,"The management and everyone is willing to work with you and teach you, they allow you to work with as many different departments to get the most out of your experience."
good,Overall good company to work for but will keep extra jobs in the back pocket started a year ago and they are already getting rid of my position
good,"Although the job itself is decent, there is little to no work life balance. Having such a chaotic schedule makes it hard to have plans. Also positions are eliminated frequently so job security is a concern."
good,"Depending on your job or unit a typical day in the army could be waking up for PT formation conducting PT then showering and back to battalion formation after that you go to work until 5, or you could sham out and stay sleep allay."
good,"- Se labora de lunes a viernes desde las 08:30 am hasta las 06:00 pm con una hora de refrigerio."
good,"Typical day of work consists of assisting customers with solutions. You learn what it takes to become a good sales rep"
good,Working at Asurion wasn't hard work but it was a very competitve environment. I like the job but I didn't like how competitive the management and system was.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"	Responsible for taking orders from internal and external clients, verifying all order accuracy, and following up with these clients to ensure product was installed successfully."
good,"Executive leadership has decided to move away from Wireline and focus on Wireless, specifically pushing content to monetize ad revenue.  Mature industry for Wireline means low margins, pressures on revenue, and threat of layoffs every quarter.  Maturing industry for wireless means pressures on margins and revenue.  Layoffs are not as routine as in Wireline.  Wireless is still a good place to work.  Stay away or run from Wireline."
good,"Company has good benefits. Job is lousy, management doesn't stick up for you. Customers treat you like garbage, management doesn't support."
good,"Verizon has grown from its not-so-humble beginnings as a conglomeration of landline, European and start-up telecommunications companies to the U.S. mega company it is today. In the earlier years, there was much room for advancement and innovation"
good,"The only bad things i could say about my time at Verizon wireless was my stores location, everything else about the job was fine even the possible late hours. my management team was friendly and by the books and things were mostly streamlined"
good,Training was long and didn't apply to our work group as management consultants.  Co-workers created a very good team environment and helped customer service reps on business accounts
good,Great company to work for if compensation is your primary goal. Company is very fast paced and change is something you must embrace.
good,"* call center environment"
good,"This company is not for everybody. If you don't like rules or have a strong backbone, don't come here. The money and benefits are great, but they come at a price."
good,"Working with multiple people and different departments was able to see multiple aspects of the location and its infrastructure. "
good,"layoffs every quarter and company does not backfill positions, although compensation and benefits package are wonderful"
good,"Verizon is focused on the wireless side of the business.  This is a more profitable but less strategic offering.  The cloud, security, and MPLS networks are being sold off.  Culture has eroded over the last decade.  Not innovative."
good,"Corporate culture has done a complete 180 from when company was Bell Atlantic. Greed has taken over where concern about customers and product were once the top priority. No longer do I say ""I work for Verizon"" with the pride I once did due to people's consistent comments revolving around the company's poor service and expensive products"
good,"The company credo states they are agile and able to minimize bureaucracy; however this is completely inaccurate.  "
good,"The experience I've received from working at Verizon Wireless is truly worth while. My co-workers are friendly and very supportive, we help each other Supervisors and management are approachable."
good,Most of the Engineering is done from offshore so one has to be prepared working night and days with the offshore team. It was not easy to work with offshore as their management was not being so flexible and dedicated to the onsite team.
good,The high employee overturn is the main sign of the company work life balance not being adequate. Great benefits though.
good,I worked as a contractor so cannot comment on benefits etc.  However it is very good company to work for.  I learned a lot through co-workers.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The pay is great & so are the benefits but make sure you are selling what your supervisors what you to sell, not so much what the customers what to purchase"
good,Verizon pays its employees very well. Benefits are great including annual bonuses and big raises for performance. The problem is that they have gotten so big that employees have become numbers and not people. When I worked there it seemed like they didn't care if you had a personal problem. There were policies around attendance (which I understand) but there was little to no leeway for extenuating circumstances. I worked for the company for almost a decade and was unable to move up no matter how hard I worked. I moved around the company but it was impossible to promote unless you knew someone.
good,"Helping customers on a daily basis, uncovering their needs and trying to find the best fit solution for them. You work together as a team to help your store overall. It's very competitive, which can be a lot of fun. The best part of the job was being able to actually help people discover their needs and finding that solution together. Its a very rewarding feeling. The worst part would have to be the stress that comes along with meeting quotas."
good,"Typical call center. very statistic driven. as the company grew from UW West Cellular to AirTouch, then Verizon Wireless it felt like we were all just numbers adding to the wealth of the executives"
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for because of it's compensation and benefits. However, there are a lot of politics involved. Job advancement depends on who you know and not your experience."
good,Verizon is a GREAT company to work for!! They have an awesome culture there. Management is not consistent and there is a HIGH turnover due to no work life balance.
good,"As a sales executive there was no concrete and defined sales strategy for the global sales department to execute on. The strategy rather was left up to each individual sales executive in their territory. "
good,I would be responsible for maintaining cell sites on the Oregon coast. Most of my day would involve travel time as I would cover over 160 miles. I was responsible for cell site performance and any upgrades to said sites.
good,"The Job requires a great deal of time.  The retail hours are difficult to get used to.  The management is null, the money can be good if willing to put in the hours.  Compensation is ever changing this is an commission only position.  At this point there are entirely much staff making commission very thin"
good,"Verizon has a company culture that is ever changing. Also as a technology company, educating employees and keeping them in the know is paramount to the progression of the company."
good,Positive work environment. Greet customers and inquire about their current internet and cable provider. Co-workers were fantastic. Hardest part of the job was getting credit dept to respond  promptly to credit checks. Satisfied customers
good,"Overall had a good experience working for Verizon. Didn't always agree with the way they ""managed things"", but enjoyed the people and the work."
good,"good company,  good pay and benefits,  nice team work, good training.  customers can be tough at times, but were given good working tools to resolve that."
good,"pay is good, nice working conditions. nice cafeteria and health club. friendly people. hardest part of job is worrying about job security as you get older."
good,Great Place to work for accountants and finance majors. There is free personal trainer and 50% off your cell phone bill.
good,"I monitor the Verizon Wireless National Networ, perform FA (Feature Activations) on network equipment, provision, and implement change control management. Create and submit nightly reports to management about the status of projects (change controls), and network health. Interface with my counterparts for project deliverables, and attend conference calls and WebEx to monitor and complete assigned tasks in support of the Verzion Wireless POR (Plan of Record)."
good,"The people are nice from any department. The data center is brand new, and we take pride in keeping it clean, organized, temperature must be perfect for the data center, HVAC is on site as well."
good,"It was a great place to develop the skills to move on, but it seemed like it was harder to advance and move up. No complaints about the people I worked with though, the culture was very good."
good,Worked in many groups due to re-organizations over the years..Great health benefits..Very secure job until jobs were moved overseas..
good,"For the most part its a good company to work for!! I would encourage people to apply. Been here for the past two years. Lastly, the benefits are the best I have seen thus far"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Enjoyed training modules for new cell phones and technical support. Great health benefits."
good,"Verizon is a tough place to work you are compensated by generating growth though customer interactions. However, you have to deal with a lot of customer service issues at the store level that prevents you from selling."
good,I enjy working at verizon wireless because I get to help different people from different backgrounds. I like to know ive made a differnece in someones day. My co workers are awesome.
good,"fun at work place. managers and co-workers awesome to work with. customer service was great. nice location, well paid."
good,"The compensation and benefits are great, but there is little to no accountability within the company. Management seems to be ill suited for their positions."
good,Properly directed inbound calls in the phone queues to improve call flow. Provided accurate and approriate informantion in response to customer inquires.I really enjoyed working at verizon. A  fast paced friendly enviroment with chances to advance in the company. good pay.
good,"As soon as Verizon had the Bury Service Technicians bury FIOS, everything changed. We went from a crew that made all the managers look good, to a crew that was always worried about losing our jobs."
good,"Overall, Verizon is a good company to work for. With such a large and widespread company, there is the potential to change between business groups and job functions if desired. My Business Unit was unique , in the fact that is was formed from the acquisition of MCI by Verizon. This differed from Verizon in the fact that Verizon was viewed as a more of a close knit, family-oriented company. On the other hand, MCI, as a company was all about business and growth. After a few years, the cultures began to meld, with a few holdovers. In my position as a Project Coordinator, it was my job to manage the installation of circuits for various government agencies. This was done in a team setting or individually. I had to manage the priorities of various groups, such as provisioning, install and sales. The PMO is a customer focused team and that did not always coincide with the directives of the other groups. This could make serving the customer a little challenging. I was able to overcome the barriers and build a good working relationship with all the other groups."
good,"Verizon aspires to be a leading telco provider"
good,The company is fine. Met the needs of the family at the time. I would go back be a use I liked the culture of the workplace. Company is good.
good,Verizon Wireless is a good company.  The benefits are great but the retail hours are tough when it comes to having a family life.  The retail side of the business is great to get sales experience.  The training team is very strong.  There are multiple avenues to move up but it can be hard.
good,Great place to work with great benefits if you are able and willing to make it your life.  It is a high pressure sales environment that will push you either to success or your limits.  You will learn a great deal about sales processes and be challenged every day.
good,"Overall a good company.  Not a lot of room for growth.  Moving up from Sales Consultant to management does not necessarily mean an increase in pay, so there were times you were left wondering what you're next move was."
good,"workplace is not good, but supervisors are not strict. But not being productive on this job. Im not gonna stay on this job . I need to be more productive"
good,The company as a whole is very good in assisting customers. The life/work is poor. It is very hard to get time off during holdiays to spend with family.
good,"My workday was enjoyable. The job I had gave my crew and I the ability to police ourselves every which also taught me the self discipline to complete a task without having my hand held every day. First and second level management was tremendously respectful and easy to work with. At the corporate level there was a concerning disconnect. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Fast paced work environment. Work on commission. Manaagment could be better. There's no assigned break times you take a break with its not busy. Sometimes a break doesn't happen
good,Fosters an environment which allows you to work independently and treat your work almost like your own small business.  A very big company with the ability to move around.
good,"Great company overall, during holiday seasons very little work life balance but overall great company to be a part of.  Sales goals can be challenging some months but overall they were fair."
good,I enjoy working with the newest technology. I have learned working in a team environment can drive positive results. The hardest part of the job is worrying about performance versus taking care of the customers needs. Stats and numbers are more important than taking care of the customer.
good,"Great place to work, but way too many politics.  Work hours far exceed what you are told.  Alot of face to face and in the field time."
good,goals change everyday without clear definition.  no job security.  Several RIFs every year with no reason why some are cut.  Excellent pay and benefits though.
good,working at Verizon was a very stressful position. Your goal is to try to please your customers but sometimes doing this was very difficult being that the problem could involve a number of different areas of Verizon that you have no control over.
good,"* Good Place to work."
good,Productive and interesting each day. Learn different areas of the telecommunication world.  Always something new to learn and explore with in the different departments.  We did a lot of cross training with different departments out side of the department in which I worked.
good,"- some days are very hectic"
good,"It was fun and a great learning experience. Too many inconsistencies with contractors/vendors who sold Verizon products as well as issues with corporate retail stores. All in all, it's a great place to work!"
good,"As a technician escort I got to work on time, listen to any short briefing from managers on what new about business, and safety issue if any since work is outdoor.  At work I learned how people intact for the needs for services in a diversify committee.  Management at work is high conforming leadership.  My co-workers are all union members vs management which most of the time turns up heat on job performance.  The cold Winter, and hottest basements.  Freedom"
good,"I have had the opportunity to work for some amazing leaders at this company!  Leaders that treated failures as learning opportunities, put my interest and my career aspirations before theirs, truly listened to what I had to say, and let me try out new ideas they opposed. I worked for these types of leaders for 4 years of my 12."
good,"The culture is competitive but close knit. However, if  your not producing the top numbers you don't matter and not respected. Company does have good benefits plans and their are a lot of good people who work there."
good,"Large American Company with all the + & - that involves."
good,"Fun place to work at sorrounded with the latest I.T equipment, servers, networking equipment, storage libraries etc."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The benefits and pay is excellent but certain offices will not give you the opportunity to succeed or grow. I give verizon an A- just as long as you don't work in the Salisbury MD office. The management is horrible and will reprimand you on anything.
good,"Depending on what department I worked in I handled a large volume of calls. The calls were for new service, repair of service or billing questions."
good,"Verizon is a very large company with many departments, branches and area of responsibilities.  You can work in certain area and never know everyone is my experience.  Verizon appears to be have room for advancement and also use vendors or subcontracts as staffing agencies for qualified candidates."
good,"learned a lot about the wireless industry"
good,"A typical day at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater was first meeting in the employee trailer to clock on, told where you were going to be that day, either by the front gates or by the main stage. You get given a a handheld device to check peoples tickets, then sent on your way. At the front gates you're required to scan everyone's tickets as they come through, answer any questions they may have and that's about it. If you are by the main stage entrances, you are also required to check their tickets to make sure they are in the correct place. Answer any questions they have and help direct them to their correct seats. At the end of the show every employee is not allowed to leave unless the lawn and seating is cleaned out. I didn't much care for the management here. My co-workers were very nice and fun. The hardest part of the job was having to stand in the heat all day. The most enjoyable would be getting to listen to the free concerts!"
good,you are just a number at a large company like Verizon. It is not a fun place to work and there are little to no incentives to advance.
good,"Above average work/life and benefits, below average culture. I felt chained to my desk, and even managed for bathroom breaks of less than 3 minutes."
good,no growth but very little expectation.  just focus on meeting budget and you can take the rest of the year off.  no pressure to create anything new or optimize - status quo is good enough
good,Customer Service can be a very challenging position but at the same time very rewarding when resolving a problem for a customer to their satisfaction.  Treat them as you want to be treated in a customer situation. I enjoyed working at Verizon and am very grateful for the experience and knowledge provided to me.
good,"I liked the culture here, it was just hard because of retail hours."
good,"extra hours everyday for employees, great co-workers. learned how to repair and maintain aerial and under ground cable for phone and data for homes and businesses. the hardest part of the job is not having enough employees to help with all the jobs. I really liked meeting new people"
good,Not much room for advancement. There is not a strong Verizon following in Miami.
good,"My co-workers are hard working and care for the customer.  Verizon offers career growth, especially if you are willing to relocate."
good,Compensation/Benefits are great but it can get super stressful
good,customer service call center for verizon wireless customers
good,Ok...more incentives and gas allowance would have been nice...otherwise you produce you get paid
good,This job can be tedious and you're taking about a thousand calls a day.  I liked my coworkers and management.  Job security is virtually a thing of the past as many customers use other sources for directory assistance.
good,New projects are very less so learning new techology is difficult.
good,When I started at the company my main duties were making sure that all merchandising and collateral were up to corporate standards. Ensuring company code of conduct was being enforced and adhere to. Verifying contract and clear disclosure on all sales transactions . Once moving to sales my role included greeting clients and uncovering their wireless needs in order to promote products and services to enhance their day to day life and/or business needs. Working directly with the public and being able to provide them with the best possible customer experience.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good learning, u will know the business well,"
good,"Daily, I logged into several systems to receive calls and  needed resources to assist customers.  Reviewed outlook emails received from area operations, supervisors, team members and customers.   I Assisted 32-45 customers with billing inquiries, data details, account opportunities, and equipment troubleshooting.  When needed I served as a Supervisor relief, assisting team with additional resource support and escalations."
good,Entrenched management yerning for the good ole days slow to change and lack the tools to advance improvements in process and operations.
good,"Excellent Experience but looking to achieve higher goals, also I have no benefits with this company as a owner."
good,It was fun to work with many different people. The schedules they had us on were very hard because they were split shift but the management would work with you.
good,A typical day would consist of helping customer feel good about their experience with the company while maintaining company standards.
good,This was the position that I started out doing. It was great while I was there. I learned alot and proform my duties to the best of my ability. I developed a great relationship with my customer's. I had some great co-workers who helped me along the way. I processed the information quickly and was able to proform my taskes independently in a short time.  The hardest part of the Job was using systems that didnt work that great. The most enjoyable part was providing service to the customers. At the end of the day I felt great that I was able to make a difference in the life of my customers.
good,"Typical day consists of monitoring alarms, and opening tickets either routine or outage."
good,"A typical day at work would be about 12 hours at the office helping about 40 technicians get through their day and about 2 more hours at home taking care of the paperwork end of the day. It’s a fast paced, overwhelming career but after each day you feel like you truly have made a difference within your area."
good,great benefits and outstanding co-workers and some supervisors
good,"Very fast paced environment, Customer Service Oriented. Potential to advance. Numerous positions and job locations across the United States. Service Level and Zero Defect methodology."
good,"The company has changed over the time that I've been a team member. I really enjoy the benefits package including being able to pay $15 p/m for the gym, although I do wish the gym was off site. I enjoy the days when I have a customer that allows me to work with them ton resolve their issues. That is always a great feeling of accomplishment. "
good,"Great customers in our stores to ascertain what each individual needs in order to make recommendations based on their specifications. Develop new personal and business accounts for Verizon Wireless by providing information about our wireless and Internet, and cable services. Call leads for more business opportunity."
good,"Must be able to answer phone calls while being timed and work through scripted messages while maintaining excellent phone etiquette and reaching personal office goal for sales. Managements job is to make sure team makes goals and can sometime pressure an individual to achieve higher. There is not much time to socialize in the workplace. There are many reasons why someone may not maintain their goal but the pressure can be extremely high. Best part of the job is excellent medical benefits, pay and incentives for achieving your goal. Must be a top sales person."
good,"company has good values, don't be afraid to challenge your self. you have to step outside of the box to succeed. Do things that don't feel comfortable."
good,"We take inbound calls. We handle technical issues, customer service concerns, and striving for opportunities to generate revenue.  Management is available to assist in further options resolving concerns and getting customers to buy more services and needs.  Co-workers rely only on each other for support and maintaining morale. Being able to speak with coworkers with technical issues and learning from each other is the best part of the day."
good,"As a sales rep, you will be constantly on your feet for upwards of 8-10 hours a day. Some days are slow and some are extremely busy. When the days are slow, a rep will make cold calls to current customers. Verizon is an excellent company to work for; however, it may not be the best place if you have a family because you don't get to spend a lot of time with them."
good,The money was great. I didn't like being stuck in a building all day. The work schedules were horrible.
good,"A call center environment is the most stressful and challenging environment one could possibly experience. A person has to be mentally and emotionally prepared for the difficult challenges that will come everyday. The benefits and pay make the challenges worth it.  I have learned a lot while working for Verizon, especially when it comes to learning communication, negotiation, being productive and proactive, and working with integrity."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Go out door to door doing sales for Verizon FiOS services."
good,"A typical day in the BGCO you would normally encounter during a call:"
good,"install and repaired business and residential telephone services, high speed internet, install new feeder lines to residence and commercial buildings"
good,My typical day consisted of assisting customers with account inquiries and making sure that we maintained clear records for the back of house.
good,Verizon if very focused of the lives of the people they serve. True leaders in the industry.
good,"Verizon wireless is a great place to work. Benefits are good, and the money is good too. its a great thing to be apart of a organization that is going places and can allow you to ""show what you know"" as long as you are ok with that and can keep up. Definitely learned how to build a rapport with customers, and display knowledge of products and services. One of the hard parts of the job is to not allow the politics of within, to have a affect on the way you do your job. this can be difficult with sometimes it seems like the people that should be there for you, aren't, and you have to combat them, along with the dissatisfied customers."
good,Overall great company to work for.Work day team moral depends on your management team
good,"I began my career with Verizon Wireless as a customer service representative in 2007 and continued to work with Verizon until 2012. The key point that was of interest to me is the employees I was meeting had all had long term relationships with this company, even through mergers and buyouts. This meant a lot to me because it reflected that Verizon Wireless, appreciated their employees. I then was promoted approximately a year later as an assistant retail store operator (ARSO). My main job responsibility was to pass the corporate audits that were reviewed and processed at retail locations. I began with one store and before the end of the position I was personally in charge of six stores, including my own, for corporate operations. My daily responsibilities included processing daily reports of the stores transactions and inventory to make sure the employees were compliant on a daily basis. If any issues had arise or needed attention, I was in charge of coaching the employees and management on proper procedures and processes. This was one of my favorite jobs I have personally ever been apart of. The employees and management were great and the work environment was always pleasant. When I was in my second year of operations it was a nationwide decision from corporate that some positions would be eliminated, my job happened to be one of them. Instead of letting me go they offered me a couple decisions to stay with the company. I accepted one of the offers which is what resulted in me applying for sales later on. I then moved on to sales for another two years. The hardest part was"
good,"It is a fast pace environment.  It's place to teach customers about their devices and sell customers additional wireless devices.  The information that you learn about what you can do with each device is amazing.  Typical day consists of selling customers new phones, setting them up and assisting them with billing questions."
good,"Time for a change, they are currently moving my job to a new location which is over 60 miles away. No longer allowing the work from home within my department which was great in bad weather or if I needed to care for my child."
good,Company paid well had excellent benefits. Almost impossible to advance  into management unless you've been there for years.Very stressful dealing with customers.
good,"Training to take calls is one thing, but all that goes out the window once u start taking calls on the floor.... Day to day change on how you are graded on the calls you take. Poor schedules unless you have been with the company for 4-5yrs. The customers will stress you out, plus your Supervisor will stress you out. Trying to take a vacation around Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years is like trying to win the lottery, unless the call center is closed."
good,Co workers friendly and always willing to help. Hours6  were bid on every 6 months
good,This company offers very good benefits. There is lots of ongoing training and chances for you to grow.
good,"VZW compensates fairly well for the job type.  There is room for advancement early on, but it stalls pretty quickly.  It is a cubicle city and the environment isn't very positive, overall."
good,Company is strictly in a cost cutting and profitability focused state.
good,"Work/Life Balance is great "
good,An industry-leading company which rewards it's employees with fantastic benefits and advancement opportunities.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Clean very professional environment the company took care of employees and gave great recognition luncheons
good,Fast paced job with many different avenues to explore within the company. 
good,Highly competitive place to work with exceptional compensation and benefits.  Management allows the oppurtunity for advancement and to  learn all tactics of sales.
good,"Verizon Wireless has a benefits package that ranks high above what is seen in other companies.  Verizon's benefits are the best in the industry.  The stress, however, is no match for the pay.  Upper level leadership constantly belittles front line employees in a ""put up or shut up"" type fashion.  Front line managers are given no credit when the store does well, but when metrics are not met your job is threatened.  Do well and you will enjoy your position for years to come.  If you are friends with an executive expect a promotion!  "
good,This position was a great step towards becoming a more polished manager and public speaker. It allowed be to network a lot and help customers on a one to one basis in person.
good,"Great benefits available including:"
good,Get to work with friends and the coworkers are awesome. Talking to people on an everyday basis!
good,"no day is ever the same, love to make new friends and meet interesting people, great place to work because i like helping people"
good,"The benefits at Verizon Wireless are great. If you are looking for a regular 9 to 5 Monday through Friday, this may not be the place for you."
good,This place had a great environment. The coworkers were great. Typically had to take calls to fix business account. Handled billing and basic tech support. The review system they had in pace for calls was inconsistent. They would do there best to find what you did wrong for a call. The same call listened to by different supervisor one would say what you did on a call you should fail for but the other would give you praise and say you did great. It was too subjective.
good,"Hard work/life balance, benefits and pay is good."
good,My job was fulfilling. Never a dull moment. Always something new and exciting going on. My clients kept me busy! Partnering with the Leaders of the business was the most enjoyable part of the day.
good,It was good company to work for when it was GTE but when the merge came about it went down hill with all the changes they made.
good,Too many inconsistencies with management. Few really care about the employees while too many only care about making a name for themselves to try to move up the corporate ladder. Co-workers help each other out when we can and they make it easier to get through the day. Benefits and Pay are very good compared to other companies in the industry. The hardest part of the job is taking insults and threats from customers without any support from management. I don't enjoy the job and there are no opportunities to advance within the company that's why I am now looking to move on.
good,"Verizon Wireless has a work culture that is very customer focused. The work force is diverse and most co-workers were a pleasure to work with. Although it is a huge company, it is very difficult to move up so choose a position wisely if you join the company because you will likely be doing it a long time. The hours in the call centers are not family friendly, and your schedule will change often based on holiday/product launch needs as well as a shift bid every 6 months. Just when you get used to your schedule, it changes again. It is not healthy working long hours, having irregular ""lunch"" and break times, and working nights and weekends makes you miss many family events and your social life suffers. The cafeteria hours are only geared to the 8-5 employees and is usually closed when the call center employees need to take their lunches and breaks so you are reduced to unhealthy vending machine options if you don't bring enough food."
good,"Customer service rep for the store. Was in customer service dept for about 3-4 years. The last 8 or 9 months I was there, I was transferred to sales dept. I didn't like sales as much as customer service. Pay was great and benefits were awesome. Coworkers were always fun and had a great time at work. Always positive. Management had me closing store every night. 5 days a week. I never got different results after speaking directly to manager. Was not happy with schedule. Days I requested off were mostly rejected when I put them in a month in advance, plenty of time."
good,I have learned through my work experience that learning is a everyday occurrence whether they be the employers or employees. Determination serves as a driving force in helping completing one's task in the office.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,A typical day consist of handling inbound calls from Verizon Wireless customers and answering questions about their cell phone or account. I learned how to succeed at first call resolution by ensuring I had a clear understanding about what the customer was calling in about to avoid a call back. The hardest part was balancing school and the long hours. I really enjoyed the incentives.
good,"Glass ceiling. Rep are promoted to management based on who they know within the company. This has created management teams, with very little leadership skills."
good,Get there early to set up for the day.
good,"Ok place to work, although if you went over the 30 second alloted time frame for your call, management would hover. They also had a horrible attendance policy. I watched one woman go into labor and was afraid she would get an ""occurance' if she left to go to the hospital. It was not unheard of to see employees vomiting into the trash due to illness, because they were afraid of getting fired."
good,I have learned about unions since working at Verizon. Some management is from off the street and some work their way up. The hardest part of the job is the commute.
good,"Verizon is a fast paced, fun place to work. A Positive attitude always is a good way to start any day off. Servicing customer in the process of purchasing new handsets or phones for due upgrades, answering questions, assisting Sales Reps in any way that I could to make transitions go as smoothly as possible. My manager had us come in By working for Verizon I have achieved many transferable skills that I hours early on Sundays so that he would have extra time to teach us more sales techniques. As for my co- workers I feel that we did the best we could with what we had. Sometimes trying to keep a positive attitude with two or three sales gone bad is truly a challenge.The best part of the job for me is when we as a team have met all the quota for the day and ""high fives"" are being displayed all over the place. Over all Verizon can be a great place to work."
good,Customers call in complaining and you try to help them as much as you can while getting yelled at at the same time. After a while you learn patients and realize that they are upset and you have to let them get their frustrations out so u can help them and possibly solve the problem and end the call with a happy customer.I really Cant speak much on my co-workers because when u go into the account of an angry customer you can see why they was upset not full filling promises that u told them and you couldnt reach.The hardest part of the job was trying to fix someone else mistakes but the most enjoyable part was satisfying a customer.
good,Management in Treasury dept is horrible. The Company is good overall but i do not recommend applying for anything in treasury department because of poor leadership. Coworkers are fine but i see there is a culture in this particular dept that is not favorable for advancement and it has not become a positive place to work. let me be clear it's the department i work in not Verizon as a whole.
good,• Support President and Chief Operations Officer
good,"it is a great palce to work if you don,t have small children. i enjoyed the experience but you have to dedicate a lot of time"
good,A typical day in a telecommunications day is resolving customer delinquent accounts as well investigating and resolving misapplied or missing payments. Provide excellent customer service in all interactions. As well as learning and training in other aspects of the business.
good,"the companies environment is rather stressing but well worth it if you were able to make 5 or more contracts a week. the co workers were ok, management wanted everyone to succed which was inspirational."
good,"When I started at Verizon, I had just dropped out of college three months prior and I thought I would be flipping burgers, so when the manager - an enterprising, energetic little guy with a background in auto sales - decided to take a chance on me, I was thrilled. And honestly, wireless sales is a prestigious position, it pays well, and the work is challenging."
good,Inbound calls from customers in regards to wireless services including but not limited to billing and technical support. Maintaining a positive attitude at all times and make sure that all questions or concerns of the customers are answered and resolved correctly. Must offer upgrade options available to customers and maintain high scores based on customer surveys.
good,"a typical day at work would be meet with my sales team let them know the monthly goals see where were at and need to be and complete it. Make sure everyone is aware of the specials, hardest part of the job would be meeting your monthly sales quota but the product was good enough that we usually did. Most enjoyable part of the job would be playing and learning the phones."
good,contacted large coorperations on past due balances and helped resolved issues preventing payment
good,"Great compensation and benefits, opportunities for advancement are great."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Enjoyed working at Verizon as I made good friends and the team i worked with we gelled meaning we got he job done. Bad part was management constanly over worked us which in turn limited our time with family.
good,Literally we do more work before 9am than most do all day. Very much a high-paced Global Service Desk.
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for, because you know what your going to get from them and what they expect from you one the first day. However this doesn't leave much room for growth within the company."
good,Good paying company but personally feel that there aren't many opportunities for advancement
good,It was a good enviornment with opportunites to advance and grow professionally.
good,The company is huge and offers great benefits. But the work/life balance is not that great.
good,great training for different department. decent pay for start off. managers are well knowledge on their products and services
good,"Verizon came in my life due to a merger. The culture is very stereotypical corporate america. However, they are some what tolerable on being late. For example if I were to clock in a minute after my alloted time. I could just stay over a minute to compensate. At the end of the day, working in customer service it is about how many calls you take and handle time. So if your looking for a laid back type of call center job. This is not the one. They are very disciplined and information changes within the hour. So you have to be at your best. The benefits are good considering they are one of the top earners in wireless technology."
good,"My entire worry is that I am 31 yr old person and am in hunger of work, learning, knowledge and to grow fast. I have proved myself in different fields like Compliance, Operations, Service Delivery and Metrics. Hard part of my career in Verizon is to keep myself engaged and good part is that there are no such big pressure."
good,"This is a newly graduated, singles, pre-retirees dream job. From day one you have insurance, dental, medical, and vision. The company promotes from within and pays for education* and all they ask is to come to work."
good,This was a great place to work until they began to off-shore the majority of the business. Great pay and people to work with.
good,The division that I worked in was with the corporate collections group. Great management group that was very effective in engaging co-workers and other integral groups to work as a team in meeting departmental and company goals.
good,"This company is not the best place to work if you have a life outside Verizon. Every store has a management team that has their own ""star team"" therefore will give them the ""star treatment."" Such as coming in late was not an issue if you were a great salesman nor was taking an extended lunch. While other ""non-star team members"" needed to work harder and by the book! I witnessed a lot of favoritism from starting off as a greeter to customer service rep. Mostly all of the men working there are perverts. Constant threats of losing our jobs if we did not perform to their expectations. Monthly goals that would just get harder and harder to achieve. This is something that we all work/worked with because the pay was better than most places and paid the bills. However, most of the people I seen that left the company was due to not being able to handle the stress put upon them any longer"
good,"Depending on your location with this company, there is a good chance to make good money. However, there are clear favorite stores in the company and these favorites are usually the ones to get the majority of the attention, thus the majority of the customers. Due to the fact that it is a salaried job, there are a lot of hours involved without a guarantee for a lot of money due to the commission scale."
good,Great people and fun work environment but I felt that there was a lot of pressure from management to take advantage of certain situations or customers to gain sales that were not always ethical.
good,"Since its sales, its a challenging and stressful work environment. Need better management, planning, and processes to ensure clarity and better product delivery."
good,Very goal oriented.  Sometimes goals were not achievable.  High pressure management that pushed to achieve goals no matter what.  Not a good company for work life balance.
good,"Always a bust place with hands on modern technologies. Always new things to learn, ideas never go un noticed. Hard part of the job is working with frustrated customer but they still want to do it their way.Great pay but unstable ground."
good,"About 6 years ago Verizon started Finance Transformation, closing many offices and forcing them to relocate to larger campuses.  Verizon likes the high turnover and prefers younger talent and lower salaries."
good,Lead with fear mentality which wasn't leading to more productivity. I just went in kept my head down and did my work. You saw people being walked out daily for the slightest of reasons.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I enjoyed it, but not good documentation and systems that speak to each other. Communication was not the best definitely no training manuals that they give to new associates. Management don't communicate well with if they have concerns.  You find out as your contract is up"
good,A great place for young people who would like to build skills that will help them with a career later. And a great place to earn great pay for those with a strong sales mind
good,"Overall good company. Poor management and good employees get overlooked. Advancement can be a little difficult. The commute was my deciding factor. It’s 2019, remote should be an option."
good,"When I first started VZ they cared about their employees. Now we are under paid and over worked. No recognition.  They work isn’t hard and the numbers are sometimes achievable, depending if VZ wants to be greedy that month or not. Great benefits!!"
good,"I've been working for the company for 9+ years. My current role is a Home based agent, but you become a prisoner in your own home. The incoming calls are stressful and customers can be really rude. You definitely need have thick skin. The company benefit and pay are great schedules change every 6 months and based on performance, and can be 4x10 shifts or as late as midnight.  You are put into a bid and you get what they give you. Be prepared to give up your family and outside activities when it's time to change shifts. You basically work all holidays except Christmas and you bid on the rest. Coachings are never what you do good but what you can do better. Company has changed in the last few years and I don't expect to be here much longer."
good,"Originally was a wonderful company to work for.  At the end,  we were all just numbers, no consideration was placed on our well-being, happiness at work, stress levels- we were just part of the herd."
good,If you’re at a slow location it can tend to get boring. Also if your management isn’t good then you won’t enjoy yourself as much as you could otherwise
good,"I've worked for the company for the last 10 years and it has rarely been boring. There is some potential for greatness with the change to vz 2.0, but that is also a little chaotic as roles are redefined."
good,"Good opportunity for upward mobility.  I learned a lot.  Verizon prepared me for my next worked chapter.  Inspire engages employees and leaders by developing a culture of continuous learning, goal execution, collaboration, and performance through one integrated platform. Motivate employees and celebrate their success with the team & throughout the organization. Provide valuable feedback that develops employees into capable leaders who drive results. Reach Goals. Develop Leaders. Elevate Performance. Increase Productivity."
good,Not bad if you are interested in a sales position. Sales goals are changed and updated frequently. You are rewarded pretty well for hitting your target numbers.
good,"Reps make more money than assistant managers. Most managers take a demotion to make money again. Harder to make commission, pay scale becoming difficult and harder to make a good commission check. Benefits are great"
good,"Overall the company is a decent first time sales position. Pay is good as long as you push yourself to exceed expectations. If you don't have the luck to land a good store, your numbers will be impossible to reach and you will lose your job. In this aspect, the company tends to set you up for failure."
good,"Often we had to work long hours. Depending on manager/group, employees can work remotely 2-3 days a week. depending on your level and performance review, you will get fair yearly bonus."
good,I wish there was more opportunities for career advancement without waiting 4+ years. Verizon pay for school which is great. I love working from home. Great culture.
good,"This is a very demanding job, and requires a lot of patience. In addition meeting required metrics and sales habits is mandatory. Dealing with customers that require high level of service can be difficult."
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for promotes from the ground up. As long as you are willing to show up and do the work you will be able to get the experience that you need to grow professionally. This is not a place to get stuck in a single position for more than 2 to 3 years. If you find yourself not moving into a new role, it is time to start looking elsewhere."
good,"Some teams are doing projects on cutting edge technology. Some are just maintainence jobs. Management are mostly IT people, so they are not completely on top of their job."
good,it was very competitive just no music very silent but great engaging customer experience loved solving there problems.  Fast working internet and great manager
good,"The environment was highly competitive with other wireless providers and because of the nature of the business and needing to stay ahead of the competition, projects felt that they were ever changing or never complete. I also felt that too many leaders had their hands in projects, which made the instructions and expectations varied, which felt chaotic most of the time."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,A slogan shared and imprinted on the minds of workers early on is 'Verizon change wireless'. This is a very accurate statement for how business is at Verizon.  However not only is it an ever changing landscape it is also a very diluted system with many layers needing to communicate to one another to get tasks completed.  Sometimes even simple tasks require multiple layers of management to have discussions with before they can be completed.  Its not an efficient way to do business.
good,"Operations Manager of the National Activation Center.  Worked closely with the field operations teams to ensure customer satisfaction. Managed a team of 6-10 technicians that interfaced directly, on  daily basis with local market field service technicians.  Developed and presented quarterly and annual performance reviews to all direct reports."
good,"Verizon has great benefits and can offer great flexibility.  After having children, the job's 6 month schedule rotations no longer work. The 12 weeks of training were a great introduction to the company. The culture at the center I work is not always the best. Does not necessarily feel like family. It did when I first started though. This was a nice start to my career, I have skills and training that I can take with me to any industry. My advice if you are not looking to stay on the phones, is to apply to other positions within the company as soon as you have completed your first year of employment and manage your time wisely."
good,"The money you make with Verizon is a game ,don't expect to have much of a social life if you burn up your vacation time , management is jealous of the rank Union employees because they make so much more money than they do."
good,"Verizon was a great place to work if you enjoy call centers. I firmly believe that a good supervisor makes all the difference in the world no matter where you work. I started out with one who was amazing and easy to talk to. On my second team, my supervisor was still new to it so she wasn't as good, but I had great teammates who made it worth going in. The medical benefits, competitive pay, and yearly bonus also made everything that much better."
good,"Working daily to resolve consumer issues whether be network related or billing. During time of management responsible for employee safety, time management, learning and company policies/procedures. The hardest part of my job is me being in need of change and wanting step forward in a different career path. The easiest thing for me to do at my job is almost anything with my drive to learn and experience I embrace change very quickly."
good,"Great Company 401k match, Paid time off , Great benefits. I have been with the company for 6 years and its time for a change and opportunity to grow and looking for a better work life balance."
good,"There were plenty of upsides in orientation and what you are told would happen in the company, however once you are there per usual things change. The same people that train you are the one's that pray for your downfall. Not all bad but the stress and backstabbing not worth it."
good,Good place to work dynamic work experience friendly people good advancement opportunities good compensation career opportunities abound good vacation schedule
good,Un salario competitivo pero el ambiente laboral deja mucho que desear.
good,typical sales work environment - very hard to hit quota some months - did not like working in a pushy sales environment. Left to pursue different type of job field
good,"This job is a conflicting one. They do pay very well, and their business is very strictly run. You need to be competitive and hard working to make it, but you can definitely make it. Don't apply here if you cannot handle heavy work stress and mental drain."
good,Verizon was a great place to learn and grow when I first started my career in sales.  It taught the basics and then as I progressed into the Business sales channel it allowed for even greater growth.  The one constant at Verizon is that change will happen and you learn to change focus on products and services quickly.
good,Schedule changes every 6 months. You have to bid on shifts and the computer chooses from how you arranged the jobs from top to lowest shifts that you want to take. It is definitely fact paced. The good part is that you get to work from home and with doing the shift bid you have the option to having a split shift
good,"Emerging technologies and quick paced technology advancements kept the job interesting and challenging.  Although many tasks were repetitive, many repairs and outages were vastly different from day to day requiring a broad set of troubleshooting skills, analytical thinking, and an understanding of network processes."
good,"Verizon pays VERY well. I know for sure that my ability to sell and give first class customer service is because of my time at Verizon. Verizon takes pride in investing in their people. The training at Verizon is like no other but the work life balance is non existent. The commission goals for the sales reps more times than not is unobtainable. If you do well one month the next month your quota is raised and most likely you won’t hit quota the month after having a great month. It’s like they make sure they don’t have to pay out a high commission two months in a row. Everyone is brainwashed, I was too, and walk around spouting off the companies credo when people are having valid issues with performance. Very manipulative people usually ascend to management and they manipulate their team into doing what needs to be done to achieve the unobtainable targets. Corporate makes bad business decisions and usually always takes it out on retail departments with layoffs or they make you feel like it was your fault a product failed even though anyone in retail could’ve told them the customers wouldn’t t have been interested in whatever new product they want to push. I am grateful for my time at Verizon but I’m glad I got laid off. I have my life back!"
good,great company to work for. benefits are great. support 24/7. a great place to grow and get work experience. job isnt for everyone must be a good critical thinker.
good,for some personality types this job is perfect. You have to be ON all the time. deal with the high pressure metrics for performance. difficult scheduling of time off and having a work life balance
good,"I worked for Verizon for over ten years, and they had great benefits, and the pay was good.  However, the couple of years, you would be worried in the spring and the fall about having a team call on a Thursday.  I was in Sales Ops, and it felt like it was only a matter of time before you would be let go."
good,Typical work day I supervised 24 facilities that included the campus and retail stores.  Managed any issue within supported sites.  The most important thing I learned there was how to managed priority and  Time management.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"No good training or processes in place to help a new hire. The group i was in, i was placed with a senior engineer who was very arrogant, combative, not a good person to receive training and instruction from. He was very negative all the time towards me and others in the group. He was very knowledgeable and very integral to the group and he knew this so he took advantage of that.  My supervisor was very reserved on confronting him and addressing the issues at hand."
good,"Competitively monitored and micro managed to ensure that you were doing your job as trained."
good,Loved the job and loved selling all the newest tech that came out. Coworkers were a lot of fun and it made selling even more fun. Once I got into management and ran my own store i was unable to have that coworker friend relationship so that area was not as much fun but the benefits of leading a great team and working together to achieve the stores overall sells goals became a lot of fun. We made the best of it and treated it like a game which led to our store coming out on top most months. The down fall of Verizon as a whole would be after i gave two years of my life and all of my time making my store sells higher than ever before. when i opened my store on a day we never opened which was a sunday to help my long time girlfriend upgrade her phone because we had been to busy for me to help her that past week due to the new iphone launch. I did everything by the book and in view of the cameras unfortunately this girls mom called into Verizon about a week later asking about her daughters upgrade and wanted to make sure that I had paid cash for the phone. when Verizon started to check into the line they noticed i had upgraded on a day my store was closed and later found out that i had only gotten permission from the mom over the phone and the rule is that the account owner has to be in the store at the time of the upgrade unless management approves and since my store was closed i was not actually a manager that day. the chain i worked for had there lawyers fight verizon to keep me but verizon said that they won't even hear our story because we are a tiny little dot on a map full
good,"Agile methodologies."
good,"The hardest part of the job is being so small in such a huge company.  You really feel like a number and for some people that is OK.  The job is not hard.  There are ways to advance your skills and Verizon even offers tuition reimbursement and other programs to assist your advancement.  What they don't tell you is the undertone message:  The show must go on and everyone is replaceable.  It's hard to build a life and fully commit to a company when that's playing in the back of your mind.  My advice:  live small, save everything, invest and create alternative income streams - because this definitely won't last forever... more like 10-12 yrs max."
good,Higly fast paced environment but a little more political. More focus should be placed on poeples ability to get the job done and not on politics. Has the best benefits I have ever seen though
good,"salescalls "
good,"Very hard to move up into the company, Go wireless outsources for management instead of promoting current employees. Very friendly place to work just feel like it could have been managed a little bit better"
good,Work day consists of helping customers.  Became a pro at handling customers concerns and troubleshooting technology.  Enjoyed customers as they also enjoyed my product knowledge and professionalism.  Hardest part are the goals and inconsistent commission rate changes.  Enjoyed the relationships I've created working there.
good,They don’t provide longevity. Job is good for learning new and upcoming. Managers are good and fair. I don’t believe they are meant for projects within the company.
good,"I would have stayed at Verizon but after 1.5 years as a contractor, they still had not considered to hire me or push for a raise. After all my contributions, I didn't feel fully part of the organization."
good,I worked for Verizon Wireless for the past four years. During my time there I developed the necessary skills to be a successful sales rep and Manager.
good,"Typical day at work involves a few daily meetings, system health checks, MOP Reviews.  I have been able to sharpen my Sys Admin skills over the years.  My manager is very hands off and allows us to work outside of most of the bureaucracy.  Oncall and difficult hours can be the hardest part of the job."
good,"Verizon was and extremely professional place however it was so strict with the customer surveys.  If a customer was upset and give your a bad review it could cost you your pay raise or job.   You were surveyed to death!  Customers can be extremely rude, it can get to you if you don't know how to take charge and control.  I think it should be $18 per hour not  $12.95"
good,"Installation, commissioning and maintenance of high speed business lines for international customers. A typical day would be making sure the field engineers and equipped and dispatched to meet customers' schedules."
good,I loved working here had many opportunities. I relocated with the company and due to unforeseen events I was let go. I can understand but don't agree with it. There was no compassion or understanding from the company on how tough the move was for myself and my family. I worked for the company for almost five years my numbers were good and was an asset to the company.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A typical work day at Verizon Wireless is non-stop busy. You must adhere to the schedule adherence 95% of the time and constantly getting back to back calls. Calls are requested to be no longer than 12 min MAX and you are required to handle at least 40 calls a day with 2 breaks and 1 lunch. Employees are a great help when you ask for it, however supervisors barley can give you any answers when needed and never follow up in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job is dealing with changes and not being notified by your supervisors and or receiving the updated documentation and or looking for the proper assistance for an escalation in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you gave it your best and were able to resolve client's issues especially when it's an emergency."
good,"The benefits and pay are good. Some opportunity for traveling. A bit stressful but if you are really good at over the phone sales, this is the job for you."
good,"lots of benefits. Unfortunate some coworkers make the work experience displeasing "
good,"My experience was not terrible but also wasn't great. Training was sub-par when I was hired but has since improved greatly. It's a great job for someone who doesn't have too much experience with sales and is looking for exposure. Not great for someone who isn't good in high-stress situations or dealing with abstract personalities. I personally enjoyed the culture although it could be a little impersonal at times. "
good,"I wouldn't go back there, but it was great at first.  Mandatory ot made for some great checks, but I was constantly missing family functions.  Management is wishy washy, and its fast paced and always in cue."
good,The ability to interact with many different customers and learn their needs and be able to meet those needs with different phones and services helps create and strengthen sales skills.
good,Verizon is a leading company on its industry. Provide good benefits but lack of good management. In some instance management team lacks of integrity and push its employees to unethical behaviors.
good,"I enjoyed working for Verizon until they made a bunch of changes.  They provide full benefits including tuition assistance.  They have a cafeteria with dart boards, pool tables, etc.  The hardest part of the job is the changes they made for the sales floor.  You have to work overtime to meet the quota.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture and energy everyone has there.  It is usually a good vibe.  I am sure other departments are a lot of fun.  The changes in the sales floor have made that department too stressful."
good,"The work environment was really great. The team was also good. Everyone truly works as a team and help each other as needed. At the company,we followed the agile methodology."
good,working for Verizon has helped me advance in life and be able to purchase a house by the age of 25. The hardest part of the job would be troubleshooting devices. If you are a people person and have some sales experience this job would be perfect for you. Theres definitely money to be made
good,"I liked working at this Verizon because of the manager that was previously there, he cared about his staff and employees also the customers that came in. But above him were the rudest and cruelest leadership team. I understand a business needs to make money, but to shove it down customers throats and making them feel uncomfortable was a sick joke of doing so. But our manager stood up for the customer service first then to sales which made our reviews great and kept having customers come back."
good,"You are on the phone or two simeultaneuos chats with customers all day. You are micromanaged with your schedule and stats. Verizon offers great benefits and compensation and plenty of overtime. If you have a chat or call at the end of your shift, you are required to complete and do overtime. I personally almost never got off on time unless I did not adhere to my schedule and pushed my break and lunches to the end of my shift.. Very draining job mentally with customers as you are expected to know and resolve any and everything."
good,"The job pays good and have great benefits, but there are alot of cons, The bonus annually is pretty good. You are allowed over 30 days off per year . The job is stressful and sucks all the life out of you."
good,"overall good place to work, the work life balance is not good at all. the benefits and employee discounts are awesome. the career advancement is great."
good,Verizon is a great place to work when you consider salary and benefits.  It's not such a great place to work when considering job stability.  There is always the chance of a RIF.  Verizon seems to be constantly reorganizing and reshaping their groups.
good,"The job required a lot of over time due to its high sales requirement, A high sales requirement is fine, but at the time i was a full time high school and student. 60+ hours a week selling cellular devices really took away from my school work."
good,"Worked for Verizon Wireless before it became just verizon, Place was decent enough job. Pay was great back in the day then compensation changed. Management was good at times but changed too frequently. The voice of the associate was not always heard"
good,"Good workplace to start your career!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon has been a great job, but it is a draining experience. Unless you are on the fast track to get promoted you will be in the same position in 6 years."
good,"All call centers are a little different. "
good,Fun-spirited supervisors with a very fun environment. Learning more and more skill daily which will help me continue too grow. The pay and benefits are also great
good,Verizon is a good place to work. Beware of the cost cutting measures. Show up everyday. Be happy. Schedule not really family friendly. Money and benefits great.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of reviewing any news or changes, checking your commission attainments and store/district leader board to understand what your target goals are for the day. A brief meeting with management for a break down of pertinent information from the morning calls. "
good,you will be pushed to sale only to hit metrics. They will always tell you to think positive and try to find creative ways to get customers to by their products.
good,"Verizon treat their employees really well, "
good,"Job is unnecessarily stressful. If you don't get 95% of your survey's perfect they hound you for it. Basically, you can't fail at anything otherwise they'll make you feel miserable. If you can advance beyond taking calls, then it's a whole different world of a great job. Management needs to not micromanage to prevent so much turn-over. Where most company's do annual reviews, Verizon call center does weekly reviews."
good,A typical day at work is to call customers or clients for them to advertise online.The hardest part is to get the leads because its a business to business campaign.
good,"Working for Verizon was wonderful as far as salary and benefits go.  It was also great in that it was challenging and never boring and you were able to talk to many people on the phone, which I enjoy being interactive with people.  I am very grateful for the time there."
good,In my current position there is too much isolation and not enough team involvement and focus to produce achievements. no purpose = no achievement. Verizon is a very large company and has difficult being agile although the teach their own brand of it.
good,It’s a good place to start if you are wanting to go somewhere with customer service or clerical work. It will help with advancement in the future for people that want to stay in this kind of work.
good,"Verizon Wireless has made many changes over the last few years, lots of lay offs, outsourcing and reduced bonuses. We can no longer work from home and many locations have closed causing employees to travel long distances to offices. However the company still offers bonuses, annual raises, tuition reimbursement and 401k matching. So you have to take the good with the bad."
good,The environment of Verizon is very competitive but can be lucrative for a sales person that grinds.  You make cold calls on your down time to make up for it being slow.
good,Verizon is moving at the pace of its customers. The skills you learn at Verizon are all transferable to any other job you work or apply for in your career.
good,Overall great place to work. Management style is outdated and needs work. However there  is opportunity for growth. Great benefits and an excellent tuition assistance program.
good,The call center is a very stressful place.  The demands are high and it places a lot of pressure on employees. No room for advancement in certain areas.
good,Verizon management focuses on sales and the number of calls taken only.  Mandatory overtime and no consideration of family or outside commitments. Overtime can be given 1 day in advance and is mandatory.
good,"The telephone operator position within Verizon is fast-paced with high performance requirements. The objectives and procedures are ever changing from week to week. Everyone is under stress to perform and compete with themselves,other team members and other companies within Telecommunications. Management is somewhat helpful,but under the same expectations. There is great camaraderie because all operators feel ""we are in this together"". We know that we either sink or swim as a team.The customers are the most unique because we service mostly the deep south and the east coast along with the west coast. We have an interesting mix of personalities as well as accents to deal with, and never know what will happen next on a phone call. There have been notable celebrities past and present that have called into our different offices,much to our amazement.The hardest part of the job is keeping your cool and staying professional when being insulted or called a racial epitaph. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer was pleased,or being able to take an extended vacation, and obviously cashing a very large check every two weeks."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Definitely helped me improve on my customer service skills that were lacking before taking the job.   Shifts could be long and could be at times expected to work longer than scheduled.
good,"When I first started working for Cellular Sales it was a really fun job. Everyone was part of a team and was willing to help you with whatever you needed and it was a fun atmosphere with friendly competition. As the months went by, management changed and people were being placed into leadership positions based strictly off of how much they could sell. If you ask me a leader is much more than that. Our lead is very young, inexperienced and more of a dictation than a leader. This is one of the biggest reasons I'm leaving the company. Regional directors stopped caring about the employees."
good,"For the first year or so, I loved my job. New management decided every department should be a sales department and my stress increased exponentially. Between dealing with customers (which we can all agree isn't usually fun) and pressure / threats from management, it just gets to a point where it isn't work it anymore."
good,"Good pay and benefits, but work-life balance is hard because to make money, you need to work every weekend. Scheduling is also rough, There will be times you will work 8-10 days in a row."
good,"having to sell to every customer even when they called in irate about how high their bill was.  We would have to up sell to them."
good,Focused on customer service and results of performance appraisals.Get 15 min breaks and lunch times vary. Schedules rotate every 6 months and are based on performance and tenure.
good,"Initially excited to learn new career but over years of changes in telecommunication jobs became more demanding, stressful and overloaded. More lay off of employees work load became greater for everyone."
good,"Days can be long, learned some of what not to do business, management needed more people training, culture was trying to improve but struggled in some places"
good,There are many pros to working at Verizon. The best attribute with the company are the amazing benefits provided. Another major benefit is the training provided.
good,I wasn't at Verizon very long.  It was a very stressful time for me but they did provide appropriate training and compensation.  It just wasn't a position for me
good,"Benifits and pay we’re great but you live Verizon. They micro manage.  They tell you exactly what to say, track your every move, and you have to work all the time."
good,I learn everyday that no situation is the same but all should be given the same respect. I feel management could be a little better at supporting reps; especially those reps who fight for the company and then the manager comes in and folds over to give customer whatever they want at no cost to them but makes employee look like rude because actually following company policy. Culture can change with the change of employees (especially management) or change of locations. When the schedule gets no attention and not taken care of and your the one stuck with a repeated ugly schedule with no life/balance.  I enjoy seeing the results of helping someone with something that is going to better their life!
good,"Good perks good hours good coworkers great cafeteria "
good,"Verizon offers excellent benefits, and many career opportunities.  Workplace balance is often not a priority for Leadership, the Company comes first.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but employees have to know where they stand with Leadership."
good,good benefits.  a lot of changes over the years have made the work environment not as fun. recently there have been store closing due to company not growing as it once was.
good,"Very good place to work. During my time, the PH office has established employee engagement activities which proved to have had a great and positive impact to the employees. Though there is an occasional company politics which is typical to any organization."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Job eliminated and moved to different state.  Otherwise it was a great place to work.  Good insurance and flexibility and I would recommend it if job stability is not a priority
good,"A day at work consisted of opening and closing procedures, some house keeping, trouble shooting, but most importantly, sales. I learned how to turn many unlikely situations into a sale. I also learned a lot of trouble shooting techniques, and operating of computer systems used every day on the job. Management was very driving towards sales. Work place culture was fun and friendly and team oriented, although it was competitive. The job could get challenging when sales were low and it became high pressure. Also deescalating an occasional angry customer was intimidating or uncomfortable at times. It was enjoyable to be part of a team that encouraged and supported one another and who made a day at work fun. It was also enjoyable to make a sale and push to make more money on my commission check; being in control to some extent on how much money I wanted to make."
good,good benefits and tuition reimbursement.  Expect long hours of sittng at a desk.  At times can be stressful.  good phone benefits.  A structural way of work.
good,Only thing I disapproved on was the company selling refurbished phones as new making double-triple sales. People are wanting the best quality not reburb junk
good,"This job overall was ok, but after a while you grow stagnant even with being promoted. Due to the Industry being retail, it felt at many various times that they owned you. This did not work well for me attempting to prioritize my family life."
good,"Verizon is a good company.  They just started focusing more on the business itself instead of the employees.  The pay wasn't what it should have been for the work that was being done.  The management was good for the most part, and the workplace environment was fun.  I enjoyed the people that I worked with."
good,"Verizon is a fast pace environment in which the bar is set high because of the competitive nature of this business. Verizon is open to new ideas and encourages their employees to submit their suggestion."
good,Always changing. Fast paste. Good for people who love to sell. It was a great team at the time I was there. I know a lot of people have left and moved forward with their careers since then.
good,"VZW offers great benefits and pay, but the job can be stressful if you aren't into working in a fast paced environment. Also, the better schedules are available based on your seniority and performance. This did not work for my school schedule."
good,After the Vodafone buyout the culture changed.  Spending $130 Billion put a lot of stress on the company and it hasn't recovered.  Multiple layoff ensued after the buyout which created the need to cut costs and lay off many people who built up the company from the start.  From what I hear the company and culture have really suffered ever since.
good,"I worked on average of 10 - 12 hours a day.  Always competing so you could get a decent schedule,e so you could have work love balance.   If you were all about work you would be very successful."
good,"high paced, challenging, competitive job. Strong culture the right people can do very well. The wrong people will die to the stress. Fair pay for performance."
good,"the commission based salary is why i left,if they paid me i would have stayed. the training was excellent, the support system was excellent and the staff was very professional and respectful."
good,"Verizon Wireless was a very fast-paced, competitive company to work at.  Policies, procedures, and systems were constantly changing.  It is a sales oriented company regardless of your role.  The benefits were great.  They supplied health insurance benefits, including vision and dental, paid vacation time which increased with your time with the company, and 401k."
good,promotions were slow and it seemed as if the job was a revolving door. I learned a lot from the experience and would recommend the job to any looking to further their people skills.
good,"Great benefits, no issues when taking FMLA, PTO and 401k benefits"
good,"good company to learn technology.Salary is good and good leave policy.Women friendly.Encourage growth if you have merit."
good,"I wouldn't do it again. Metrics are outlandish, goals are a bit far fetched, but if you can survive random center closings and relocations, you'll do fine."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"In general, it has a good work/life balance, but it can get pretty hectic around holidays depending on the team you are one. For example, when there are a lot of promos during a holiday, you might have to work late to support development."
good,A lot of the work done is not available due to internet and wireless. The job when first started was great and lots of opportunities.  This has changed over the years as phone services has changed .
good,"My contract experience at Verizon has been beneficial in jump starting my career. Valuable corporate experience, and a company that pushes for greatness daily."
good,"Stressfull at times, work comes before family. The relationship between labor and management is very poor.  The pay and benefits are at the top of the industry."
good,You are expected to work over hours. Working in the NOC you will learn at a rapid pace and touch on many technologies and work with many vendors. Do not expect to be able to move around much if you are talented as they like to keep talent in place. Raises are hard to come by.
good,"Very fast paced and demanding but very rewarding with a great group of Engineers. Daily Desktop (hardware, software) and WAN support. Great learning facility for WAN engineers studying/learning network engineering."
good,"Verizon is a competitive work environment. At times it can be stressful. There is your standard ups and downs. Overall the company is a fast pace place. There is opportunity to advance with the company if you are willing to relocate. "
good,A typical day would consist of securing customer lines from hackers. I learned to identify fraud by regions & patterns. The hardest part would be handling upset customers.
good,"I was a Verizon Wireless retail location Solutions Specialist which is basically a sales position combined with technical support/customer service. "
good,This company provided good benefits and pay but the environment was very stressful. We had to have multiple skill sets and meet goals that were impossible to achieve. Management was out of touch with the employees and didn't seem to care.
good,Very demanding on the number of calls you took. Could not vary off of a script much.  A very tough job. Not easy taking call after call sometimes with very upset people.
good,This was previous job at Verizon in Information Technology...very stressful environment with much unpaid overtime.  Teams were very supportive.  Liked working remote.
good,I am a veteran & could not get hired full time at Verizon without a college degree. I could only be a contractor which was limited to 3 years. After that I had to leave for a 1 year minimum before going back as a contractor again
good,Great company with amazing benefits. Excellent sales model and training. Would highly recommend this company to anyone that was strong in sales or just starting out.
good,"Verizon Residential sold CA, TX and FL territory to Frontier Communications. The Missouri center is outside of the Frontier footprint and previously supported other states. Frontier shut down the MO center."
good,"I worked at Verizon as a developer for about 3 years, but got laid off. It's unfortunate but it is what it is. Honestly i was looking into some positions anyway. Work started to get repetitive and wasn't learning much. Also got tired of lack of communication. Towards the end I was doing 2-3 day api's and then found out they didn't need them anymore. It's very hard to move up unless you plan on making this job your life and working 24/7. Very competitive. However, they do offer great benefits and competitive pay. You get great health insurance coverage plus dental and vision, 2 weeks paid vacation plus 1 week time off. 401k is nice too. I believe you're 100% vested from day 1 of work."
good,"The people were wonderful however it was a very sales driven and was sometimes overwhelming."
good,A low-stress job when working on the floor answering calls as long as employees have ability to not take upset customers personally along with ability to resolve issues on the first call.
good,This is a typical service provider company.  None from top management have good credentials. lot of confusion. I guess all the good people are busy putting fires of bad decision of management
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The managers say a lot of positive things, but seldom put them into practice.  There were many times in training when we were left alone and the supervisor on duty would wander off and leave 30 or so trainees alone with customers."
good,company is changing tremendously and is perfect for anyone willing to conform to the powers of a major corporation.  The benefits the company and 401k options are the best things they have going now
good,"Verizon had great compensation and benefits, but they had a high level of expectation and an extreme level of micromanagement. The overall team spirit was low."
good,"A great company to work for with many benefits, in my call center not a lot of room for growth but that was ok for me.  I would have continued with the company if I was not displaced. I did not want to relocate."
good,"On a daily basis you will get to touch various aspects of the business, from sales, to business development, and even finance in some instances. Overall it is a high pace environment that required you to be on your game at all times, but the payouts are worth it."
good,Job was not right for me. It was not a career I saw myself enjoying. I did not like the job but the pay was very favorable and the benefits were great.
good,"answering inbound calls from customers concerning a variation of topics from phone bill, to technical advice, to plan change, to discounts, and international travel info."
good,The company closed the facility I worked at and offered little option for relocation.  I had worked there for 10 years and suddenly found myself looking for a job all over.
good,"Verizon Wireless is a great position if you like to be constantly watched, and don't need help with from a supervisor. I was asked why I had to go to the bathroom because of adherence. You can be fired if they do not like the way you perform. They have great benefits, and other positions are great as long as it not in the call center."
good,"Working in a Verizon Call Center can be very rewarding yet very challenging.  It is a high paced quick learning environment.  You have to be able to adapt to change that occurs every 3 months and even at a moments notice.  Career advancement is available, but only you file the plan management gives you that they plan that yourself and management work out together."
good,Expected to sell to consumers who did not justify those sales. Customer service role was catered towards generating more income for the company rather than actually assisting customers.
good,"Verizon is a overall good company with some great benefits. However, they can improve their process of hiring for managers. Also, they can do a better job at pay."
good,"Business accounts manager- 8-5 half salary half commission. Way too internal bridges to cross, it affects productivity. Management is hit or miss, a lot change in management throughout a year. Company goals and focus change monthly."
good,"Unfortunately, Verizon Wireless as a company has not been the company I was passionate working for lately.  There is little room to grow. I've shadowed a position that has recently been eliminated.  There are layoffs in every channel and it feels as if there is no where to go.  "
good,"Helping my customers was the highlight of my job. However as with any job, policies that change often gets very frustrating, especially when it starts to not benefit the ones on the front line that knows the job inside and out. I feel I was unfairly let go but ultimately the customers and fast paced evolving technology is what kept me there for 13 years."
good,"Pros-"
good,"I definitely enjoyed my time at Verizon. Because it was a sales role, it was very competitive and quick-paced. Most people coming in for a new phone were excited, and therefore it made the product fun to sell. Verizon is also a top-ranked telecommunications company in nearly every area, so I believed in what I was selling."
good,The envionment was very streeful. It was very difficult for the average person to advance no matter how well you were performing.Also it was a very long commute. 55 miles each way.  110 miles a day.
good,It's a hard job with the competitive salary.  Teams change every 6 months with new management and shifts. The hardest thing is being yelled at by the customers.
good,"GTE/Verizon has completely gone defunct in the Midwest or rural areas of the United States. Frontier, on the other hand, is mostly Midwestern. I retired shortly after Frontier took over Verizon territories, so I cannot speak honestly about working for Frontier Communications, but, working in any telecommunications industries is extremely stressful."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great training programs and employee friendly attitude.  Requires a high degree of energy and great communication skills to be successful.  The company has great employee benefits such as tuition reimbursement.
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for, they always cared about the Credo of the company and the customers. Once mobile companies began to convert metrics changed and became unattainable. Management showed favoritism and unfairness at times."
good,Verizon as a company treats its employees as very competitive individuals and do not necessarily focus on a team aspect in anything. Customers are the best reason to work for Verizon as the people you see everyday are different and makes for a interesting workday. Stressful schedules are required as they do not approve time efficiently nor do they allow vacation requests outside of a 2 week period.
good,While the job itself was tedious and boring the people I worked with were great. Everyone was always helpful and willing to work together to make the network better.
good,"If you like to suck-up and are willing to agree with anything management says or does, then you will do well here. This company used to be a much better place to work, however in the last five years or so, it has been steadily declining. In a desperate effort to cut costs to stay competitive the quality of employees and service has suffered."
good,Good place to work since they assist you as employee and help develop you're skills to progress on the company. Nice installations and atmosphere .Nice employee program on the services.
good,"Telecommunications is a competitive space, and departments seem to be understaffed.  I receive emails from my boss at 8:00 at night.  I have no desire to ever work myself to a position that has me working that late."
good,"Sales job is tough and incentives have dwindled in recent years, that being said, base pay is substantial and the have great benefits. Management can be inconsistent at times with what they're looking for you to do on each call.  If you get a good team lead, you're golden, just don't rely to much on the monthly bonuses."
good,"Closing sales on a daily basis, a really great work environment,"
good,"Verizon has good benefits and has the potential to be a good place to work. However, the management team in certain areas can be difficult to deal with and stifle growth. Look for good people to work for. Work life balance can be challenging and appreciation is hard to find."
good,OVerall the environment was easy to adapt to.  Management seemed to care.  People were friendly and the job opportunity was good.  Enjoyed the comroderty.
good,"No work/life balance. Shifts based on performance. Management great, but employees not treated as individuals. Once hired, very difficult to lose your job, however with the amount of changes that happen in the company, job security (i.e. center closing) is not a certainty. Possible to advance."
good,"Very Busy and Stressful environment in which customers wanted to come in and leave without seeing or being introduced to any other products, and having a budget in which they wanted to stick to."
good,"The job is stressful, you get paid a decent amount of money but you have to listen to customers talk to you like you don't matter. No matter what the customer says to you, you have to deal with anything unkind names they call you. It was not fair to me and quite annoying."
good,"Good Benefits and 401."
good,A typical day is very busy and challenging. Plenty of latitude to structure your day and construct tools to accomplish multiple tasks and projects. Many of my peers are great to work with and willing to help to achieve success.
good,As a Customer service representative typical day is talking on the phone to customers all day . Making sure that the customers accounts are accurate . While working this position I have learn to listen to understand and not just to be able to respond. Management at Verizon could good. The hardest part of the job was to get adjusted to sitting all day answering the same questions. I am now use to it. The most enjoyable part would be making the customer happy.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I really enjoyed working at this company and was sad to leave. However, unless I wanted to move to corporate headquarters in another state, there was no advancement in my field so that is why my rating is lower. If you are in other areas, like sales, you can move around. The benefits are the best. Very complex working structure with many layers."
good,Dealing with customer and their phones you can imagine how it goes... as the world pushes forward and makes changes the demands for cellphones take over
good,"I've worked for Verizon for 4 years."
good,"It was a great door for me to be in the sales and wireless industry."
good,"overall good place to work, but again too many politics involved in the lead distribution format and lack of supervision by the managers. territories were not very well planned and deadlines were very stressful!"
good,the more you would work the more you would sell so your commission check would be higher.  it taught me how to manage my time with customers and find the quickest ways to get them exactly what they needed
good,My typical day at this company was to learn more about the wireless industry.  The managment team was diversified and the culture of the company was fast pace and challenging.  The hardest part of my job was assisting customers regarding technical difficulties.  One of the enjoyable part of the job was the discounted plans for employees.
good,"productive and fun working with verizon"
good,"Management at my particular store made it fun and pleasant to be at work. I wasn't a fan of the necessity of brown nosing for upward mobility. Nonetheless, just having new customers and profit wasn't their only goal, though it was high on the priority list. Rewards were also pretty decent."
good,Pay is really good but you have to deal with a lot of pressure from upper management to sell products and have to deal with the overall ignorance of people with there phones. Overall not a bad place to work especially if you are not sure what you want to do after school but want to make money and have good interpersonal skills.
good,"Things were always changing in the work culture which made it difficult to perform your role on a consistent level.Although my immediate supervisor was excellent, upper management made things very stressful."
good,"Great company to work for. Great benefits, great healthcare, great 401k match, company has awesome events when there are events, always awarded when job is done. Management can be a lot better."
good,Exceedingly high demand work environment with limited freedom to improve service to the customer. We repeatedly band aided problems that continued to reoccur. This made for extremely upset customers and staff.
good,Very competitive job place but the benefits and pay were worth it. Just wished the management would have been more understanding. Taking time off was always a hard thing to do. Also not hitting your quota for one month was the worst. Without hitting your quota you don't get paid.
good,The job was very guess and check. Managers were enforcing rules with no real world application. The top-down chain of fear got to be way too much to make the work day enjoyable.
good,"Working at Verizon is cool, Money is great and job security is good as well. Has a union to back up and cover employees. Only down fall i would say is the room for advancement and contract negations."
good,A well paying job with great benefits back in the 80's and 90's. You worked (at the time) in a cubicle and were not allowed to speak to any other operator.
good,"Typical work day revolves around answering numerous billing questions, false promises through customer service, and forcing products on people that you do not believe in. Occasionally you will get the great customer who will treat you like a human being. Sales mangers were great people, but higher ups will push them the companies agenda, even if not best for the customer or the workers."
good,"Great Benefits and the pay is not bad starting out.  However, it is very stressful to make your stats.   Management  is never on the same page at the supervisor and Associate Director levels.  Constant change that makes no sense at all.  No system in place to handle complaints fairly and effectivly"
good,"its good work place"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,There's no where to move up in the company in New Jersey except for leaving the state to take another position I was happiest when I worked for the gas and electric company
good,The benefits are what keep people and the competitive pay. If the company did provide these perks nobody would work for them. The leaders don't understand what we go through
good,"The company has competitive pay and excellent benefits for employees. The leadership is inconsistent and unreliable when it comes to aiding their employees. You might get a good supervisor, you might not, which makes it hard since you get a new supervisor every 6-12 months. Performance is graded more on interpretation of the customer than on the employee's actual ability to do their job. "
good,"A typical day at work usually consists of assisting customers with various needs. Mainly, troubleshooting devices and giving training to customers. There is a lot of sales involved as the products are all for the clientele. Must be proactive in introducing customers to new products as the company's main objective is growth."
good,Verizon has an incredible work culture. The benefits are great and  the pay is sub par. They offer reimbursement for school and team building activities.
good,"The retail sales representative is definitely the hardest and most time consuming position within the company.  It also provides financial opportunities that are in many ways unavailable within the company.  Management is great.  The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships, working as a team, and making great money."
good,"Verizon is  a technology company with some painfully outdated processes and technologies. "
good,Good company.  Layoff and continued reductions  began to negatively impact morale.  I enjoyed my time there because there were so many quality people working there.
good,great place to work if you do not have a family needs a better work life balance besides that the pay is good and the benefits are great sometimes management can be a little hard to work with
good,"sometimes long, and extensive hours. the quota is reasonable, sometimes hard. the benefits are great. The job is pretty self explanatory, the turn over was high when I was there."
good,"The company provides great befits for their employees. However, management is very poor within business government. The company should find better ways to grow talent workers in area they are best rather keeping them in area they are not happy."
good,"Very good company. They give full freedom to employees to give new ideas."
good,"Not a bad place to work, you would take dozens of phone calls in front customers daily. They could range from simple billing calls to escalated complaints.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication between the upper decision making levels of the business and the front line customer service reps."
good,"Solutions Specialist normally deals with the consumer accounts at the store level. We also handle all SMB inquiries with the local area, make outbound cold store to new business to perhaps to offer Verizon Wireless solutions. "
good,"Fast paced. Taking inbound calls handling customers concerns with accounts, resolving issues with plans, billing, usage and troubleshooting device issues. The biggest thing I learned was managing time, multi tasking, team work, adjusting to various changes."
good,"A typical day at work was assisting customers in choosing the best device(s) and plan that was best for their situation and needs. Also technical assistance was given to those with issues with their devices. Customer service was also provided for those with issues concerning their accounts. I learned effective communication in dealing with others. Also, even though I was already familiar with technology, I learned more as far as the inner workings of devices. Basically I worked individually in a team environment, obtaining assistance when needed to solve issues or problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
good,"I  am part of Fleetmatics, we are a recent acquisition of VZT. "
good,"New technologies are welcomed keeping you up to date with the industry,"
good,"Verizon is a great place to work for any driven person. The culture is fast paced, constantly changing, and cut throat. You work hard for your money. With that being said, you have potential to make a ton of money if you are dedicated and consistent. The company offers amazing benefits and consistent hours. There are many perks. It is difficult to move up in the company if you do not have a degree. With all of the downsizing the company is doing, job security isn't always strong."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Call volume could range from a few minutes between calls to consistent back to back with no break in between calls.  Supervisors are under pressure to keep all team members stats in line.
good,"Typical job, nothing fancy. I learned a lot about node.js and express.js to create several one page applications, but most of the employees use java. Overall average job."
good,"answering calls and helping Verizon customers with their technical phone problems, selling service to customers, answering calls regarding billing problems. and Helping customers get the phone plan they need."
good,Verizon WIRELESS Is A Metrics Based company. Customer surveys can either make or break you. Training takes 6 weeks to complete. Overall it's a good company to work for
good,Verizon is a great job to get your foot in the door for entry-level sales. The compensation is great and the work culture is great. The only set-back is when it comes to getting a promotion it is extremely difficult.
good,My position was mostly during Alltel management which I have no complaints whatsoever. Typical call center environment with considerable compensation for work well done.
good,"Good company to work for. Good work/life balance and fair compensation. Job security is minimal as with any company. Management is hit or miss and job culture is getting better. "
good,Co-workers and management were very nice but the work load was very heavy and I found the work load unrealistic.  Direct supervisors tried to work with the staff and defended our work while upper management only cared about getting more work done with less staff.  There was always the threat of lay offs.
good,"Great benefits and good salary, amazing vacation and holiday pay. Unfortunately just a name on paper in a big corporation where lately nobody cares how loyal of an employee you are."
good,"- Day to day Operations of Incident and Change Management "
good,"It's an okay job. Not ideal if your goals arent only performance based. A lot of conversation in the beginning about job progression and there has been some, but no room to really branch out into other fields."
good,"The job pays extremely well and includes great benefits. The job itself can be stressful with having to meet many so many different numbers while providing great customer service. The supervisors are not really helpful, in my experience, with assisting you in being successful. They're job security lies in the hands of the representatives so their main focus is that you are meeting your numbers and not so much about helping you grow. There are many supervisors that genuinely care about helping you grow in your career but that was not my personal experience. Overall, the benefits and the pay compensated for the lack of support from the higher ups and the great environment made possibly by fellow representatives made the job very manageable."
good,"I was brought to Verizon Wireless as a clerk to help teams in the finance department better organize and complete new orders. "
good,"Great Management partnership."
good,management needs to improve . the job is not hard as long as you are ok with sales . training process and company culture is good. I learned new sales and communication technic thru. this job.
good,I never thought I'd work for one of the most recognized industries in the world for 10+ years. They paid very well and I learned quite a bit. Thankful
good,"Action packed, heart stopping, two fisted fun. The latest technology and you're in the middle of it practically every day."
good,did not like the agency liked the company that I worked for and the TL was ok people on the team very young and childish nothing more to say about this place
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I was in Sales Support and Operations for almost 10 years with the company. "
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for with fantastic benefits!! However, job security no longer exists there!! During my 17 years with this company I have learned to cope with customers with complaints and remain patient with the irate consumers!! I have also learned to work alone and open and close a shift by myself and follow directions of emergency procedures individually!!"
good,Typical day at Verizon starts at 9 am until whenever. You could work a 8 hour day all the way up to 12 + hours. Be prepared to work with irate customers. You cannot be thin skinned. Coworkers are great. Overall company is a good company but I question their actions a lot of the time.
good,Verizon was a good company to work for with many benefits to it including versatility and mobility.  It had the versatility of being able to work in any of the 50 states in multiple capacities.
good,"great place to work, nice benefits and compensation, they also have career advancement. some location are starting to close. i had a nice experience working for this company"
good,"Verizon has outstanding culture and environment in order to work.  The only negative is in the opportunity to do things outside of your department, to advance."
good,"Typical day was about driving business and customer service. Verizon is an organization that teaches you about working hard , fast and disciplined.  The co- workers were always friendly , competitive and very loyal to customers. The challenging part of the job was growing the business and the best part of the job was the customers and making money."
good,Verizon was a good place t work but hours were a it crazy. retail hours are crazy and we were understaffed for wha needed to be completed. management was good but upper management was really not aware of the day to day workings
good,"Cool job. Very aggressive sales. I made good money for the time I was there but it is very easy to get stuck in time there. You have to cross the ""grey area"" in order to make money or you'll be like me. Job searching."
good,"Great job. It was tough to deal with some customers. But, the training was spot on. I was laid off from this job. I loved training new-hires and filling in for supervisors."
good,"I worked in their ""refer a friend"" department in Tampa, FL. Made a KILLING selling FiOS. Would have cleared $150k had the program not been dissolved. If it was still around and in the DFW area, I'd still be doing it."
good,"worked there for 2 years, then one day out of the blue, no warning, was advised I was being laid off.  I enjoyed my job and the benefits were really great"
good,"Fast  paced environment.  Interfaced with internal and external customers. As the environment evolved, online training was offered to maintain knowledge of new applications.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.  We all strived to do our best for our external customers."
good,A highly stressful line of business but great benefits package when joining the organization. Great community and flexibility in balancing work/life balance.
good,"I learned that the job I applied for wasn't what I was told it was to be."
good,"Always shifting hours,  unknown  advancement   opportunities and also  work life balance is poor. not enough time off to be with family around holidays also on shift."
good,"Very fast pace environment but also over work and under paid.  No room for advancement."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is very fast paced.  Every day is different.  I've learned so much since working at Verizon.  As an HR Business Partner we go through yearly training and hold weekly refresher trainings.  The hardest part of the job is staying on top of emails.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people.
good,"Unfortunately, Verizon was a depressing and stressful place to work. Hostile work environment that management did nothing to correct.  However, I learned a lot to enhance my job performance."
good,The job is very easy. We basically review medical documents for the veterans at the VA which is very helpful. I've learned so much about different medical illnesses and also different types of systems and processes while working here
good,A joy to be part of one of the global leaders in technology innovation. Stretched your abilities everyday while demanding the best for their clients.
good,"Great overall company, however, the job itself sucks.  Customers were the worst.  Opportunities for advancement for a position off the phone is very, very hard to come by.  You are micromanaged to death and made to feel like you are in kindergarten again.   Definitely not for me or anyone who is strong willed.  Apply at your own risk."
good,"Mostly my work is related to build and release. I did so many scripts for continuous integration and did scripts for deployment."
good,Learned a lot about sales. You're able to make good money and the experience has been great but some things can change. The job is easy and anyone can learn it just takes time to get that sales experience but has been great overall. A lot of good people and great co workers.
good,The company and benefits are great with Verizon.  It is the stress from the customers calling and yelling at you because they have not paid their bill.
good,"verizon as we know is a powerful telecommunications empire and with that comes a pretty hefty customer service center. i enjoyed the opportunity to talk to people and review their issues, or renewal of service, sometimes troubleshooting a phone, but only doing inbound calls can be a bit of a hastle when it is 8-9 hours of straight inbound calls. it was something i was able to look past due to the heavy payment and 401k compensation. The biggest issue is the training. I felt like just after a few weeks the management expected us to know every single response to every question and it was hard to keep up, even for the rest of my class. I had asked for more of a direct way to learn the material seeing as how a lot of us were struggling, i even propossed retaking the training course so i did not feel like i was going into the job blind but they had refused and for that i had to leave for something different."
good,Overall Verizon was a good company. But the job became very stressful  when it did not have to be. Certain policy and procedures were put into place that did not have the interest of there employees at heart.
good,The projects were very detailed oriented and due date driven. My team mates shared information and were there to assist if necessary. I learned how to navigate in numerouse internal company applications to generate research and reports.The hardest part of the job was dealing with possible live circuits that could not be disconnected in error.The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with external customers and completing projects.
good,"As a cable splicer/customer service technician my day was filled with gratifying work.  I learned from senior splicers/technicians and was able to test my abilities to provide superior service.  I was constantly challenged to meet my set goals within the company and received fully meets on all reviews.  The work load was erractic as dictated by the client requests for new service and maintenance on existing lines."
good,The way the place was ran it was great. I even helped open or close the place as if I was management however the pay was really low. The higher ups was cashing in on all our hard work.
good,"Fairly rigid work environment, "
good,"you have to sell or you will be written up, the verbal isn't really a verbal, it is said and then they write you up like a week later, it happened to a friend of mine. I sold well. I love to help people, I like to do the troubleshooting, and helping people save money on their calling plans. but unfortunately they are all about greed especially one particular AD in Chandler and one female sup that had to always be in the top 10 lol.!!!"
good,"Great salary and benefits, but limited opportunities for advancement.  Company is attempting to change culture from old thinking telephony company to a more modern entertainment and communications company,"
good,"A typical day at work. Co-workers are good."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I enjoy working for Verizon, but I would like to work in a field that is similar to what I obtained my degree in. The work environment is great and Verizon treats their employees well."
good,"Challenging, fast-paced, dynamic, interaction with many functional groups in different parts of the world; work with leading edge technology; innovative people practicing their craft of ingenuity."
good,"It's a good place to work great benefits and pay"
good,This was a fun place to work.  The work was rewarding since to could bring efficacy to the work place.  Work day was 9-5  and Monday though Friday.
good,"always busy working, solving problems in a efficient time frame, worked mostly on own, enjoyed learning new technology and freedom to work independently and also as a team when needed."
good,"Train staff on all solutions and products."
good,"I help customers troubleshoot their problems and guide them with steps to improve their services with Verizon. Working in this job. There's a lot of research involved for plans, data and new perks are available for Verizon daily so as a representative I must learn about new policy weekly."
good,"A Great place to work with excellent benefits "
good,Verizon is a diverse environment.  They provide a lot of training.  My coworkers are excellent.  Hardest part of the job is not being able to assist a struggling representative.  Most enjoyable part of the job is watching a team member progress.
good,"great benefits, pay is good. too many avenues to get resolution in position. employees work together. Too many rules to get things done."
good,"Verizon Wireless was a great company to work for in terms of having excellent benefits (medical/dental, 401k, tuition reimbursement) and being compensated very generously.  It was a typical retail environment in regards to having to work Sunday-Saturday, with any shift on any day.  So balancing work with life was very difficult.  One tended to miss out on spending time with the family.  I had a great relationships with store management and co-workers, but higher level management only had company views in sight and didn't really care too much about employees.  The hardest parts would have to be the hours, but everything else comes naturally to me.  Dealing with people and quotas are 2nd nature."
good,"My typical work day. Login to begin work at 8am. Process orders and take phone calls until 10:15am, log out for break. Log back in at 10:30am to continue processing orders and taking calls until lunch. Log out at 12 noon and back in at 12:30pm to continue work. Log out for break at 2:00pm and back in at 2:15pm to continue work until it was time to leave for the day. Complete tally sheet of orders worked, and log out for end of day at 4:00pm. "
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for as they take care of their employees. The benefits are the best i've seen, and they match up to 6% on 401k from day 1. "
good,"Verizon's VP leadership has issues developing and executing their vision past 6 months which creates issues with large hiring and layoff swings. Verizon consistantly lays off their VP's and SVP's every 18 months which means the direction and vision changes every 18 months. Due to this Verizon is consistently losing their best people due to fear of unemployment which makes it hard to execute long term plans. That's the bad news, the good news is that Verizon has a large amount of cash which does allow you at the management layer to develop some interesting products. "
good,"Learned alot coming out of college as my first job. Environment does not compare to bigger tech companies or startups. Need more perks, such as gyms, fitness reimbursement, lunches, company activities, etc. Older environment, need more younger talent."
good,Verizon has great benefits and a great tuition program. They have one of the best training programs around and really prepare you for your job duties. Many of the skills are transferable.
good,"I worked for Verizon and had to leave when I wasn't able to transfer to a retail location, due to high gas prices.  There's a lot of overtime opportunity, and a chance to make some great money to support your family."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,due to the constant demands and nerve wrecking positions they put their employees through when contracts are ending. Creates stress
good,"A great place for flexible working, good pay and work life balance if I the right area otherwise new opportunities are not there focus is on US control."
good,An interesting and exciting opportunity to work with supply chain/data analysis team and to learn the valuable knowledge that I have received from the project.
good,Excellent job experience and great pay. Got to travel to other systems for help meet customer demand. Only issue was the fact I agreed to 30 month contract and it lasted 17 months. Knowing Verizon's history I was smart to save and not blow my paychecks.
good,I was brought into the company with the promises of a pay that I didn't get and had to work with others that weren't as educated as I who made more just because they had more customer service experience than technical (which the company asks for). I also had to meet issues like during the six month probationary period you cannot fall ill or anything. Also if you do not come in at top pay you will not be able to use the benefits given to you so if you can stick it out it might be a good fit for you but if not don't bother.
good,"Pretty cool place to work. Great bonds made with co works and management. Fast pace, and the rules are always changing, so you need to know how to adjust quickly."
good,"Company, its goals and global culture is good. But local top management is too micro managing things and adds no value to business. They are sure to screw up motivated individuals."
good,A typical day at Verizon Wireless consisted of Managing Several business accounts ensuring that they are current per their balances. Also Marketing to ensure we made our clients aware of any new products and plans.
good,"I worked for Verizon Business as a contractor in 2008, in support of a mega outsourced network deal. In 2008 VzB did not have processes or tools to support Services delivery, nor did they have a team experienced in Service Delivery or Project Management - they did appear to have a deep & experienced Sales organization. They also had a wise, tenured executive that travelled months on end to be on client site, where I was, and he brought reason to chaos. This was a contentious gig with an unhappy client, but we all worked to get them sorted out. My skills were valued, though I felt I had to defend & champion my approach (bottoms-up planning of how long it takes to build world-wide infrastructure) to be taken seriously then.  I imagine it's a more mature services provider these days..."
good,"As a customer Service Rep, pretty sure you deal with people who are angry about their bills, phones, or want to upgrades but can't. Somethings have changed since working there, to accommodate people with want to buy phone whenever they want, but the explanation of their bills situation sometimes can be the worst part of the job, due to customers reaction and anger to their bill being so high. Sometimes working with 60-75 people a day and most of them have issues and they blame you for their issues is not fun. High stress job, Verizon Wireless is very confident in their services because the company built itself from scratch through the policies they created from day one. So they train their employees to stick with the policies and to be frank with the customers. The plus side is the discounts for working there, the instant view of new technology, the trips to Denver and Salt Lake City for training and seminars, the benefits and bonuses. They pay for your trips and hotels along with gas. So if you can detach from the drama and moody/evil customers, then this job has everything that people look for in  job."
good,the company was very profitable and it was plenty of opportunities to make money. Company just not a stable environment for longevity
good,"*A typical day of work consists of clocking in by computer systems, completing inventory, taking walk-in or appointments, selling any devices that require cellular service, and providing customer service."
good,I worked here for a few years and the experience taught me many things it helped me grow and learn I need to keep my personal and professional life separate. I am a kind person so I learned never show your weakness because in this busy you need to keep both eyes open.
good,"This company treats its customers better than its employees. Though there are some nice perks to being an employee, the expectations in the daily routine can be stressful and discouraging."
good,"Typical day was daily Customer contact and team contact. The entire branch worked as a team and was back up to each other in all phases . The Team had a firm commitment to the Core Values of the Company and we always have the Customers best interest at heart without jeopardizing our integrity."
good,"At Verizon I provided customers with business, government, and residential listings in all fifty states as well as Canada in a timely (30 sec or less), and professional manner."
good,Best coworkers ever! The company was great when I started 10 years ago but started to go downhill in the last 4 or 5 years! They use to treat their employees great and not so much anymore. Its a shame. They do pay really well though.
good,"- I work an 8 hour shift, 5 days a week, unless there is overtime available. Scheduled to work every other weekend."
good,"Great people to work with, I really enjoyed  my time working with Verizon Wireless. Not only did I learn a lot from this working for Verizon Wireless, I was also able to get them to pay for my schooling as well. It was really sad to see so many people get laid off from there."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A typical day at work would include: taking calls, providing customer service and technical support. Meeting briefly with the supervisor to discuss any changes and duties that need to be worked on."
good,"The company is trying to shift to selling new technology with mixed results.  Very cost conscious but and always trying to do more with less.  Growth opportunities are limited.  Decent management team, co-workers are great and always accepting new challenges.  Overall a good company but needs to execute the business plan to shift customer sales from older technologies to stay viable"
good,Great for Getting By.....Meet Many individuals throughout the day
good,Before customer service became in reality customer sales I would have rated Verizon 5 stars.
good,"Answering calls, taking payments and transferring to the right department. You have numbers that you have to meet but you also have to be nice, beg and plead to customers even if they are unruly"
good,"A typical day consisted of, receiving incoming calls from customers, problem solving and resolving issues/complaints in a timely fashion. upselling to customers to make sure they had all the nessecary services from Verizon."
good,Very demanding but pays very well.  Very long hours are required.
good,"My management and coworkers are great people to work with, which is why I've stayed with the company thus far. However, I feel that the work environment is something that wears on me. I am fine with customer service--which is the majority of my job, it's simply the hours. "
good,An average day at work is reviewing any product or promotion that is currently new and then implementing strategies on pitching it to clients. Reviewing yesterday's numbers and working on a plan to better those for the day. Being in a position that requires meeting a lot of quotas is stressful and my co-workers and I rely on each other for support when the stress is elevated. The hardest part of the job is meeting the metrics and wide range of goals that comes with wireless retail sales. The most enjoyable part of the job is educating new clients on the devices that come out monthly.
good,The culture of the call center was that of a fun and productive atmosphere.
good,"sell. sell. sell. big focus around sales in this job. lots of pressure to sell but when you can and do, you will be rewarded handsomely. the management does put a lot of pressure on the sales representatives but its only because they have pressure from the executives on them.....and so on and so on. co workers are nice for the most part. occasionally you get a coworker that is not a team player and is overly aggressive in sales. hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers and also sometimes the having to meet sales quotas and expectations. best thing.....the money"
good,"Verizon Is a very large company and there are a lot of different departments with plenty of representatives.  It is not easy to advance with this company.  I have established great friendships working for Verizon, personal and professional, but there is no time for conversation. Once you are clocked into the systems there are back to back calls. My goal is to find resolution for every customer. Verizon has improved my mutitasking skills and has made me aware that it is importand to establish a genuine connections with every customer.  My biggest concern with verizon is, the evolution of the objective is now conflicting with opportunity to advance within the company."
good,"This company is performance driven. Great place to work and very structured.  In customer service, it's all about driving numbers so it's very difficult when you have to choose between doing what's right or helping the customer. It's a challenging job and if you can do this job, you will be successful anywhere you go."
good,"While Verizon Wireless provided a great work experience in theory, it had a lot of gaps and areas of opportunity as it pertained to a work/life balance and the management team. The position I held, Global Enterprise Advisor, was completely unorganized and held the people in the role to unrealistic metrics and goals. The management team seemed completely disconnected from their direct reports, not only on the supervisory level, but also on the upper management level. There was no such thing as work/life balance either. Verizon was your job and your life, and they made sure of it. All in all, if you're looking for a job that pays well and has good benefits, this is a great job for you... especially with the great yearly bonus they give around tax time. But, if your looking for a job that is perfect or good in the way that operates or the way that you're treated as an employee, look elsewhere."
good,I learned that with the proper amount of time and patience almost any goals can be achieved.
good,"Great job, with great co-wokers."
good,"At the time, late 60s early to mid 70s this was a thriving company. Plenty chance for advancement .My section was all young people and of like mind, only my wanderlust took me away from here!"
good,Diverse company with many different employment options. This company has many of the same pros and cons you'd find in any major corporation.
good,"Job requires you give 150% of yourself if not they will ""coach"" for not stating the right things on calls"
good,"A typical day at Verizon for me was non stop calls that varied from billing, troubleshooting cell phones, adding services, assisting irate customers and researching customers problems. The hardest part of the job was having to answer so many upset customer calls back to back and then having to pursue them to give you a good survey so your job performance wont be in jeopardy. The job could be very streesful. Another thing were the constant shift changes, you could never really get comfortable outside of work knowing that your shift will have to change every 6 months. The people were very pleasant and the benefits are the reason most people stayed. Overall I found the job to far and very stressful."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Easy place to get comfortable and work, it is a sales job so you keep what you earn."
good,"Going to Work with Verizon Wireless can be rewarding if selling the hot topic items.  Management at my current location are not on the same page and makes my job a little harder.  Co-workers are main reason I enjoy my job.  Hardest part of my job is the long inconsistent  hours away from my family. A typical day for me is setting up my goals for the day, and staying on task to reach my goal as the day progresses."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their Verizon phone service and demonstrating problem-solving skills on a daily basis.
good,management and customer both can be difficult.  It was a very negative working environment.
good,"When I used to work for We-R-Wireless, I learned time management.  I was a full-time college student while working there fourty hours a week.  When there were no customers, I made sure that I was doing my homework.  I also learned that professionalism is more than how you dress; it is how you conduct yourself in front of the customers.  You never know who could be in a place of business.  "
good,Great place to work. Good pay and benefits. Employees stay withe the company and shifts are assigned based on senority.
good,"dynamic work environment"
good,"Long hours but great benefits."
good,"I work in a call center , so all you do is answer incoming calls from customers ranging from billings issues to technical issues; an there are metrics to meet. There is a lot of stress involved."
good,"Great money for technical support help desk, but it gets old fast."
good,"Splicing fiber optic cable, test cable terminals"
good,"place is a call center, so there are hardly any breaks or personal time. managment would be upset if you leave to use the rest room to many times. if you get into an agrument with a customer they always choose the customer over you"
good,"Verizon requires a lot of structure, which was nice."
good,It's a learning experience. The people I work with are good people and they are willing to train you and will gladly answer any questions you may have.
good,"Good company benefits"
good,"A typical day at work involved selling phone, internet and cable services to residence customers, collecting bills, and discussing bills.  Verizon was instrumental in teaching me to document correctly and effectively on all contacts."
good,"A typical workday started at 730 and ended at 4."
good,"Learned a great deal about program management and being a Foundation within a larger corporation. Very hands-on internship. Witnessed a few things: pay and benefits are great, just like the rest of the company; there's more red-tape than a typical Foundation or non-profit; and there's not a whole lot of growth for someone in an internship position or with only a few years of experience---seasoned workers are preferred--so consider this when applying if thinking long-term."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Management makes job more stressful by not providing the reporting system needed to attain account goals.  Many opportunities available to assist major accounts in maximizing their wireless performance.  Every day has opportunities to learn and grow your abilities and career.  Verizon is very big on promoting from within.
good,A typical day consists of applying new information with minimal training in a matter most effective for the customer inquiring.
good,Verizon management is uneven and relies on nepotism and favoritism. The job is secure only because it is a union show in NYC. Over the course of my employment the environment has devolved considerably and the opportunities for career advancement have all but disappeared.
good,"A typical day at verizon was busy. It was mobile sales so it involved alot of troubleshooting peoples devices or trying to recomend the best device that would suite them and there needs as an individual."
good,Great pay and great benefits. I learned a lot about supply chain and logistics.
good,Its been great working in Staffing Company. My Management is very co-operative.
good,"Great benefits and pay, poor work/life balance. Never ending metrics change."
good,"If you enjoy being able to have at your fingertips the latest technology, and can explain it in words that people can understand, this would be a great job for you.  Bear in mind that, like anywhere, you tend to become very relaxed with one another, and also bear in mind that cliques form when that happens.  Do your best to be a part of the clique that includes the store manager, and you should have a long and prosperous career."
good,"a typical work day will be busy. mgmt. as times will not be the best. the hardest part about the job is the always changing environment with polices for the company. the co-workers overall are a good group of people to work with, the definitely make it a better place to work. the most enjoyable part about the job is the people that you work with."
good,"In all honesty, it is hard to review this company. There have been days when I just absolutely love my job and days when I wonder ""why I'm I here?"""
good,Worked in an environment that would never settle for what you did yesterday.  
good,Verizon is a good place to work. I don't think it makes for a happy career. You become more of a number than a employee. 
good,Great paying job. Fast pace retail enviroment; and fast pace customer service on the phone jobs.
good,Worked mainly as a project manager and business analyst in Operations and Technology group. Worked from home and in offices as needed.
good,"A typical day at work began with inventory counts. On several days a week before the store opened we provided customer workshops to teach customers how to use their new smartphones, tablets, Ipads, or MBB devices."
good,Retail based environment which can be very stressful at times. High energy employees and managers keep you on your toes in an ever changing wireless technology world. Customers are the best and worst part of this job and of probably any retail job. Meeting several new people and developing new connections and relationships is always enjoyable.
good,"- Create, run, and manage reports that assist in the forecasting of non pay disconnects"
good,"We have our work scheduled, complete our day to day responsibility, good interaction with all the team mates, learn technical as well as soft skill improvement, helpful in Personality Development."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"co worker are very fun to be around, typical day is sales, I learned a lot from the job"
good,"The first seven weeks were awful. Although, their training program is top of the line, they drag it out over seven weeks. After that, you go on the phone training and I honestly felt that the training was about specific details instead of how to find answers within their training program. My hours were determined basically by my social security number and because I had one of the last in line, I got a really awful schedule. I had a two-month old at home and would have to leave for work when she was sleeping and come home when she was sleeping"
good,"A typical day is receiving calls from customers, resolving concerns, trouibleshooting, I learned excellent customer service skills, co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job is keeping caklls below 5 minutes, attaining their stats. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and resolving their concerns."
good,Busy call center environment. Co-workers helpful & nice. Fun place to work if don't mind some of the pressures that come along with the position as far as 100% voice of the customer which your bonuses & job are based upon.
good,Excellent co-workers
good,Typical day is heavy call volume answering customer questions or concerns regarding their wireless accounts
good,Company offers a lot of benifits and perks but has hidden agendas
good,The corporate atmosphere is competitive and the focus is market share and profitability.
good,"Usually we meet on the tutoring lab bus at Morgan State University. The bus takes us to a school. We tutor the kids which is the most enjoyable part of the work day. It could be managed better but, my co-workers were diverse. The hardest part of the job was communicating with management."
good,"As an Indirect Account Manager your day begins with reviewing prior days sales and identifying key metrics to focus on in your store visits. Organization of your day is key to having a productive and effective day in your locations. Organize where you will be visiting daily and what you will be discussing in the location, this is based on your morning review of sales and areas of opportunities. An Indirect Account Manager works on their own and must be self motivated to exceed sales goals and expectations. When in locations you will be training, coaching, and supporting the management staff and sales reps. The most difficult part of the job is making an impact in a short amount of time that changes a behavior. The most enjoyable part of the position is finding that your hard work is changing behaviors and resulting in an increase of sales."
good,"Verizon is a leading company in telecom and wireless. They are constantly developing new product lines to appeal to their customer. In product marketing, I learned a lot about lifecycle management and a lot about the retail process from call centers to retail stores."
good,"Currently experienced in working with TCP-IP based network infrastructures and monitoring tools commonly used in VoIP-based telecommunications platforms. In this position it allowed one to become very familiar with Cisco Call Manager, Version 7.x, UCCX, Unity and Cisco Unified Communications. Performs adds, moves and changes, call flow and phone tree updates, maintenance, CCM backups. Escalating and resolving Help Desk telecom calls; coordination and communication with support escalation teams Additionally, has experience working in medium-sized to large IT departments and working with a diverse range of administrators, engineers and developers."
good,"The selling, of products the customer request and computers, breaking down the pros and cons of each product!"
good,Great benefits and package but very demanding and busy.
good,"they have good benefits which is accessible on your first day of work. moving up in the company isnt that easy but the pay is decent. in comparison to att, verizon treats their employees the best."
good,"Rapid change in a high tech, wireless environment. Ability to impact many customers, across all verticals. As most of population now has a cell phone, opportunities for advancement are shrinking as positions are no longer back-filled and teams are consolidated."
good,"Verizon is a changing company, evolving from the ""phone company"" reputation it once had, into a cloud centric environment. The product set is changing rapidly to embrace the future of communications. I have met many interesting and knowledgeable people in my time at Verizon. The hardest and yet most enjoyable part of the job is learning about new products, and learning the interaction with vendor/partner products. I learned much there."
good,"Verizon was the result of a merger between GTE and Bell Atlantic. I went to work for the company when it was GTE.....a wonderful company to work for before Bell Atlantic took over. They gutted the place. Layed off people, cut the janitorial staff, removed the coffee, took out the plants in the lobby....even turned off the lights in the vending machines."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The work is diligent. The people are very friendly and overall morality is high.
good,"Overall Verizon Wireless is an ok company to work for. I work in a call center environment. The South center is very disorganized. There is minimal room for advancement. The hardest part of my job is adjusting to the inconsistency. The Northeast center that I origionally worked at was great. They were professional. And the center was all about career progression. The benefits are great. Working at Verizon Wireless, I get the benefits of an employee discount, annual bonus. The most enjoyable part of my job is resolving my customer's reason for calling."
good,"Lots of meetings, expect to be on meetings most of your work week. This leads to very little time to accomplish ambitious targets that often times are unrealistic. The targets are catered to upper managements political battle about who can accomplish what first. Most of the work is outsourced and the quality of resources offshore is very detrimental to satisfying your curious mind. If your looking for job security and the rinse-wash-repeat cycle this is the place for you. This is a good place to start but once you plateau move elsewhere fast."
good,"Working with customers, construction, engineers and peers is very stressful every day. Although the salary and benefits are great to me the stress isn't worth it."
good,If you hustle you can make a lot of money here. Watch for competition amongst team members. Everyone's out to make a buck by adding a couple of NEW LINES!
good,Able to teach reps how to sell and use the proper tools to bring in revenue for themselves and the company
good,"Love what I do but no longer find it enjoyable. Daily functions consists of assisting customers with all aspects of account. Primary function is to assist with any issues with phones/usb modems/pc/laptop and various software. Management is no longer involved with day to day operations. Sucess is only measured against required rankings. My favorite part of the job, is all the good friends I have made throughout the years and the things I continue to learn. Also, that I have been able to remain with one company for almost 12 years."
good,Benefits & pay were great but you will work for every last penny. They say that they're focused on core values & integrity when it comes to the customer but unfortunately no consideration is given to the employee (in my personal opinion).
good,A typical day at work was helping customers find the right solutions for there phone needs. working with all types of people and learning how the company works.
good,"Verizon has excellent benefits and job security as long as your doing your job. What you will find at times supervisors arent helpful and know less than the reps do. They pride themselves on values and ethics, but for the most part dont live up to their word. For example, a schedule pass allows you to be excused for part of the day and your allowed to make it up during alloted times before the pay period is up. Most call centers follow this rule to a T, but my center didnt. You couldnt do passes on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday and all make up time just happen to be on these days. Its a very stressful job dealing with customers who 8 times out of 10 call in very upset. Good Luck managing your time. Its hard because you will began to see the mental stress of the job will cause you to be absent more than you may have from any other job. Your time will go fast. I give it by mid summer you will have no time for the rest of the year."
good,Work work work and hard schedules when you have a family.
good,"This is a place that has many people trapped because of its benefits and vacation plans, which are great. Everyone there wants to leave. Everyone there is stressed. The operators have the general public on the one hand, who don't know or care that we are working with a severe time constraint, and management on the other, who don't realize how difficult it is to work with the public. The lucky operators find better jobs elsewhere. The unlucky ones are either still there or they found jobs with less stellar benefits and pay. They are not hiring but shrinking, so most likely no one will even see this review."
good,"A typical day was fast paced, but rewarding - feeling needed and helping others at their time of need."
good,"Verizon's FIOS product line makes sales of current and existing products very profitable, coupled with an excellent salary compensation and free benefits under union contract makes individual employee saisfaction high."
good,"Fast paced environment assisting sales agents daily. Knowledge of consumer reports and sales options available in order to process activations and service for the agents. I good experience. A good job, Typical day at work? On the phone, assisting the sales agent advising of correct Verizon porcedures to process approval for a consumer for service."
good,"When I first started a couple years ago, there wasn't has much pressure and commissions were generous. Every year since I have been with the company more is required and commissions has gone down. You are no longer sales in the store, you are also a tech, customer service, and everything else. But still have the same quota. Good job if just getting out of college, but don't stay long."
good,"Verizon Wireless is good place to work. Very team oriented, accountable environment. Everything is about being on time and numbers. No work day is typical because each call is a different scenario; so one is constantly thinking on their toes."
good,"I worked for Verizon Wireless for 7 years; started out as a part time sales representative, moved up to management. Although it was a typical retail environment, I will say that Verizon Wireless provided excellent training, they even covered expenses for travel and hotel stay if the site was remote. Rating management should go by a store by store basis, but I am happy to say that I enjoyed working for every manager that I worked under. I've witnessed employees at other locations where reps were disgruntled due to management. The negative aspects of the company dealt with compensation. As most companies who struggled through the tough economy (from 2008 and beyond), Verizon was no different. Targets and quotas were stretched beyond attainment, commission checks could fluctuate as much as double or triple (up or below) from month to month. The company has great benefits and even paid for my college tuition; I ultimately finished my B.S. Business at a university. It's a great entry level job for those looking to advance in their career. Opportunities for advancement into corporate (or business sales) depend on who you know, and how far you're willing to travel to the nearest HQ."
good,"I loved working at Verizon Wireless! Since this was a retail position, I wanted to venture into outside sales to see how successful I can be. I felt limited at times by how many customers I can help and up sell by being closed 'indoors.' I accomplished some very extravagant objectives, and the compensation was good. I often miss working for Verizon Wireless, but I know I can be more successful outside of the retail settings."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A franchise that sells Verizon products and services. Usually I clock in, update my portion of the sales board in the manager's office, grab a key so that I can open up a drawer to ring from, and check the inventory room so I know what's available in store to sell."
good,"most enjoyable part of the job- great pay, benefits, tuition reembursement. Great place to learn and grow with a company that is consistently benchmarking the industry."
good,The company is very large so advancement is an option but it is all about work. The company has been around a long time so it sticks to the old ways of running a company... you work - you get paid.
good,Not a lot of room for growth but a good company to work for. A lot of jobs are going to a comission pay with a base salary.
good,"There is no such thing as the typical workday. I learned flexibility, critical thinking, and teamwork above all."
good,"It was a door to door job, so if you like knocking doors or are good at it its the job for you i love sales, but door to door is not for me, the pay way great and the people were very good to me"
good,"Although its basically saleing cell phones and different types of wireless equipment, the constant pressure of meeting sales quotas and keeping a customer base was a bit overwhelming."
good,"My experience with Verizon was only 2 years. Prior to that the company was MCI and prior to that Worldcom. Despite the issues that arose with Worldcom, my experience with both Worldcom and MCI was enjoyable. I was able to further my work experience as well as advance into other positions."
good,"They call it the golden handcuffs for a reason. Once you get a $1,200.00 weekly paycheck it is hard to leave no matter how bad the work experience is"
good,"I started as a customer service rep and liked the diversity of dealing with different types of situations people all day long. I had paid training and the job allowed me to learn about the technical and administrative sides of the business. But sales and handle time eventually became more important than helping customers. Benefits were great, good pay, virtually free medical (depending on what you choose) to tuition reimbursement, to 401K and childcare reimbursement program during the summer. I didn't like being 'squeezed' between the union mandates, such as slowing down work at their command, and management making changes 'every 5 minutes' (it seemed) that the union didn't agree with. If you don't do what the company says, you risk losing your job. If you don't do what the union says, you are sort of 'black listed' and made an example of."
good,The company has created a high stress environment that has a high turn over ratio. For the employees who have tenure the have adjusted to the high call volume and take the day in stride.
good,"The job provides Good work-life balance. So if you need that from a typical retail job, then this could be a good foot."
good,"Good pay...not sure they are about the employee. Long hours, main focus was on making money and not the employee."
good,It was an okay company to work for. Management team wasn’t my thing therefore I left. Medical and dental and vision were really good benefits. That’s all I got
good,"The management are selected more often than not by favourites. Meaning that these individuals are unable to LEAD, MOTIVATE, and PROMOTE. The overall challenges is the quotas that were in place when I was present. Just stay focused and you are able to meet all challenges and most of all learn WHO you are!"
good,I wanted to study my profession so I left. My manager was great because he showed me how to read situations in life better not just in a transaction. Definitely a good job
good,"Culture could be better. Current IT mgmt needs to be changed. Need more inclusive mgmt in IT. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Workplace was too extreme, due to the privacy of customers we were unable to have anything out. I understand the technology but we couldn't even color in our down time, do crossword puzzles or anything."
good,Absolutely love working at Verizon! However I can't continue to handle the schedules that they give. Schedule bidding is done sporadically and 50% of it is based on seniority. So being in the pro group has a newer employee I have top performance and still get terrible shifts. For example my next schedule will be working Saturdays and Sundays as well as later in the evenings when I have two small children that I will not get to see.
good,Good place to work . Its slow paced and very competitive. There is a lot of work politics going around the  teams. Overall a good place to work in. if your manager is good
good,"Overall experience was positive. I learned quite a lot from my time working here. As a student it is often difficult to find a balance between school and work, however management was very understanding of my situation and helped create a flexible work schedule. The one issue that I had while working there was the lack of training by the company. It seemed that a lot of the day-today interactions were learned on the job.This left me feeling unprepared in certain workplace scenarios. Perhaps a more solid training program for new employees will benefit the company and its employees in the future."
good,"Door to Door sales. great people, bad at respecting off hours. Flexible hours but its essentially based off your effort, most of the time. Commission based only"
good,"The managers have demanding goals, which are placed upon employees. Calls are back to back, with not a lot of breathing time between calls. Excellent benefits and pay, however this job is not for weak minded. It takes a lot of discipline and you cannot take the calls personally. More time should be devoted to culture and more down time between calls. They are more concerned about conformance, than performance."
good,"fast paced, competitive sales environment. if your sales quotas aren't met consistently every month you will be looking for a new job before you know it"
good,"To reach your goals can be VERY hard. Some are set for you to fail. Different supervisors arent consistent across the board. However, great pay and benefits and you can advance. A LOT of people are constantly on leave for stress and anxiety. If you're new you are great, but after a while you can easily get burned out."
good,Gree guest count inventory make calls clean sell phones and other Verizon items post sales in group messages clean do and watch trainings clock out for lunch
good,"You never knew what you were going to walk into each day. The customers needed a lot of help, but that is why we were there. As long as you were willing to take the next customer and full of energy, you were able to make a good living."
good,No shortage of incoming calls people available to assist with your calls. Lots of options when it comes to managing work/life balances. Strict about following schedules and not taking breaks when not scheduled to do so.
good,"Very stressful, micromanagement. Rude customers depending on your location. Managers always ""looking"" over your shoulder to see what your doing and how your doing it. If they dont like how your doing it or if higher managers dont like how your doing it (even though it's getting the right results), they will force you to do it their way or they will write you up and ""threaten"" to fire you. You get written up if your not selling enough of a certain device, and they dont pay you your whole commission kf you dont get to the desired percentage."
good,Significant growth and development as a leader.  Developed strong presentation skills as well as the ability to plan and execute strategy to meet company goals and objectives.
good,I enjoyed helping customers solve problems and/or finding solutions to make their lives easier. There was a very diverse customer base in this area. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting new people all day and assisting them with their needs.
good,"lots of hard work and long hours, including weekends.The insurance and other benefits are fantastic. There is a lot of change in management, so must be flexible."
good,It is a good place to work.  Has a lot of advancement opportunities.  Has great benefits.  The company provided the option of working from home which is very beneficial.
good,"I loved my boss, but the people I worked with were bullies and mean.  It was close to my house, which was great.  But I hated going there everyday but had to bring home the money"
good,"Learned a lot in my 25+ years at Verizon - from customer service, to sales, to team management and relationship building.  Great pay and benefits  - Pays for your schooling too!   "
good,"Benefits and compensation were great, however I had a problem with some of the way management operated.  There was a lot of micromanaging and some of the sales techniques used were not always 100% ethical.  Management got a commission based on the performance of the store, so they didn't always care what you had to do to sell a product, they just wanted to see numbers.  Often a lack of wanting to assist customers who were there for troubleshooting or instruction, wanting to focus on sales."
good,It's a ok place to work but the management does a horrible job when you need them. Management does not want to help when needed. You normally have to go find them or they are some place  out of the building.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A typical day at work with Verizon is taking over 100 inbound calls, as well as conducting outbound calls. For every customer that would call in, it was expected that the customer was completely satisfied with the resolution provided. Every survey taken by the customer should be giving a 'Yes' to our calls, or else it would be a coaching/write-up by our supervisor(s). "
good,"The culture is great, however, it focuses on the Hispanic heritage as most of our Operations Team and Director are Hispanic.  If you put in work you can progress, however, they want you to kiss butt to advance, I don't do that."
good,The job is very stressful and the work hours are by bid factoring your metrics and seniority. you do weekly role plays and weekly coaching everyone has their own way of doing things and depending on your supervisor sometimes its their way or no way
good,Good place to work with bright people and good salaries. Tis company has so many re-orgs the company is constantly in transition which causes problems.
good,It's a call center there is really not much to review.  I have never worked in a call center prior; so there is nothing to compare it to.  I have enjoyed my experience and trainings.
good,"Driving innovative ways to establish a positive culture within my team and creating our future leaders"
good,Work-life balance is a bit challenging. Overall a great company to work for if you are career oriented. Great pay and benefits and be sure to continue to develop new skills to maintain your current role. Hardest part of working with this company is to see constant restructuring meaning layoffs. Verizon Comm owes billions of debt when they purchased VZW from Vodafone and needing to thrive with fierce price competition is causing layoffs.
good,"Worked for a short time because I had to move and there wasn't any jobs available to transfer to at my new location. I loved the new hire process and the health care benefits, but I hated working in a cubicle staring at a computer all day. Just wasn't for me but could be a great opportunity for someone else."
good,Amazing job amazing pay if your management matches your drive to be hard worker you will succeed. Great pay and also good opportunity for a career hard work and attention to every detail  is most important.
good,I work with great people.  Unfortunately the work load demands are sometimes unrealistic and this has a very negative impact on the morale of all teams in our department.
good,"greet customers and build a small relationship based on their needs."
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for from a compensation standpoint. There are plenty of opportunities for training and growth. There company is constantly changing, which can be good. The question is at what point is their too much change without understanding the impacts or prior decisions."
good,"Great Company, Great Benefits, Great Co-Workers and Perks... The Customer Service and Schedules are AWFUL and leaves no time to actually live a life. If you like money and have little responsibility, then this is the job for you."
good,"Culture is good, benefits are good, commission structure needs improvement.  Honestly, my coworkers are the best part of my job.  I've worked several jobs and the best part about any job is your coworkers."
good,I really believe that Verizon wireless is a pretty nice place to work and you do learn a lot while working their. I would definitely recommend someone else to work
good,"The benefits are good, not a fan of call centers. There are opportunities that present themselves but there are a lot of lateral positions that are temporary."
good,"I love the company, have been here since graduating college the first time. Great benefits and experience. The location is good. I wish there were more opportunities to circulate."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Overall it is a good place. But I expected the offices to be more modern. It really feels like government offices. Compensation is pretty good and the facilities are also good.
good,"Management there wasn't great."
good,"for me the worst part of this position was the noise level on the call floor.  most of the time, I could barely hear myself talk and struggled to hear the customer on the phone."
good,Nice place to work.  Good benefits and great management.  Would for sure work for them again if the opportunity presents itself.  Positive work atmosphere.
good,"The work place culture was decent. Great pay and plenty of opportunities for advancement. Great benefits, 401k, tuition reimbursement, flexible spending account."
good,"The best part was the pay. The management was poor, the work/life balance was non-existent, they energy within the workplace was always very negative. If you don’t come into the company at management level, you will not be respected."
good,"Lots of recent lay-offs and cut backs.  Many high perfomers have let which leads to inexperienced managers and an increase in turn-over.  They have made it a lot harder to make money by raising the quotas to unattaineable  levels.  I feel like with all the cut-backs we are given too many additional things to do (other than sell) that it is negatively impactint our sales and pay checks.  I took a $25,000 pay cut last year with the same level of performance."
good,The pay and benefits were amazing but he time off and balance with he shift changes twice per year was horrible. No flexibility for performance. There was always something new to learn that we never used
good,Verizon offers good benefits and pay however there are a lot of politics within the organization in regards to cliques and favoritism. The supervisors tend to pick their favorites for special assignments and promotions.
good,"High stress environment, FCC regulations caused very strict policies on how long your call could be, how long your breaks were, competitiveness and short call requirements caused unethical additions to packages that customers would call about a few months later after the ""free trial"" ran out."
good,"I've been here 2 years and for someone who's only 22, making almost 30 an hour is amazing. But I'm a techy and would rather stress over something hard rather than deal with the constraints of being reprimanded for not offering to sell something to someone who just spent 20 minutes yelling at you because they didn't pay the bill."
good,"Good job with great pay, but no room for advancement.  From start to finish, answer phones, resolve customers issues and sell.  Management is slightly out of touch with sales process because they have not done it in several years."
good,worked at verizon for a very long time  but after the mergers with sprint and att the race was on to be #1.there was a point that the head of the call center wanted every one put on some kind of correction action  as a scare tactic no matter what you performance was. this is not how you should a business
good,Verizon is a great place to work at as far as career advancement goes. The people there are friendly and the work environment is great but there a sense of favoritism amongst teams
good,"I've met a lot of great people, and have learned so many skills through working with Verizon. However, it is almost impossible with the hours of work we put in to have a decent work/life balance."
good,"Handling a high volume of calls in a very brief time frame with high accuracy and extreme courtesy."
good,"You are either in ""in"" or the  ""out"" crowd - opportunities to grow are there but heavily contingent on the network you build ; not unlike other organizations"
good,"Great place to work overall. however if you are ok with doing the same job function for the next 20 years of your life, then this i for you. Call center life. you can advance if you want to relocate to another state."
good,"there is no balance of job/home life.however, they do pay for you to go to school. so thats good. You have to have senority to get decent hours. Change energizes us!"
good,"Verizon was a great place to work. They offered benefits from day 1, had a good training program and management. The environment is extremely stressful though because of constantly changing goal targets. The management was very good at making sure you didn't make too much money with ever increasing sales goals."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Good Company overall to work for from a corporate standpoint.  They appreciate a work life balance with a lot of opportunity for advancement.  Higher up roles have a lot of external hires.
good,"If you are not located in corporate headquarters (Basking Ridge, NJ), then career advancement is little to none unless you are willing to re-locate multiple times."
good,They keep trying to reinvent the wheel. Instead of asking the technician how to improve things they hire someone who has never done the job to fix the wheel. Upper management tends to distrust everyone which makes for a poor work environment.
good,"I worked for a premium retailer, not worth it. Pay wasn't that great - no commission. overworked under-appreciated. The owners were awesome, but the corporate micro managers always did us dirty."
good,It is a very fast paced place to work. If you have a good management team you are able to work together to be able to meet sales quotas. However if you do not have that support structure it will be much more difficult to be able to keep your head afloat to be able to make a standard commission.
good,"Accounts were set up by unscrupulous individuals who never fully explained the charges on the future bills that customers received. Management presses operators to SELL, SELL, SELL!!!"
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for if you are interested in the technology field. They are making a lot of interesting changes to set themlselves up for the long term. There are truly excellent benefits such as medical, health, 401K, profit sharing, tuition assistance, etc.  Verizon is a large fortune 15 company with a lot of potential for development."
good,"Its sales, you have to lie to the customer, give them things they don't want, need or even can afford. You are required to make them hate themselves and their decisions while walking out. If you don't, you don't get paid."
good,"La empresa ofrece un paquete laboral muy bueno (por encima del promedio del mercado: 14 sueldos conforme a ley, bonificaciones por cumplimiento, reparto de utilidades, reembolso para capacitaciones, etc)."
good,Verizon offers wonderful benefits and has multiple opportunities for growth. It is a very fast paced environment and constantly changing but they are great with providing training for the frequent changes.
good,"Verizon provided opportunities to work in different roles. Allowed a nice work/life balance. A typical day is working with business users to address requirements, issues and work with development teams to find resolutions."
good,great place to start a career to make good money but the commission structure is always changing how they pay you. they are starting to pay less to do more work
good,"I worked at Verizon full-time (More than 20 years)"
good,"Verizon is a very competitive performance based company. The high stress atmosphere is balanced by the excellen compensation and benefits. In my experience employees are paid higher than their counterparts in other organaizations. However, advancement requires relocation."
good,Made cold calls and meet business that were in my territory for new products and maintain current plan. as well look for new business also managed 16 reps for business sales. I learned all my sales from Verizon. management was average a lot of micro management. Work culture was good really enjoyed everyone I worked with
good,It was a nice i enjoy my time the great people a amazing workplace culture. hard working people i really enjoyed my time at the faclity........................
good,After 20 plus years of loving my job I was moved to the WBG.    I hated every minute of it.  Stuck in an office with an electronic lease.  I requested a package and got it 6 months later.
good,"Overall Verizon was a great place to work, I just feel like the culture at my particular location didn't work well for me. Good Pay, advancement was limited to who you new and not actually your skill set though."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I was always stressed out working here."
good,"Verizon is a great place to learn, since the Global In-house centre (GIC) is going through a technology & talent transformation. Though there has been some negative press about Verizon in the recent times, rest assured, its a good place to learn and experiment."
good,A solid phone company that laid off employees to be more profitable. Many solid coworkers lost their jobs because Verizon's market share had topped out and they can sell phone's through retailers and make more money.
good,"I worked in the conferencing center. I would answers phones, answer emails, and take reservations. I loved working with the people. The hardest part of my job is that you had to multi-task. I was able to do with due to the fact that I have in past jobs."
good,"While working for Verizon can be a very rewarding career, the truth of the matter is that no job is really ever safe.  "
good,"Very good people to work with and great pay. Training was lacking, probably due to budget constraints. Unfortunately, I was caught in a company wide staff reduction."
good,This is a typical workplace struggling with adapting to changing technology and moving toward IoT and digital media. Excellent benefit and rooms to grow.
good,"If you can adapt and constantly be working on your skills, there is a lot of room for advancement within this company. Job security, however, does not exist here. There are always layoffs and well qualified employees losing their jobs for budgetary reasons. Always be looking for your next job if you plan on working here."
good,Pretty good place to work. The management changes frequently. Policies change on a daily basis. The company should roll out New products more in advance to help the employee and customer.
good,Verizon has great benefits with low out of pocket healthcare and excellent 401K and employee profit sharing plans. Very relaxed place to work. The place was easy to get to off of Route 28.
good,Stressful fast paced job. Job is demanding. Customers were not easy to deal with sometimes. Some employees provided support. Monthly goals that must be meet.
good,"good work environment/flexible working time."
good,I like working for Verizon Wireless (Wireless Zone) it had a great store culture. I loved my store manger. My typical day started with my opening up the store and prepping for the day.
good,"Verizon was a great place to zero in on your skills and abilities. It was a tremendous place for career growth, competitiveness and where you were allowed the ability to fail forward."
good,"Verizon was fast paced, long hours and demanding customers. BUT the benes are great. good health benefits, nice people, great phone discounts, awesome training program, l learned a lot"
good,Verizon is in the middle of transition and is looking to evolve in the near future.  It's network department is on the older side and could use hiring some younger employees.
good,"stressfull job, very busy not enough help must follow strict guidlines on every call.   the company was once great to work for loved my job till the last few  years... everyone in the company is miserable."
good,"Good salary and Benefits."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Discounts and paid time off, great 401 k plan to.invest in included a yearly bonus with how well the company does over the quarters do. Great people is a plus!"
good,"Verizon is a great place to work for the long haul, but for younger professionals looking to grow, not so much.  Management is old school.  But the work day is always 8am to 5pm and there is some flexibility working from home depending on the group you are in."
good,"My years were with Southwester Bell Telephone, SBC, & AT&T. Although I worked closely with GTE/Verizon I was not actually employed nor paid by them.  My goal was to take both Business & Residential customers away from them."
good,I enjoyed my time at Verizon the job was overall excited and pleasing I would take another job like it in a heartbeat...the culture was everything to me along with the work life/home life balance
good,"Scope to learn new technologies."
good,Verizon provides an amazing learning environment and provides a lot of opportunities to learn new skills and move to the next level. The downside is a heavily biased management and a language-specific work culture which makes it difficult for an individual to work for a long time. Also the work life balance is given minimum attention as the need to impress the onshore team is more than anything else.
good,"The day would start with counting inventory "
good,"Felt there was no right only wrong. Would get a hour meeting of what did wrong, but five minutes of what one did good or get praise. The good was they always worked with you, but sometimes the negative became more than the positive."
good,"Constant changes working in call center there are  changes. If you do not keep up with the changes    It is very difficult to keep up with the word life "
good,"I enjoyed working at verizon most of the days, the environment and co workers were very friendly but highly competitive. The commission and incentives were also good and i could not say anything bad about the manager i had."
good,"opportunities for advancement. Decent benefits, pay was fair. Each day was different. Meet lots of people. Downside, always open except for Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas."
good,"I imagine Verizon is not the only place where you feel a constant friction from others trying to climb the corporate ladder.  I do recommend Verizon Wireless for employment, but do not work here expecting to make long lasting friendships."
good,"good to work here and learn new technologies in cloud platform like devops,aws,ansible,cloudfoundry,service now."
good,"Verizon has great advancements for career growth, they have good health care. They have fun activities they do every year, and always work on work- life balance."
good,The job is like any other customer care position. The people are great and the staff trains you very well. At times very dynamic and high paced. Then there are days where you will have a heavy workload and will be challenged to exceed at what you do. Overall good to place to work.
good,"Daily sales activities can become very cut-throat as all sales reps are trying to meet their individual quotas. If you are willing to work hard, Verizon can offer a great career path, although you do have to pay the system and work to be on a few peoples ""good side""."
good,"I worked at Verizon as a contractor. I learn a lot about Verizon network systems, management and Verizon workplace culture."
good,Excellent leadership team with an outstanding team of engineers. Management cares and the clients are well taken care of. The organization believes in educational fundamentals to ensure best practices are met.
good,"I liked working at this Verizon because of the manager that was previously there, he cared about his staff and employees also the customers that came in.  But above him were the rudest and cruelest leadership team.  I understand a business needs to make money, but to shove it down customers throats and making them feel uncomfortable was a sick joke of doing so.  But our manager stood up for the customer service first then to sales which made our reviews great and kept having customers come back."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"verizon is  a good company, one of the best training programs in that industry. Managers are always learning and evolving through online and classroom training."
good,"This job has a great compensation but expect working holidays, overtime and to put your life aside."
good,Although the benefits and compensation was good. Some of the managerial staff did not look out for the best interest of the employees. The company did not allow the employees to work to their fullest potential and did not provide the means to do so.
good,"Continuous system issues impede the ability to be productive. Applications and such continually shutdown in the middle of transactions. This creates a continuous stressful atmosphere when "
good,Started with Verizon as a sales rep... loved it because i love talking to customers and getting to know other people and offering them other solutions is a no brainer. After a while Verizon started to make changes to the retail side that they never did before. I wanted to grow within the company under the operations side but the company took alot of those operations position out and wont be fulfilled again which is a big bummer because i really like Verizon because the benefits are amazing.
good,"GTE became Verizon and is now Frontier which is a whole new "
good,"A typical day at work is very busy.   This is a very detail oriented company.  Very smart, intelligent teams work very long and hard to accomplish tasks.  This is a great company to learn and work for if you are single.  If you have children or expect to leave on time, this is not the organization for you."
good,"Started out as greeter at the front door. Got name and what visit was for.  Then went to Campaign manager made calls to customer about events, upgrades etc. Was on the phone eight hours a day. Small store. Few employees. Hardest men worked there for years together was not room for advancement.  Customer were the best part of the job."
good,"Verizon is quite good company to work in specially for girls employee. It has job security and decent work culture."
good,"I enjoyed my work and my teammates at Verizon.  Sadly, the product line I was responsible was being phased out.  Otherwise, would have not left Verizon Business."
good,"Employee benefits number one, advancement geared only for sales force.  From the customer service level not very promising, unless you do sales.  Maybe this will change and accommodate the lower level employees"
good,"Worked with Account Team to design and manage changes on Toll Free Applications used in Contact Centers. I learned how to develop the applications using a GUI - Graphic User Interface, then I was promoted to a Project Manager involved in requirements gathering and tracking the progress of the project through the Implementation phase, testing and deployment to production. Troubleshooting priority 1 trouble tickets could be stressful at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team. Training employees, and seeing them be successful."
good,"Overall, an exciting place to work.  Weekly meetings and staff report.  Teamwork fostered and advancement probable.  Worked with 1,500 customers to assist them in business planning and marketing campaign development."
good,talking to customer and selling products to them. I learned how to talk to a customer the right way. Management thought us everthing we know. the co workers were great and help ever step of the way
good,"Majority of managers are helpful, must be extremely competitive and give 100% customer service. Downside, there is not much of a work/personal life balance."
good,I loved working for Verizon it was quick paced and a fun work environment. No day was ever the same. The only down fall was the fact that it was solely commission.
good,"I answered customer calls regarding billing& account information, as well as cell plans and cell phone offerings."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Everyday we would have team meetings from 10:30am to 12pm about product knowledge. Lunch from 12-1. We would work in the field from 2pm to 8pm knocking on at least 75-80 houses trying to sale our product. Lastly we would wrap up the day with a quick 20-25 min meeting about our day and we would leave the office around 9-9:30.
good,Verizon is a great company and I love working for the company. I enjoyed the culture and family oriented relationship that we had in our store.
good,"Great benefits"
good,This job is a bit stressful if you're not ready to take phone call after phone call. I thought it was a great fast paced company to work for. Definitely made the days go by faster. Management is always open for you to talk to.
good,"To whom much is given, much is required. Politics as usual. Call center life is hard. Supervisors are not respected; it's the least honorable job in the entire company."
good,"Pros"
good,The people are great but the management is lacking in experience. No advancement and the choose same people for special projects.
good,"Its a good company overall, but the pay needs to be more than it is for the amount of work they require, the stress it causes mentally due to irate callers and constantly requiring more from their workers, but no increase in pay. When promoting in this company, the first supervisor levels, they will not give raise, but ask much more from you."
good,"Inbound calls, answer questions and concerns in regards to plans and calling areas. explain billing concerns. explain features for equipment.sell products and services."
good,"Good company to work for but going through major transformation that will require lots of downsizing to get to healthy numbers. As technology disruptions: OTT, IPTV, Wireless price wars, cord cutting is taking a toll on the business model and margins."
good,Met with customer install services give customer education on their new products. Close out jobs with the use of tablet.
good,Great pay and benefits from job. Not great if looking for a home life balance. Long hours with lots of extra work days. Not easy to have family life/time with this job. But great for single people looking to advance their career!
good,"Training is fantastic. Verizon is a stressful place to work, but Director made the work place fun by having games, and prizes and truly recognizing employees hard work."
good,"answering incoming phone calls "
good,Working for a major corporation was a great experience. The company had excellent benefits but lacked in flexibility and promotional opportunities.
good,"fast pace and competitive making sales and offering solutions to customers that will best suite their needs."
good,Expected to do follow ups while talking to other incoming callers. Very busy and high numbers to meet. It is possible to perform well and if you do the pay is good and so are the medical benefits.
good,The job and culture of the job is great. Sales is the main part of the position but being quick on your feet and staying current about products is key.
good,Management and morale is low. Just a regular call center. Great insurance and benefits. Matches 401k up to 6%. If you are not looking to move then career advancement is scare.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Its not a bad place to work. The south is a bit different in their freedom of speech and actions, but overall its a good please to work.  Good benefits and with tenure, lots of leave time. Phone team can be a very stressful job and right after the new years calls can be back to back since vacation time starts up all over again."
good,"Best training I have ever had. I felt extremely prepared."
good,The company is a good company to work for. Excellent benefits when you start on the first day. Can be stressful b/c of so many changes within the company often.
good,"Met lots of new people."
good,not a whole lot of work and life balance but good pay and many opportunities for advancement if you can sell. paid vacations
good,"It was a very fast paced work environment, so I was busy all the time. The best part of my job was definitely my co workers. Successfully planned and executed corporate meetings, lunches and special events for groups of 100 + employees. Received numerous customer commendations for customer support."
good,"Verizon has great benefits.  The tuition reimbursement is great.  $8,000 a year towards school.  The yearly bonus is also a plus."
good,"Great pay and balance of life. Decent Amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. Love the amount of days you receive for personal and vacation. Did not like the Tardy policies due to having an occurrence if you are 6 minutes late especially if there was traffic or having a hard time getting in the building. Love the Job overall would work there again"
good,"The company offer great benefits but has quite a bit of work to do on their culture and making their employees feel appreciated.  Their training program is extensive and exceptional and your co-workers are the real reason you come to work.  They make it feel like family.The company does meet federal standards for breaks and  lunches, otherwise be prepared to be onthe phone full time."
good,"This companies fast growing pac makes it an awesome place for advancement. But you must move around to move up. But no degree needed for advancement, just a good work ethic. The job becomes your life though. But for that you have a chance to make a six figure income."
good,"Help people with their phones, open accounts or close them. You do work a lot and hours are very long and hard to have a balances."
good,"A typical day - Good"
good,"Handle directory assistance calls, I have learned many aspects of this job through the years. Worked clerical, payroll, secure information and reports. Handled complaints, escalating procedures to help assist customers. Co-workers are helpful and show shortcuts they have learned to help assist you in helping customers. The hardest part of the job is how is has changed and it doesn't seem customer service oriented, its use the information they have and if they don't have enough its an attitude of too bad to handle more callers. The most enjoyable part of job was before they changed we were customer service oriented and were able to assist and help customers understand more of what information we need to help assist them in the best possible way."
good,"Everyday at Verizon was the same, with some new challenging situations. Very educational , i learned how to enhance my people skills, and learn to work with people to solve a common problem"
good,"We worked in a mall kiosk, so it was earning your sales at every opportunity. You had one shot to close the customers and I made sure I did,"
good,Good company but looking for advancement locally is extremely limited. Equal opportunities for either sexes especially if willing to relocate to NJ.
good,"I have learned to multitask from providing information to basic queries , order status and billing to technical troubleshooting."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I did not like the environment it wasn't welcoming and friendly. When there was a problem it was humiliating and the issue wasn't resolved. Other than that you make great money and the customers loved me.
good,"good work life balance, good VZ culture and working environment."
good,"Very Productive, fast pace environment and the employees are remarkable. Ability to make great working partnerships and to build intergrity"
good,"Prepare to work you butt off!. Great pay. But be aware that your sales will save your job. If you like cut throat sales, this is the place to be. Benefits are awesome."
good,"Learning advanced technologies"
good,"I was a long term employee of this company.  I credit the development of my sales, customer retention, and customer service skills to them.  They have a great training department.  Through hard work and learning, I was able to make very good money there."
good,Days at work are crazy answering so many incoming calls. Main problem is the management at Verizon. Your Supervisor there will either make you or break you. If you have a great supervisor you will do well if not then prepare to hate it.
good,"Ask customers what services they have, and try to get them to switch over to Fios."
good,"Graduated from Verizon Wireless “Customers First Selling Skills, Selling with Integrity, and Customer Service Solutions.”"
good,"unlimited overtime so you can make alot of money, alot of growth is available with the company"
good,"Lots of changes. It was a numbers game there, there are always new stats to improve on.  Great benefits from day 1."
good,"Fun atmosphere"
good,"Typical day at work - Answered inbound calls re:  rate/ billing, service inquiries, applied credit/debit adjustments; updated addresses, credit card information, obtained and applied payments to consumer accounts."
good,There was no career advancement opportunity at marketstar. I have been rank #1 month after month and did was not well recognized on that.
good,"My typical work day is enjoyable and I like it to be busy.  I have learned alot about FCC regulations and compliance in this position and enjoy the project management work.  Multi-tasking is great for me!  Enjoy seeing others smile at a job well done.  Excited to learn more every day and enjoy contributing to the success of the company.  My co-workers are great, but I normally get along with everyone.  "
good,Very well-rounded company with excellent growth potential.
good,"Coworkers were mostly very fun, however, the hiring process is very simple, so a few nuts slipped through the cracks. Overall a fun experience though."
good,Benefits were good. Management was ok. Customers were awful
good,"A typical day at works consists of sitting your whole shift taking inbound calls or the system making outbound calls for you.  You work in a call center environment at a very face pace with great people, but yet again don't get mingle with them as you are confined to your workspace all day other than the two 15 minute breaks you are allowed.   The hardest part of the job is that you have metrics you have to meet but in actuality you have no control over them. So in all you are really to set up to fail.  Advancement is very hard within the company as you are not given the opportunity for an interview to showcase what you are capable of."
good,"in bound call center, selling is a must now! wasn't that way 8 years ago.  I learned a lot from the company as far technical aspects go. People are great that you work with on a team.  Management has changed for the worse.  More stress on the representatives from Supervisors then Area Directors.  The stress level there was way to much. A lot of 10 eared people have left. Sad to see it happen."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Heavy focus on meeting daily sales quota."
good,"Take calls every minute of every day. a ton of great people. Very professional, A lot of perks."
good,"A typical day at work is working with customers to identify their wireless needs and to offer solutions that will enhance their day to day lives.  "
good,Benefits include Vision and 401k matching. Shift bidding based on tenure. Friendly coworkers. Excellent training opportunities.
good,"Being employed at Verizon is what each individual makes it and depending on your goals in life is a ideal company to work for. My day began with receiving the plats for my job and loading the required equipment to complete the job. Jobs could take two days up to several weeks to complete. The most challenging aspect of my job is dealing with factors that are out of my control. For example working at a new construction site dealing with people, the environment and equipment that may make my job harder to complete. What gives me the most satisfaction at Verizon is being at the forefront of fiber optics and dealing with the challenges of a fairly new technology."
good,"Being able to get the job done, some great managers and the salary was very good"
good,"Excellent pay and benefits. Highly stressful, slightly manipulative and somewhat unethical sales structure. They pull you in with the words ""customer service"" position and then the first day of training after spending a great deal of time testing and interviewing, tell you  that this is a ""SALES"" job. Verizon prides itself and even trains employees on ""NEEDS BASED"" selling but management enforces: sell as much as you can to anyone who calls in, in actuality. Great company to work for in the service and sales department if you enjoy SALES."
good,I have nothing to say but i have to type something in this box in order to continue
good,Interesting projects. Sometimes could be crazy busy. Great benefits.
good,"The job is a call center-oriented Customer Service post, involving no small amount of time in front of a computer. The benefits are very good, and the pay is great for a right-out-of-college job. The work can be very intense, however, and requires a strong demeanor."
good,"Great compensation, very fast paced, constant change, amazing benefits 401k, medical, dental, vision, tuition reimbursement"
good,"Enjoyed the job, but after five years I got burnt out. That is not unusual for the call center environment."
good,"1.Sign on at the time of my shift then sign off to bring up all of the systems that I work out of. Once signed in start taking phone calls from the direct, indirect or sales channel representatives."
good,I enjoy using computers and computer systems. Always work close with Management to communicate effectively in person and writing as appropriate for the needs of the audience. I love having the ability to speak both languages clearly so others can understand you.
good,"I learned alot about yellow page advertising. The management was tough, the co-workers were great. The hardest part was being glued to your desk all day. The co-workerswere the best."
good,"receive calls all day,you can not please every customer,managers lean hard on employees to resolve problems,co- workers are all doing same thing,hard to get cussed out for 8 hrs a day by people you don't know and for something you have no control over,best part of this job is the starting pay."
good,"Work is good , Learned more about telecommunication and network , Management is good, colleagues are helping in nature."
good,"Working at Verizon was really a great experience, you meet all different kinds of people all through out the day all day long. Working with the public you learn to be sympathetic to customers wants and needs. The hardest part of the job is when there is a situation a customer may have and you have to tell them there was nothing you could do. No matter how bad you want to fix the problem you just couldn't. Working with your co-workers you become a family, their problems are yours and yours are theirs, you learn to work together and help each other be productive and succeed. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was getting to meet new people and being able to help them."
good,"Provided stellar customer service to approximately 50-60 calls per day to resolve account issues such as billing, equipment and plan coverage concerns, and provide solutions to create a win-win outcome for company and customer. Contacted with technical support, management to provide a concise resolution to customers' issues on account. Patience, tact, good listening and retention skills, and constant interaction with representatives from other departments to provide a positive experience for customer. Maintained a resolution-focused mindset to gather pertinent information, understand customers' issues, and if possible, provide a first call resolution. The most enjoyable part of the position as customer service representative was the satisfaction a customer would have at the conclusion of a call if all their issues were addressed, an established rapport was created, and their intention was to be a long-term customer of Verizon Wireless."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon really takes care if their employees. The pay is pretty good,and the benefits are amazing. You also get a decent amount of time off (personal, vacation, sick days). I work in a small center so unless you are willing to move there is no opportunity for growth. The management is awful. It may just be a problem with my center, but there is no communication and no consistency. The job itself is extremely stressful. Everyone is different so it may not be as stressful for some as it is for others, but they put a lot of pressure on you. Especially when you are in a small center management is all over you constantly about EVERYTHING."
good,There was never a down moment. Even if a customer was not in the store there was inventory to stock or customer contact lists to complete. The management always made sure we had a training class for every new product or service we offered. The hardest thing about the job was the hours we worked were not conducive to having a family. I enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere.
good,Exhibits quality customer service from greeting point through departure; ensuring that all aspects of a customer’s needs are met and that it is a positive experience.
good,A typical day at work consists of incoming calls from probable customers and existing customers inquiring about plans and services. It is the job of the representative to uncover theses needs and provide the best wireless solution. We also provide areas of customer service and technical support. The work environment is very friendly and although we work in an individual work environment we do occasionally work as a team. The most enjoyable part of is the interaction with coworkers and the individual competitive environment. The most difficult of my job is a quota based environment and also the work schedule is not conducive to family and is not consistent.
good,"This was my first position I've ever had as a salesman and I can tell you, it wasn't for me. An average day at work consisted of sitting a customer down at our desks, and essentially trying to sell them over-priced phones and accessories. If a customer had walked in to merely pay a phone bill, I was instructed to attempt to sell them something, anything in the store. While I didn't enjoy the work, I worked with some very interesting and intelligent people, and my manager always had some great story to tell that made the shift slightly more enjoyable. Aside from this, the pay was incredible. Aside from a base hourly wage, we were given commission based on what we sold (including our monthly quota), and the amount of money that could be made based on one's salesperson abilities could be astronomical."
good,Good Company. The benefits and salary are great. Advancement is difficult.
good,"The company was a good compeny to work for, as manager I really wished I had more time to interface with the work force, it seemed they spent more time talking about change than executing change. I felt that our field team could offer coporate more input, so that we could make a more effective maket approach and raise our ROI, corporate occasionally made many unrealistic projections with out doing strong demographic studies. On many occasions some clients couldnt be services due to municipal, or government regulations which we a true hiderance at times. I sincerly believe is being upfront with a client and not just making claims to get a project."
good,"Call center environment that promotes putting the customer first and focusing on being the best as oppose to being the biggest. I learn how to please and educate my customers, providing options that benefit them. Hardest part about the job is not being able to satisfy every customer but it is also fun trying!"
good,Educating and convincing potential customers to purchase cellular service from a kiosk.
good,"Verizon Wireless is extrememly customer focused, offering the best of the best in the wireless industry. Verizon's mantra is to have an even better day tomorrow. I have been extremely dedicated to my customers and coworkers at Verizon Wireless for eight years. I have done everything from the simplest one line plan change, to activating a major business account with hundreds of lines. I have been in charge of Merchandising a retail location, inventory management, running conference calls with management, calculating sales numbers, and even greeting. Currently I am working with the business team supporting ten sales reps, a data team and manager."
good,"Verizon call centers offer great food, excellent security, and a gym. The benefits are excellent as well. The amount of stress you experience is part customer and part company. You have to be strong minded to work in a call center environment. Leadership has high expectations, and the goals are not easy to meet. But once you have a clear understanding of how to do your job, it becomes easier"
good,Verizon Wireless was a challenging and rewarding organization.
good,"Great work place environment but is not good for persons working with a family. It affords you the opportunity to provide financially, but robs your family of your presence."
good,well a typical day is working in different houses everyday so it challenging which i like . and its a very productive job. techs are friendly and management is ok
good,Good learning opportunities and innovative technologies are being implemented. Lots of hurdles to pass for career progression even though we do everything right from our side.
good,"Great place to work if they were not laying off long time employees constantly. They do not value those who know how to do their jobs, they just see them as salaries to get rid of."
good,"Great culture, management is extremely well trained. But job security is NOT there. In 3 years I worked at two different stores that both closed down. Severance is good but its scary to walk into work and find out that you don't have a job anymore. "
good,"Great Pay but very stressful handling back to back calls from 80% irate customers"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I guess it was a okay job, very busy and great jobs if you want to be a sales rep. other then that its not the best, bad hours, no breaks, and always on your feet"
good,"Verizon is a great company. I am a contractor. My daily work would consist of sending out reports to Vendors in different markets. I have to read over contracts between Verizon and Vendors on agreed bid unit pricing. I work out of Oracle dashboard to pull Network Analytics Reports, NTS Tableau to send FIM reports to markets, reply back to emails, have weekly sync-up calls with all my markets. I enjoy working with my group. I have learned so much from them. I have learned how to solve a lot of issues that arise. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being able to help solve their issues."
good,"Working for a major corporate company like Verizon really exposed me to how big corporations worked, further developed my customer relations skills, and a true foundation for team building."
good,Great place to work when starting out ... good environment but changes in pay scale have made it a place where our worth is less and taken for granted
good,worked and there was no chance for advancement and located a better job and one in a different field. Had good benefits and extra hours if interested in working more.
good,"A Typical day  begins planned and normally turns in to a day of prioritizing. Being able to prioritize is very important as a Corporate trainer in a fast pace environment. It begins with reviewing your calendar of which is planned and then reviewing the emails or request that came in at the last minute. Also taking into consideration the national goals for the company which can change at any time. The ability to manage your stakeholder's request for training and analyzing production to see if the request matches the need is paramount. This is where the magic of a trainer floats to the forefront. After processing all of the fires and the planned task and their deadlines, trainer are tasked with coming up with the plan to deliver and execute. This is definitely where I shine. Creating curriculum that the stakeholder will see value and keeping the learner at the forefront of the creation to ensure you meet the needs of the audience is the key. The return on investment is very important and must be seen in a short period of time while consistently delivering world class customer service. Traveling is also a task that must be planned in advance to ensure that you are budgeting properly. Planning travel in advance also allow for better preparation of amount of attendees to any training and provide you with a better outlook on how to prepare for the audience."
good,Its a place of business and to the point you get to meet different type of people all day when it came to making money this is a place to be because you were required to do mandatory overtime
good,"A very competitive job to have. The company is a leader in the industry, so you are never good enough. The company strives to stay on top and this filters down to the employees."
good,"If irregular hours are of a convenience for you, then this would be the job for you. I have kids and the ""flexible hours"" were not what i had signed up for but due to my necessity I had to figure out a way."
good,The pay is exceptional but like all call center positions there are metrics involved. It's the number of metrics they have that I feel makes this position extremely stressful.
good,"Working in customer care at Verizon is one of the most soul-crushing experiences of my life. They do their best to try to compensate for the job with benefits, but they don't outweigh the cons."
good,"Sales, hard work, long hours, very competitive. Work hard, play hard, earn lots of money. Lack of management communications. Very flexible with school schedule"
good,"Interact with customers, go over sales to prepare for purchases.  Setup and close store to make sure we were always ready to start and close.  Help sales associates with recommended purchases.  Receive shipments, send back returns, and weekly device counts  as well as monthly inventory of store stock."
good,"I learned how to successfully run a retail store from all aspects.  Whether it be from forward facing customer service escalations to district contests, running behavioral commitments with reps to hit quotas."
good,"Co-workers steal commission. Highest commission phones were the low end phones, who wants to sell someone a bad product just to make money? Management was good o work with. If someone didn't show up to work you had to stay."
good,"Ok place to work for mature people."
good,Its a pretty decent job. The typical day was very stressful. Customers demanded a lot but I was able to manage and give the customer exactly what was needed.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Workplace was very fast pace- lots of competition in sales.  Very hard metrics to overcome.   But the people working there were great.  I had an awful manager at the time I left-  but I've had some great ones too.
good,Verizon was a great experience and I enjoyed my manager and co workers. The main reason I left was for a better opportunity geared towards what I want to do.
good,"Apart from the management, Verizon is the perfect company for women employees to work with. It has lot of Employee benefits. Technically i would say, Verizon has to grow a lot. Still Stuck with lot of legacy Technologies and tools."
good,"Verizon has a wonderful work environment, but very stressful performance goals to meet. Some day it is back to back high calls value and sometimes no down time to take a breath. The hours fluctuate through out the year and shift can include the week and holiday. They have some flexible options but not enough."
good,A good environment and not micromanaged but open environment with lots of work. The group had lots of deliverable and we achieved by working day and night.
good,Verizon is a great company to work for and the benefits are great. My only complaint and reason for leaving was the lack of ability to transition from retail to corporate.
good,Verizon offered a great environment with room for career advancement Though the company offers great benefits it does have extensive hours which affects work/life balance
good,"Load jobs for the day, communicate with manager on safety issues, job requirements, load and unload truck, confer with other technicians about job locations, work ideas, etc."
good,I enjoyed my 18 years with the company. I had the opportunity to receive 2 degrees due to tuition reimbursement they offered.  Opportunity for growth and learn new technologies.
good,Verizon is a good job to have if you are trying to advance quickly. The pay is great however there are many changes that are made daily. It is a very fast pace company and competitive.
good,"there benefits are amazing best deduction costs than any other company I have heard of, a lot of overtime offered and double pay 51 hours worked . also they pay up to 8k in tuition fees before classes start!!!!! as soon as your hired with the only restrictions of being employed with no leave and passing with c or higher. Had to leave to follow my career path in finance."
good,"During my time at Verizon, everyone was professional. I did not have any issues with anyone. I enjoyed the work environment with the other staff, but not so much the work itself. I realized that working for a retail store is not what I'm interested in pursuing as a career. Due to this, I was able to find another job and pursue a different career path. "
good,"Every day they walk up and down the isles listening to your calls. Every month they listen to a random call and grade you on it based on criteria they have. If you pass the criteria they change the criteria to whatever you're weakest at. Although usually I might applaud the ""never stop improving"" spirit they endorse, after a while you get sick of it. You can never just come and DO your job, it's constant scrutiny, every hour of every day."
good,I worked at VZW a long time ago and during that time I enjoyed working there. I was able to learn a lot about phones and I got to see the first camera phone come out. It was a pretty cool thing to watch technology advance.
good,The job was challenging but that was the best part. I worked with a great group of guys who all worked well together. Our local management was always supportive.
good,"helped customers out, learned patience was important, management was amazing very helpful, culture was great, hardest part was no raises always on a freeze, everyone there made it enjoyable."
good,Working with a team of 8 in my department was great. Management could have been much better. I was actually chosen by my supervisor to be my teams leadrer
good,"VZ was a good place to work, this is a GREAT place to begin. My only issue was that certifications and education are not always the factor they should be for advance."
good,Your peers and most of management are great. The jb in itself is what sucks. Taking calls all day of people complaining and being negative takes a toll on you.
good,Open or close store...didn't like the fact of not having a set schedule but no one does in Retail so it is very hard on the body to get decent rest if you are up late and up early to work...Management wasn't very understanding to this concept when it came down to you being tire at work...sometime staying awake was hard but the fun part was meeting new people in the store
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,after 20 years of service it was time to retire.  it was a stressful environment with great pay.  it was a call center with calls per hour to meet and double duty with answering calls and working on customer issues at the same time while being on the phone.  trouble shooting issues dealing with other departments and having a hard time making time constraints because getting in touch with other departments was a difficult task.  most enjoyable part of the job is when the employees would get together for morale purposes and bring in food and have a little party.  management had numbers to make and passed that onto employees and that made things stressful.  i learned time management and how to balance and juggle and trouble shoot to the best of my ability.  i learn fabulous customer service skills and had a great relationship and repeat customers that called in for services.
good,Work/Life balance is not great with this company! This is an all or nothing company. If you cant give them all your time then this is not the place for you.
good,"its good company i enjoy my work with my co-works."
good,"Verizon takes care of their employees when it comes to pay and benefits.  There is room for advancement if you can do your job well.   Work life balance can be a challenge, but if you find a position you enjoy then this would be a good place to be."
good,Quick paced environment.  My last Associate Director was very supportive and provided a fun work place.  My peers and team were positive and upbeat.  The most enjoyable part of my job was spending time with my direct reports.  The workplace culture was mostly positive.   A typical day at work was taking call after call from cellular customers.  My team shared information and supported each other.  I had a open door policy and was well connected with my team and peers.  The hardest part of the job was having to deal with irate customers that were not willing to listen and were not flexible.
good,"Very good company to work for; great learning tools for technology. Good job security for union workers but not for management. Management expects for union employees to learn the new technology and then teach it to management. This should be reversed. Numbers seem to be the only thing that matters now to the company, not the workers who help build the company."
good,"Management was full of people who wanted to belittle you because of their income. Other than that, it was a fun place to be. Just needed more humility among their management."
good,"Verizon provides benefits day one of employment."
good,It was the team acquired from intel so all the people are very technical and i learned a lot what happens on the other side of chip manufacturing and got to work on new projects
good,"Overall great company, the call center was very stressful to deal with on a daily basis. Did not enjoy the pressure of upselling upset customers on every call."
good,"Tough environment, great money. Any retail job is going to be tough, and Verizon retail is no exception. The money and oppurtunites for advancement are plenty."
good,"This is a great job, especially right out of college or high school. Must be self motivated to make the commission check. I would recommend this job to a friends."
good,"Great benefits and pay (makes it hard to leave) but the people there aren't the greatest and the customer service world isn't for everyone; no matter how bad a customer is talking to you or mistreating you, you cannot let it affect you. No matter how strong you think you are, it takes some serious patience to work in this environment"
good,This job had good pay and excellent benefits however the job itself is pretty boring.  If you don't mind repetition you would love this job.  The hours are strange.
good,The job is tough but manageable. You learn time management and key personable skills that will allow to succeed in acquiring clients. The job has great management that teaches you market and product knowledge which will give you much more conviction when dealing with clients.
good,Verizon Lab experience exposed me to multiple applications of telecommunication while maintaining the ability to multi task on a large scale..........
good,"When I worked at Verizon I received great sales training, benefits, and pay.  Not exactly sure what it is like there now since it has been so long but my experience was good."
good,"Constantly pushing myself and aiming to improve. Ran a store with the absence of a manager and still no promotion when one was assured to me if I hit certain goals, which I did. I notice it took certain employees longer than others to get commissionable for no apparent reason. Occasionally your commission check won't come around and they will give you an ""I'll have to look into it"". With weeks passing by, sure to stay on top of it or they will yell at you for not following up. Worst of all I was told I would be hired for $9.25 an hour and was only getting paid $9.00 an hour."
good,Great teamwork and relaxed work environment. The company is very innovative and always looking to obtain greater market share.  My most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying either a business partner's or team member's request.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Setting up on my systems at the start is relatively smooth. Every now and then there was a rude customer but the majority were kind. Technical aspects were great  Only problem is the QA or metric increases having the rep being required to sell sell sell
good,"Verizon is a leading technical company providing very good services to its customers.  Compensation is quite good, provides very good health coverage and 401K plan.  Work place is physically comfortable but not mentally so due to job security, which is not what it used to be.  The company is constantly downsizing."
good,Got a chance to use the technology I like and the boss was very accomodating. Good people to work with and respected my views and ideas during the meetings.
good,Mangers were not as associated with the people they work with and feels like a job you get tired of doing fast. Not enough competition with a fixed salary!
good,Would splice fiber and copper wires. Worked in manholes and aerial work doing splicing of copper and fiber. I liked what i did and enjoyed going to work.
good,"Clean, friendly work environment. Exceptional management as well as company culture. Room for upward mobility within the company with various career advancement opportunities."
good,A typical work day was clocking in to the computer looking at the schedule and helping the customers on the calls with whatever issues they needed.
good,"I handled incoming calls from customers in the bilingual department.  The job was very fast paced and at times could be stressful!  The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my co-workers.  However, that rarely happened because one is so busy receiving incoming calls from customers."
good,Start your day with a group huddle which fills you in on the latest info on the company then pretty much your on the phone all day. Work pretty much consist of a plethora of job duties. The job requires a lot of multi tasking. My favorite part of the job was honestly meeting people from around the world. Hardest part was probably dealing with the customer attitudes about the company pricing.
good,Great Place to work. Not alot of room for advancement. Long hours. Pay and Benefits are great. Casual dress. I only left because of the long hours and I had small children at the time.
good,Although there is barely no Job security - i actually do like working at Verizon Enterprise Solutions. We are a bit of a Family! We used to be Terremark Verizon.
good,"Working at Verizon, being my first company was a great learning for me. I would definitely recommend everyone to work at Verizon"
good,"Verizon Telematics had little to no understanding of process improvement and the benefits associated with the practices. Therefore the business model changed with the new CEO, and the quality culture was non existent."
good,"I made a good living from Verizon, they provided a nice weekly paycheck, but they did not treat people like people. I made a good living"
good,The majority of my career with Verizon was spent on the phone with customers.  This could include billing questions and errors or ordering of services.  I dealt mostly with small businesses but also on occasion with residential customers.  I enjoy speaking with people and to do for them what they would do for themselves if they were able.  I take pride in meeting my commitments and doing so in a timely manor.
good,"I loved this job, everyday I was able to help someone find numbers, get the emergency help that they needed or just be there if they needed someone to talk to.  I learned to be calm at all times, and not take everything personal.  I loved my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was having people yell at you for no reason.  The most enjoyable was the pay, and the benefits."
good,overall good firm. The division and management of work can be made more efficient. Salary and Benefits ar good. Overall a nice firm to work for.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a good company, but the work life balance is not beneficial on the retail side. You have to put in a lot of hours to make due."
good,Good work environment but the work/life balance is not there. The hours are not conducive to having a good home life. Managers are always there to support you.
good,learned alot and made me become a better sales person make your schedule lots of deacts and some months wont make any money and you have to share your money witth other reps
good,"Required to arrive each day on time, log onto computer systems and be ready to begin taking calls at start time. I learned customer service and multi-tasking skills. I also learned sales and collection skills. Management varied over the years ranging from flexible and fair to lazy but demanding. I worked with a diversified group of co-workers over the years and remain friendly with many. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the favoritism of management over seniority. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with different departments to satisfy customers' requests."
good,Its a fun place to work. Its a very high stress job. you learn a lot about the dealing of a wireless carrier. 90 percent of your job is tech issues like guests not remembering their passwords or downloading an app.
good,"Great benefits and good people to work with.  The job is tedious, but the vacation time makes up for it.  The management is truly interested in your advancement.  Plus they offer tuition assistance."
good,Great culture but when you are finally put on your own after almost 6 months its a whole different world. You need to really work hard at staying connected with the people around you. They have a lot of great company activities.
good,A very exciting organizations to work for.  It does get very hectic with customer concerns and back to back calls. The hardest part of the job is back to back calls.
good,Verizon provides great benefits to their employees and attempts to maintain a fun atmosphere. It's a great long-term career path for those individuals that already have management experience.
good,"Extremely talented colleagues."
good,"It's good experience and really enjoyed working with ETech. "
good,"I would recommend this type of sales position to anyone already familiar with wireless communications devices, regardless of age. A typical day for the Retail Customer Service and Sales Associate would include prospecting and growing small to mid-market business accounts and building a ""sales pipeline"" through cold-calling, and working side-by-side in-store with prospective customers to determine wireless product and service needs that will best suit their needs.  The most difficult part of this position was resolving escalated issues, such as billing, and equipment repair and replacement. This position would NOT be a good fit for the individual who is not comfortable with working with the public in a retail sales environment."
good,Liked working here.offered many opportunities and training however was not fully supported and walked out for medical reason.
good,"This was the best school ive ever been employed, staff was excellent children were challenging, but eager to learn...in an impoverished area so the children were a bit ruff around the edges but eager and receptive"
good,"Most of the calls are simple. You will have a few escalations a day if you're not on your toes and/or sound like you know what you're doing. The one thing that bothers me most is the fact that this is a small team and because of that, service level is always a concern. If too many people are out, you cannot call out without using the few sick leave hours that are provided to last you through the end of the year. Policies change frequently. The culture team is awesome, everything you hear about Verizon wireless is true when it comes to the amazing treats, events and activities, HOWEVER, because its a small department, service level is impacted, therefore, not many people have enough decent time to participate in the events. The company is an awesome place to work if you are an outgoing, people person who can make great connections and network. Its an even better place is you're open to relocating to other states for a new position."
good,"Due to the size of the organization, you may or may not be in the same geographical location as your middle or senior management.  Work balance is good, some employees are a pleasure to work with, host holiday parties and gift exchange, a awesome break to the everyday groundhog day.  Their is distinct separation between management and subordinate.  I have not been onboard long enough to have an opinion or career advancement and future opportunities."
good,"Fun job.  Lots of new technology.  Constantly on the move.  You learn how to be patient with people in this job.  Forces you to listen to what the customers are looking for.  However, they moved you around to various locations a lot.  Retail hours are rough at times.  The benefits were amazing.  However, with a quota based system, job security was rough."
good,"A typical day would be that I would answer calls, sell phones, and give billing explanations."
good,Fun place to work but no growth if you work in maintenance project
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon was a great launching platform for my career. The company has a lot going on so there are always great projects you can work on to develop your skills. Overall a good experience with a few occasional bumps in the road.
good,"Managing a team of 8 for special events by Verizon, selling their FIOS services"
good,Well if you find an opportunity to work there take the chance they got full package and benefits
good,Great culture initially.  Things started to cheapen up once we fully merged with Verizon Landline.
good,Verizon is a very fast paced work environment.  A typical day consists of a short huddle with management.  We go over the daily sales goals as well as different promotions and incentives for our customers.  Normally the store has between a 20 and 45 minute wait.  Smiling and being friendly and courteous to customers is key.  The hardest part of the job is closing sales.  A lot of people are able to get really excited about the technology but most of it overwhelming and since the customer is unfamiliar it makes it difficult to convince them to buy something they arent completely interested in learning how to use.
good,Verizon at the time was too expensive for my clients and other telecom were heavy on compitition and verizon would not budge on lowering prices so it was hard to sell products as an account executive.
good,"Amazing benefits, on site Training, and time flexibility. Management were always motivating and empowering. I had several Managers who were readily available and provided great feedback.  I met some wonderful people while working for the company. Co-workers were a joy to be around and very helpful. It was a very competitive environment on where you must be on top of your stats every day. However the only Con, no room for advancement in my Area."
good,use them as a stepping stone to a greater career goal.  great benefits at the start of the job and discounts on your verizon wireless bill
good,"very busy inbound call center, no employee appreciation in my office. compensation was grand and that's all you get."
good,"I've been with the company for three years. I see some movement upwards but mostly laterally. On top of that I have seen plenty of talented people leave after being disallusioned. You know how the cliche of adult work life is high school all over again? well sad to say it's more true then ever within this fortune ten company. I imagine it is like that elsewhere but in compounding with the fact that stores are understaffed, it makes working here all the more disheartening."
good,"Took calls nationwide answering questions or concerns on account, made payments, walking customer through troubleshooting phones, and reviewing bills."
good,"Good work like balance, great benefits towards education, sick days"
good,"I dealt with a lot of angry customers, nothing that was too big of a problem"
good,"- Changing environment and always something new to learn"
good,"*Provide world class customer service"
good,Worked in a call center wasn't the biggest fan. Found that the environment was wonderful but hours weren't family friendly.
good,A typical day at a Verizon Wireless call center consists of taking calls the full 8 hours scheduled to work besides the 2 breaks and your lunch schedule. Verizon Wireless focused on providing excellent customer serivce to each and every customer. Co-workers we're like families since the majority of us worked in the same department and together for five plus years. Verizon Wireless does take time out to recognize top performing centers and individuals.
good,"I would stand at the door to greet customer as they came in because this was a commissioned based job and you had to work for your money. I really liked this job from the money i made from it, however I wanted to attend college as well and they wouldn't help me with my schedual."
good,"Loved the people, however, the anonymity of being over the phone can seem discouraging to some. Others enjoy it. I'm more of a personable person, which hindered my ability to get the number of calls each day to meet my quota."
good,"I have been with Verizon Wireless for 15 years, I really enjoy working for the Company. My co-workers are my family away from home. Verizon Wireless offer many tools to advance to the next level: tuition assistance, on the job training, and shadowing the job you would like to advance for a day. The most difficult part of my job is after you have taken the steps to show management that you have meet all requirements needed to succeed. You still can not advance to next level because there is never an opening to excel to the next level or you are not qualified."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good pay, great benefits, but bad management ideas and managers. Coworkers were easy to get along with and mostly a good job to have."
good,"good base with a high potential in commissions, management is there but not always there if you know what i mean."
good,If you dont mind 10hr days a grueling work environment it was a great job. I learned money is not everything.
good,Verizon is a great company to work for.
good,Verizon has allowed me to grow as a sales rep and has given me the tools to sell effectively and has taught me skills that will be transferable to any other work environment.
good,-Stressful environment
good,Overall its a good company to work for..it can be stressful..great benefits
good,Verizon is a great company. The place is stressful at times with the constant changes and the management who showed favoritism. I learned alot of skills that I can carry over to future jobs.
good,Verizon Wireless pays very well and has an excellent benefits package and tuition reimbursement program.
good,I worked for Verizon for 24 years and was laid off. They closed my department and moved to Texas. They didn't even try to find us other positions within the company.
good,Verizon is great place to work to support yourself/family and explore a modern corporate culture. Expect to work long hours and a high stress level.
good,"As a former Verizon employee, my biggest take away would be that the company does a great job of taking care of its employees but the job itself can be very draining. They have a great training program to start out new employees. The culture there is very strong and coworkers become like family. They provide fun activities and events throughout the year to boost morale, and offer great pay, benefits, and time off. This job taught me how to deal with a lot of very tough and sometimes unpleasant situations and how to handle it and position it in a positive way. That being said, it helped build my professional skills and it was a great stepping stone. However, this would be a very strenuous job to keep long term unless you are able to move to another position outside of customer service (ie: supervisor, training, operations). The biggest challenge of the job is dealing with irate customers day in and day out which can wear you down, mentally, and emotionally. Employees also have multiple metrics they are required to meet each month that can add to the pressure of the job. It is a great opportunity, but be mindful that it is a very high stress, fast paced environment."
good,"Verizon is a fun place to work with exciting events always going on. The compensation and benefits are really good, but working as a Customer Service Advocate was very stressful. Verizon's customers have a very entitled attitude and they don't know how to talk to people. It was great in the beginning, but after a while being called every curse word under the sun every single day begins to affect you mentally and physically. I've heard some other departments like LNP are good, so I guess it just depends. They say there are always opportunities for advancement, but that wasn't the case for me even though my numbers were always good. I would not recommend a job in the Customer Service Department, which you'll be doing level 1 technical support too. It was way too much to deal with. Again, the pay was great, but it wasn't worth me losing my sanity."
good,"Good Place to work, The people that you meet will become your family. They are opportunities for you. sometimes communication breakdown can be better. but good place overall. 3 weeks of Vacation for people starting off is unheard of."
good,"if you never had selling experience, this is not the job for you. You have to get out of your comfort zone, and realize you are only a number and statistics are whats important.  Managers will encourage you, yes, but they will tell you everything that wrong and drill it in your head. till it becomes a repetitive thing. AGAIN if you are a real salesmen this job is good for you."
good,The performance standards at Verizon were very clear and management staff was excellent at communication and offered assistance to attain goals. A typical day at Verizon seemed repetitive but it is not. You will use problem solving skills and critical thinking to assist each customer.
good,"The amount of calls, stressful environment due to customer abuse, lack of bonuses, pay scale, I dreaded work everyday. I needed a mental break because of the caller abuse. I sought out mental help for 3 months before I joined the work force again. I actually would never recommend another call center job"
good,It could be better. They are not open to input from associates and tend to be unyielding in their policies. Management rarely has the experience to mentor.
good,Management was very relaxed and made work more enjoyable.  Everyone treated each other like family.  I am not sure about the culture of the company now as it has been awhile since I worked there.
good,Company develops first with many things.  Is quick to change and always expect the unexpected.  It is required and expected to sell consistently with the performance agreement and there are no commissions on the sales.
good,Great benefits but current culture is primarily focused on revenue and not the employees. Verizon does not care about working their employees beyond their limits.
good,It was alright working there the environment was good the best part was being able to see famous people on event days and being able to work for some of them during the events
good,"I believe that it was was was a  great great great dffe,l ;;';; gooogd good good ecperience o bera;; dpkkkkk[  seemslike a coole p;axde tp werl overall no complains"
good,Verizon is a productive fun place to work but not consistent from center to center. I relocated to a new area and kinda regret that i did. The culture is totally different from where i was.
good,"it was a great place to work as far as Verizon itself but the location did not get a lot of business so that made it really difficult,,,and the manager I had was not that good at all I did not get proper traning I needed he was more about himself"
good,I enjoyed the fast-paced environment and the culture at verizon. It was a lot of fun working there. I would recommend working for verizon to everyone.
good,Good company.  It is stressful but with patience and a lot...I mean a lot of trail and error you can handle this position.  After 6 months you can move around the company.
good,the company and benefits are great. some of the management are not there to help you. some are there to get you out of there. I had many nice supervisors that were willing to help and teach you and make you successful which is what makes a great supervisor in my opinion. I got one bad one and that is all it took to get me on the not performing list and get me fired for not having as many calls a day as I needed. I had perfect ten accolades for customer service but the stats are so high that you have to maintain that it is hard to  keep them at a level you can to keep your job. Nobody wants to worry about losing their job every day. Benefits are amazing the employees are great the only bad thing is some of the management.
good,This employer had a very laid back atmosphere with casual dress code.  Feedback was given on a regular bases to help with job performance.  Games and contest were a part of the workplace atmosphere.
good,Very average. I feel they will need to change how they pay their employees.I do like the feel of  working for a great company. The managers are great to employees
good,"For the most part Verizon is a great company to work for, excellent benefits.  The benefits started from the first day of employment.  However, the job itself could be very stressful."
good,Verizon is a company that tend to be a fast paced environment. There are some slow times during the day but for the most part it will keep you busy. An individual needs to be prepared to handle upset customers.
good,Fast paced call center. great benefits.  i enjoyed the food trucks and the offline time. they threw great parties and the benefits were awesome. the place was always clean
good,It was the call center.. very stressful.. customers love to argue with you... verizon does not work to keep stores from ripping people off which makes them call you and complain constanly
good,I enjoy my time at Verizon. I am looking to leave because I am relocating or else I would definitely look to become full time and move off of a contractor role. Love the environment and culture that Verizon provides.
good,"True customer service. I loved the culture as well as the pay and incentives. Working in customer service for a wireless company became very stressful once company changes were made then it wasn't fun anymore. I was a top rep for 7 consistent years and was not able to advance as I should have. They wanted to keep me on phone because I was really good even though the job description was beyond stressful. If you love customer service and enjoy dealing with difficult people then you won't have my same experience. Verizon as a company was great. Really took care of employees with incentives, reg pay, and bonuses."
good,"what I have learned at Verizon, In the position that I had it was a very open position in the fact that I had not one specific job title . So It was hard to be properly evaluated and held accountable ,so that has made it hard for me to find another job because my job title was so broad. I've also learned that that expect a lot of you it seemed that my life revolved around work I was there a lot extreme overtime, long days and going in on my days off , definitely had the mentality that always Verizon came first."
good,Learned a lot in an outside sales position after 3 years. Time for a change now. Would do it again for the knowledge & experience. Great time off & benefits
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Pleasant place to work. Remote work available. Management always easy to work with. Typical day at work reviewing federal government order requests. Hardest part was always end of month when customers had to get their orders entered by end of month. Kept us busy.
good,"Attend a 5-10 minute huddle daily, receive 30-40 calls with breaks and lunch between, follow a timed schedule from the start to end of your work day. Attend 45 minute coaching per week with your direct supervisor to discuss strengths and opportunities to assist with increasing metrics. The most difficult part of this job is maintaining a positive attitude no matter the nature of the call."
good,"Verizon was becoming more and more stressful and unsatisfying, lots of great people though.  If you enjoy fast paced workload, it's great.  The company overall is well-meaning, the industry, however is relentless."
good,Verizon was a nice place to work. It is a fast paced environment with back to back phone calls. You are held accountable for your metrics and must ensure the numbers are being met to prevent disciplinary options. The company cares a lot about their employees and value their hard work. This company always go above and beyond to show appreciation for their employees. The job offers a number of flexible shifts.
good,"great day at work if I needed help my supervisor was there to help and so was my teammates.Hardest part of the job was havin to tell a customer no,Most enjoyable was being able to help the customer and resolve all issues customer has"
good,"Good Place to Work .. Good Money "
good,It is a great culture but changes every month. Commissions can change drastically and moving up in the company means you may make less .................
good,working for a contracted company that works with cwriOn was  good in a way to meet new people and be opened to environment and talk to people more on a daily basis but overall the experience was great
good,"I liked it a great deal here, the people I worked with were awesome also. Overtime was available most of the time. It's challenging work because you are dealing with customers all of the time, but if you are a people person it will be great."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I felt fulfilled after work every day. The benefits and commission were very good. The work environment was enjoyable.
good,"Great Pay, Unfulfilling position and very repetitive. Defininetly not a good fit for anyone wanting to learn new things on a consistent basis or move around at all."
good,Call center work never changes. The environment at Verizon Wireless was great through. Very positive and motivating. supervisory staff was very supportive in my experience. regular training to cover new content or promotions
good,"The environment is great! It is fun and upbeat however, job can be very hard. It can be hard to sit in one area for so long and adhere to a schedule. Management is supportive. The benefits are excellent!!!"
good,"Handel 50 or more incoming calls per day, some escalationed calls, billing issues,technical issues handeled. learned a lot about how cell service works, and how to deal with difficult customers, as well as co-workers."
good,"I had the pleasure of working with a great team whose skills and personalities meshed well together. Verizon puts over 20k into each person with their training process alone, so you know their committed to having you stay and thrive. "
good,"The culture at Verizon is probably the best and most important thing. It was usually a fun a different place to work at, the co-workers were always fun and outgoing as well as atmosphere. Inbound call center so you are sitting for 8-9 hours a day. Very performance based, meeting metrics, sales, goals, etc.."
good,"Consistently busy"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon takes care of its employees. I did not enjoy being on the phone all day. But if you like call center work, there is nowhere better."
good,"Tons of training and opportunities for mentoring. "
good,A good place if you like call center.  Could wear jeans daily and compensation was good.  Co workers were great and we had fun.  The hours 12-9 were the most challenging.
good,"Fast pace environment. The company is very generous in rewards for tenured employees. The longer you work there the better Verizon treats you. However, constant change and the inability of leadership to keep up adds stress to the job. Lots of grey areas in terms of finding out direct answers and problem solving for the customer."
good,"TPV is necessary but not very interesting."
good,"the bonus were great, with the money being collected, they could give more"
good,Verizon is not the atonosphere for me i just dot think i like it very much i do like certain aspects of the job
good,Went to door-2door to sell verizon fios products. Started my day around 2-3pm went out knocking doors till about 7-8 or until it go dark. knocked probably 40-50 doors and avg. 2-3 sales a day sometime more.
good,great benefits and compensation. the workplace community is friendly.
good,"Fun work place with lots of management support. Verizon has lots of recognition awards, trips and extra money given to their employees to reward them on a job well done."
good,i love this job no complaints really good place to wrok that cares about people
good,Accepting inbound calls regarding issues with equipment or network. Sometimes the training is good depending on the product. The hardest part of the job is dealing with entitled customers. The most enjoyable part is dealing with customers who truly appreciate your help and don't focus on unreasonable request. All and all great company for someone who loves learning about new technology frequently and managing customer relationships.
good,Great job and a great opportunity to be a manager. Was able to travel to another state and get that location up and thriving.
good,if you are able to live on minimum amount of pay great company
good,Great management staff and benefits.  Stressful. Not family life friendly
good,"This job was very fast paced and the day flew by."
good,Awesome culture! Great people to work with.
good,a typical day required answering phones and helping customers with questions on their credit card bill
good,"in bound call center, handling multiple request. i learned a lot about different products and services verizon had to offer. my co-workers were very helpful, and polite. i enjoy the team work."
good,"i was a sales rep. and i was dood to door seller, it was fun and convincing peolpe to buy this product was great"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Your day is very busy with a call after call atmosphere. Coworkers were your second family. Some managers where extremely nice, fair and approachable and others were not."
good,Physically job is or was not extremely demanding. Location of buildings quite near transportation. Work culture protected by union rules. And CWA 1101 work rules are enforced.
good,Calls are typically back to back with little to no break in between. I learned great things and met great people. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the metrics.
good,Worked in a call center. They keep track of EVERYTHING! To the point it stresses you and your supervisor out. Initial advancements come with minimal raises but after that the come with just more stressful responsibilities. Management says they care but ultimately every decision goes through corporate. and corporate is only about profits. They could care less about you.
good,Working for Verizon was a great experience meeting different people over the years from coworkers to customers. This is a fast pace company. Depending which store you was at managers were easily to work with. The hardest part of the job was making every customer happy even if you didn't have anything to do with them being upset. If my position was open again I would do it again. The biggest issue with them is buying other companies and downsizing.
good,"Victra specifically had bad management the entire time i was employed by the company. No staff company wide which eventually took a major toll on the district as a whole, regional managers could not keep up with all issues in hand forcing bjs and Victra to terminate their contract effective em mediator thus leaving everyone laid off. NO WARNING just a 8am phone call."
good,"Great work environment for those who are adept at sales. They provide a lot of opportunities but only give attention to those who have top sales numbers, which doesn't always translate to good leadership skills."
good,"I enjoyed working at Verizon the pay is awesome and the benefits begin day one. However, there are unrealistic expectations pressed upon you daily which creates anxiety. This can be a stressful position."
good,Great employer to work as a stepping stone. Benefits are great and you have a good amount of paid time off. Management in certain areas were very stressful
good,highly competitive with a chance to grow  Productive and fun place to work  Benefits are competitive and the matching of the 401K is wonderful  would recommend this job to anyone who wants a career in communications  the job is highly competitive with sales to be made
good,"Great company to work for. Good benefits, good pay. Excellent staff and management. Retail hours are generally from 9am to 8pm. Good products and services."
good,I enjoyed working there- they were not respectable that I was on medication that sent me to the restroom more than the normal person- so that ended my position there- my bathroom breaks was not on there time- schedule for me.
good,Terrible culture due to bad management in the past two or three years in particular. Management by humiliation and degradation became the norm. Always feel like you're never doing enough despite working 12 hours a day or more. Work/life balance is awful. You're not expected to have a life.
good,"Telemarketing with a salary. Phone book and internet advertising sales. I sold in multiple territories based on the time of year. When a territory opened I was assigned $30k in existing business with a $15k new business acquisition goal for example. Out of the $30k in existing business only about $10k renews, so the $20k in cancellations is rolled in to my new business goal, making it an actual $35k in new business acquisition."
good,My manager was the reason why I stayed so long. A good manager can make or break a location. He was amazing. The work and pay was ok there were days you feel way over worked and some you are not working at all.
good,good place to work. i enjoyed the people i worked with and learning about different devices. The pay was very good as well as work life balance. very good benefits.
good,This was  job in sales. You had to make quota every month so you had to try and up sale everyone that came in. You get to interact with a ton of different people which could be a good or bad thing.
good,I worked with Verizon for 5 years. The pay and benefits are excellent. Work environment is also good. You do work a lot though and although they say they will work with you on your schedule to balance life and family I failed to see that happened in the time I was there. Over all it was a great experience and a stepping stone in my life.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Demanding customer service position. New changes. co-workers and management ok. very strict enviornment. Talking to difficult customers is the hardest part.
good,great pay very stressful sales job but if you wanna be great you can definitely the best job i have had.
good,"learned a lots of things like communication skills , organizing things"
good,"Had fun while helping internal and external customers"
good,"Busy, a lot of info every day, working with co-workers is on a different level, working every weekend and holiday's for over 5 years is hard, and the better part of the job is a phone with everything unlimited every 6 months so you can show the customers the new technology."
good,This company taught me how to professionally and personally grow but I was working over 80 hrs a week that I got burn out and I need it a break after 6 years
good,"I learned how to deal with angry costumers and how to do sales as well. However, no benefits and minimum wage does not cut it."
good,The Company Is The Leader In Wireless Technology And They Have Great Benefits. I Only Had Issues With The Sub-contratced Companies That Work For Them Because The Benefits Are Not The Same.
good,Productive workplace and employees are fun. Teamwork environment.
good,"Verizon was an excellent place to work. The people and the vibe were good. Lots of amenities like on-site cafeteria, 24 hr gym, and lounge spaces were comfy and cool to get away from the phones. They really did everything possible to make it an enjoyable experience."
good,They did a great job supporting and making work as fun as it could be. Our management team was fantastic and did a great job of promoting from with in.
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits. The actual job is highly stressful. If you’re used to call centers then this job may be for you but for it to be my first one I’ll never work in a call center again
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for; however, there was always concern about if your job location was going to be next to close it doors.  I was able to obtain my MBA with the assistance of the company."
good,"This was years ago but I remember having a very active culture with various activities going on especially behind the launch of a new product or service.  It was quite stressful in the call center as people call about kids and bills, yelling and cursing but you have to remain calm. All in all, professional for the most part.  I didn't know a lot of the behind the scenes that was taking place for sure...."
good,As the company acquired other companies things began changing and eventually outsourcing came into play.  It was difficult having to train an overseas team to take your job.
good,"Management is more focused on getting their commission checks rather than helping their team earn higher commission checks. Other than that, it's not a bad place to work."
good,Worked at Verizon for 13 years and then was laid off unexpectedly. I lost my health benefits my discounts and MyPay. I wasn't happy about this and ended up having to take a job with a $5 pay cut because I needed a job
good,"Management does its best to help resolve customer problems. Even with the stressful work environment, the company does its best to provide support to deal with work life balance."
good,"Verizon is known for always changing job responsibilities and conducting lay-offs. Its a good place to work, but if your not a sales rep , it is scary only because they are always laying people off."
good,To succeed in this company you need to be cut throat. Slamming customers with devices just because you get paid for it. It's ridiculous.. One of their core values is INTEGRITY... but majority of the reps have NONE.  I refuse to be that person. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great pay, great benefits, great employees, awesome break rooms, giveaways, we all felt appreciated. Only thing I disagreed with were the stats, and how we could not have a consistent manager or schedule. Easy job overall, if you can handle angry customer calls."
good,"Typical day at work was fine. Typical clerk duties with managing of the daily functions of the store. All of The Verizon Plus Stores closed including the location i worked, in Denton."
good,high volume of customer service skills dealing with people on a everyday basis trying to make sales an upgrades
good,on a daily basis i would go out and cold knock on doors. mostly in the suburbs. i met all different types of people. my manager was just a little bit older then me and my co workers where all about the same age as me. the hardest part of the job was walking. i was walking like 10 miles a day. what i most enjoyed about the job was that i was actually selling a superior product and saving them money at the same time.
good,"Manage personel and pre-shift implementation. Procurement and payroll. I was in charge of employees assigned to one shift. I was responsible for activities that occur during the hours worked. Aside from my responsibilities to the company, I was also responsible to providing employees information, support and guidance."
good,Great place to interact with different people hardest part of the job is dealing with customers ups and downs
good,"Only complaint is that through billing, the callers are rude and very nasty. One can only handle verbal abuse for so long. Verizon (depending on your management) tried to give you time if you had a bad call."
good,"management was amazing and always helpful. but very stressful work, consistently getting yelled at by customers. they try to keep the working environment as positive as possible"
good,A typical day at Verizon was fun and fast paced- at some points very stressful with the diversity of inbound calls. Management was very helpful and organized. The strict policies were easy to follow. The hardest part of the job was not being able to solve the consumers tech problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was the rewards for working professionally and hard.
good,i really enjoyed my job in all areas not having any complaints. we worked as a family and no matter the task at hand we overcame the objection to ensure the level of our customer service was outstanding
good,"Went to work from 8 in the morning to 5:30 in the evening. I learned how to fix computers and printers. My co-workers was nice and very helpful. The hardest part was meeting new people, because you never know how they going to be."
good,"Managers did work with us to help the customers with what they need. A typical day involved helping the customers. My co-workers were helpful and fun to work with. The hardest part was trying to help everyone that called,but not being able to. The best part of the job was a customer called back,and thanked us."
good,"Great work environment, employees and management. Daily sales and customer interaction. Money handling and keeping track of inventory. Heavy lifting from time to time."
good,"great company, benefits great, work life balance can be a  challenging, pay is great, management is is very supportive. the atmosphere is face paced and energetic"
good,Verizon has the best culture to work in. Always changing and learning new way to stay competitive in the Market. At the same time always trying to make it fun for employees to reach their goals and exceed in their job performance. As they say always raising the bar.
good,"nice place to work in my book. Fun environment, you must be a peoples person, You will work lots of weekends, The pay is very good but they are going in a different direction."
good,"Every day a was challenge, Supervisor's were very supportive. We all worked as a Team."
good,"A typical day would consist taking inbound calls from customer and other departments researching and resolving inquires. I have learned to work well with other to resolve issue, fully read and research matters fully be patient and never give up. Management should always lead my example. Its very important to always be a team player, help others and be a leader. The hardest part the daily job is trying to please everyone. I enjoy when I have a very escalated customer and I am able to turn the customer around my promptly resolving the issue and making the customer happy."
good,"Great company to work for. The job culture in my current building however is not."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"It is always about making the customer feel as comfortable as possible with you, create a connection with him or her and from there build amazing customer experience for them where they will feel so satisfied with the service they will want to come back any time. I learned as a sales associate that my job is important. It is important to have a positive energy at all times no matter how hectic the job is at the moment. Being positive and being willing to help people no matter how many times they ask the same questions is the key of this job. It will not just get you customers because of how comfortable you make them feel but it will also be an amazing experience for yourself as an associate. Having the right mindset and attitude towards this job is definitely the key to success, or at least it worked for me."
good,"Not the best pay plan. Even if you sell $15,000 in profits the company commission payout is 1% if you don’t hit your minimums. Which is completely unfair."
good,"Our store managers are pretty solid. It upper management is horrible. They constantly remind everyone that they are ""replaceable"". Even the number three salesman in the entire country was told that he was doing a terrible job and that if he didn't pick up the pace he was about to get fired. The use fear as the sole motivator to get them the numbers that they want."
good,Verizon has tought me a lot about time Management. The company is big on Customer Service and we train our staff to be sympathetic to the customers needs.
good,"A typical day at work included regular store visits, analyzing sales reports, training employees, motivating team members."
good,Poor management and leadership. No direction or plan for conducting business
good,Fast paced environment. We are on the phone 90% of the days answering incoming calls from existing business clients as well as potential clients. I have learned to be very patient with our customers as well as to listen to their needs. Appreciating our customers is what keeps us in business. Management is what we look to for help with difficult situations. We work together as team players. Our co-worker is who we lean on through out our day for support and advise. The hardest part of the job is not being able to satisfy a client right away. We don't want to leave them with a bad feeling about out business. I enjoy helping and resolving any situation given to me.
good,"When I started with the company, everything was great. As years went by, cutbacks, commission changes, over-demanding work loads and not valuing employees cut morale to the core. Frequent layoffs are also disheartening."
good,Verizon has very poor management skills which affect the team which the team then takes the fall for.  Very poor communication skills between management and upper management
good,"Being a contractor I got paid for 40 hours a week, and anything more needed to be approved, which didn't happen.  I had no PTO/vacation days.  If a holiday fell during the week, my manager would not allow me to make up those lost hours. Management runs badges too.  When I worked more the 40 hours per week, nobody complained, but when I tried getting some of that time back, they got a little snippy."
good,"Deliver the ultimate Verizon Wireless customer experience."
good,Work for the company for a good period of time. During this time i saw more DM's changes than a mother change pampers on their baby's. Really love to deal with my loyal customers on the daily basis. But the lack of respect and profesional between the company managers toward their workers really take a told on your spirit toward work. Hopefully someone from the hi end outside of this state see this and it will take matters on his own hands.Sales are great but they have favors between their own. And if you are not with them better kiss your chances to get promote or even tramsfer to another location. Using their techniques of blooking your self to a clean start on a better work enviroment. All i saying is if you are up for a good start and love the GOOD OLD BOY SYSTEM well them florida is the place for you.
good,Basic call center. Overall not bad but some mangers are terrible. Alot of micromanaging and nitpicking. Would not recommend if you like to think for yourself.
good,"I worked for the company for 10 years, 7 as sales.  Reps would make very nice monthly nice bonus checks.  about 2 years ago, the company changed it's comp plan and most of the veteran reps checks dropped a good 65%.  They also got rid of any non-sales positions in the corporate stores so you as a sales rep can be wasting a LOT of your time on non-sales items like transferring customers content, billing issues, and phone troubleshooting.  i LOVED working for this company, but that changed very quickly w/ all these negative changes"
good,"Verizon pays incredibly well, I enjoyed this job tremendously when I first started, but the work life balance is non existent. You are managed down to the second of your day at work and your entire day is monitored by people and software."
good,"The company as a whole was a fun enviornment however did not care about family, If your child was sick oh well, they told you what your hours were, day off etc. if you din't have a sitter oh well. Thats why I chose not to stay long."
good,"Wonderful employee communications, lots of travel and hours. Very hard to bring in a decent income.  Lots of charge backs and paybacks for missing items."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I love Verizon my hourly was great. But management keep wanting to sell with no integrity exp tell the customer this comes with it even dough it didn't.
good,"The work was very demanding, requiring 100% accuracy and performance of all software and systems 24x7x7365 to ensure 15-minute maximum of delivery of network billing records to the IT Billing systems.  This required our team virtually training both the IT Billing systems and the Finance Revenue Assurance organizations in the proper methods and procedures for receiving and testing software changes to out data mediation systems for over $60 billionof service revenue for Voice. SMS. and IP usage (billable) records (roughly 6 trillion record per year)"
good,I do love the environment of a high paced sales work place but there was always little to absolutely no help or assistance from my immediate managers due to the fact that they did not know how to sell anything. My immediate superior had zero experience as a manager or as a sales representative rendering them as nothing as task managers giving little to no support to the representatives working at any given time.
good,"The day starts at a thousand miles an hour, your job is do whatever it takes to give your customers the absolute best possible experience. You are strongly bonded with coworkers and different groups to make sure intervals and on-time delivery of services occurs. The hardest part of the job, is having an unhappy customer. The best part of the job is when you pull off a miracle and your customers tell your bosses how great you are, and how much they like working with you because they know they can count on you to get the job done and keep their projects on track."
good,Opportunity for career advancement; engaged workforce. Excellent benefit package including tuition reimbursement.
good,"While being employed with Verizon it was definitely a challenge. The company was a third party agencies named Coleman and Associates that handled DSL, cell phone technical support and customer services as well as retention. The company did not compensate like it promised and there was lot of false hope in being promotion. There was not a lot or organization in the company. One of the hardest things to deal with is trying to retaining customers with no tools, no compensation, nothing to show that the customer is appreciated. I enjoyed working with employees and working over  representatives and getting to know the personalities."
good,"Log in start working the files sent in email finish that send off in email, work corr till a phone call. Phone calls depend on what they want anything from checking an address for what a customer can get to recreating errors that rep got on there system. Management is nice and understanding to a point if you don't do as they expect they will let you know. People at work are kind and seem to enjoy each others company. Hardest part of the job is doing your best to help a rep that called you with an error and there is nothing you can do. Enjoy my work hours and not working weekend"
good,"Change is constant, but Upper Management seems to have lost touch with the ""regular"" employees. "
good,"I can only speak to my personal experience, and I wouldn't work for the same director (Mahmoud El Assir) even if they paid me double what they used to.  Other organizations in the company and the company, in general, is pretty solid."
good,The stores i worked for and ran had very poor ownership and management. I am sure working for a verizon store with proper management would be much more successful and enjoyable.
good,"AMAZING benefits and pay; however, there's absolutely no work-home balance due to frequent mandatory overtime due to service levels. It can be a hard job if you're a parent of young children.  It's a contract position negotiated by the Union & Verizon, so you're not really sure how long you'll have your job, which can cause anxiety."
good,"Company was sold to Frontier Communications, It is no longer the company it once was which valued employees here in the United States as opposed to overseas labor."
good,"Go out to do installs, Everything is fine then managers out surveying jobs every now and then to rite you up. So many different managers worried about loosing their jobs there were so many written and unwritten rules set up against you, They would build a case against you over a period of time and when the pressure came from up top they would put you through a step program in order to get rid of you."
good,"The company was fun to work for in the past.  Was compensated well, given opportunities for advancement, and the benefits were really good from tuition reimbursement to healthcare.  Benefits were cut along with compensation structure, was working harder and longer hours for less pay."
good,Good Pay and Good Benefits. Horrible Management. No work life balance. Opportunity to make good money. The management shows favorites. They are not a well liked management team in West Michigan. Beginning all the way from Store Managers all the way up to the District Manager. Not a good team to work for.
good,"No advancement, very few opportunities. Limit you as an employee. As soon as you start to earn a decent wage, they look to get you out. Sales is generally safe, but quotas are astronomic for a product that is saturated."
good,"Good pay and benefits but all that matters is the bottom line and how much money you can make them. Went into work early, left late and stayed when no one else would. Never a consistant manager and no realistic expectations."
good,"It was very hot working back there. They never turned the air conditioner. What upset me the most was that I was never recognized for my good work,"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I gained almost 10 yrs of Management experience.  gained skills such as:"
good,"A day at work was not very fast paced. Being placed in a not-so-busy mall was the cause of this. "
good,"Very physically challenging, if you have a bad back this is NOT the job for you. But if you don't mind heavy lifting for hours at a time, you can earn an honest wage with little to no stress. A plus for anyone who knows how to work a fork lift, and or electric pallet jacks. Like most seasonal positions the job has its peek where the work load gets incredibly exahusting, but towards the end you make the same pay for a fraction of the amount of work, which is kind of nice in a way. "
good,If you do not have a family and do not care about your hours this is a great place to work.
good,"You could make decent money, but there are days you get a goose egg too. Cellular sales, a subsidiary of Verizon has no manger on site so things can get hairy at times. Commissions drop often and customers are unreasonable given the fact that management takes there side when complaints reach them.,"
good,"Management needs to be re-vamped only at the Alpharetta campus. They only care about #s, metrics, and writing employees up who don't do what they say do."
good,"No work-life balance, they ask you to work on the weekend too."
good,Poor management needs more improvements on the culture that they provide to the employees. And much more better paying wages.also be safety goal mind going forward.
good,Over all culture is good. Teamwork is excellent within tech to tech. Management style is varied sometimes you have a hands on and sometimes you have a do my way or highway approach. The vision given and the direction given contradict. The company has shift to totally for profit .Cutting corners on safety but enforcing on obvious. Single out individual perceived to not conform. I don't want to blanket
good,An ok place to work. Highly customer service oriented. Not many opportunities to advance. Good opportunities to learn new skills at no cost to the employee.
good,"Visit to Doctors, sales and promotion, Workplace culture is very informative, The hardest part of the job is to dealing with doctors, the most enjoyable part is when talking to colleagues."
good,"Deceitful, untrustworthy.  Will lie to your face and most definitely stab you in the back.  Will do anything and everything to ensure they keep the title and pay.  Lazy.  Not up to date on their own skills.  Will throw the associate under the bus if it means keeping their job"
good,I  enjoyed working for this company very much. Their selection process for supervisors should be updated because the last two supervisors I had were not in the customer service realm and had no knowledge of what makes the customer experience great because they both came from technical support.
good,It was a good place to work with great benefits and advancement opportunity until they sold off to frontier communications and then everything went down hill.
good,Not what I thought.  No management support.  every day was unsure of your job.  didn't like the overall floor plan.  stripped down of privacy.   Wish things didn't have to change.
good,i sold verizon fios door to door in florida in summer. i almost died a few times from heat exaustion . i worked 6 days a week no time off . i felt like a rich zombie at the end of the day
good,Great benefits. Aggressive sales goals. Retail hours mean most holidays and weekends are staffed. There has been some good managers while I've been employed. Develop yourself with help from leaders.
good,"This is a good place to show up to do you. If you are the type that wants to make easy money while ONLY concentrating on yourself and your metrics its great."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Verizon but unfortunately there was an upper management shift and many contracted employees lost their jobs, including me.  However I was able to showcase my skills in Microsoft Excel and People Soft.  I received solid training and learned the Verizon way of getting the job done.  I would recommend a Verizon career to a diligent job seeker."
good,"Work Place Culture is good but there is no Job Security."
good,Work in Silos. Some teams good. Some are bad. Segmented structure creates an environment of CYA instead of what’s best for customer or business. So many people it is easy to have more negative experiences than positive ones.
good,"I reported for work on time and was assigned a desk with computer. I took calls and gave technical and service advice to the callers. Verizon is a good company, Xerox and their surrogates are the poorest company that I have had dealings with. They fired people for no good reason just to reduce overhead. They wrongfully terminated me less than 10 days before benefits vested to save money. They fraudulently operated behind a closed-door mask of false security to conceal their criminal tactics."
good,"Great pay scale, work tour options is convenient to home life. Vacation and personal days are adequate properly planned.  Local management appears to be based on personal skills!"
good,"The pay and benefits are great, you are however, sacrificing your personal life.  In a retail position and after 12 years no vacation time can be used during the holidays."
good,the team members were great. Outstanding management. good benefits. on feet all day. Went through a lot of training. staff was great. Very helpful. the day went fast.
good,Great company. Fairly compensated and benefits are of the best around. Good experience. Only set back is retail setting and hours. Great new hire training.
good,Company used to be better before recent changes. Would recommend that upper management pay attention and listen to the employee base. Listening would better help to improve employee morale.
good,"Great paying job if you work hard. The environment was very unprofessional and you had to rely on your own resources to be good at your job. management wasn't always there for you, they would encourage manipulation as a means to sale."
good,"Aircraft Engineer, Sales, Sales Manager, General Manager, Built team Culture and trained my staff. With a passion for excellence, looking for the a 100% closing ratio."
good,working for verizon was a lesson learned. I work for verizon while there was a nationwide strike. Overall the job is pretty simple. Knowledge on all electronics is a must.
good,Management is helpful and you will like to make money for yourself.  Enjoyable part of the day is seeing the customer is satisfied with your service
good,"Pay was low and based solely off tips more than hourly wage, management was very picky and detrimental to the overall success of completing the task at hand, etc."
good,"I liked working for Verizon Wireless, I did not like the owner of the company. He was never around and when he was around he would give wrong information to customers and leave us to deal with it"
good,Verizon wireless can be a very stressful job and the upper management is to controling when it comes to a employee and their time.
good,"Fun workplace, meeting people from all walks of life. A boost to anyone with prior  customer  service. Gives one a view of the different aspects of customer relations. Great co-workers, always there to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job is not being able to visually see your customer, most people do not trust giving any kind of information over the phone , so one should be understanding and kind , give good customer service, so that the customer will trust you to help them as you were trained to do. Knowing that you've help brighten someone's day , by being empathic and helpful about their concerns and questions."
good,Innovation of wireless products and seeing the growth of this technology is a gift. A must see for any company world wide.
good,"At first everything was great company moral, management, coworkers were awesome...everyone was happy. Then I would say in 2013 things started going down hill till eventually everyone was giving up and they closed our call center May 8th but still have some working till Sept. I thought I would retire from there...guessed wrong but great money went from 14.90 starting to 23.59 when I left in 5 years."
good,"not very good in terms of job security, i learned a lot and co-workers are great but always ins stress"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Once your day began you are tied to your desk with a headset trying to answer phones within a timely manner while handlilng offline requests.  If your call ran over you could not take scheduled breaks, and you were not allowed to call customers back."
good,"pays great and alot of work but the benefits are amazing"
good,It was a great temporary job. If i stayed in California I probably would of stayed longer.
good,Good Benefits
good,Verizon has great health benefits and pay but management was not that great. Very fast paced job that I enjoyed.
good,"I enjoyed working for verizon, I liked getting up in the morning and leaving for work, i enjoyed being able to work on my days off and as late as i wanted. They have some serious management issues to work out."
good,This is a great call center sit down at your desk in air conditioning answering calls from upset customers. At the end of the day you feel like a punching bag and you just spent the day with Mike Tyson. The pay check will keep you coming back if you have rent or child support.The most enjoyable part is when you help someone with a problem and hear how thankful they are it makes your day. The hardest part is when you can't help; these people they are spending their money and you can't do anything to satisfy them terrible feeling will totally wreck your day.
good,I was happy for the most part working here. The pay and benefits really couldn't be beat. Coworkers are fun and easy to get along with for the most part. Management could be better.
good,Sometimes management is more worried about 'smoothing things over' rather that doing the right thing.
good,"I worked for Verizon and the companies that acquired (Worldcom & MCI) for many years."
good,Its a very family oriented place and we are very friendly to our customers however you don't get paid well enough to financially support yourself on your own. The manager makes triple what we make for not as much work as we do!
good,3 holidays a year.  Continuous micro management    money is great benefits great.   No loyalty to good employees working for many years with great client base.   Out with the old in with the young.  If you get in you'll stay for the money.  Some managers are much better than others.   Good luck.  You won't be disappointed
good,"Overall I had a good experience. "
good,Try to escalate sales to customers while helping them with their account and managing their price issues. Very good entry sales position for customers who are trying to gain experience.
good,"While the benefits are stellar at Verizon, you will work to earn and keep those benefits. The management does not always seem to be on the same page and things are done haphazardly."
good,"I worked for a Verizon authorized retail company called Cellular Sales. The job was ok, but employee turnover was high and understaffed in general. The locations were no less than an hour's drive away on top of open to close shifts and that is why I left the position."
good,Verizon is an elephant of a company. There is name brand recognition in the market that helps you sell. But there are a lot of areas that it is lacking. Nothing to add about my time at Verizon.
good,"a good place to work, Work burden is more when the release is approaching, inefficient management  in handling  the projects, a company where you can learn and explore new things"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a great place to work but hard when you have kids. The compensation is good but hours our hard and changes every 6 months. It's hard to say whether you would have a good boss or not because you have to bid for positions.
good,Verizon is effected by TV streaming services and it is losing a lot of income and therefore trying makeup by rifting a lot of employees regardless of their skills or services.  There is no loyalty for its workforce anymore.
good,"Due to inconsistent management practices, schedules can be dependent on management subjective opinion instead of seniority which may nor may not work for the individual. Particularly, after returning from leave (like maternity leave). "
good,Good pay great benefits...offers a challenge in getting out of your comfort zone and learning to work with the public. Would highly recommend to friends and family
good,"Excellent training provided."
good,"Though Verizon is a great company however the inside culture within IT is not great because of strong bias towards specific candidates for promotion. Talent is not recognized and hence best talent leaves the company within 1-2 years of time frame. Verizon do provide great compensation but the work life balance is totally horrible. You have to bring your own Coffee to work, this tells us that how much Verizon invests in their own employees development."
good,"Great Company."
good,"Over 17+ years experience and I have seen the company undergo drastic changes over the past few years. "
good,"There is a lack of management, but if you are responsible enough to manage yourself and your customers you can make a good living. They did away with some of the team leads so standards at some locations has suffered."
good,"Well the only reason why I stayed, was due to the people that were around me.. They made it enjoyable for me to come to work. However, management was not quailified for the postion at all!! I mean upper manangement, not imediate supervisors. They made you work overtime..seldom raises..Didnt pay out the commision and also overtime.. I eventuallty got exhuasted, and quit."
good,"VZ is very large organization and sales cycles internally take a very long time, and one has to be very understanding of the process to get your deal moving.  I find it similar to any other large institution with risk avoidance in mind!  Best of Luck!!!"
good,The environment is awful and turn over is high because management doesn't have any consistency.  10 different managers will give you 10 different directions and then 8 of them will coach you to not follow the other managers directions.
good,"Typical day, sale, sale, sale, and quota can somewhat be unreasonable. Quota changes from month to month, you can be successful, but you have to be exstremely aggressive"
good,"I was so happy the day I went to work for Verizon. So full of positive energy, hope, motivation, and passion. Didn't take long for them to put an end to all that. By the time they sold us off to Frontier(many years later) they had broken the moral for everyone in the workforce."
good,service issues were dealt with under a 15min aht whicih was almost impossible since theres so much to do on a technical call. field techs usually had to rectify issues beyond remote fixing
good,"It's a cool gig if you are going to school in the evenings. If not, you can make overtime money. Every other week or so you get one day of during the week but you must make it back up on Saturday if you do actually get that weekday off. Every union is different, my union didn't help us to get personal days neither a sick day really. No benefits, down to the employee discounts are limited and you can't really apply to all inside jobs if you are a 2 year temp. Not much room for growth, just by luck. Just a cool gig. At least Gym memberships for all employees would be nice. It ain't easy when them techs be swinging on poles and the assistant have to join them in unsafe areas. Just saying. Lastly, the company needs to stop changing the contract by mouth and do it in writing instead. Provide techs with tools and more job security for the assists. Assistant were hired for a reason and it makes other telecommunication companies jealous because they don't have assistants."
good,"The company supports career progression for Customer Service, however, few opportunities are given.Failed Surveys don't always portray that the messenger did not use active listening, empathy, and solutions for its customer."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Unrealistic expectations for sales unless you are willing to stretch the truth. You have to do everything that your job title requires and some just to meet your minimum
good,"Verizon is a competitive company and has great medical, dental and 401k benefits.  It is a fast paced and ever changing environment.  I would recommend it as a place to work."
good,A typical day at work starts with a morning meeting. While trying to get everyone hype for the day. Management was not the best. They had their favorites and it was very apparent.
good,Worked through a third party company telvista. They are all about who you know and not so much what you know. I would not recommend to go through telvista
good,Verizon is a good company but very top heavy. New organizations and change in mid leadership seems to be a monthly occurance. It is hard to get any new ideas heard or implemented if it is not going to generate $1 billion. Often it is easier to get a contractor.
good,not enough pay for my campaign. other than that it was ok. I would go back if I had too. The staff was always great just like family. The facility was not that great but well maintained.
good,"Verizon was a very fast paced job.  It can be stressful if you let it.  I did a lot of troubleshooting with customers, handling inventory, managing others, changing planograms  for store and helping with cash management."
good,"Great company but stay away from retail. no work life balance, sales expectations too high for such a saturated and competitive  market. take advantage of tuition reimbursement if your there so you can get a better job later"
good,"Great pay not so great work life balance."
good,"Verizon offers amazing benefits. They offer pretty decent compensation. It's a retail job, so it has it's highs and lows. The turnover is very high. The focus changes constantly with a huge flow of new products. The management is mediocre at best. If you happen to work for someone that is worth their salt, they are usually gone pretty quickly. The company tends to take advantage of these people. Great job for learning different job fields such as sales, account management, tech support, operations, customer service. Get in and get out."
good,"Making quick decisions to improve customer experience with customers."
good,"Worked 10 hr work day, learned how to test co-ax cabling, got along with everyone, nothing really hard about it."
good,"Great place to start career and gain corporate experience and technical skillsets."
good,"Productive and challenging assignments"
good,Enjoyed customer experience. Everyday was a new experience.  Always felt like that I made a difference in a person(families) life. Living in a small town where everyone knows everyone makes a big difference in how coworkers are dealt with.
good,"I have had many issues with my general managers. Multiples manager, but the company as a whole is solid. I am leaving, or looking to leave, because I am needing a job with different hours. Verizon, in my opinion, is not the best job for parents."
good,.. management likes to micromanage doesn't give you an opportunity to do your job and they have bad attitudes your fellow coworkers are great most of the time hardest part of the job is the goals every month they are forever changing and the company consoling give you more difficult things to sell the most enjoyable part of the job for me was the new phones and new technology console coming out every 9 months
good,After years of service and NEVER having a major outage occur at my sites you can be let go without cause.  Recognized several times over the years and restructuring can come along and take all of your hard work away.
good,"hours are not typically flexible "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon was a great company to work for.  Then corporate bean counters took over and everything changed.  We all numbers on our head waiting for time to go to the slaughter house.
good,"Was A temporary job."
good,I worked far too many hours and didn't have any life balance to show for it. Management can be really great or really terrible. The company reorganizes far too often.
good,It's a great place to get 50% off on your phone bill and also to learn about new products coming out.  Free wifi at work.  Meet all walks of life.
good,"one of the favorite ""go-tos"" of leadership is ""change energizes us"" well expect to be constantly energized. there is constant upheaval. new metrics, new requirements, new responsibility, same pay. i believe the goal of senior leadership is to give the reps as many task as possible, but never provide proper compensation."
good,Good training. Top of the line product availability. Excellent sales support from mother company. I enjoyed working with the contractors and their clients.
good,"Extremely nice people to work with. High energy, high reward.  Dedicated professionals working hard to give exceptional customer service."
good,Verizon payroll services in Lake Mary is a call center and not much more than that.
good,Verizon offered really good pay and incentives however the benefits were not easily obtained. Vacation time was hard to get approved even in non peak seasons. Verizon does not do a good job hiring mangers and in my six years with the company never had a decent one.
good,"Computer parts and peripheral support equipment distribution. Orders taken by 3:pm had to ship that day. No excuse besides complete facility equipment shut down. It was a very automated environment. We processed over 400 orders a days resulting in 3000 to 4000 packages a day. I had  A Fed-X and UPS trailer dropped at my doors daily, sometimes needing two to cover volume. Due to pace of the facility a lot of people could not or would not work under the pressure which was daily. The race began at 3:00pm and the trailers were picked up at 7:00pm"
good,"Everyday was a different experience.  Very competitive atmosphere, but on a healthy level.  Although working in a retail environment can be very challenging, as a team we always seemed to make it enjoyable.  Ability to learn valuable knowledge while with this company."
good,"Typical day was greeting and meeting customers, finding out their particular needs and wants are and try to place them with our product that will best suit them. I learned how to effective sale merchandise to customers as well as lead and manage a store. The management was not the best. The hardest part of the job was when business was slow trying to get customers to come in. The most enjoyable was being able to meet new people and help them."
good,"Worked 30 to 40 hours per week, answered alot of calls during the day, talked to people all day, learned to be patient and listening skills"
good,"A typical day at VZW included answering inbound calls from business owners or their representatives. I learned how to choose and recommend the appropriate rate plans for these businesses and how to recommend the best equipment. "
good,"I've worked for Verizon for over 13 years and although challenging at times, it's a great company to work for!"
good,great paying job but the upper managment dont respect you and or care about you personally
good,Great company with a need for upper level management talent.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great pay and benefits but very political. Call center has far to many employees and drama
good,Many incentives and benefits can be stressful. Learned a call center is not the eviroment for everybody. Hardest part getting yelled at 45-60 times per day based on someone else's mistake or policies you have no say in.
good,"I am a long term employee I have worked in the retail , customer care and HR organizations within the legacy companies and VZW."
good,Pick up jobs in A.M. call customers repair what ever needs to be repaired close job out go next customer etc.Learned how to repair test locate faults and high speed circiuts.Management is poor due to a degree in anything but telecamunications equals boss.co-workers very good group of people.The hardest part of the job is to meet the # of jobs per day and explain why you are 2 weeks late in repairing the customer phone.the most enjoyable part for me was to see a satisfied customer when you leave the permise.
good,"Started as an Amazing company to work for, the past 6 years they have let there corporate greed get in the way. It is a shame. I thought I was going to be able to retire working with them."
good,Solid company to work for. Excellent benefits for Parental leave and more than fair compensation for jotting your monthly sales goal. Great extensive training program.
good,"When the smartphone market was taking off, you could make a great career at Verizon.  Nobody expected the smartphone market to boom like it did, and for several years while that was happening, VZW employees made 60-80K.  Currently, VZW is becoming more lean by paying employees less to compete with the online market and the other carriers.  A consumer wants the tactile SP, not really thinking about the service so much, so the carriers all go by the same strategy of marketing directly that, then taking it as a given to focus on selling everything else, and stealing monthly customers from other carriers.  It is still a good place to work if you are either a college graduate without a specifically oriented degree, or have the sales talent to excel to a top seller ethically."
good,"I do not see the benefit of answering question about my current company and do not feel confortable discussing the company I am currently working for, so I will not be answering this question."
good,"Verizon puts business first.  It is a great company with great benefits and a fun culture.  As the leading wireless carrier in the country, it is a fun time to be a part of such a successful company.  A few cons include lopsided work/life balance with no leniency for family emergencies, no breaks, short-staffing leading to closing the store one day a week, increased quota by 2 due to short staffing."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for when it comes to salary and benefits. There is not much flexability when it comes to schedules, however it is preformance based meaning the better you preform, the better schedule option you will have when it comes time for a realignment."
good,High turnover. If you apply yourself you can definitely make a good life with their company. Benefits are great. You just need to be determined and want to succeed.
good,They have a odd way of evaluating the Rep.  They have the customer run the evaluation.  Which is not always a good vantage point. The customer is usually upset and you can't promise some of the things they wish.  They don't just pass out smart phone's or other things that cost money.
good,When working here you have to have realised that it isn't gonna be about the money here. It's all about the expectations and quota your supposed to meet. Most of the people here are nice but sometimes management can be a littlbmuch
good,Verizon is a great company to work for. The employees are some of the smartest people you will work with. The compensation and work life balance can be better. We are expected to work long hours and do weekend work as well.  Sometimes you are allowed to work from home but that depends on your manager.
good,"AS LONG AS YOU DONT HAVE A VINDICTIVE SUPERVISOR AND A MENTOR or someone to Fight for you, YOU WILL DO FINE. I had the worst supervisor ever multiple times who will find ways to write you up and get you fired. I ultimately resigned due to office restructure but would not go back."
good,Poor work life balance and job security is seemingly disappearing.  Good pay which is also I portant including solid healthcare.  Leadership is questionable and often provides mixed messages.
good,"Days were spent managing CRM and focused on tactical sales.  Leadership managed inflated performance metrics, which took away from conceptual and outcome based discussions.  Sales cycles were monitored on a daily basis with focus on delivering a monthly number."
good,Great place to work. Great benefits and awesome co workers. fair hours and enjoyable job. Working with others was and must and often times went really well.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I liked working for Verizon it’s just very stressful environment."
good,A typical day at work was taking calls from nice and not so nice customers. Constant changes in work procedures. Job security was very low. Managers and supervisor very strict.
good,"Very generous in terms of salary, bonus, benefits, etc. It's a very fast pace work environment and does require for you to put in many many hours. The overall culture is nice, very flexible with your work hours and working remote as long as you meet expectations. Employees are very competitive. Overall, cool place!"
good,"Highly competitive, stressful culture. Adequate management. Sales driven mentality created unethical employees. No room for advancement unless it is to store manager."
good,"The EVP(Great Person) wants a change of culture to be more productive in the call center. However, the directors and managers have a different idea, and run it like a slave ship. When I was there had the number 1 team and left to my old job because I was being pressured to write people up..I should of stayed an just switch around like all my peers did, the perks are awesome.... They just need to move the dinosaurs who are running it into the ground..."
good,Verizon is a solid company to work for with opportunity for growth in the area of sales. Work life balance could be better due to having to work weekends and late evenings.
good,Very Fun with lots of comapany activities. The managers were very helpful and worked hard to help us succeed. I do feel there were not a lot of work life balance
good,"They pay well. "
good,"The pay and benefits are excellent. However, a growing dependence on me is leading to a horrible work/life balance, and I'm just not sure I'll ever get to move on from this position as the dependence increases."
good,There is a lack of support from upper management. There are certain behaviors that are acceptable and when you complain to HR there is no resolution to your issues.
good,Good company to work for if you are young or early professional years. Difficult to advance in your career. Verizon paid 3 Masters to me but when asked for Manager position never had the opportunity so I went to another company that valued all the education that Verizon provided me
good,"Verizon was a very fast paced environment, but very enjoyable type of work.  I enjoyed dealing with customers, and helping to solve problems.  I love to always learn more."
good,Working as a Escort you just go out with a technician. Management sucks. Good job if you im school or have a life because you off on weekends. You can do overtime but it’s not mandatory. Not the best job but it’s something better than nothing. You can move up to become a technician.
good,"Supervisors are not very nice, pay and benefits are good.  Shift changes every 6 months not ideal for students are single parents yet they claim “work life balance”"
good,I liked my experience there just wasn’t what I was looking for the pace was very fast the assembly line constantly ran in a fast pace sometimes the scanners would jump off track because we were moving to fast
good,You would clock in and immediately take up to about 200-300 calls a day for customer service related issues. You received two 10 minute breaks and 1 hour lunch break.  The management would always be stressing time per calls.  You had to be under a certain time.  And one call that required a lengthy customer service would bring up your average and get you in trouble with a section manager.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"High stress atmosphere. Competitive pay. "
good,"No review to write. I loved my job there, but even though we had much more work than we could handle we were still laid off. That said, we were said to have excellent work production."
good,"I started with Verizon specifically to begin a new Career. I rose through the ranks at record speed by being promoted to Assistant Manager within 9 months (a third of the time expected to make such a move) and within 2 months of my promotion at a week after my 1 year mark my store is being closed and I am being laid off. It's painful. I haven't found new work yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I can continue on with Verizon."
good,"pay and benefits better than most. call center environment., very fast paced, pressure oriented.."
good,"My job as a consultant is to handle customer issues and attain consumer sales. As a consultant you will sit in a call center cubicle and take non stop phone calls until you are scheduled for breaks and lunches. The job is stressful. The management team expects a lot of production from their employees. It is a union position which causes a disconnect in the relationships between management and representatives. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people who are in need. The hardest part of the job is meeting the demands of the management team. I have learned that no matter how well you follow the guidelines, no matter the quality of the employee, they will find a way to get rid of you if you fail to produce."
good,Pay was great. Terrible work life balance. Management is under so much stress from higher management that they force you to push products on customers that they do not want which results in high return rates. Everything you do is micro managed.
good,Good Benefits and a overall Good company. You must leave your team in order to move up. There is always multiple layoffs throughout the year. Make sure you are a generalist and not a specialist.
good,"As an EA your job is always on the chopping block--this is what happened during the 8.000k person layoff.  Your seen as the most expendable employee, however, you work harder than most of the people around you.  You're constantly on the phone, cleaning up messes and babysitting other adults.  The job isn't hard, it's thankless."
good,No different than any other big company. The manager provided a great opportunity to build interpersonal skills. This allowed lead technicians to manage day to day operations. The only task not experienced was developing expense/capital budgets.
good,great place to work. just wish they hadn't changed our pay. The pay became so low that it affected the way reps performed in the store. It made the managers very stressful.
good,its retail sales one day you are a hero the next you are a zero. High demand to upset customers. Management micro manages. customers can be really ignorant to the device that they own.
good,Loved the work and helping customers.  The problem was the quota amount of new activation's and hardly no emphasis on assisting existing customers.  The push to sell the accessories was troublesome as well.  Especially when the customer could obtain the same items online for a fraction of the cost.
good,Great Job for someone that likes changes daily. it keeps you on your feet but you have to deal with people looking out for family and friends even when your work your best to move forward.
good,Answered 50+ incoming calls from customers helping with billing questions and setting up or moving their services. Was required to offer and sell calling services on each phone call. Hardest part of the job was meeting daily goals while still keeping customers happy and satisfied. Best part of my job was answering customers' questions and providing them services that I knew would be beneficial to them.
good,"Verizon was a good place to work, advancement was difficult, great learning environment, weak management training, good benefits and working environment"
good,"Given my previous position and Verizon hiring trends, most candidates will be internal. When it was great and sales were rolling in, everything is great (pay, management, culture). If sales are slow then leadership is going to make your life stressful no matter what you do and how hard you work. I loved individual people and managers, but not the culture as a whole. As an Account Manager I had a terrible work life balance and was always a the office and always thinking about the job. I very much enjoyed forming relationships with my customers. When you do succeed at Verizon, it is difficult not to get ""big headed"" because success there does not come easy. However, I would say there is a certain percentage of territories that you can get, where sales will pour in no matter what you will do."
good,"As a sales representative my job requirements where to have a great customer service and make sales that best fit the needs of the customer. "
good,Stressful and micro-managed environment but best benefits in the industry. Health vision dental life insurance long temr and short term disability. Overall the pay and benefits makes the poaition worth it.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I have been with Verizon for over 20 years, there are great friendships that have been developed and I have learn a lot from the company. I would like to take the skills I have learn and move on to develop myself and gain more knowledge in the management field."
good,"Very results oriented"
good,"Expert Windows Unix and Network techs. This company expertise was in operating systems. I was in monitoring for 13 years, coordinating resources and techs during outages. The in depth knowledge of the people around me here were impressive."
good,Glad I worked there and glad I left when I did!! Good people but some management needs to learn!! Ready for my next adventure!!
good,"Working hours 60-80 hours a week based on 40 hours"
good,"It was an OK place to work, working mids keeps a person on the outside.missing all the company perks. The coworkers were friendly for the most part"
good,"Pros- good pay, benefits, training, some college paid for"
good,They truly make it exceptionally hard for you to succeed. seems like there isn't much you can do to reach your goals not to mention they set unrealistic goals. and once you get used to the changes they implement they come along with new changes.
good,"centrally located in COS.  Diverse group of employees, all very skilled.  first level management was very good and supplied good direction and insight.  Strong but reasonable demands are placed upon everyone.  In general, a really good place to work."
good,"As my first job, it was very challenging but the people really helped me a lot. I learned the basics when it comes to computers and all the stuff related to customer service."
good,Strong company financially with adequate benefits.  Still stuck in the 40hrs a week at a desk mentality with little to no work schedule flexibility.
good,They think they own you. I often worked over 24hr continuous only to have them try to beat me out of ot. Drive with no sleep. Safety is number one unless it costs them money then you better take the heat if something goes wrong.
good,"Very difficult to move up and work life balance suffers for most in my role.  management is out of touch for day to day operations.  Unrealistic sales quotas this last year.  People that have exceeded quotas were not meeting them.  When only 2 people make quota in a store, there is a problem."
good,"Over the past 7 years, there have been at least one layoff each year, often times 2 a year.  Created a fearful work environment.  People are less willing to support a team and more concerned with individual credit and avoid risk taking which could grow the business."
good,"Great benefits and training, but very little job movement or advancement. You must enjoy shift work within this 24/7 environment."
good,I am an extremely hard worker! Great work ethic that i got from the United States Marine Corps. Excellent team player and customer service. Great employee to have that requires little supervision and eager to learn more!
good,"Like your typical call center, it has some old outdated games in the cafeteria for you to play on your breaks, but that is only after you finish your extra large cup of Kool-Aid. Some of the worst work/life balance i have ever seen."
good,"Fast paced environment and very good place to start a career. Learn many things about telecom, tools great trainning provided frequently to keep updated."
good,great compensation. great team of people to work with. long retail ours. great management team. great team driven job to make sure your store is the best location in your region.
good,good place to start out. low hours not the best of pay. good first job. independent contacted.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"a regular work week consists of installing 'FiOS' in homes for new customers, trouble shooting and repairing copper phone and 'FiOS' services including inside wiring as well as outside plant "
good,A typical call center.  I wanted to take the position for the challenge.  I did find that call center work was not for me.  The back to back phone calls did not present job satisfaction.
good,In a typical day I would open the store with the Store Manager. Then I would log into the inventory systems. Load all the programs into the scanner and scan all phones and top end accessories. Run the inventory report and resolve and discrepancies. I would then move to the floor to check people in and direct store traffic to promote a nice environment for co-workers and customers. I would also check in all merchandise received that day and restock shelve with accessories. I also assisted in trouble shooting phones and filing phone claims. Resolved billing issues and transferred files for customers. at the end of the day I would lock doors and help count and reconcile the cash drawer and verify the daily deposit.
good,"Start the morning by doing inventory, scaning everything in the store one by one. then we spend  hours  doing customer service, activating devices and taking bill payments. ending the day by cleaning the store and taking out the trash. Overall I  love my job and my boss is also. its basically the changes within the company that has completely lost my interest ."
good,"Good benefits, pay isn't bad by industry standards. Must be willing to change everything does with this company for better or worse. Be aware of that if you can deal with it you will do well. Management can really vary, depends on who you get as to how good they will be. It can be night and day from one location to another. If you want to move up be sure and network and foster a good relationship with your district manager"
good,"They are not your typical retail job, they have retail hours and you will work every weekend and be contacted everyday especially once in management. You will see your co-workers more than your own family. Commission goals will constantly go up and be made harder to hit. Benefits are second to none and VERY worthwhile, great 401k and really good medical benefits."
good,"Great company, but I do recommend that they increase the pay for some of the positions that they offer such as Fraud Analyst, due to the amount of work that is being taken care of. As well as focus more on developing the Agents in getting sharper at what they do. Then management can be distant at times and but overall, the company is good!"
good,"I was a retail sales rep there.  Money is good.  It is fast paced, high pressure sales though.  Work life balance is pretty bad but they do give you a lot of vacation days."
good,"working closly with customers face to face, building relationships with co-workers and customers to resolve problems. Challenging goals exceeded monthly."
good,Busy Telecommunications company.  Always new and improving
good,It was stressful being commission only and the owner would continually tell you your job or paycheck is on the line.
good,"I found myself doing and redoing based on indecisiveness of Mgt.  Not alot of thought is put into forward thinking and ultimately rework is done because team recomendations are not followed or taken seriously. Overall, brilliant engineers just a lack of cohesiveness."
good,"I liked working for Verizon, there was opportunity for advancement, they had great benefits, were flexible when I needed to work from home.  I had some great co-workers. What I liked most about my job was the flexibility and management, they allowed me lots of flexibility.  The hardest part of my was when I got laid off."
good,"Wasn't bad, felt like though you were always working, never felt like you had days off. work always followed you."
good,"o	Compiled records of charges for services rendered or goods sold, calculate and records amount of these services and goods, and prepares invoices to be sent to customers; reviewed all necessary information and computed charges using calculators or computers. Prepared itemized statements, bills, or invoices used for billing and bookkeeping purposes; Ensured that services are provided in accordance with state and Federal regulations, organizational policy, and accreditation / compliance requirements; Provided information to senior levels of management on the implication of policies and procedures being formulated and recommend specific action; Engaged in continuous study of the entire professional field, including best practices, to maintain the professional competence, knowledge, and skills necessary for the satisfactory performance of all assigned responsibilities; Completed required continuous training and education, including department specific requirements; Ensured that required documentation for activities within areas of responsibility is performed in an accurate and timely manner; Compiled data for billing personnel."
good,"At Verizon I worked in a warehouse setting, mainly because all equipment could not be stored in a damp environment until it was placed in a cabinet for the outside technicians. I worked 12 hour days from 5am to 530pm on a regular basis. The best part of this job is we always had work to do and was always busy. Hardest part was I lived 4 hours from home and when I met my wife and had a child. We decided to move back to WV where we were originally from."
good,Over all good experience and great folks to work with.
good,Managed the overall operations and field activity for Verizon Enhanced Communities within NY / NJ/ MA/ PA/ TX. Responsible for the management and supervision of a unionized workforce and the daily force to load management.
good,Not much room for advancement.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I am enjoying working for Verizon. It is a constantly changing environment and always something new to learn.
good,I was there for close to 13 years and it was good while it lasted. Great benefits and pay. Schedule was not good even with that many years I wasn't able to get a good shift.
good,"Daily construction of telephone lines, working with blueprints to maintain service to the community. Working with co-workers that are loyal and energized daily."
good,"Diffusing customer service issues and HR issues with fellow associates.. I learned scheduling, motivating/ teamwork skills. Management was very statistically driven with a vast diversity of co-workers and personalities... Behavioral issues were difficult, but teambuilder sessions were fun and educational"
good,"I worked at Verizon just as the smart phone was becoming popular. In a span of a few years we went from begging people to add a $5.00 text plan onto their account, to going on waiting lists for the latest smartphones. Loved this job, loved the product, but I hated the work life balance especially around the holidays."
good,Be prepared to work hard and deliver top results. If you do that you will love this company.
good,"I've worked for VZW since 2006, when I first started it was great. Good work culture strong possibilities for advancement and a overall awesome work environment. In the last few years culture in my center to be exact has turn into the worst working experience of my life. Management plays favorites, supervisors lie to you to cover themselves. It's High school type of behaviors from too many grown people. A typical day is constant calls from customer with issues with their device. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with nasty customer that berate you and talk down to you without you snapping back. I enjoy being able to solve problems presented with a good customer and fixing the issue. Overall VZW is a good company just not in the center where I came from."
good,Supervise team of 20 consultants whose primary goal is to resolve customer complaints while utilizing a consultative sales approach in an ultra-fast paced and highly monitored environment
good,they change things all the time in order to not pay as much. you have to kiss up to move up. you have to play theirgames. very much a boys club.
good,"Working hear was hard because, so many hands in the pots often times..folks, made up things as they went along the process. Glad, I move on"
good,"Manager always made time to listen or help if needed in a personal and technical level . No matter how busy was always available easy to work with , did not micro manage"
good,"They are usually there to help you if needed. The job did have good benefits. The job is 24/7. Holidays, weekends and anytime. Hard for people with children."
good,Good place to work. Growth and development is in place for those who want career advancement. It can be very political at times which has left a sour taste in the mouth of many.
good,While at Verizon you are only as good as what your mgr allowed you to be. And some managers were allowed to be un -ethical in how they ran their department.
good,"it was great while it lasted  management changed & it felt more as a intimidating place to work because ever since corporate was cleaned out, the employees were cared for at all."
good,"Constant inbound calls, large change in the industry over 20 years; Verizon is the industry leader in the US. Strong management, helping valued customers."
good,"You have to work hard bit pay is great and benefits are fantastic.  You are measured by metrics everywhere nd will never be good enough at your job, even as a top representative"
good,"I loved working there, but the work life balance was an issue. The management staff could have been better, some worked when other's barley came to work."
good,"Good company overall. Just make sure upu get in a dept.that the work won't be sent oversees."
good,When applying here you will go through a few different interviews and then a few weeks of training for your specific job. Then you will essentially test out of the training and be hired on or not meet the minimum requirement of comprehension/skills and be politely let go.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Bad management, micromanagement, no one cares abouyt you, youre just  anumber, would never work corporate verizon again. Bad management bottom line. NO"
good,"Management micromanages"
good,"Great pay, raise every year if you perform. The best insurance benefits I have ever seen a company providedThe job is easy. Management at that location left much to be desired. Example, management encouraging lying to the citations or management complaining when they have to get out of their office to help a rep on the floor."
good,"Being an Iqorian as we call it was definitely a different experience by itself. This was a very diverse place when it came to the employees which made the day a lot more interesting by far. while on the floor you have to be trained a good deed of time due to the non stop calls coming in from different agents, but you catch on fast and it becomes second nature to you. there is different schedules for sure depending on who your team leader was . there was four days on and 3 days off if you worked 10 or more hour shifts but you got your hours or more ."
good,"benefits drasticly trimmed back, reduced bonuses, reduceced time off, almost zero progression outside customer service and technical support call reps. However, pay is good, co workers are great, and can lead to better careers outside of Verizon within IT, Sales, or Business endeavors."
good,"Verizon Wireless was once a great job, but like most fortune 500 companies, the stress level, work load have all increased. Most people are given way more than they are able to handle and are expected to push through. At the same time, the compensations have all stalled. Further, job advancement is also frozen as new hires are expected to run in each position now and there is no time are room to train."
good,Has great benefits! The health insurance had great options. I enjoyed some of the people I worked with and I had flexibility with vacation time off...
good,"Verizon allowed me multiple work scenarios that allowed me to raise my children while doing my job well. I am forever grateful."
good,"I enjoy working in Verizon company for 4 years as a lead QA test engineer. "
good,Good Company limited opportunities where i live that why i had to move out of state. Management is over worked at times and it is felt down the line but that is any job. Good benifits
good,It was a great company with a good culture. They acknowledged their employees and leaders. Was a leader in the industry. However I wouldn’t go back. The salary is lower than any of it competitors.
good,The work was ok. The people that worked there where ok they looked out for them self’s only. But same supervisor looked out for the team and they would not let thinks roll down hill. That was the reason why I went back to school to get my degree in business.
good,Great training. Benefits offered day of start which Is great! Management in my location were super unprofessional and rude to customers leaving them upset and issues unresolved leaving store threatening to call the attorney general on us. No room for advancement at my location anyways. The wrong people get promoted and sales reps would like to your repeat customers and state you di not work there anymore just to get a sale. Management would play stupid and do nothing about it when brought up to them even when customer tells them that was what they were told.
good,Working for Verizon was a good stepping stone for my career. Even though it was hard hours that included nights and weekends it was worth the experience.
good,I worked with some of the finest individuals at Verizon. Most workers stick together and help each other out when necessary. The company promotes that environment.
good,Working at Verizon offered me the opportunity to work with a lot of great people. The culture at Verizon was very family oriented and the benefits were great.
good,"Learned how to deal with many different types of customers, and acquired problem solving skills as well as many technical skills with Internet support."
good,The Verizon experience varies depending on your department and job location.  There is a move to divest of the land line business to focus on Wireless and content.
good,"fast paced very busy, full of training to keep up with new features/services/equipment"
good,"Money was good. Weekly pay was awesome. Used to have a good chef in the cafeteria but he quit to start his own business. Food went downhill from there. Starbucks was good if you had the right person making your drink. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"It is face paced but once you get the hang of the job the day goes very quickly, The lack of overtime us is the only reason I am looking for additional employment"
good,Enjoyed my time at Verizon. I wanted to take advantage of accepting a management position at another company. I would return to work at Verizon if approved to return.
good,"While I appreciated the benefits, I got to a point where myself, and a handful of others end up partaking in FMLA disability time off due to how bad the stress and unorganized chaos constantly ravages Verizon call centers. I worked in the Chandler call center in Arizona. Managers almost never agree in facts. They have ""meetings"" ALL AT ONCE with either zero or a lack of support when sups are needed for approvals, etc."
good,I worked for a retailer therefore the rules and regulations are slightly different than at corporate. My retailer underpaid us with no benefits and overworked us.
good,"After the merger, not one employee was safe and severances were not  guaranteed.  The company lost an enormous amount of deep knowledge and began to port their jobs overseas."
good,Management was hit and miss through my roles. Moving up is more towards who you know rather than what.I did move up and relocate twice for job advancement.
good,Verizons benefit package is top tier only issue was the work life balance. Hours could be better but its still retail so its expected to work all weekends and holidays.
good,in this job you learned how to have patience as well as how to build relationships. the enjoyable part is seeing people leave happy with what they wanted. i learned how to time manage and how to multi-task very well when we were short of staff.
good,"My only complaint is the lack of career advancement focus. The company pays a decent wage but within the past few years, there's been more of a company focus on industry competition and acquisitions."
good,I had a great boss for the first year and he was demoted and eventually fired. I reported to his boss and was treated fair because my team was making quota monthly
good,Being part of the corporate clique can make or break some people from advancing. Great benefits. stressful as all call centers are. Leadership policies have become less employee friendly in the recent years.
good,"I work at a third party Verizon. I do not speak for Verizon themselves, only the Third party Verizon that I worked at. You have to really be good at sales"
good,Job is fun and great people but long days and mostly commission so hard to make money also a lot of door to door sale so you never really know what's gonna happen or where you are gonna be placed
good,"Afforded the opportunity for advancement, job related certifications and good benefits.  Working remotely was a pro and a con in that I spent a minimum of 12 hours daily - often times longer - at the job.  While saving time to commute it did require me to be available 24/7"
good,"Verizon is a great place to work with excellent pay, however scheduling was unpredictable do to upper management, the chain of command was sometime difficult"
good,Very easy job if you know how to work with different people and clients have very good people skills over the phone overall a very chilled job to work at
good,Verizon provides great benefits and great pay! Working for Verizon can be very challenging but also very rewarding!  If you're willing to put in the time and effort Verizon Wireless can easily be a life long career!
good,This job was absolutely fantastic if you have the ability to be on your phone 24/7. If you have a family and want a life out side of work you are going to not do well in your life. Great way to learn work ethic and the ability to know that there are more important things in life then money. the job is one of the hardest jobs I've ever had to walk away from because you are so deep in to the job that you feel like there is nothing else in life that matters but making sure that your store and work is pumping out the numbers.
good,"Fortune 500 Company, great benefits, enjoyed the tuition reimbursement program.  Career advancement was available in retail management.  I wanted to get into Human Resource but their head quarters is in New Jersey.  Management loves to micro manage which I was not a fan.  Retail hours are not fun and weekends we had to work.  Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend."
good,"First job out of college - introduced me to business world.  Work Life balance is always a struggle when it comes to retail hours, but one should know this when they are signing up"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Had a decent experience working as a consultant at Verizon Wireless. Their contract tends to be around 30 months which is fairly long for a consultant. Pay rates were average compared to other employers in the area. Telecom being a saturated market the confidence among employees are not very good and that leads to a not very positive work environment. Layoffs every year also leads to a negative work culture.
good,"A lot to learn in the environment but not enough money or opportunity for commission for some locations. Laid back work space, management handles thing in a different way then most places. Not anything to hard to do, once you get the hang of the position it becomes easier with time."
good,"A good company to work for as a starting point in your career, but get ready for a lot of continuous change. Things are always changing. I had 5 different managers in the 4 years I was there and worked with quite a few new people."
good,"Company is going through a transition. They are currently trying to reduce workforce through a volunteer program."
good,Great pay and good benefits.  Union is week due to displacement.  Company does not care about you or the customers.  The only thing that matters is the bottom line.  The unwritten policy is patch and go. Management is so bad it's a joke.
good,Things have changed recently with leadership and you can feel the change from the bottom up. There is so much uncertainty in the company that it makes it difficult to focus on your job.
good,"Vz told me I was a perminent employee both times I worked for them, but after a couple of years they give you a pink slip.  I worked for them for almost 10 years in the combined two times they hired me."
good,Sometimes it was the best job in the world.  It was fun helping customers learn what worked for them the best and then also helping them learn to play with their new tech
good,Typical day is busy and fast paced focused on providing the best possible service to our customers. Culture is focused outward on the customer and on integrity. Most difficult part of the job is working with outdated tools. Most enjoyable part of the job is satisfaction of providing excellent service to our internal and external clients.
good,"Going over sale packages"
good,Decent place to work. Benefits and compensation was pretty good. Management could have been improved and maybe more of a focus on customers instead of selling everyone everything. Maybe take the time to figure out what would work best for each person.
good,"Benefits of Verizon are very good, the 401K is one of the best in the industry. Salary is above the average in the industry."
good,Compensation is what is keeping me here. This company does not help you get promoted and it still plays the game of connections/who you know in order to advance.
good,I mean they pay well but it is a high stress job and watch out for management. They will screw you over the second they get the chance. You get a lot of paid time off but if something comes up and you get sick it is a bit more difficult. It’s corporate and if that’s okay with you then you will like it.
good,"Great company to work for in regards to job security, and or benefits.  Timeliness is of utter importance to the company. Verizon is unionized as well which is a benefit for all who work there."
good,"Great place to work for,  Had a lot of freedom to make my own time. Challenging environment from a technical and customer relations stand point. Work Life balance was great but did include plenty of travel up 60%."
good,"Verizon is always at the for front in wireless solutions, however management is stuck in the outdated style and cannot allow growth while hiding behind policies."
good,"A seasoned manager, engineer & technician with over 10 years’ plusexperience in the telecommunications industry. Areas of technology and electrical engineering, responsible for the delivery of high-quality off-air CATV, satellite, microwave, and digital transport programming up to end user, outside plant (point of demarcation from ISP facilities). Utilizing, maintaining and installing a variety of optical and electrical interfaces including but not limited to coaxial cable, microwave, and fiber optic transmission."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,No matter how hard you work it is never enough - there is a constant attitude of never enough - management is afraid to compliment you in fear that you will relax or stop working..
good,Verizon was a job that used to pay very well for the hard work and time spent working. Employees are now the human element to take the brunt of customer frustrations.
good,OK for contractor/consultant work.  was only a contract worker.  Had a good manager to work with.  Did not interact with upper managment or attend staff meetings.
good,"they will ask you to take on responsibilities and not pay you more for it. they wont advance you if you're not well connected with management. They play favorites and its all politics here with this company. So if you plan on moving up in the company, get to know your managers and really bend over backwards for them if you want a chance at promotion"
good,a typical day at Verizon is based upon door swings and independent customer base. Very fast paced and high stress at times but enjoyable overall. Management teams change often. Ability to be promoted In the company is satisfactory. Work-life balance is a struggle but on the flipside you are benefited with  vacation and pto.
good,"Start your day with counting inventory, and cleaning up the store. Once open hurry up and wait for a customer to walk in. Management was not concerned with how to get customers in the door just what you did with the walk ins. Must hit goals, but fun dealing with the customers and helping them maximize their service for dollars spent."
good,Always very busy. Management played favorites and you had to learn on the fly. Dont expect to ask coworkers for help. The hardest part of the job is feeling valued as a member of a team.
good,"Managers do not promote from within, culture lacks motivation and aspiration. Job function is mundane and there is no growth within the department. Moving to a different department is impossible and no other manger takes you seriously. The hardest part of the job is knowing you have to come and tolerate such a work environment day in and day out."
good,The managers want the reps to sell customer things that they didn’t need or want.  The district manager wanted results that were unattainable based on customer ability to afford.  Management allowed reps to fast talk customer for number or commissions but these products was returned at other location.
good,Work hard and it will pay off.  There's always new products that you'll have to learn and always a different scenario everyday that you'll encounter each day which keeps it interesting and on your toes.
good,"I worked for VZ for 17yrs and overall my experience was good. At the end it was time for me to move on. I didn't see eye to eye with my direct mgmt and although it was always professional I did not want to be in that environment any longer.  VZ is a enormous company with endless resources and I think they are headed in the right direction, focusing on 5G and Security. I admire the CEO and his leadership. I believe VZ is a leader in innovation and maybe I will work there again one day. The Engineering (Solution Architect) organization has went through changes. They are considered customer facing and have more a sales role than in the past. An SA is expected to be onsite for 5 customer meetings per week, with or without the account manager. There is tremendous pressure on the SA organization to be more sales focused. Due to the geographic importance of where the SAs are located there was a large RIF. They gave me the option to move from Tulsa to Dallas and I declined and accepted a severance. Several SAs where given the same ultimatum including an SA with 40yrs with the company. I'm not saying this is negative but just the direction they have chose to go, and is a fact."
good,It was a contract position through Aquent. I had a wonderful manager and the work was interesting and valued. the pay from Aquent was marginal but adequate.
good,"Fast-paced, competitive, fun environment in many ways. Yet management and the cutthroat ""1st or nothing"" mentality makes it a bear to work through. "
good,Working at Verizon Wireless was definitely stressful but fun.  It became worse with every year that passed.  So many layoffs with multiple departments and titles across the entire country.  Their prices are too expensive compared to their competitors.  Which made revenue difficult over the years and caused the closing of tons of locations and down sizing of departments.  The stores no longer have tech support or customer service reps.  They only have sales reps who are paid primarily from commission.  This causes the focus to mostly be on sales instead of the overall help that customers need which includes device problems and education.  Years ago I promoted their company to everyone.  Not anymore.
good,"Verizon has many good qualities but the under belly of the beast is what makes it so stressful."
good,The problem was Verizon had just come out of a strike and part of the union demand was to hire more people to help out with the workload. Verizon just gave the new guys 3 months contracts. They were not going to keep everybody they hire. They wanted to meet the union demand and that's what they did.
good,"Was a company trying to work into a secured area and thus was difficult.  No note taking, only memory, no visual aids, no study materials, no flexibility for learning. Training class was to short."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I enjoyed this temporary position. The hours and days off were consistent. It was also very close to home,so I didn't have to travel far. I also got to learn about this company. It taught me many other skills I needed to advance my skills."
good,"Interactions with customers and setting up quotes.."
good,"I worked at Verizon for 12 years. This is an interesting & innovative company. It IS cut throat. There a many quotas & goals you MUST hit. There is also an ever changing learning curve due the various products, which are ever changing.  The position is well compensated with tenure. You WILL WORK for every dime you make. This is definitely cut - throat & NOT for the faint of heart. Procede if you have plenty of T-Cells to spare & dare."
good,Very fast paced environment no matter what your role is. Pretty stressful. Good pay. Good benefits. Good hours. Strong union. Management wasn't the best. They treat you like you're before them as a person
good,"The culture is just okay, the pay is good for that industry.  Unfortunately they do not value good management.  It seems a lot of the managers lead by fear as opposed to constructive criticism and helping you achieve what they are you asking for.  In addition to this there are an abundance of corporate politics that get in the way of doing the right thing every time.  I guess that is just corporate america"
good,"Good money, No work life balance, overall great company . many positions available within the company just depends what area of expertise your into . p"
good,Union Vs Management and you're the ping pong in the middle. Great pay and benefits but you trade in your soul. The days are long and dont make plans with your significant other because there is forced overtime.
good,"Verizon has much to offer its employees, but would do well to value them more and to focus management attention on building employees up versus climbing the corporate ladder."
good,"When compared to other major publicly traded companies, Verizon is a great place to work. However, the ever changing and cut throat telecom industry is resulting in non-stop reorganizations, budget cut and naturally lay offs."
good,It's a high pressure sales environment. The work life balance can be hard sometimes. My manager is reasonable. Not all are. Overall I am grateful for the opportunity. It really is a great job if you come in with the awareness of what it is. I am low maintenance.
good,It will definitely keep you up to date with the latest and greatest.  They have training to teach you about the new products and also the new services.
good,"Typically, work days will keep you on your toes (depending on coworkers' attitudes and store traffic) but the commission structure makes it difficult to exceed quota and be recognized for awards/promotions without cutting corners. Some representatives who do well in sales may not be as qualified to manage when promoted to leadership roles and can affect the way the rest of the store performs due to ineffective leadership tactics. If you enjoy working in a fast-paced environment and being on your feet all day working with people face-to-face, working as a retail sales rep can be a good place to start your career and will humble you quickly as you mature professionally in preparation for future endeavors. However, unless you're really good at driving your own business from outbound calls to drive in-store traffic, it can be difficult to make more money while maintaining a certain level of moral conscience and integrity when it comes to being honest to customers and selling them what they actually want/need. Any management promotion or career advancement within corporate structure may involve relocating to get to where you want to be, so those who are more flexible may see quicker job advancement."
good,"hard work, a lot of stress, retail hours. really you should try to get a job for Verizon that isn't sales related.  you would still be paid fairly and have all benefits"
good,"The store opens at 10am where we open the safe in the back start up the computers and sign in to our work stations. Each sale we produce, whether its accessories or an activation, we receive commission and sometimes have focus days were we win prizes for selling new lines."
good,Fast paced company. Great experience in dealing with irate customers and problem solving. Enjoyed making a difference in customers' lives and improving customer client relations.
good,"A typical day working for Verizon Wireless/Cellular Sales was relaxed. I took a lot of pride in taking care of customers whether it was sales related or technical support. I just wanted the customer to experience the WOW factor. It was very common to have customers calling me after hours to get advice on their new device and I always took the time to help them out. That meant I worked from home too. I do not think there was anything hard about the job at all, maybe when the system crashed and I was helping a customer with whatever they needed."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"very fast paced, high quotas when quotas are met one month they are increased so much the next month making it impossible to meet. Upper leadership not held accountable for actions. pressure is put on store employees"
good,dealing with upper management it depends on who you report to other wise good most people are nice to work with retail hours sometime can be tough makiing sales
good,"Made outgoing calls, on an automated dialer, to customers whose cell phone bills were past due and/or disconnected. Hardest part of the job was advising customers what the call was for and having to explain their past due account. Best part of job was learning that I was able to quickly relate to customers and put them at ease."
good,Verizon Wireless provided the skillset needed in order to grow within the company. There is a lot of room for advancement if the employee chooses to grow with the company.
good,"If you’re not into office politics - this is not the right place for you.  With a constant changing environment, it’s no wonder why everyone is paranoid and overly political about everything. Great company and a good place to work in Lake Mary, but not for another 5 years."
good,Gained experience regarding the telecommunications industry. Enjoyed helping customers regarding their services and getting them a fair price. management was supportive and pushed everyone the be the best that they could be. hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customer who would not take no for a answer.
good,Work was great people were great in my department.  There was no accountability for decisions made at the top that lost millions in revenue causing a shift in the work force and a down turn in employment progression.
good,"Great company for the most part . HIghly fast pace and stressful at times. Alot of changes taking place , so if you cant handle change this company isnt for you. Otherwise rewarding in salary and bennies, bonus."
good,"The company offers great pay and benefits. However, the job is very stressful because your performance is based off of numbers. A lot of those numbers are not in your control but the customer or management perception which can be very frustrating. There is no consistent in the company. Also being based off of performance you have others that will do anything to get the numbers even if its misleading or not in good integrity"
good,"Was laid off, position was eliminated. I was at top pay so it made business sense to eliminate the position. In sales, competitors in wireless make the Verizon business slow."
good,"I relocated from California emergencies the job suited a purpose at the time but it's not a career based Avenue for key."
good,"Verizon is a fantastic place to work full of great benefits. If you're willing to do what it takes to network your way to the top Verizon can be a successful career for you. What most college students aren't aware of is that Verizon does offer a prepaid tuition program as well, so you can work, get your degree paid for and learn new skills!"
good,"Verizon Wireless has excellent pay and benefits and an annual bonus that most companies no longer offer. The benefits were superior to other companies that I've worked for. However, it is difficult to balance work and life in some of the work environments such as retail."
good,Verizon offers very good pay and benefits however layoffs and uncertainty are as constant as the daily operations and projects change. I do have some freedom to perform my duties but as is in most cases I am hamstrung by finance and moratoriums to perform my job at the highest level.
good,A typical work day consisted of maintenance and Cell inspections.  Verizon was unique because as a cell tech we handled all aspects of cell inspection and repairs.  Other companies appeared to work based on levels.  Management with the company over my last 5 years with the company suffered greatly. The job culture was good do to the people I worked with.  The hardest part of the job was the on call scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was trouble shooting and repairing.
good,"Benefits are best of interests to anyone who works here. Chances for advancement are close to none. If you want to be a top director or manager better to have a masters degree and experience because they currently have people who already have those positions and have been there ten plus years and will do anything to keep those positions. I cannot standby this company who give their employees everything to take care of themselves but treat them like garbage. I will be fine without them and support anyone who still is working for them there are still opportunities on the outside of Verizon as a company if your looking for work. Verizon is a great experience from the past at the moment any company will hire you. Good luck, your going to need all of it that you can get."
good,Not very flexible when it comes to changing your shift when you have children or other commitments. They did have excellent pay and benefits and it would be a wonderful job for somebody who is single.
good,"work my way up from operator services to finance department."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"From what I can tell things have changed since I left 2 years ago. A typical day was walking in and being greeted by other employees who would check to see if time was available to go home. It is what it is but being a punching bag for people got old after 6 years. Management was pretty much useless for airing any problems (I've heard this has gotten better). Also work/life schedules were impossible. No real flexibility (I've heard this has changed somewhat also) The worst part of the job isn't really the companies fault, it's just people. It wears on the soul."
good,"We got one half hour lunch and two ten minute breaks. Not enough when you're sitting down all day in a chair. There isn't enough team building with other employees such as competition with other teams or certain days you could wear certain things. Just very boring at times. The management was okay, but my team leader was amazing. The hardest part of the job is making sure your production minutes was on point or you could get in trouble. Everyone was off dude to a lot of reasons but very strict on taking bathroom breaks which I didn't like. The most enjoyable part of the job is always learning about new ways to improve your own customer service skills. But a typical day would get into work, log in and get right to work. Spend the next 2 and half hours on the phone before your first ten minute break. Then another 2 hours or so before your half hour lunch. That continues on with another 2 plus hours before your last ten minute break and off to home. Very boring day but it's up to you to try to make it as enjoyable as possible. I just wish there was more team bonding or more time off the phone to regroup or longer breaks to stretch. Sometimes you lose focus on your work when sitting for hours at a time."
good,Great company to work for due to pay and benefits. No room for advancement and you become complacent. Decent hours and schedules change every six months.
good,"Certain things were great. Great money in a field of technology that's going nowhere but up. With that being said, the expectations of the managers and company as a whole seemed a bit...aggressive. It became difficult for the sales reps to sell what they already had to returning customers. Getting a day off for any reason other than death was quite impossible. Mandatory Friday morning meetings a 7:00am, mandatory whether you were schedule a day off or not, were completely unnecessary. Email fixes this issue for thousands of other companies. Benefits were great. Management was usually the person that sucked the most up. I rarely found positive leadership throughout the company and it's different regions. It seemed they were more concerned about who followed their rules blindly than chose what was best for their store and its employees. Staying open until 8:00PM on Christmas eve is an example."
good,The company overall is amazing. The culture is top notch and the opportunities for advancement are definitely available. The problem is when you have such a large company sometimes the message doesn't trickle down the chain. At times you will have a bad apple such as management or co-workers. It's hard to create a better culture without the help of your team.
good,I had a great team but the damage from the past still lingers and current management is not allowed to help the situation. Verizon is drowning itself one unhappy customer at a time from past mistakes.
good,"Very driven culture."
good,Verizon Wireless is a very big company and is growing rapidly. As an employee you have a lot of opportunities to grow. It is a great place to work while you are in school and taking easy courses.
good,"Verizon is good place and good people to work . This is a fast pace work environment and I have learned a lot , people are friendly and close knit so its easy to work ."
good,"It feels like your job is always on the line.  The people are nice, but the work comes in spurts so you can be drowning and overworked for months followed by a month of boredom."
good,I loved my job however the culture change made me want another  direction. I saw the quotas go higher and the goals harder to reach nothing else to say
good,it's a job where you have a busy schedule. takes up most of your day and if you are money hungry then you would be perfect. want to purchase new stuff like a car and house verizon is good.
good,I worked there years ago so I don't remember everything. it was a while ago when I worked there... only thing I really remember was my lunch getting stolen a few time
good,Good Salary but no work life balance. Lot of micro management from the top management. No freedom to take decisions on own. Work is hectic with lot of followups from top management.
good,"A typical day at Verizon can be demanding but rewarding. You are very well trained and developed. I gained excellent leadership and problem solving skills. Advancement can b difficult, but not impossible with determination,"
good,"Very demanding jobs and almost impossible to advance without moving just based on the scale on the business. If you manage to survive the dynamic business and position changes, you can make good money."
good,Verizon was a good place to work. Pay was great and employees that I worked with are some of my best friends. Work life balance could be better. Their ability to promote within is terrible and the their management/leadership program is wanting.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Love working for the company however if your looking for a stable income commission based is not for you. also hours are super long so I don't recommend for anyone with children.
good,"Great company to work for, especially in comparison to most. Have instant benefits, great competitive pay if you put the work in. It's a different type of sales job. As long as you're open, coachable, and can bring a positive energetic attitude to work everyday you will succeed. Be prepared to work retail hours which are very inconsistent."
good,Job requirements were very grueling and a lot was expected of you. Very numbers based as you had explicit metrics you needed to obtain in order to remain employed and make a good pay check.
good,Gave me the opportunity to obtain a college  degree and provide for my family.  Great medical benefits and 401K matching.  Culture change in progress when I left Verizon.
good,"Loved my job, fast paced and made a great living. Management where I come from was very political and handled situations poorly.Overall I ended up leaving even though the money was great, I would consider going back to Verizon however at a different location"
good,The best part about working at verizon wireless is working with people and being able to apply my customer service skills everyday on the job.The typical day on the job was loading and unloading trucks and making
good,"during the day if not busy review promotions, work on learning portals, keep a clean work place. Once there are customers we must attend to all their needs and questions, I have learned how to work under pressure when left alone at my store I was located at, and how to solve a customers problems to something as small as a plan change to something as large as their phone falling apart."
good,"Entry level positions can be quite lucrative, but recent reorganizations have seriously hampered advancement opportunities. Job functions outside of direct store involvement are risky, as annual realignments have induced severe cutbacks over the years."
good,"Tons of a work load, not enough pay or solid comission. Goals are reachable with the right months. Anything outside, your lucky if you hit. If not, no store grace or exceptions. Rely on mainly hourly pay unless in an area with constant driven traffic."
good,"Good company that hires great people.  You are trained better than you've ever been by any previous employer.   They provide excellent benefits, excellent pay.  "
good,Taking 95% inbound calls with 5% outbound calls. Learned how to sympathize and empathize with customers when needed. Co-workers were easy to get along with in general. Always being ready for a change or challenge at any given moment. Departments always had an annual summer outdoor activity to help with team building techniques.
good,It a hectic work place and you may have to take about 60 calls no matter the nature of their calls. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management.
good,Great Pay and benefits. Work/Life Balance is not so great. Very demanding hours and family life is supported but respected.
good,I enjoyed my time at Verizon. I was sorry to have to leave.  The people and  management were wonderful.  Never a dull moment.  Verizon was a fast paced atmosphere which I enjoyed thoroughly.  Lots of work to be done. I had lots of interaction with my customers helping them with their Purchase Orders and resolving conflicts so that my customers could be paid.  I was sorry to have to leave due to my contract coming to an end.  I would have liked to stay on longer and possibly of gotten hired fulltime.
good,loved working for Cellular Sales but the business volume due to commission base only was not working for my lifestyle. I was able to work my own schedule and utilize my customer service/management skills. I became a lead/manager/trainer but the volume of customers has decresed drastically in the last year.
good,"A typical day at work all depended on which day of the week it was and how many customers we would receive. A slow day would usually be a Monday, and the most busiest day would be a Saturday the day after everyone got payed. I learned many sales rep task in this job, and the hardest i would say was when I first started learning how to do inventory."
good,You will definitely learn a few things about sales and business working with any company associated with Verizon. general sales skills will be acquired and general phone knowledge will come with time and proper training.
good,"Good compensation and benefits, but poor technical career path and weak management.  Corporate philosophy is 'goal oriented' and not employee focused."
good,"Verizon was not the funnest place to work, but at least my co-workers had a sense of humor, we would often brake each other out of routine for a quick hello, i thought that was nice. "
good,"A typical workday would be coming in and doing inventory, making sure the store is clean and organized. Making bank deposits and uploaded said documents to management. Updating on current promotions to know what to sell to the customers. Knowing the prices of the devices and seeing what the best option it was for me to sell to the customers based on their needs. As assistant manager I would have to handle day to day operations as well as escalations that may occur. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Working at Verizon was very pleasant.  I was an administrative assistant, supporting the VP's executive assistant and several middle managers in one of the major marketing departments.  Both my co-workers and the management people were friendly and caring.  The work itself was not particularly stimulating, but the atmosphere of the office and the friendliness of the people made it worthwhile."
good,"a relatively good place to work for a few years, or possibly make a career out of it, if so inclined.  "
good,"As technology is consistently transient environment, working at Verizon Wireless means staying up-to-date with people, trends, and technology!"
good,"Good product base company in Telecom Domain and Wireless technologies in the US and other continents."
good,"A typical day consists of being dispatched to a job site and then gaining access to that job site. Securing the needed tools and supplies is usually required before arriving at the job site. Analyzing the Engineers Plan and a survey of the job is often necessary. Engineer's plans more often than not must be modified for actual job completion. Conversing with key people on a job site is often required which could include a Super, Building Manager, Contractor, Customer or other pertinent individuals. Completing of the job assigned may require delegation of duties to coworkers. Open communication with supervisory staff is ongoing on the status of the job, any barriers to completion as well as the expected completion of a particular job."
good,"Verizon, one of the largest telecommunications is trying to change; much of management comes from the days when telecommunications revenues were made by being awarded exclusive territories.  Wire business suffers; wireless is very competitive.  Much wireless business management came from the retail sector.  Wireless solutions are, for the most part, not owned by Verizon and there is no revenue passing (as in most other industries)."
good,"Given that this a verizon sponsored program for the currently known School of Technology for North Carolina A&T State University, I felt that working enjoyable."
good,"Mega company. they have the money, and position to be very cutting edge should they want to. The wireless division should be profitable, and the company make 18B a quarter. so job security should be there"
good,The company promotes change and is always looking into new avenues to improve their product. The company has great benefits but does not hesitate to layoff its employees.
good,"I work with a lot of Verizon wireline employees everyday, which helps me improve my communication and interpersonal skills. I am assigned projects every week that requires me to meet certain deadlines, which justifies my work ethics and organizational skills. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the gratitude that people give me after helping them for several weeks or months to improve their lives and getting them back on track towards a healthier lifestyle."
good,"Management position, mail room setting. shipping and receiving, The hardest part of this position was the different hours and different shifts that i needed to cover. The best part of this this job was the facility and its accommodations."
good,"ok work place, "
good,Overall a good company to work for and co-workers are great! Good compensation except work have to work on most weekends and management have ease of leaving early when they work.
good,"There would be a pre-shift meeting to go over results from prior day and how certain fallacies can be improved simply by discussing them. Our team leads would discuss several ways to escalate different situations in a very proficient way. Co-workers would always mention different things that would help them when it comes to making more sales and productivity. As far as doing the job, it would be great knowing that I was helping customers in great ways."
good,I enjoyed the management role. I thrive in customer service based work environments. The hardest part of the job was acting as a go between for Verizon corporate and my customers. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was seeing the smile on my customer's faces after they had a glitch resolved or upgraded their device.
good,It is a good company to work for. They are quite big and it is easy to get lost in the crowd and not stand out making it difficult for new opportunities.
good,"Migrated anywhere from 5 to 300 laptops."
good,"It's a good place to work and the direction the company is going is positive."
good,"I worked for this company for several years. Its a really good company to work for. The people and work culture are all great. Pay is good, This is a call center environment and its a entry level NOC/IT support role. For several years the company has been going through re organization and downsizing. I eventually opted out for a volutary layoff and moved to a new company."
good,"The work environment was very hospitable. My coworkers made it very easy to come to work everyday and have a good day. everyone was very nice. Our union was active and helpful, whatever you needed there was always a steward available to assist you."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Fun place to work, get to meet a lot of interesting people. The goal is to sell as much as you can as well as providing the best customer service."
good,Going through a transition. Great people to work with. Work from home. Upper management seems unclear on their strategy for improvement and plan for strengthening the company.
good,I enjoyed working at Verizon. I worked with the data team to develop solutions for Verizon customer. It has a great team environment.
good,"I had 10 very good years of serving under two excellent Region Presidents at Verizon. My role grew with the company, as I have done with previous employers (Nokia/Pillowtex) and was given opportunities to manage a variety of functions."
good,"Career within current department has hit a ceiling and become stagnant.  As a result, seeking new and challenging opportunities."
good,"It was fun introducing the NYC market to an affordable and new cable experience. There was a good mixture of event planning, sales,customer service on a daily basis."
good,Verizon has been a great home. A typical work day is going customer base and looking for new logos. The management team is heavily invested in you and always looking for ways for you to succeed. My coworkers are great people and are always available to bounce ideas off of.
good,walk door to door and sell the Verizon product. walking up to a compete stranger and selling them a product was a learning experience. which taught me about people relation.
good,"Worked with the staff of Bryant Park to ensure smooth load in and out of large scenic installation."
good,I enjoyed my time at Verizon. The work/life balance can be difficult because your schedule change every 6 months. In my experience I was able to work on a far amount projects that I was able to work on. I had a difficult time advancing into a management position when available but was not given feedback as to why or what I needed to improve to secure the position.
good,Very good company but very hectic work schedule and less benefits to contractors
good,"The first 20 years of my career were with MCI which was an awesome entrepreneurial company in which you were given the opportunity to succeed or fail.  Verizon was very much an old style bureaucracy in which you would never do something without permission.  At MCI it was always better to ask for forgiveness than permission.  "
good,"I have no comments to share.  Pay was fair, culture is changing."
good,A typical day at work was a basic Triple play install and a trouble ticket or two. Co-Workers are great. lots of great people . I learned a lot of new things about Fiber optics and Coax and Data cabling . The hardest part of the job was the frustration that came along with all the intermittent issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was just knowing that you did a great job and giving a customer what they want.
good,"the largest part of the job was cold calling old clients, also i was required to give out my personal phone number, which i had to be able to be reached at 24 hours a day/"
good,"Daily duties include making inbound/outbound calls to customers regarding payments to accounts, assisting customers with making repairs to equipment, and informing customers about promotions/offers and deals. I learned how to sell products/services over the telephone, use the phone-operating systems in the call center and multitask in a professional setting. Working with my coworkers has been an excellent experience. I've learned different selling techniques from numerous people. The most enjoyable part of the job has been the incentives and benefits offered to us. The accolades have made every day interesting and worth it."
good,I enjoyed working for Verizon for many years.  I was always very busy with customers issues on the phone or thru email.  I did learn many skills such problem solving and analyzing problems to determine as solution.   I had met a lot of people over the years.  Many of them became some of my best friends and still are.  I hardest part of my job was to try and help customers protect their information so they would not be a victim of identity fraud.
good,"Verizon is massive--something like 250,000 employees. Constantly they have internal issues. How many VPs again? Over 100? This country has how many? 1?"
good,"Working for Zwireless is an enjoyable experience.  The company tries its hardest to satisfy the needs of all its employees.  "
good,work life balance was very much lacking but the compensation and benefits are great
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Responsibilities included assisting customers with technical support related to wireless devices.
good,Enjoyed every minute of working and learning state of the art technology and equipment. Would love to learn more and become an advanced professional in my filed.
good,"Cellular Sales is an exclusive retailer for Verizon Wireless, they operate over 550 retail locations nationwide with over 3,500 sales professionals. Since 1993, they have experienced over 19 consecutive years of positive growth. Skills associated with this sales opportunity have included developing new personal and business accounts. Also providing information about our wireless "
good,"Verizon is overall a good company to work for. Pay and benefits are awesome. It is a little difficult to make the needed transitions into new position or to develop your career, especially when trying to transition out of retail to a corporate position."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of meeting sales goals( at least 3 phone sales a day) meeting all customers needs which ranged from fixing internal problems with phones to paying phone bills and performing daily duties like, contacting previous customers about their new service."
good,"As a Verizon/contractor every day at work has given me the ability to learn and experience new knowledge. The management is excellent and the co-workers are united to accomplish each day agenda. The hardest part of the job would be having to solve an issue which has to be resolved the same day. It means sending emails, making phone calls, and arranging schedules. For the most enjoyable part I would say being able to help others."
good,helping customers was not always pleasant but it was a part of the job.  It was very disappointing when the department closed down.
good,The work environment and employees were easy to get along with during the work day. At times it could be a very demanding day due to the dynamics of the business when it came to troubleshooting problems with vary customer networks.
good,Enjoyed working for this company. There were great benefits and compensation.
good,"Atomosphere wasn,t the greatest, but there are great people to work with."
good,I already reviewed this company and feel that I said my peace on the previous review. It has changed over the years but is still a leader in the industry.
good,"Great cellular provider, great compensation with base salary and commission for sales. Did not like store environment and micro management, require high quotas but burden sales reps with scorecard quotas that dont make you any money. Very hard to take prolonged time off due to short staffing, longer than 4 days almost always denied."
good,"Very productive company that micromanages employees heavily to manage company costs and provide a superior product to it's customers.  Innovation and product superiority are unparalleled.  Very demanding job that requires dealing with very high stress levels.  Very rewarding when you are able to help a customer with a problem, and provide real working solutions."
good,"A typical day was completing work requests related to business products that included the adding, moving, reprogramming, outing of telephones and equipment. I learned how to analyze and complete 5 residential repairs to telephones, modems and cable equipment daily. I only worked with co-workers if the job was bigger than expected and lasted more that 3 hours to complete. I think that hardest part of the job was having to climb 30 foot polls in the rain. "
good,"answering phones, handled escalated calls of irate customers, managed accounts for Vol(Verizon online accounts) to get started with setups and disconnects, credits and complaints."
good,"Verizon is a good, solid employer who provides excellent benefits and compensation.  Although rewarding financially, it is a very high stress environment.  The most difficult part of the job was juggling internal and customer requirements."
good,"great company to work for, awesome employees, would recommend this company to anyone"
good,"My typical day at work begins at home with checking email and numbers. Then I travel to various retailers developing relationships, training, merchandising  and management of all Verizon Wireless services sold. I started with the company almost 6 years ago in a Corporate Retail Store as an Assistant Manager but due to my previous experience I quickly moved up to my current position. I work with a team of very dedicated and hard working individuals who all have previous management experience in the company. I am seeking employment currently because I no longer feel there is room for advancement. I truly enjoy my job and I love that I make my own hours but I would prefer a Monday through Friday schedule."
good,"Out of college, started my IT career here.  Learned and grew in this organization which was originally MCI but later became Worldcom and eventually Verizon.  Learned how to itnegrate new solutions and manage IT platforms.  Culture was cutting edge and do what others have not done.  If you got a good manager or worked on a strategic platform then you were doing well."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,It is a great place to work because there is unlimited overtime. Food carts outside for people who don't want to drive to town. I learned a lot about Verizon. Management is very friendly and helpful. The co-workers are very helpful. The hardest part about this job is getting used to the system. The most enjoyable part of this job is knowing you have helped someone.
good,Be prepared for the big corporate culture and waste of time to get things done.  Looks and sounds good but many of the people I met there did not really like the company or their jobs.  This surprised me.  Very inefficient processes.
good,"This is an okay job for someone who does not plan to do much outside of working in sales. Compensation and benefits are great, however work life balance is not."
good,"Workplace in constant flux. Changes come often to all parks of the job, policies, products, managers, co-workers, systems."
good,I enjoyed this job as much as I could. I was allowed overtime and did get bonuses also. Inbound with cable and phone packages with discounts were great also.
good,"My day starts with reading review documents , discussing it with my lead or my team mates and moving ahead with the test plan and execution. During the course of my association with verizon, I have learnt about how the wireless industry functions, each day is a learning experience with us learning something new about the business and how our work adds value to our company. Our management particularly emphasizes on learning about the business, conducting frequent brown bag sessions and town halls with our organization's leaders.  Our team's a mix of people from different educational back grounds and cultures, so each person brings in a fresh perspective and that is key to developing an all round view of things, I particularly find this useful as a tester, because I should be able to visualize and test the application in all possible ways, in order to ensure that the best quality is delivered to the customer. While it is tough to achieve this, I enjoy the challenge as it pushes me to give more than my best."
good,"work was not as fun as it was before\"
good,my typical day consisted of meeting quota for the day. i learned many important information on new electronic devices that i had not known and even how to fix some of the smallest account incidents. my co workers will very helpful and always in a god mood. they were driven to meet quota which helped me stay driven. the hardest part of my job was maintaining learning to stay calm when customers were rude or inconsiderate but then again that was the fun part of my job is seeing them calm down once i resolved their issue or came close to it where they can go on with their day not so upset.
good,Large coroporate company where you feel like you are a number instead of a person.  Had great medical benefits and money was good
good,"Verizon Wireless is a great place to gain valuable customer service experience. The job is fast paced,  training in all aspects of customer service is provided and the benefits package is great."
good,It was a lot of floating between departments to get the whole store stocked on a nightly basis.
good,"Verizon is a large company with many chances to expand your knowledge base and further your career.  There are many very talented, knowledgeable and helpful people working at Verizon.  The most difficult part of the job is working effectively with the constant threat of layoff looming over your head. "
good,"You have your own desk and your own computer to report to everyday. I learned a lot about the quality of customer service that needs to be provided to customers. I love the job I do, monitoring my departments calls. "
good,"poor management, but fun place to work at. cool people to work with, fun and very productive. Their is alot of micro management going on which makes it hard to focus on goal."
good,"The overall work experience was good."
good,"Although the pay and benefits are great, they do come at a cost. your home or social life will suffer from long or shifting hours."
good,How to work the individual in a good work environment... You had to make sure the customer is happy and no matter the customer is always the one right makingsure everything was update on the account etc.
good,"Supported several high end customers. Helped clients managed call centers, data and voice networks. Stressful environment. On call 7x24x365"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Supported the Executive Director and his team of approximately 400 staff members across the country. Assisted the team as they went through organization changes and new strategies/products were assigned.
good,"answered calls, placed orders for service, sold verizon products. The hardest part of this job was having to sell something on every call."
good,I worked for the company for 6 years and saw a lot of growth from other locations and a lot of turn over from my location.
good,"If you want to be in the telecommunications or wireless industry, this is the one of the best. In Sales I worked retail for most of my nine years with Verizon. It had it's great days and it's miserable days. What I especially loved about the job was the competition was motivating and the fact that the sky was the limit was amazing. This has been adjusted heavily the last few years decreasing overall pay for a large percentage of reps. If you are a high earner, this is not the sales job for you but if 50K sounds like your cup of tea, Verizon is a great company to work for."
good,"providing phone support for customers with voice, data, or video services."
good,Great benefits customer service was number one concern. Long hours at times with overtime being mandatory.
good,long hrs and long days- it was nice working so hard and being rewarded for doing a good job
good,This was an exciting job that brought new experiences with each potential Business to Business client. My managers were helpful and professional.
good,"Verizon Wireless was a great place to work, there are not a lot of opportunities for advancement because people stay in the same position for so long. There are a lot of great and talented people who make up the company, especially on the retail side. Working with the public is difficult but there were always some shining moments with certain customers. Verizon offers excellent benefits and does everything they can to keep costs low and benefits high for its employees. Compensation is indicative of the job title/position, there are bonuses and short term incentives for non-commissioned employees. The training program is nationally recognized and ensures employees are set up for success."
good,Working with very smart people is always a plus. It helps when they listen to your thinking about soluntions and act on them. I like the Verizon environment.
good,The company has change a lot in the 8 years I have been there. They are no longer family focused and caring about the work life balance concept. They provide excellent benefits with 100% tuiton paid but provide little opportunity for advancement to utilize the skills learned.
good,"Typical day would mean calling existing customers to insure satisfaction, offer service enhancements and new products to acquire additional revenue business, develop and work new customer leads, work to accomplish monthly quota"
good,"I been with Verizon Wireless for many years and moved up from a Customer Service rep to Management. I excelled in sales but my overall demeanor was to make sure my customers and the business I worked with were happy. At first Verizon Wireless was very customer oriented. Make sure they are happy was above profit for the company. Happy customers build loyalty. However, not sure if it was due to new management or the economy...that changed. After a while, it was a very sales driven environment. Make your quota or fear the loss of your job. I understand about letting the bottom 20% who don't perform their basic duties go, however, scaring your sales reps to upsell to customer who did not want smartphones, tablets, etc. Some times, bottom line, customer can't afford it! There is only so much sales reps can do, they can't force customer to swip their credit cards."
good,Great place to get your career going. Opportunity to learn and wear many hats. Great place for career advancement.
good,It is a great company to work for. It has a lot of change however the schedules are not very family friendly. The company offers a lot of benefits.
good,"open drawers, greet and help customers at door, customer support, technical support and sales. Always be selling. I learned to not judge people when they walk in the door and it doesn't hurt to ask for a sale or mention a product. management at store level is good, at executive level is a joke. we have new leaders every year, don't care who we are or what we think and have no follow through. hardest part of my job is dealing with customers who are completely angry and hitting redic quota's every month. best part of job is seeing people walk in with little knowledge and watching them walk out being a pro with their device and comfortable with me and my service."
good,"dealt with employees within Verizon Wireless. The company was great as a whole, but the department lacked good management. People were very stressed and treated poorly. HR could not even fix the issue as the higher ups were some of the main problems. Overall, there great if you get a good team. But ask around before joining."
good,The upper management are only looking for their bonus with their unwillingness to negogiate a fair contract . Their somewhat total disregard for the POTS customers that rely on copper facilities until it reaches BPU proportions is very disturbing. They have lost all connections with what made them a good company.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Overall it was a wonderful experience growing with a large telecommunications provider. In the end it was the feeling that you were just a number, and downsizing resulted in the need to take a buyout."
good,"VZW is a wonderful company to work for. Their service is excellent and I firmly believe in what they sell. Their benefits are amazing and pay is pretty good. However, there is little focus on giving you time to live your life and it is extremely difficult to move within the company if you are not fitting in at a particular position. I want to work for them for a long time, but because my talents do not match the exact position I am in and you are stuck once that happens, I will most likely end up having to find a job somewhere else."
good,"Cons:"
good,"A good, friendly environment, provides a platform to expand knowledge."
good,Great place to work Great managers 24 hour work day is a plus surplus and overtime a plus The site location is closed I wish it would open back up close to home and convenient
good,I learned a lot there and would love to work there again. The people and work atmosphere is very good.The office building is nice and you feel positive woring there.
good,"Verizon is a great employer.  However, mid to upper management micromanage with no trust or collaboration.  This creates a toxic environment.  Verizon offers a qualified 401k, full medical, dental, and vision coverage along with tuition reimbursement.  Management can be oppressive but if you are focused and work very hard, then the sky is the limit."
good,"Typical day was never the same that was the best about it. There  are different projects to work on, to help you with your growth"
good,Contractor position.  Do not receive any benefits so I cannot speak of that or other perks with the company.  Typical day is demanding.  Always a lot of work to get done.
good,50 hour weeks with a lot of multi-tasking.  Benefits were very good with yearly bonus'.  Pay increases had gotten better with the decisions being made by HR instead of organization management.
good,Good company with work life balance. I would recommend this company. I have great experiences and learnings working in this organization. All the policies are quite good.
good,Trabajar para Verizon fue una experiencia muy agradable en el tema de desarrollo de profesionalismo y adquisición de clientes. Me enseñó a ser un líder y manejar obstáculos con tranquilidad y determinación.
good,"Really enjoyed my work environment and coworkers,but the positions was not right for me and I had to relocate. Definitely recommend this 0position to someone looking to be in the sales force."
good,"If you can handle the constant turnover rate it's a great place to work."
good,I learned a lot of leadership and operations skills. This job was a hub for organized team players looking to excel. It was truly a great learning experence.
good,"Great company to work for, if you're self driven. Will fire you basically at any given time, if they dont like something. Had a great trainer. Stay motivated and be sure to make functions."
good,"Okay job for the most part. There isn't stability by any means there. The turn over is ridiculous, and the supervisors are never around when you need them."
good,Great benefits and personal time. Goals keep getting higher and higher to the point the average yearly pay has dropped ruffly 10-15k per year over the last 6-8 years
good,I enjoyed my time at Verizon. I appreciated the flexibility my management allowed. They encourage learning and provide tuition reimbursement. The team members I worked with were exceptional.
good,Working at a corporate Verizon retail store taught me more than going to a 4 year university.  I learned the art of selling and giving it my all everyday.  Great team and great management
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The company is amazing! During training you DO NOT have flexible hours. After those first 3 months you do. Management isn’t that awesome. The two managers I had weren’t that great and one of my managers lied to me and that cost me my career permanently. It’s a great place to work just don’t trust everyone because not every leader has your best interest. I’m so upset and I’ve been trying to get in contact with my previous recruiter but I haven’t got anywhere with anyone.
good,Working with Verizon was really great opportunity. I learned a lot from Verizon and my Project manager. I built my carrier at Verizon like anything. opportunity
good,My experience working for Verizon wasn’t that bad. I got comfortable. And you can easily move up if you do well. The call center I was working for lost their contract in my city due to high turnover rate. Only thing about being easily promoted. The trainers kind of sucked sometimes.
good,Verizon has great team and projects that helps to grow professionally. And their tuition assistance program is very supportive if you would like to pursue further studies.
good,"Corporate will move you time and again, or will find a reason to make life miserable if you do not move stores to which you have no say in. You may be downtown one day, northeast the next, or store was sold to franchise and poof, there goes your vacation/sick/personal time."
good,Tons of upward potential for aggressive sales oriented employees. Began as a front line cst svc rep and transitioned into roles that help my career within the company
good,You will be required to multitask extremely well to be successful at Verizon. You must be accountable and available as the NEEDS of the business are most important to this company
good,"Competitive Pay"
good,it was a ok job to work at the pay was ok the job was ok the hours was 8 -5 Monday - Friday . we got paid even two weeks overtime was always aviable t
good,"You have plenty of opportunity for growth as long as you apply yourself and stay aligned with the right people. The pay is great, but (depending upon the position) the work/life balance could use some improvement."
good,"I loved working with the customer and loved the benefits, but my manager did not have my back.  When I was not paid for over a month, he told me it was not his job to help me and that I needed to find the contact information for HR to get the issue resolved."
good,Workday at Verizon included testing applications for functionality and reporting any defects to the development team. Management fulfilled responsibilities and was always available to help. Most enjoyable part was walking around the campus and the cafeteria.
good,Making sure you sell as much as possible to reach goals and also give the best possible customer service taking responsibility in cash handling organized clean  invironment
good,Verizon Wireless has its positives and negatives. It was great when it came to work life balance when it came to my family and children being born. I was able to achieve top positions in Sales winning contests and making it to company trips as well. Negatives will be kept quiet unless you would like to personally know.
good,"Verizon was good to me during the recession. I am grateful for that. The schedules are horrendous, however. Don't seek employment at Verizon thinking you are going to work a 9-5 Monday through Friday. It is a retail business, so your hours are going to be more like a hospital janitor. Like I said though, the pay and benefits are outstanding."
good,"Typical day is reporting to work,  receive my work,  make sure I have everything I need for the day and hit the road,  go directly to my first job and make sure the customer is satisfied with the work I performed!"
good,Great company to work for. Supervisor was always willing to help and teach. Flexible working from home and in the office. Managed hundreds of  customer accounts.
good,can make appointments with potential clients at any store. What i really liked about the company is that there is no micro managing. you will have to be a self starter.
good,This is a great place to work. Its and fun and exciting environment that keeps you up to date with todays fast changing environment. You also have the opportunity to sharpen your face to face contact skills.
good,"a typical day of work start with a meeting with supervisor, in order to discuss about daily goal...I learned many things every day, also the management were great too."
good,Working at Verizon was a fast paced environment but I feel I learned so much working for them. Verizon was interested  not just in the job you did but in you as a person.
good,"Open Store, then keep up with emails and deal with random customers that come in. there isnt a lot of rules that you have to follow other than try to end every interaction with a sale"
good,Enjoyed the teamwork at Verizon. Interacted with various vendor who supplied tools for our product/application. I had design and architectural responsibilities and was actively involved in making a great difference.
good,"Verizon provides a flexible work environment with a focus on accomplishing tasks. The perks are a niche professional community within the telecom industry, promotion/career development opportunities, and tuition reimbursement for relevant coursework to your Verizon career."
good,Overall Verizon allows you to make a career and choose from several different paths. A lot of great advancement opportunities within the company and a strong team culture. I recommend Verizon as one of the best companies to work for based on training /career advancement and health benefits.
good,The job was great until they wanted us to focus on revenue generation. slowly it became a sales role along with of course the customer service i was originally hired for.
good,They expect you to drink the company kool-aid but the sales skills alone are worth the time spent there.  While I managed to meet or exceed sales quotas it was clear most people struggled to do so simply because they failed to put in the effort or lacked the personality.  Promotion is very much based on networking and not performance.  Company HR was very dismissive of multicultural families despite appearing to be politically correct.  Grateful for the opportunity but glad I moved on.
good,"Good company, work focuses on strategy, exceptional and smart colleagues, collaborative, work from home allows flexibility. "
good,"I had Learned a lot of things from my team members and as well as got the skills from my seniors and directors in that Organisation."
good,"It was good enjoyed working there and I was traveling in between Chicago and Georgia. Enjoyed the nice weather here in Georgia compared to the cold winter in Chicago, IL."
good,Good for anyone that wants to learn about sales. Would have to sale so much or wouldn't qualify for commission. Most of the time met the required commission
good,"Multicultural company with a lot of different divisions and teams, working together to provide the best experience to the millions of the customers all over the country."
good,"Good company to work for.  Management changed a few times. But, that is about it  a little unorganized but for organized once management was ran well."
good,The culture of Verizon with it's desire to hire a great staff of people that enjoy servicing the their customers and meeting their needs. Gives anyone who works their pride in what they do.
good,"I worked for Verizon (and predecessor companies) for 34 years.  Overall, I feel Verizon is a good company, as they compensate employees well and try to foster a team-work/family environment.  However, work/life balance can be hard to achieve in most management positions and advancement can be difficult."
good,"Overall good company with good benefits but can be ""too big"" and have inconsistencies across the enterprise.  Take advantage of all the benefits including further education."
good,Wasnt too bad of a place to work. can be stressful at times. basic call center environment. Management was likable. Coworkers were likable. Very diverse environment
good,This is a great company to work for! There are plenty of great opportunities for growth! This company welcomes diversity! The work/home life balance is phenomenal!
good,Verizon is a good job with great benefits. they really invest into their employees. If you are a person who is comfortable on the phone and money motivates you then this may be the job for you.
good,It is good college freshers and new learner but worst people of 15 year and 20 year remain in the org no one question management has to be more concentrate and bring the change
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,worked for VZW for 6 years. it was a great job for a retail environment. a lot of turnover in management.The work itself is not difficult. mostly troubleshooting customers devices and bills.
good,"Lots of changes at Verizon as the business units come together under new leadership."
good,	Responsible for contacting local business and residential property owners to obtain authorization for installation of Verizon fiber-optic equipment.
good,"To clarify, I worked for Cellular Sales, not technically Verizon, but they were a good company to work for with plenty of great people and opportunities."
good,At first the solutions specialist job was very good to me. A change in leadership lead to micromanagement changes that hurt morale amongst employees. Things like walking every customer to the door every single time or you will be written up. On a busy saturday this is not a realistic expectation.
good,"Good Opportunity"
good,Lots of projects but the people are great!  Verizon Agile--all about you when its your turn.  Most of the project teams have 9 to 12 projects at all times.
good,Never a dull moment at Verizon. Challenging work in highly complex architectural opportunities. Portfolio objectives unclear for a carrier striving to be something other than a carrier.
good,"A good place to work. Good benefits/options to further your education, growth opportunities, fast paced with interesting challenges. They offer flexibility with work schedules."
good,WorkPlace and ethics are good.friendly collique and feasibility of personal life balance.constant learning and self development is also focussed by diifernt training session
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Helpful staff. Nice place to work. Must be able to juggle phone calls, walk by assignments and meetings all in a day at work. Be proficient enough to report on all, including training during the day."
good,Worked there for a long time; overall a great experience. There is a lot of opportunity for anyone who wants to ride out the reorganization and leadership changes.
good,I wouldn’t recommend working here if you don’t have a store team that is genuinely there to be mature and advance the company directives on an even playing field.
good,Great company overall... all companies have things they could do better. But feel it is one of the best companies I've worked for. I have been happy here.
good,"You definitely set and maintain your own performance level, held to a higher standard and challenging career. I loved working there. …………………..……………………………."
good,Good job management said they could work my hours but ended up not being able to. I did however learn alot working there and i love salea now because of them.
good,"once you move up out of an entry job there is no security, they lay off regardless of tenour. you are a number and not a person. other than that the company is great to work for."
good,Pretty straight forward. Meet sales incentives. Alot of following up on customers current and past and letting them know they are eligible for an upgrade
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I love the fact that they worked with you and your schedule whenever you had an emergency. Also, they treated everyone the same no matter when you started."
good,Balancing work load and managing multiple employee characters were the biggest challenge of every day. Addressing customer concerns and expectations were also part of the daily responsibilities. I enjoyed traveling to many different locations to inspect technician work performance and perform quality and safety inspection's.
good,"depending on location, it can either be very busy or not busy at all. typically you would help customers with whatever needs they may have. sometimes the transactions are easy, however, depending on what location, you may have customers that can have extreme needs, so you need to be able to access the situation and figure out how to work with these customers because they can ruin your entire day if you dont have patience and the will to go above and beyond, even when you dont want to."
good,"I have enjoyed working with every person I have ever met at Verizon. The hourly pay is great, as are the benefits, but you really have to be a hustling salesperson to succeed in the role. If you're ""too nice"" customers may take advantage of that and want to speak to you all day, in which case you don't make your sales. It can be a very high stress environment."
good,the company puts a lot of resources into developing their employees and the pay and benefits are great.  the most difficult part of the job is the stress.
good,"-A typical day would consist of me showing up to work, Clocking in, and going over are day check list. Opening, Mid, And End shifts all have different tasks. During the check list we assist customer with problems they have or help them with their accounts, all while trying to up sell them with products and figure out the best possible promotions for them."
good,I would recommend working for Verizon to friends and family without hesitation . I left Verizon due to conflict of scheduling at the time had my son and my supervisor wouldn't assist with my schedule.
good,"Most of the job requirements were  new to me, however the trainers made the learning process exciting and easy to grasp. The job was fairly easy and was a great working experience. Verizon is a great company to work with."
good,"A typical day at Verizon was very stressful due to the department that I managed."
good,Talked to customers about different phones upgrades and new line activations and phone bills and customer service issues and  lost or stolen phones and other wireless devices
good,"Overall, employees would agree that Verizon Wireless is an outstanding company and launchpad for beginning one's career. Company benefits are virtually unmatched, with opportunities to earn annual incentives, generous 401K matching, tuition prepayment and aggressive annual raises. Negatively, the pervasive workplace politics and relatively low turnover rate (especially among manager-level employees) severely challenges upward mobility and engenders some monotony. But for most, the financial reward outweighs the tedium, creating a rewarding employee experience."
good,The pay was good and can be a fun place to work. Very good benefits and opportunities for advancement. Verizon offered employees discounts on products and services.
good,"Gained a lot of experience at Verizon.  As a manager, pay was great for a while, but decreased every year even though sales increased."
good,"Back in the day VZW was a great place to call your employer, but not so much anymore with the number of jobs being reduced, eliminated, relocated, or outsourced"
good,Overall a great company to work for and they really stress accountability and learning. Pay is good. Try and leave work at home if you can. Personal life turns in after hour social time with co workers wether you like or not! Keep a level head.
good,"You will get only what you put  in to this company. They are not very big with loyalty with their employees. However, while you are there, you will be compensated for hard work."
good,"Challenging opportunities offered.  Good culture. great benefits.  Intense work environment."
good,Company better at talking work life balance than achieving it. Managers made all the difference and varied wildly. Some were spectacular and made coming to work awesome. Others made it a nightmare.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great team of engineers who work on complex problems. You will be working on cutting edge telecommunication technologies and solving complex problems with smart engineers.
good,To survive in Verizon one should posses good human interaction skills and be agile to do anything any time.    Not a structured company.    Lack of  Transparency.
good,Not a bad place to work at but not somewhere you want to be at forever. Good for students who need flexibility with hours. Relax over work environment but yet quick paced as well
good,Wonderful place to work. This is a fast pace every day is different. Mangers vary between amazing and needed to work on soft skills. I would recommend it.
good,Employer provides excellent compensation and benefits. It is going through rapid change due to the industry and this can lead to stress at times but overall a great employer.
good,"Busy, a lot of info every day, working with co-workers is on a different level, working every weekend and holiday's for over 5 years is hard, and the better part of the job is a phone with everything unlimited every 6 months so you can show the customers the new technology."
good,"Call center employees are not traditionally the healthiest so it was really fun and rewarding to get to work with those that wanted to lose weight, get in shape, or just generally improve their overall health."
good,"I loved working for the company, until they changed the commission structure for our region. You must meet quotas to earn a viable commission, if you are ok with suggestive selling than you will be fine. They will train you and will invest time and money in you as an employee and a person. It is great company to work for. My only complaint would be trying to get an add on sale compared to just helping someone in need. The company has goals to hit and some times just helping can't happen without adding a commission and i didn't like that personally."
good,"Lots of opportunity to advance.  However, shift bids are not often and if you have issues with your shift, you can't get it changed for months.  Medical is great, and people there are very team oriented."
good,Company has excellent benefits. Hard to move up in the company without knowing someone who can recommend you for the job. They pay well but you'll work a lot of mandatory overtime which makes it hard to have a proper work life balance. Decent hours.
good,"training on new IT equipment, such as scanning the network. The co-worker are very nice and there was a good collaboration, team work. The management give the chance to everyone."
good,"Verizon has consistently maintained high standards with regards to its employees. The working environment is friendly, management is skilled and effective, and there are many tools to help an employee with training, work/life balance, and personal emergencies. By far the most enjoyable part of working at Verizon was building teams of great people to achieve the companies goals."
good,Verizon paid really well. They did not however treat you as an equal. It was a sales job so I guess I expected too much of the company. I did however have a few amazing managers.
good,"Good place to work. I would recommend it to anyone. Nice perks, good pay, and good people. I think the company will also have a bright future. Hope this review helps."
good,"Opportunity to grow and learn and ask questions if  you are unsure of something.  Civic minded and ability to form close friendships that will support you throughout your career.  Need to be a constant learner and try your best to succeed.  Have a great attitude, focus on the customer and treat one another with respect."
good,Verizon is a leader in the industry. You'll work hard but you'll learn a lot. You really don't have a say on what shift you work. It's based on your performance and tenure.
good,"Good, "
good,"Great benefits, good people.  Lots to learn and lots to do.  Days go fast, as the workday can be very fast paced.  Diverse group of people, and you will work closely with people all over the US, and often have counterparts in India."
good,Enjoyed customer service and assisting customers.  Enjoyed learning about new technology.  Enjoyed working with other associates.  Good Management at the locations where I worked.
good,"my review is a mostly positive review. overall my rating was four stars. Good benefits, work from home telecommute policy was a very nice perk to have."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"It was great until they dismantled the business. We had a stellar managed team that could design, build and support almost any customer. Verizon saw this as an expense and sold it to IBM."
good,"It was  a long time ago that I worked there. It would be unfair to rate them due to this. As in all corporate jobs, policies and procedures change over time. I worked here over 10 years ago and don’t feel the training and such are still the same."
good,"Retail scheduling with long hours, fast paced, competitive environment, high quotas, with good pay, compensation, benefits  and poor life work balance"
good,this job required going door to door in order to sell verizon's new product. i enjoyed working with this company because of the interface that i had with the customers. i had the opportunity to talk to customers face to face and understand what they like about the product and what they disliked. which gave me better understanding of how to deal with customers
good,"The company was a great place to work. As the business grew, there were plenty of opportunities to learn and advance. Once the mobile phone industry became saturated, those opportunities slowed and then stopped. The executives have tried to bring new success by purchasing old tech companies which didn't help. The company is now on a push to downsize."
good,"Some days are tough, but every installation or repair is different which keeps it interesting. Co workers are willing to help when needed and overtime is available if thats what you seek"
good,"Good working environment, Great chance to acquire special technical knowledge and skill. Energetic and multicultural work environment like a mini beautiful world."
good,"Workplace can be stressful when restructuring is always occurring with reductions always looming.  Good benefits.  401k, Medical, Vision, Prescriptions."
good,Great place to work 3rd party management is not the best but you can make good money. If you like people this is the place for you as well as you have to like phones.
good,Great company with lots of benefits and opportunities.  Lots of recent layoffs in the Lanline side vs wireless.  Company is going leaner with Management to promote 5G services; making more jobs automated.  You get paid very well; but you earn it. It's a fast paces; high stress environment at times.
good,The company is great place in the beginning. Though it does get reptivite  and mundane. They have great benefits and they give you excellent training. Management at times are not always knowledgeable and on your side.
good,we did get forced overtime for almost a year. the benefits were good. Management always found something wrong no matter how good a job you did but that seems to be typical about everywhere you work now. I like the fact that you were finished with your job when you got off work you don't have to worry about calling customers back or what you did not get done that day.
good,"Managing 5G project "
good,"Great company to work for and learn the latest in technology. If you do not know the right individuals, advancement can be frustrating.  There will be many who will try to trip you up and hide how bright and talented you may be because of how competitive the work environment has become, but in all fairness, it does keep you on your toes.  When you leave Verizon, I have found that other organizations seem to look like they are not quite as organized. Verizon is definitely not for the faint at heart, but the true survivors will end up going far.  Verizon is a boot camp for how to navigate corporate America."
good,Typically call center jobs can be very demanding. Working here gave me the opportunity to know my strengths professionally. Some days were good and some days were tough.
good,It is a great place to work. Being a SQF Practitioner is a very good position to have. you work independently and you are not micromanaged. You handle all of the company's audits.
good,"Pros-"
good,"work, work, work, work, work"
good,Verizon has great benefits and a welcoming environment that allows you to grow.  Promotion within is limited and salary negotiations is non-existent.  It is a good company if you can find a position that will not be downsized
good,"Verizon has an extremely flexible scheduling for their staff, makes up for the low wage in that reguard. If customer service is your  niche? Everything else will be a breeze!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a good opportunity to learn and grow and build your knowledge.  The work culture is diverse.  The hardest part of the job is the ever changing organization.
good,"Highly customer centric, KPI focused, great if you like being busy at all times, not great if you value work/life balances and holidays. Not a bad place to work."
good,My honest opinion is that this job was fun. It pushed me to strive for more and i learned a lot from it.The job made me grow as a young man and made me had a better understanding of the world
good,"Sales of Verizon Wireless Products including cell phones, accessories, insurance, tablets, and other technology information for customers to use in their daily lives."
good,"It's changed since I worked there."
good,Corporate opportunities. Structured corporation located in beautiful setting with varied and up to date facilities. Many corporate and team building events.
good,"Verizon was a good company to work for. There is room for growth with Verizon. Verizon is a great technology teaching company. Within Verizon I learned management skills such as motivating a team to sale, teaching them how to overcome objective, and how to be able to recognize the customers needs that we can resolve their issue the first time presented to us."
good,"sometimes I was a little confused, because someone told you to do one thing and someone else will tell you to do something completely different. at the end of the day you needed to decide what was the best option."
good,highly active environment sales qouta and  technical I enjoyed working for Verizon we did problem solving and case management also learn how to de escalate problems
good,"Verizon provides very good benefits to their employees and many advancement opportunities.  Unfortunately, they also have a culture of never ending layoffs and reductions in force which does not allow for any sense of job security."
good,"Good company to work for with a lot of benefits and hands on training. But poor management in some aspects. Its not a sales job they take lightly, eigher 100% or you wont last long."
good,"Good for the time spent, IT not the same as before but there's lots to learn and new technology to salvage. I was working out in the Piscataway office"
good,"Great Fortune 500 company to work for. Great product and services, within the company. bonuses incentives every month and winners circle trips yearly."
good,"You are being hired as a salesperson, and as such, have to meet quotas. The company can be extremely political and regional management tends toward micromanagement. "
good,Great place to work if you like sitting in a cubicle all day.  It was to my personal preference to be in that type of environment all day.  I liked the people but I was not suited for that type of work.
good,It’s a great job if your goal is to make as much money as you want to. It lacked a work/life balance element for me personally as you were always having to be apart of work threads through WhatsApp and customers had your cell phone number so you could be called at any time. I personally left because I felt as though I couldn’t progress any further in leadership based on what I had for leadership directly above me.
good,this place is a good place to work if you are driven and don't mind a sales based commission job. wages are fair and the environment is very teamwork based.
good,"I worked for Verizon for close to 8 years. I started from the very bottom, and there are opportunities for growth all the time. the company has changed a lot and with the new CEO things have changed they have downsized a lot which has created  bigger workload to bottom lines. expectations are always high, and you will never please leadership in its entirety. this coming from a op performer in te bay area."
good,"Verizon's new building offers very new technology and work equipment, an open floor plan, and a very collaborative work environment,"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I am a consultant for Verizon, I am not sure that I should write a review on Verizon. It would not be fair for me to rate Verizon. But Verizon is a great company."
good,"It was a very high paced environment with calls.  Billing questions, technical issues and phone plan/upgrades.  Very high paced and easily leads to burn out"
good,Not a bad place at all to work . They had unlimited overtime and everyone was friendly. The management was good to go and fair. Answering calls in a call center was the evironment
good,"Work with them in the summer and I was taught very little but it was an experience. Door To Door sales, and built relationships with clients that returned regularly."
good,When I started at Verizon I was excited to work for them. Now that I have been there for a bit I see why they hire so many people at once. They can't keep employees because of the way their shifts are set and the management is terrible.
good,I'm no longer there so it's hard to assess the company at this point. While I was there sales had contests and paid commissions that were in line with what was expected and proper..
good,"I think it's a great job for a lot of people, it's just not for me. I'm always looking for a better family life/ work balance and it doesn't exactly suit those needs."
good,Opportunities to promote and grow.  Great company to work for and opportunities to promote especially if willing to relocate.  Awesome benefits and pay.
good,Good company to work for with competitive salary and compensation.  Promotes diverse working environment.  Great business vision and promotes adherence to the corporate core values.
good,Verizon is a good place to start in your project management career as a contractor pay is really low but you can advance once you get your foot in the door. A great culture of employees.
good,Verizon is a solid company with excellent benefits. Some expectations are unrealistic and decisions are sometimes made without consideration for front-line employees.
good,"Meet at the office at 8, dispatch to location and come back around 6."
good,I had an amazing manager at Verizon. our team consisted of 10 of us. We worked very well together. There was a lot of transparency in our team. workplace culture was very professional.
good,Verizon had purchased a company that I had been employed with for 5 years. After a year they brought in all of their own people. I kept my position for 1 year after that
good,"Everyone there was on the same ""team"", which made a huge difference from the top managers down to us on the phones. We all had the same goal and it brought it together in a great way."
good,I enjoyed working here. Great pay along with flexible hours and competitive pay. It was close to were I lived and they made it joy able to be at work and help others find what they are looking for and could afford.
good,"I would work here again •	Assisted customers over the phone with billing, equipment orders and tier one trouble shooting."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,it was ok just wish the work area was a lot more clean. overall it was an easy job just located too far from my house which is why i couldn't keep working here.
good,"Hard to advance, like most large companies, the stock price is the most important which often means workforce is cut frequently.  Good benefits which you would expect."
good,Good company but currently undergoing major changes. New leadership is taking the company in a questionable direction. A mass exodus of talent may occur soon.
good,"Employees were great. Company had great benefits. Materials were provided to better achieve goals. Company vehicle provided. Company downsizing to increase profit, employees were working the jobs of 2 and 3 people."
good,"Depending on the workgroup, there is flexibility to create your own work life balance.  There are a lot of benefits with the company and you must lead your own development."
good,"I am management employee, I work 55+ hours a week, even on vacation, I get pulled into work issues.  IT by default is a very invasive career, weekends and late nights make for a odd family dynamic."
good,Verizon is a decent place to work with many incentives for employees. Corporate structure does hinder what could be a better work environment. Overall it is a great company that offers great benefits. Definitely some great people within the company as well.
good,taking calls from customer's and trouble shooting any issues that may be experiencing with their phones and doing what i could to cheer them up and to let them know that they are important and i was there to help them.
good,Call Center at iQor. No where to move once your there. Pays well. High school environment. Decent quick training and about 2 minuet back to back calls
good,"I think it should be acknowledged , working in retail is quiet the experience. it helps you learn how to interact properly. and also allowing space for more improvements"
good,"A typical work day begun with assessments and meetings.  There was always a willingness to work as a team,  Also, teamwork was always at the forefront of the work environment."
good,"Love working for Verizon. We've very up and coming company with bright future ahead.  Truly a leader in industry and innovation.  Great advancement opportunities for folks living in bigger cities but not in Hampton Roads, VA unless you are willing to relocate :-("
good,As an intern they really took care of us and gave us plenty of opportunities to learn and grow within the company. I was able to participate in meetings with my managers and even present in front of the CFO.
good,"decent job but felt the work was just not safe enough for me, management was very suspension happy, also somtimes when certian tools were needed to finish jobs they were not givien"
good,When I was working for Verizon I was a contractor. But the time I was there the working environment was always positive. Communication with the Engineers and Techs were good.
good,"Overall a great company to work for. Different sections of the company are managed much differently and allow a much richer, fun culture, better opportunity for advancement and much easier work/life balance."
good,"Good environment, recent leadership changes have made this shakey. Excellent team that were very supportive. Very fast passed and competitive in a good way"
good,"Few advancement opportunities for employees. Management is for the most part seperated from employees, not a lot of relevant training materials. No raises."
good,"I enjoyed my time there.... Unfortunately my client began it's downfall and my streak of year over year growth began to slide. VZ recognized my efforts, and rewarded me with a a very nice RIF package."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,on time and work some of people helped when needed. You can train in other areas. Find work to do on computer for your work day.  go help other team of workers when emergency came up.
good,"Little employee loyalty, all about the bottom $."
good,this is a good place to work at especially to build your customer service. great environment. management is very supportive. good workplace culture. good place to come to everyday.
good,A typical day consist of working with customers in helping with with their telecommunications needs. The management culture was very good. The most enjoyable part of the day was being able to go in an provide a service.
good,I worked here for several years and then started my family. I went into licensed daycare to be with my children. The customer service department was very high stree due to quotes that needed to be met daily.
good,"Great compensation, however, work life balance is almost non existent.  You will get to work on very interesting projects but know that workforce reductions is common (more than 3 a year consistently).  Progression in company is hard fought and change over substance is a continual process."
good,Worked with sales reps processing in store applications for service while reviewing applicants credit history and determining eligibility. The work environment was clean and professional.
good,Great pay and benefits. Great bosses. They care about their employees. Abel to move up in job and title. Union environment who looks after their people.
good,"Azienda che per la sua natura e dimensione offre molte opportunità di sviluppo personale. Tra gli aspetti più positivi l'atteggiamento positivo del Management riguardo la flessibilità, l'equilibrio lavoro-vita personale ed il lavoro remoto."
good,this review is irrelevant because the call center has shut down and also the amount of time that has passed since my employment with Verizon. many things have changed.
good,"Everyday was something a little different."
good,"The team selling is great, it's nice to work with different situations from each customer.  The odd hours can be challenging but overall it is a nice place to work."
good,I did not like the work culture. There is no life and work balance at all. You have to be working all 24/7. But I enjoyed the work though. Nice management.
good,"Great place to work and learn lots of sales skills. They do a great job of taking care of their employees, and making sure there are career advancements!"
good,"Verizon is a company that never sleeps.  Since customers depend on Verizon 24/7 it can be difficult to find a Monday through Friday 8-5 position and when you do, you will likely have to do at least a few weekend on-calls and out of hours tours.  However, the pay and benefits are very competitive and attractive to a lot of people."
good,Wonderful sales position if you don't mind working retail hours. Nights/Weekends/Holidays.  Store hours used to open a little earlier making it easier to have work life balance but they keep opening later and later making it impossible to get off of work before 7:00PM.  Commission structure was much better when I started but you now have to work 100x harder for the same amount of pay.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"This job offers great salary and benefits however, internal politics were a negative factor in the organization.  The operation could have benefitted from more professionalism at the top."
good,"This position has some good points, but inconsistent  rules and regulations make it tough to conquer. Perfect starter sales job, not for the professional. Good pay, benefits and perks. Hardest part of job can be the hours.  This is not good for a work/life/family. Most enjoyable is the ease, technology, training and benefits."
good,I had a great learning experience working for Verizon Wireless I would think technical support and I was able to learn a lot about the ends and out of cell phones
good,Verizon is an excellent job to keep for maybe a year or so but no longer. It should be used to build people and sales skills but not as a job in order to sustain ones self.
good,"Good place to work, business needs constantly changing with a strong focus on the customer.  Incentives at the front line employee level are focused on specific products."
good,"Great place to work.  Plenty of opportunities for advancement and career development.  For sales professionals, Verizon has many layers of sales channels to gain experience."
good,"The job is rather stressful, if not too terribly demanding. If you have to call in for any reason, do not leave a message. It does not seem that anyone actually checks the voicemail. Communication between Workforce and supervisors is lacking. The IT team is pretty sorry, and unresponsive. The pay is low and difficult to live on."
good,"*** Innovation promoting"
good,"The main job duties included, overviewing the customers account and finding ways to maximize profit for the company, while maintaining the customers good faith and trust about Verizon. Inventory,opening and closing the store, and reporting daily store sales were apart my duties as well."
good,Working in the FSC the salary is pretty good. but understand that you will be working long hours. Currently working 12 hour shifts 4 days a week. It can be alot to manage
good,"Good bonus structure if you get into a management band. Hard hours with on call weekends for most positions, flexible with working from home within most teams."
good,"Call center of over 70 employees and processed 80-100 trouble calls per day within a 226 second time frame. In addition, as Shop Steward for Locall 226, Communications Workers of America, I interfaced with management on a weekly basis."
good,"Verizon was a great place to work. very fast paced. They do have very high standards and you are required to keep up a quota. This can be stressful. The training is very through and extensive. If you can handle the high pace and keep up with the quota, you would love this job."
good,Verizon provided me with multiple advancement opportunities over my 12.5 years with the company.  I started as an administrative assistant and through advancement and promotional opportunities I reached the level of marketing manager as my last position.  The department was disbanded through corporate downsizing.
good,"Very nice and good to be and happy to be working "
good,"I graduated from college and got hired at Verizon in Duluth, GA. I was great during the training period you go to the main head quarters and they teach you everything you need to know and familiarize yourself with. I loved the team interaction and the atmosphere of competitive spirit. Great managers, you work crazy hours but you are in control of your pay check, sale and have fun doing it all day!!! I loved it but I want something more settled in career standards. So health care is my direction."
good,Continuous incoming calls 2 15 min breaks and either 1.hour or 1/2 hour lunch. Mandatory overtime. Several tour options available. Work hours and vacations all on seniority basis. Union shop.
good,"I worked at VZW for 17 years.  I ran out of opportunities to advance.  The people I hired, trained and watched succeed have followed me to my new career opportunity."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I got intensive training in customer relations and analytics. I also developed great skills in multitasking and working long hours. I got opportunity to have deep market research.
good,"I would prefer not to rate this company.  My time has passed and I am ready to move on.  The people were great, the work life balance  left very little to be desired."
good,"very fast pace environment, morale depreciated over time, positions were hard to get, management was never accomidating, never recognized for hard work or performance"
good,company is more focused on growth than its employees. that also means that they reduce overhead and costs to continue to inflate the bottom line dollar
good,"good place to work long as you fit culture they define...rigid workday sched on telephone calls come in automatically screened by skill set, 2 15 min breaks, overtime avail sometimes forced, rotating work sched to include weekends"
good,"I would clock in and check out updated promos, clean up around store, make sales calls, call back excisting customers and then wait for customers to come in."
good,"I worked in a fast paced call center for over 8 years. Verizon allowed me the opportunity to grow with the company very quickly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with escalated customers. The employee just has to take what ever abuse the customer is displaying. So, you have to be able to separate your self from that."
good,"It was fun, lots of challenges and great environment to work in. Always had a different day each day never the same day twice and management was quick to help you."
good,"Enjoyed working for Verizon Business, which was purchased from the re-branded MCI (formerly MCI/Worldcom).  It was a tumultuous environment following the Worldcom issues, and the employees worked together to prepare the re-branded MCI for purchase by Verizon."
good,This is a great business to work for but you must find a way to make sure your work life balance is in order because if not you will find yourself under stress you never could imagine. The company does take care of their employees and make the day fun each day there is something new to do to help with the stress of the work day
good,Great company to work for. They offer great training that will help you excel within their organization or with other organizations as you continue to grow your professional career.
good,"I did enjoy my time at Verizon, mostly because I enjoyed helping people with their technological problems and questions. The store I worked at was franchised and the person I worked for was a friend. I did not receive top of the line training, so sometimes I was unable to perform well under certain circumstances. However, other times I have worked directly for Verizon and in those situations I did receive great training. I enjoyed the time I've spent working under direct/indirect supervision of this company."
good,"Great benefits, great salary Plenty of room for advancement.  Plenty of room to become a part of management.  The managers and senior staff are very helpful."
good,Great company with great benefits. If you work retail you will have to work hard but the commission structure is the best out of all major carriers so it is worth it
good,Great place to work. Great benefits for our family of four. Work/Life balance is not an issue. Management is flexible. Yearly district conferences to learn more about the company.
good,"Various tasks within any given day - driven by status of construction or other requirements that may be outstanding.  Interesting associated responsibilities, and opportunity for creative problem solving to meet production timeline."
good,"Awesome people, terrific management, great energy, cutting edge projects "
good,Proven ability to help reps drive a number that meets company standers as well as interact with reps to help any problems customers were having or questions about our service and new products
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Too many lay offs and lack of career progession. The company is becoming more and more focused on money more than ever. Its impacting employees at this point.
good,Verizon has an amazing culture and encourages inclusivity. The company sponsored events on campus are a great way to encourage employees. The campus is always immaculate and it feels good to drive up to a place that is so well maintained.
good,This is a good place to work for some extra pocket money. I get a chance to hear a lot of good concerts and other entertainment acts.  You won't get rich but if you need a little extra money this is a good way to get it.
good,"Great job with very little room for advancement. Most days are the same with customers which can take a toll on some individuals. The company is constantly changing, must be very flexible to keep up."
good,Verizon is a great place to work and a great balance to have a work and life balance. The company is very good at working to have a strong community of involvement.
good,"Local management did the best they could with multiple re-organizations and changes in upper managements vision. "
good,The type of projects are becoming more and more high tech.  Good benefits. But the more you progress the more difficult to get promoted in the career path.
good,"I was a manager in the operator services department, I worked with the 0 operators. I was responsible for a team of approximately 15 operators. I trained and developed them on company techniques and policies. I handled difficult call situations at times. I also had to handle disciplinary situations including suspending and terminating employees when necessary. I was also involved in training new managers. This was the most comprehensive work environment I was in. I also worked as an operator during a work stoppage.  It gave me a great understanding of how to effectively deal with various personalities."
good,some good and some bad. depending what your pay structure is. it can be very amazing or just as bad. can be cooperative but can be competitive. have to worry about co-workers taking your sales.
good,I worked there for about 2 years and my co-workers were professional and knowledgeable. I would recommend the company to friends and colleagues. I thought the salary was slightly below average for my work experience.
good,A good middle of the road employer. A very large company with many departments and places to advance. New buildings and covered parking. Free parking.
good,"If you are money-motivated, then you can work here. I got tired of the long hours and being asked to sell products and services to customers that didn't want/need them. Store management is so concerned about getting yelled at by their managers that they push the sales reps to sell any way they can, with little regard for the customer."
good,Great benefits. Job rotation is offered which is great way to learn new skills. Best place to work. The people are the number one reason I love working at VZ.
good,"Not what I expected, very disappointed to say the least .  The racism is very real and in you face as a minority. Management is very un organized and just all over the place."
good,"Good employer."
good,"Excellent team work, Always some to assist you, always challenging and rewarding. you will never be bored, fast paced, often work long hours, benefits are good. Pay is average."
good,"Overall Verizon is a good company. The issues I had was with compensation. Your compensation is managed so you that you never can surpass the companies target compensation for your position. "
good,This was a promotion from Administrative Assistant.  I was trained to do graphics and learned to assist the Engineers with engineering designs.  Great job .. fun and productive.
good,It was a good experience. Hard work but made a lot of money. Loved the people I worked with and gained a lot of life skills...........................
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Worked at Verizon for Thirty-three and half years, while successfully being promoted into several jobs/work titles. Verizon is very competitive and driven."
good,Use to be a great place to work until numerous companies tried to change things by either merging with or buying outright(Frontier). Many changes now.
good,"Good managers make a world of a difference, the bad one come in and things change for the worse. "
good,"1. I never feel i am working in an office, the environment and work culture is very friendly."
good,"Great place to start a sales career. If you like technology and enjoy the hands-on and face-to-face experience then Verizon is perfect for you! Also, advancement opportunities are there if you thrive."
good,Great place to work. Very fast pace and great team to work with. You have to be a people person and have a great attitude. Have patience and put on your listening skills. The uniforms are very casual very relaxed. Gym shoes was required but ladies can also wear heels. Great company to work for
good,Verizon was a wonderful work environment with competitive wages and benefits.  It was a productive company that I enjoyed working for.  I enjoyed each operation for each job I held at Verizon.
good,"This jobs requires a strong minded person. This job is a stressful job, but Verizon does offer counseling if the load gets too much. It can sometimes feel a little too cut throat."
good,"Competitive environment "
good,VZW was a great place to work in the beginning but the manager was often swapped or moved to other stores! The job became more cutthroat when customer service was forced to sell products along with the commissioned sales reps!
good,The company is efficient and is leading in the industry. A good place to learn new technology. Good communication among developers and business groups.
good,"Regardless of tenure, you can be fired the next day. Coworkers who had been working +10 years with Verizon easily laid off."
good,This job was amazing when I first stared back in two thousand twelve. The quality of work life went down fast each year. They kept messing with commission structure to get more sales for less money. All of this was happening while they cut managers position.
good,The Call Center provided a great atmosphere. My coworkers were amazing. I had a great work-life balance and there were many perks to working there. I would love to go back.
good,"Looking back, I had a great time working at Verizon before all the changes.  Rewards and commission were great and the training staff was excellent.  Some of the downfalls would be attributed to capping commissions as well as making the metrics to achieve presidents cabinet almost impossible.  It was a good run, I'd recommend to a friend because it's still a great place to work as long as you do what you're supposed to be doing.  Definitely better than the other carriers out there.  I was proud and still am proud to have been a part of their community and you should give it a shot."
good,I enjoyed working here when I was first out of college and the pay was great but this was a long time ago.  Overall I believe it to still be a good work place.
good,Okay place to work but very stressful. Majority of the management has been in the company for decades and are not in tune with the latest in technology and follow old school top down management approach.
good,Benefits and pay seem really good vacation days start day 1. Pretty good amount of training if you have some type of skill with technology.Relationships. Support. Compensation.
good,"very aggressive as far as sales go, turn over rate is very high. must be sales oriented and very technologically savvy. Commission structure is ok, could be better."
good,"IWorked 3 different positions at Verizon in my IT career. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good place for younger people to get started. As with any commission based job, Verizon is extremely high stress. Along with that stress comes good money."
good,"Verizon offers a tremendous opportunity to learn, great income, and phenominal benefits.  However, they have eliminated leadership roles unless you are willing to work out of a hub for many positions.  Great company, but unless you're willing to move, advancement opportunities don't exist."
good,Management was very welcoming and open to new opinions and ideas. The workplace culture was very calm and open to collaboration. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.
good,"Not much room for advancement, low pay, hard sales. "
good,The supervisors would create the circles with others joining in.  We spoke about ourself one by one. Everyone learned about one another so everyone can b comfortable with each other just in case they needed some assistance or some help because the job was dangerous.
good,"As a Sales Rep I excelled very quickly and made fantastic money. Once I became a family man and moved into management, the money decreased and the hours took a toll on our family life."
good,Fun and exciting group to work with. Would do it again. There were great people to work with that were exciting and knowledgeable about daily activities.
good,"Verizon is only (as-is any business) about generating revenue, while cutting expenses. This means jobs and benefits. None of which you are entitled to. If you want to work for Verizon and make a career out of it, you absolutely must be able to help increase the companies bottomline while enacting ways to decrease expenses. That is really all there is to maintaining employment with VZ. If you are in a support role or otherwise cost the company money without any revenue generation, you must be prepared to go through a company reorganization on a near yearly basis, which means having to reapply for a different job and in all likelihood relocate to another state if you wish to continue your tenor with VZ."
good,"Flexible hours and good compensation.  Great coworkers and excellent support from others.  Flexible work schedule and able to work from home on a regular basis.  Can be stressful at times, but that goes with any job."
good,"Working culture was global and collaborative. Be prepared to network with many people in order to have success in your job function. There is room for growth, but also room for large lay offs too."
good,"The work environment is friendly. However sales is a cut throat business, you must be skilled in the art of sales in order to succeed. Sales comes naturally to me, which is great."
good,"good place to work, must be ready to work hard and use all your resources to exceed expectation. Lot's of stack ranking reports, sales analysis reports and activity management"
good,It was great but there was little to none job security. The management was great but it is not a full-time job. The stress is there since it is a sales job
good,"Working for Verizon did make me come out of my shell and break down some shyness barriers and become more outgoing. It is definitely a sales job and a good chunk of your time is helping existing costumers with technical support, which was easy but certainly repetitive. Overall Verizon is a great company to work for, which includes great pay, benefits and really cool people to work with. I would recommend working for Verizon only if you're planning on staying for the long haul or using it to make a little money in the mean time and move on to other job opportunities."
good,"The culture at the stores are great, youthful and fun place to work, the people there really become family since you are there all the time.  The benefits and pay are like non other i have yet to find, the hardest part of the job is dealing with customer's impossible demands, monthly quotas ( everyone has a cell phone now a days) and the retail hours."
good,Excellent company to work for.   Excellent opportunities for advancement and learning and training.    Good 401K plan and good benefits.    Pleasant work environment
good,"Average place to work, for some people its long term however senior people need much better task list. Sometimes feel over loaded sometimes vacuum. Need balancing ..."
good,Verizon has taught me a lot about phones and phone soft ware. The management is good and very flexible with hours. I would definitely recommend working here.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon has a lot of great things going for it as it relates to technology, great people to work with, a desire to transform itself and opportunities to learn."
good,I work in the kitchen during the major shows and events on occasion. It's a fun work environment for the most part. I work as contract labor so it's nice to work on an as needed basis.
good,"It changed from caring about employees customers to the bottom line which is unfortunate "
good,"Working in the store was great, the call center was very stressful but they tried to make it fun.  A lot of celebrations and team builders.  M supervisor was awesome, her bosses were more cut-throat"
good,"In the NOC environment, teamwork was encouraged and individual work was expected. Management did not foster career advancement and direction although, training through the company was encouraged. Senior level leadership was great and made themselves known."
good,"On a typical day at work we would take 25-30 chats a day. most of the time we would be on 2 chats at a time. "
good,"Good way to communicate on a different level with customers."
good,"Typical Day, very busy, and not enough hours in the day. ."
good,"Verizon is a good place to work overall.  Salary/ compensation is competitive.  The workplace culture is very quality and customer driven.  It is an extremely fast-paced environment.  The ""team"" culture can be challenging as many peer positions are not co-located."
good,"worked throughout mergers, had good managers until Verizon decided pull out of market on a nationwide scale. Management  got real quite, no job security."
good,My job was pretty awesome and fun but my manager didn't make sure I was properly trained on the specs of the phones we had or the monthly rates or on how to properly set up a line so it made it very difficult to attain the $50/hr net profit quota we had.
good,"While at Verizon, the typical day begins with making sure all of the inventory is fully stocked and accounted for, which this pertains to all phones, tablets, and accessories.  From there, the day consist of greeting and assisting customers with all of their cellular needs, whether it is getting a new phone or trying to figure out why their device won't connect to wifi.  Being someone who enjoys helping people, everyday is fun and brings its own adventures.  My coworkers and I find ways to keep each other laughing and keep spirits up.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with some of those issues that you can't fix that have customers highly irate because we can't fix what they need.  Those are some of the toughest things.  The best part is enjoying the times me and my coworkers have.  They are like family for me."
good,"This particular office is not hiring, but when I was there it was the union that saved this call center. The benefits were outstanding that never came out of your paycheck, there was a winter pay bonus, and the employees were mostly very easy to work with."
good,"I worked in the Landline division of Verizon and it was union.  Thanks to the union we were paid extremely well and had about the best health benefits available. Unfortunately, the union positions at Verizon are being phased out."
good,"I was second shift contractor. So i don't have much to say in regards to this role. Overall its a good company from what i saw, helpful friendly co-workers."
good,Working for verizon was exceptionally amazing. Trainings were available and were also instreucted clearly. Verizon was a great company to work work for.
good,"Huge company had typical bureaucratic red tape.  It was nearly impossible to create a new project, and execute on a plan with any agility.  It would take years to get anything done."
good,"Work starts at 9:45 am for opening shift, 11 am for closing shift."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"For the most part, good people working with challenging demands and for qualified leaders.  Often, though, the goals of various groups are not aligned and this creates significant obstacles to overall success.  Still working on correcting the culture..."
good,"A typical work day at a call center for Verizon Wireless included provided quick and accurate answers to customers regarding rate plans, products and services. I provided technical support when necessary in trouble shooting devices. The calls were back to back and could sometimes be stressful because of the various attitudes of customers regarding their products and services. An important part of this job is to be able to know the products and be able to find the information quickly within the system to provide answers. The hardest part of this job sometimes was to remain positive at all times even when the customers were very rude and discourteous.  The most enjoyable part of this job were the pay, benefits, and annual monetary reward given."
good,"Worked daily with our vendors and overseas employees to resolve issues with executive escalations and service delivery."
good,"Verizon is a very solid place to work for. Union protected benefits that are very good in todays environment."
good,"I loved the salary and benefits at Verizon. I was disappointed with the lack of career mobility and the fact  that employees can be moved at anytime. Verizon was a fast paced environment and you have to be able to keep with the pace.As an employee I feel I have gained a lot of knowledge required for many positions, and I am grateful for the experience."
good,I don't want t talk about Verizon on this website. I am looking for a part-time job to supplement my income. Preferably a position where I can telecommute.
good,It's faced environment and get chance to work on the cutting edge technologies.  Work place is balanced and get to meet diff. leadership members and learn the new methodologies and work techniques from diff. people.
good,"Overall Verizon is a great company to work for. Work life balance due to retail hours is difficult to manage with a family. Compensation is fair, but you will work hard for what you get."
good,My work place was always lively and full of energy there by allowing me to not only be efficient at work but also satisfied me.I learnt basic computer networking through my process. It provided me with tricky situations in handling customers thereby allowing me to learn how to tackle a customer's issue in various different ways and also keeping them satisfied with the assistance.
good,Very stressful job which is one of the reasons I left. Good training. Good supervisory support. Had quite a few parties for customer service representatives to show their appreciation for all of our hard work.
good,the most enjoyable part of a job was building trust with customers and they always come back to you. The hardest part of the job was definitely dealing with stressful customers with no patience.
good,"Verizon at San Jose is has a relaxed work environment. Nobody is breathing down your neck forcing you to work. You simply get the work done and everything is nice and dandy. I wish I could work here for a long time but if you are working on a project that isn't going anywhere, it is best to find other jobs."
good,The Verizon call center that used to exist in Marlborough MA was a great place to work.  The pay was great and monthly bonuses for hitting your numbers were very significant as well.
good,"I was focused on the broadband products when I was at Verizon Telecom.  This was right when BB really became popular and it was stressful, but rewarding experience"
good,Good benefits. Good culture. The base salary is a bit low for my current job title although the additional benefits help make up for this shortcoming.
good,It was a pleasant place to work. I had to relocate because of family issues . I started as a sales rep. and moved into corporate trainer and then moved into management to be home more  often
good,"Compensation was very good. Management very pushy, 30% of their salary based on their team sales. Toxic work environment due to union/management quarrels. Ability to make a lot of money."
good,Verizon opens great doors. With that comes great headache. Drastic changes are implemented for quick rate of return. Frontline is always sacrificed without remorse!
good,The company is very results focused. The pay is competitive. Verizon has a great benefits package with a reasonable amount of paid days off. The work environment can be high stress.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Competitive workplace.  Constant activity.  Often times was on the leading/cutting edge.  Fair and equitable compensation.  Often times allowed autonomy.
good,Telephony industry has fewer and fewer need for employees the company is always downsizing for technology. At one time a equipment office might have 2 floors of equipment now that whole office might all fit in a small furniture cabinet
good,"I really liked working there at the start, it was a fun environment!"
good,People at this Verizon are great to work with but upper management did not do a good job directing overall what they wanted the product to be.  Multiple shifts occurred when there was no reason for the shift.
good,Verizon Communications is a decent company to work for.  The union plays a crucial role in ensuring that employees are included in the company's financial success.
good,Enjoyed my time at Verizon.  My boss gave me the necessary tools to enable me to be successful in my job and provided me the flexibility to maintain a good work/life balance.
good,"In the last 10 years of my career I was able to work from home.  This was beneficial to both myself and the company since I was always available. My last manager was communicative and fair, but that hasn't always been the case."
good,"50% discount on cell service, great thorough trainers. Company is very supportive of employees, but the work itself...well, it's a call center, so it's not a lot of fun, but good honest job,"
good,"Stressful but a good place to work, with learning new stuff. Opportunities are more to learn new stuff and people help each other in work. Good place to work"
good,"The place hires a lot of contractors."
good,"Velocity is the average number of points from that past 3 – 4 sprints. It is used to help predict when backlog items will be delivered. "
good,I worked there a long time ago and i know it has changed quite a bit but from what i hear it is an okay place to work still.  I have quite a few acquaintances that still work there.
good,Had the best people to work for! Had a blast in training and management was the best. Early morning rallies really got people pumped to go out and sale
good,"I enjoyed working at Verizon. However, I do feel as if it is not made for a female who has children. The retail hours are crucial and you're constantly standing."
good,"That's a I.T company I worked in night shift clear the garbage from dustbin, put water can in water dispenser, restroom cleaning n arrange the cafeteria that's all the work in there"
good,"its a good company to start with "
good,"I liked having a voice. My boss listens to my ideas and the whole team works together to make them happen. We all support each other and work together to offer creative feedback and them made our ideas a reality. I love being appreciated and listened to,"
good,I liked the work . Mainly made money on commission and that could be hard at times but overall it wasn't bad at all. We had lots of regular customers.
good,"Can be fun at times to work at. However upper mangment matters alot! If you don't haver the proper leader in front of you, you can loose inspiration easily."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Fast pace and always changing. Retail hours and not much of work/life balance. You can make good money and has good benefits. Team environment can be fun depending on dynamics of the store.
good,I loved my job with Verizon Business as an IT Project Manager for the first 7 years.  The culture started to change as they began to off shore the majority of the IT department.   After 10 years I decided it was time for a change.   Many aspects of Verizon are great and I would not have changed anything.  If you can land a job with them in the wireless or business side you should be taken care of...mostly!
good,Verizon continually evolves into new market segments.  Constant organizational change.  Good corporate citizen.  Flexible work arrangements.  Very hierarchical.
good,"I worked at Verizon wireless full-time for two years. it has advantage of good  pay, and it has good benefits too, the Cons are poor Work life balance, career progression slow"
good,Verizon is a fast paced environment in which I have learned a lot and have many opportunities afforded to me. I love resolving my customer's issues and letting them know that I am in their corner.
good,Team atmosphere able to grow and meet a lot of people to grow the customer base. Yearly bonuses were a huge plus. The work schedule was not very flexible.
good,"I have nothing bad to say about them.  It was a good place to work.  I am not sure why I am forced to write this review, so I am adding characters until I'm done."
good,"good place to work but let me go after 19 years, i did a lot of functions but found it to be really a place that i had more potential to eventually grow"
good,"I worked for Verizon Wireless in assisting Customers with their high-quality communications services. This job involved business practices in dealing with our customers, suppliers, owners, "
good,Need better leaders otherwise Verizon has been the best company I've worked for would definitely recommend to friends and family. Appreciate my 11 years with Verizon.
good,"the work culture in verizon is very good, innovative, fast paced."
good,"The position I held allowed me to work from home most of the time, going to the office only for a meeting now and then. The workload was heavy at times and staff was short but immediate supervisor was great. I most enjoyed supporting internal Verizon employees with order issues and had a great team that had been together for many years. The hardest part was the lack of job security, the cuts were not determined by performance but by numbers."
good,Opportunities to advance can be hard to come by. More often temporary positions open and then an employee returns to a lower level position. The company needs to listen to employee suggestions in regards to performance.
good,beware of the cliques which is noted in every job. Work hard and be sure to have a manager that sees your worth and don't forget to remember they love process improvements but lack the motivation to proceed to standardize their approach which is a tragedy in the end.
good,"Was a very busy call center with over 1000 people on the phone taking support calls for Verizon FiOS Voice, Video and Data. The calls would come one after another. Very high paced. Held to call metrics such as 1st. call resolution rate, Call Average Handling Time,"
good,Great job that offers a lot of tools in order to help develop interpersonal skills. Always people willing to help if need be. The manager offers as much of their time to help meet your goals
good,worked this job off and on for several years it was one of my first jobs being 18 years old. Staff is friendly and caring. Hours varies day shift or over night shift or on call. could not keep this job due to relocation of a personal matter.
good,"If you want to make money, you will make money. ALWAYS CONSULT your customer. Do less talking and a lot more listening. Always know what there is to offer and ALWAYS offer it."
good,"I was not employed as a sales associate within the company, but did receive an annual compensation (bonus) based on overall store and personal performance.  Great company benefits for all individuals. I was employed more than 20 years and have gained much knowledge over the years."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,While working at verizon I was able to develop vital job skills that made me a more appealing employee. The only down side is the work life balance and the micromanagement.
good,"I have a great allegiance to Verizon Wireless as well as a long history.  I have a lot of respect for the ethics of the company as a whole.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the call center that I am currently in.  This is the fifth call center that I've been in and is the center that I have felt the least welcome.  They seem to work from an 80's philosophy of lead by fear.  Cannot and will not fall victim to this mentality."
good,closed on us without warning. Left almost 30 people stuck without a job. Had no remorse or warning. We all where completely blind sided by the whole situation.
good,Just in my case I took on more responsibility but didn't see any increase in pay and when I asked about it I got excuses that didn't make any sense considering the fact I'm already doing the job
good,"However Wireless is under tremendous revenue pressure now."
good,Customer service jobs have there pros and cons but I enjoyed working at Verizon none the less. Good management and people who want to see you advance.
good,My real networking experience certainly started here way back in 2010. They are generous in supporting your career advancement via sponsoring your exam certifications.
good,"This is an exciting job. if you love talking to people, getting to know people, and using your expertise to help them this job is for you. You get what you put in this job."
good,Guest/customer service; great place to work; great teamwork environment; great place to network with those you don't know or are meeting for the first time.
good,Verizon offers an excellent Sales Training program to help their Solutions Specialist advance in their career.  I really enjoyed working with customers to find the very best solution for their wireless needs.
good,"Great Team to work with in Jacksonville. Fun atmosphere, even when things are hectic. Good benefits to include Medical, and Vision. Dental is a bit lacking in coverage"
good,"Job has a high demand, but well worth it if you're able to maximize your time in store. You are also able to contact business clients in order t hit your quota. Great benefits."
good,"Management expects a lot out of you and rightfully so, they get paid on your performance as well. Take care of your customers, sell as much as you can, and everyone will be happy"
good,"A typical day at work wasn't too bad. I personally loved going to work everyday. Everyone there would welcome you with a smile. The people there were even better, the vibe and energy is amazing to me."
good,"Every changing job with a positive culture and growth opportunities."
good,"I was the back done of the location.  I prepared the store every morning.  I was in charge of inventory.  Typical day, my co worker and I would do everything.  I was employed with Verizon for over 10 years before I was laid off. I was energetic and tried to make the workplace fun. The managers were great for the most part. The hardest part of the job was not having support from the manager and some co workers.  Verizon is only sales oridented. It was fun working there.  The people I got to work with were awesome and we were a family."
good,There is potential to make a lot of money at Verizon. It will drain you and there is a lot of pressure to produce. The company changes its sales focus and targets constantly so you always have to be willing to adapt. It is difficult to keep a good work/life balance if you have children because the job can be consuming.
good,"Commission performance for goal oriented people. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Large corporate culture, great benefits, gym/trainer @ larger offices, as always, hit or miss on great managers/leaders, downside - must be willing to move around country for advancement,"
good,I never worked there. Therefore I cannot comment on the work environment or anything about the company.  I only worked with them for contracts related to capital construction.
good,The day at work was hot  as a sign spinner and dancing with a sign I learned that it good to dance and show were your job site  management was not good late on my checks and not did not do his job the hardest part of my job was the sun being hot and the most enjoyable was that I got to dance and make people happy and smiling.
good,Verizon makes sure that you have everything you need to be successful as a manager. They go above and beyond to ensure that you are taken care of when traveling on business and they make sure that they hear and consider new ideas for increasing productivity before  just they dismiss it.
good,"I was the store manager and I supervised a crew of 12 to 20 people in the sales and services of Verizon wireless products. My position was to hire, train, coach, schedule the staff in the operations of the store"
good,"Fun and Challenging but can have long strenuous work hours. Work on Sundays and most holidays. Basically Retail Hours. Can be very rewarding if you have no other obligations outside of work which I didn't. If you have a family that you want to spend time with or personal business to run forget about making 80k at Verizon as a Solutions Specialist. Can be a very fun work environment, but all depends on your manager and culture of which corportate store you are at."
good,Could be stressful at times if you were not a competent sales representative.  Money was good but it did mean working a lot of weekends.  You did the have the opportunity to move up if you were ambitious.
good,"keeping a positive attitude to show how much I enjoy my job as well as constantly congratulating others on their successes. When others need encouragement, I try and motivate them to keep improving."
good,is a great job.  when if first started commissions were calculated differently. my commissions have taken about 50 % decrease.  you feel that.  there is a lot of micro managing now as well
good,"Benefits were great working for the company. Good commission structure, Most sales reps are helpful. Each store has a different atmosphere as far as helpful reps and family feeling to competing against eachother"
good,The people I worked with are knowledgeable and good to work with.  It was always easy to seek help and get the answers needed to get any and all tasks completed.
good,Job is very good with good benefits but you will not have much of a life and the way sales are done now quota are almost unattainable. As a sale rep you can make around 50k as year. 80 if your a really good rep! Moving up in the company can be hard if you don't know how to deal with politics.
good,"Typical day includes assisting walk in guests with questions regarding questions about cell phones, rate plans, billing questions, and technical support. The position strives to take care of the needs presented by the guest, as well as offering other products and services relevant to their needs, uncovered through conversation."
good,I loved working there. It was one of the best jobs I ever had and I would still work there if they had not done the lay offs last year. I was able to help people and That is what I loved about it.
good,"I've enjoyed working for Verizon.  It's always great to see the latest products and getting them into the hands of customers.  Plus, it's an ever changing environment and it keeps me going."
good,"Spent many years with Verizon Wireless, working my way through multiple positions. Would have been happy to stay but they closed down my center and relocation wasn't for me."
good,fast-paced and numbers driven. Once you reach tech support level  no where to really go other than being a supervisor. Typical call center environment.
good,"Typical day at work was face paced, but management at times lacked structure. Every six months layoffs come and you're never sure exactly who is going to be safe. Good employees are often let go with only the option to reapply back into the company. There is no value put on employee tenure, everyone is replaceable."
good,The time I have spent with Verizon has been priceless. The people who are in the trenches are absolutely the highest quality people I have ever met. Management is a bit disconnected from the front line representatives and it shows in their decisions. Overall the company is one that I can recommend to anyone.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Good job with great benefits. Worked there for 10 years with awesome success. After 10 years of service I was told they were doing away with my job. They offered a nice severance package.
good,"Good company with great benefits, 401k, work/life balance. The managers are awesome. You learn a lot of different things, such as selling tips, team selling."
good,"Every morning I was the first person there and would be in charge of pushing trade-in devices from the day before to the warehouse.  Keeping records of all out going and incoming merchandise.  I would also need to correspond with regional operations manager to make sure all pricing and equipment was out and working properly.  Once we opened I would help customers with either question about bill, service and or trouble shoot devices i.e. cell phones, routers, computers, and tablets.    I would also trouble shoot our internal computer and network systems as well as payment systems.  "
good,The workplace culture is a volatile one as each person is trying to get promoted in areas where there are limited areas to get promoted. The management look at seniority as a priority to being promoted but don't take into account the productivity and efficiency of a person who is doing better at their job in a shorter amount of time than someone who has been here longer and doesn't perform at a high rate. The hours are irregular and with no chance to progress in the company this place is stunting the growth of my career.
good,"Generous vacation policy"
good,"It's hard to compare Verizon to other companies. I've only worked 3 places in my career, Verizon being the largest. The benefits are great however, there is a constant threat of layoffs or offshoring of jobs. The company does not invest in resources which make things difficult. Everything is last minute and seems to have little planning involved."
good,"Work/Life Balance is tough."
good,"It has been some time ago that I worked for Verizon, so I'm sure the culture and all has changed since then.  At the time, it was a good experience and good company."
good,"I worked at Verizon for 30 months as a data modeler. It was a fast pace environment with weekly maintenance releases and monthly enterprise releases. The job required a self starter, and for the time period that I was there, it required long hours.  Co-workers were generally friendly and supportive. Management generally leave it up to you once you have demonstrated that you can deliver projects on time."
good,"The many facets of service at four departments of my duration of time as an employee, gave me a large variety of hands-on training for program changes, for improved technical directions toward terrific office experiences, focused on promoting excellent customer care."
good,"Verizon is a safe working environment with good benefits and fair compensation. Overall a good place to work, but a hard place to keep work from pouring into your personal life."
good,worked in a small indirect location with only 5 reps in the store. all got along great and knew how to help one another in the sales process. business started to go down when a corporate location opened a mile away but we managed to pull together as a team and keep the sales rolling.
good,I learned alot about fiber optics how to cut and splice. I read and interpreted blueprints and engineering schematics for fiber-to-the-premises infrastructyure.
good,"Verizon nurtures employees who dedicate themselves to the pursuit of continual improvement."
good,I think Verizon is a great company to work for. I was laid-off from the company but I did management and customer service work. It is a great company for anyone who wants to learn more about sales.
good,My internship experience taught me a lot of technical skills I did not have previously but the company structure seems like there is a lot of downtime for most employees throughout the day.
good,"Good company to work and had learnt how to deal with different stakeholders, client etc.... Work life balance is too good. Hardest part of the job is frequent management change."
good,"Good place to work liked what i did there. improved my sales experience, i learned a lot thanks to verizon. good management i don't have any complaints"
good,It's a high stress environment but compensates well for a good work ethic.  The company has great benefits and will hone your sales skills and make you a valuable employee both for Verizon and any future endeavors.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A typical day would be getting to work, logging in and then checking emails (or helping someone if busy) "
good,Work safely and be engaged with doing a good job. Verizon has no issues laying you off for smallest reason. Working outside in weather hardest part. Being left alone to do your job very enjoyable
good,Verizon is a great place to work for with a diverse workforce and a focus on culture a professional development. The organization fosters a team environment and really stresses empowering their workers to better serve their customers.
good,Good overall company. Leaders try to do the right thing. Market place is changing and presenting challenges. If you want promoted be able to move to NJ. Overall good pay and benefits.
good,"This company has high standards for employee performance without much assistance to train on improvement. If you are great with learning everything on your own, then you can do well and make a lot of money. If not, it's about the survival of the fittest."
good,One of my favorite jobs. Not a whole lot of room for advancement although they will tell you otherwise. Opportunity to make a lot of money as long as you put in the work.
good,"During my time with this company the employees and managers went from lots of fun to not so much at the end.  This was because of layoffs happening at least 4 times a year."
good,"Executive management is out of touch with frontline operations. "
good,"Every day at the Verizon store was spent researching new phones and technology, trouble shooting problems with customers phones and plans, and selling new products to the consumers."
good,"Verizon Wireless is a great company. While working for the company some of my responsibilities were to Retain Customers, and upgrade customers to better plans and services while multitasking and Save customers money. In the 5yrs working for the company have enhanced and obtained many skills to be a better person and employee. The most difficult days were being verbally abused while attempting to keep retain customers."
good,"If you are thinking of applying for Verizon Wireless, then do it."
good,Definitely learned many skills in my time with the company. The people I worked with are very talented and that is what I will miss the most from my time with Verizon.
good,"nice staff , reasonable scheduling , long hours , good management ,nice work place culture , hardest part of the job moving up, most enjoyable part is interacting with customers"
good,if you like a fast paced demanding situation then verizon is for you.very tech oriented-management tend to treat employees fairly but if you are looking for company loyalty you may want to think twice
good,"When I started with Verizon it was an excellent company to work for. Management was in the trenches with us selling and working side by side. Over the past six months, the company culture has changed dramatically. Management has increasingly become a tool for leadership to micromanage the employees. Goals have become increasingly more difficult to achieve, and compensation has suffered immensely. When I first started there was a general feeling of teamwork and excitement about every day, but recently it has become more of a burden to go to work. Stress levels are high and increasing pressure is placed on employees to hit goals or face termination. More and more pressure is being placed on the employees because executive decisions are increasingly on the side of the stockholders at the expense of customer service and employee happiness. There is absolutely no work-life balance hours range from 10am-8pm which is divided into an opening and a closing shift. By the time you drive to work, spend the day at the store, and return home you have little time to family or relaxation."
good,"offered daily, weekly, and monthly selling spliffs as well as a commission structure. offered client discounts to employees such as tmobile, comcast, etc.."
good,Learned OBIEE while working on improving Net promoter score. The most enjoyable was leveraging new technologies with customer insights to paint a picture for customer happiness
good,"Flexible hours and you control your pay. Base salary is not the best so you strive for a larger commission check. Must enjoy customer interactions consistently throughout the day, and be a team player. If you slack, your team looks bad"
good,"Good place to work,  Enjoyed learning about new equipment and applications.  Serious workplace culture.  Shift work was the hardest part."
good,"I am still working as a contractor now for almost 22 months."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Lots of opportunities at Verizon.  However, you do have to be willing to relocate.  Every day presented a new challenge.  The hardest part of the position is that it generally required 50-60 hours to complete."
good,"I started off as a temporary employee and my management team was aggressive in helping me get hired by the company. The culture of the team was good, employees were helpful,  and the company provided opportunities for advancement."
good,It's OK here but things could be better. If the managers are in order the workplace runs like smooth. The environment is healthy when the team works together.
good,Great sales job!  Good pay and great benefits.  Company is not really hiring as much so up-word mobility is stagnant currently.
good,There was no better way to make good money part time while going to school. But if there was I would have left because upper management is blind to the concerns of front line reps and is only concerned with making goals and striving to be better rather than appreciating work already done.
good,This is a nice place to work. Superior learning scope and new technologies. Very friendly work environment and to nurture the leadership skills. Overall the rating is high.
good,Job flexibility and effective management create a productive work environment. We function well as a team and are all learning and getting better each day in a field that is very competitive.
good,challenging work and ability for career advancement. Good company with great support from management. Giving equal equality for all genders and also great team effort.
good,"Working at Verizon was the standard, to-be-expected, for a large, corporate environment.  I worked for this company, and its predecessors, for over 30 years, and found it to be a reasonably good experience.  In particular, the people I worked with were all professional and dedicated to customer service."
good,"Work 40 hours a week"
good,I have already written this review previously and it was approved.  I just removed my old resume and uploaded my new one but its the same info. just more detail.
good,Be prepared to up your salesman ship. This company loves to get people in just the right device to fit their needs. many phones are sold there
good,A fun workplace environment. Management always kept us entertained and the store was upbeat even when we were busy. My coworkers made the long retail hours worth it.
good,Take calls to help assist customers. While taking calls making sure I hit all key points during the calls to maintain successful stats. Management's ok
good,Great company. Strong on Innovation. Higher management is pretty good. Pretty flat organization structure. You'll be give challenges everyday. Collaborative environment is promoted.
good,"daily business account customer and client account assistance"
good,Very good employment opportunity with very good very knowledgeable colleagues. Challenges with efficiency and accountability. Great potential if efficiency issues are resolved. Earning opportunity could double or multiply.
good,"Answering phone calls, helping customers with billing questions also assisting with changes to services.For example moving phone service to new location ,upgrades,applying credit, etc. My goal was always to  provide excellent customer service. The computer system was constantly changing and being upgraded so we always took classes to remain relevant. We had sales contests and the opportunity to win wonderful prizes."
good,"This was an alternative school, and ACE (Accelerated Christian Education) where basically the kids taught themselves.  I was more there to encourage them"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Worked on multiple projects throughout my career at Verizon. Obtain valuable project management skills and learned how to successfully collaborate with business owners and management team. Going through the merger that created Verizon (former GTE and Bell Atlantic) was challenging. Initially, there was a clash of cultures, but everyone soon began to work towards a common goal of creating the best communications company in the world. I really enjoyed the people and traveling to our locations on the east coast."
good,"It was a billing department, and it was a contract job. There is no job security, they can terminate us anytime without any cause. Sometimes there won't be anything to do."
good,Verizon is a good place to work if you want an on the go job this is definitely the place for you.  Working through DC it has been a blast.
good,Verizon got a great ambiance to work and skill enhancement. The managers are always ready to go with the innovations and this is what makes it different. It is enjoyable to work with my team as well.
good,"good place to work."
good,"While opened, the wages were VERY competitive and the benefits were GREAT. Overtime was offered frequently. I just wish that there would have been job security."
good,worked for verizon for 2 years now had alot of good times doing so. a forever changing field that continues to challenge your sales and work ethic in a good mannor
good,"The job is very flexible.  The job itself was strictly commission and required the employee to drive several miles a day.  Since the job was door to door, the employee had to drive all around the state to the required street location."
good,In my 18 years there I learned so much from so many people.  I worked with great team members who knew the true meaning of teamwork.
good,A typical day begins with checking inventory and emails. the rest of the day I make calls and invite guests into the store. I also process bill payment and try to make sales. I love the friendly competition.
good,Verizon is expanding beyond just a telecommunications business.  They offer training in the classroom and online on a variety of subjects pertinent to your job function.  They also offer a tuition reimbursement program to encourage learning and exploring away from the job.
good,"Good place to work that rewards you for the work and time that you put in. Required, at times, high amounts of focus and speed."
good,Great benefits and discounts. Very fast pace at times. Good opportunities for advancement and development. Overall good company to work for.
good,Verizon is transitioning to new services and products as revenue from the legacy products are declining. The transition creates uncertainty in the workforce.
good,"Great work environment, spacious breakdown, cafeteria, ect. Conditions dieting going back. I loved working for Verizon."
good,"A great company to work for with amazing benefits. Management places a lot of pressure on sales reps to meet quota requirements. I didn't necessarily agree with their methods. "
good,"There is very little security with Vz, they continually have reduction in forces, which seem to be driven by the part of the business that are covered by the Union. The flip side to that is when the Union fights for benefits, and wages that generally trickles over to the management side of the business."
good,"After working at Dex Media for over 15 years I can honestly say it's the best company I've ever worked for. I started as an ad designer and was promoted to supervisor. Like any jobs there were pros and cons but the pros far, far outweighed the cons. Honestly there weren't really any cons to speak of."
good,This company really values there employees culture and core values. It is a great experience for me to be the part of it.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great company to work for, Room for Growth, and a great learning experience. Would have the pleasure with Growing with the Company."
good,"Great place for benefits, security and culture. I've learned how to management multiple work loads and at this time I am ready to grow."
good,"Good to work here."
good,nothing derogatory to say lots of good training good experience i have nothing but respect for the company or the staff i worked with
good,"Verizon has a very high quality product offering. The management teams were also very helpful. The employees were also, for the most part, very nice and helpful. Compensation and benefits were also very good. The work atmosphere was very hectic and stressful and required a long commute for me."
good,"Great benefits, good pay, work-life balance, job stability etc., comes with the regular red-tape /bureaucracy of big companies."
good,"Culture is excellent and exhibited and practiced from the top down. Benefits are excellent and cost reasonable. 401k match and profit sharing. Lots of training and professional development opportunities. Can advance if you're willing to relocate."
good,Call center work. Run with lots of rigid rules which were relaxed a bit towards the end. Good place to learn about giving excellent customer service within very limited amount of time.
good,Overall this is a good company to work for.  The opportunities for advancement can be limited and seem to be shrinking.  The company has good benefits and compensation.  Management is understanding and flexible.  Travel may be required particularly if you are not based out of head quarters.
good,"The best part about this job were my co-workers, a lot of them are still my closest friends. Verizon was a great company to work for, with great benefits and reasonable sized commissions. However, it was a stereotypical retail job when it came to dealing with angry customers. After awhile you get really good at dealing with angry customers, since theres so many of them."
good,"Verizon has a dynamic environment with a strong focus on new and emerging technologies ranging from Internet of Things, Machine-2-Machine, Cloud, Smart Devices, IPTV, Digital Media, and more."
good,great job while in school or for part time work or right out of college but would not recommend long term. there is a huge disconnect between corporate management and sales reps and the business is run rather shady with some deceptive sales tactics. Pay is there but quota is often unattainable as the company still believes it is growing in a growingly saturated marketplace. Too much politics and favoritism involved in upward mobility decsions.
good,"Good communication between employees and management . "
good,I learned a lot through my coworkers and supervisors. I gained confidence in my sales ability and was cared for in a loving way day-to-day
good,I worked that for a school year that allowed me to get an ideal about how the job of being an aide comes in. I would work for this company again.
good,Over all my experience at Verizon was great. I enjoyed being a picker and it was interesting to see how products were packaged and sent on a daily basis to other states around the world.
good,"A typical day at Verizon Wireless consists of engaging with retail consumers and creating new pipeline for small business consumers.  It is important to understand the latest technology, operating systems, troubleshooting, and applications across all platforms.  There were many improvements to be made within management during my time at Verizon Wireless.  The hardest part of this job was micro-management, as it does not allow employees to perform at the best of their abilities.  The most enjoyable part of this job was learning to use the latest mobile devices, applications, and gadgets."
good,Great work environment. Great place to develope personal relationships. Management went above and beyond making sure we had the propper training and information to deliver to the customers.
good,"Handled approximately 1000 calls per shift. Accessed relational database searching for names, locations and phone numbers for customers dialing 4-1-1 information."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"It's a great way to start off in retail. They taught me how to talk to customers, sell to customers and how to set a goal and pushed me to achieve that goal."
good,"If place of work always new objections to over come. Strong team work, team becomes more like family with the time you spend with them."
good,"i learned to work with the team in peak times, very friendly co-workers. Management is very cooperative and it helped us to deliver the product on time."
good,"The job itself is somewhat tedious and can be difficult at times, but the company treats its employees well. Great benefits, great work atmosphere and work/life balance."
good,Verizon was a great company to work for.  I learned a lot of quality skills in all of the fields that I worked in.  I gained a lot of friends that I can consider family.
good,Good place to get your foot in the door or start out for entry level pay. Great place to network with other people and find new friends as well.
good,Fun place to work with great benefits. School reimbursement and extra pay during certain shifts and days. Extensive training on system.
good,"Metric driven, supportive management and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was researching quickly to ensure accurate response to customer service or efficiency issues. The most enjoyable part was sharing knowledge with, supporting and teaching co-workers."
good,Verizon is a good place to work with great benefits and pay. Love working with the heavy equipment and driving the Line trucks.
good,In the field meeting with prospects was a typical day. I learned a ton about cellular technology. I had great direct manager and had dynamic co workers the best actually.Hitting quota for others was an issue and had High churn because of it. Loved the team building and activities
good,good company and great team work effort. mamngement is fair as well and now this review is asking too much so im typing to pass time
good,Great Benefits!  They are truly unmatched.   I survived 6 layoff rounds in 3 years.   Job security?   None.   Great team members but Verizon outsources alot of jobs so longevity is 3 to 5 years in management.  Job Work/Life balance not so good!
good,Best company I have ever seen at executing the day to day critical few.  Strong investment in sales operations is a terrific support for sales success.
good,Great place to work and the co-workers and fun to work with also. Management is very relaxed and there is no micro-management.
good,"After returning home from deployment, Verizon was the first company to seriously engage me with an employment offer that was a 'win-win' proposition."
good,great pay and benefits compared to other companies. Verizon gives room to grow to managerial postions. There is great sense of teamwork among the craft employees
good,APAC/Verizon was a very good place to work. Overtime was available but never required in the time I worked there. The management team was very nice and worked with employees to accommodate schedules as much as possible. they also worked with you to help improve areas that needed work in your metrics. Overall I have nothing bad to say about this company from an employment standpoint.
good,I had a good experience with the Verizon intern program. I gained a lot of experience learning how to operate in a business environment over my two summers.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Sales driven environment. Superiors did not micro manage and were always there to help when needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers with their wireless needs.
good,"Helping solve customer issues"
good,"Benefits start on day one with Verizon, and the company culture is forward-thinking and upbeat. If you need HR assistance, though, you may find your request takes a really long time to complete or gets lost altogether. It is likely only the Huntsville call center HR staff with this issue, but that has not been confirmed. Otherwise, a great company to work for!"
good,"A great work environment that was productive in developing new products and services.  Began as a ""startup"" type organization but grew to be more corporate."
good,You will learn a lot in a very short time. Fast pace never bored. You will be able to multitask like never before and be in 2 places at once.
good,"It's a Union environment.... Can be very challenging, but rewarding once you earn your respect.  I enjoy going to work everyday and making a difference.  I work hard to get big rewards.  And I manage to see success, and the more I work with individuals and show them I am here to help them succeed, the more I see come back to me in a positive way."
good,"I love the job but the distance (Hillsboro & Vancouver) and the pressure involved is beyond any normal expectations. I will not speak badly about any employer that gave me the opportunity to live and pay my bills. I loved helping people, and having customers come back to specifically me. It made my life and job worthwhile. The most difficult part was having so many different managers and the high turnover rate. Nobody ever stayed long enough which led to low productivity. All in all the job was a great learning experience. I'm glad I'm there, but it's time to move on."
good,"I don't understand why I have to do this!"
good,Good environment and learning culture. Enjoyed working with different large customers and different technologies. Good employees.
good,Verizon was an excellent place to work for someone who enjoys meeting and working with new people every single day. I had a great time working with the team I had around me and enjoyed the laid back team oriented atmosphere.
good,"I loved my job, I enjoyed interacting with customers, and getting to know and handle the newest phones and devices as the came out."
good,its good place to work and I always appreciate and recommend the people if opportunity knocks for this position..You can join without any intension.
good,Many changes within this company which required employees willingness to accept. Made the job challenging at times which I thought was good because I liked working with new things; that is why I moved throughout the company in order to learn and keep on top.
good,"Fun place to work, the best thing about this company was the overtime that they offered during the year.  You can make lots of money."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for.  They have excellent benefits and tuition assistance program.  Highly recommended for professionals that are seeking higher education.
good,Overall good place to work! You learn a lot and have the potential to be promoted to management fairly quickly with hard work.
good,Great company to learn about Telecom. Continuous training to ensure clear understanding of changes. Great incentives for delivering results.
good,"A responsible professional with 30 years experience with the same firm.  Each day a challenge.  Well respected by co-workers and management.  Most enjoyed the ability to train co-workers in the use of report tools, systems and process.  The hardest part of the job was leaving without the proper amount of time to train those left behind."
good,verizon was alot data entry in there system alot of copy and paste and emailing back and forth to cysco sometine answering phone calls
good,"Helping customers and finding best soultion for them."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The preferred company I work for is very enjoyable as far as the people and upper management. I learned quiet a bit from the owner as far as Microsoft and Excel goes. I've been in the business for more than 4 years now and I've came along way as far as management and organization and structure building goes.
good,"Based on job requirements alternate work arrangement's  allowed employees to work around family needs. However this was not supported equably by all managers."
good,I am grateful for the experience & skills that I was given over the years. The company is at a pivotal in its history and it will be interesting to see where the go in the future.
good,"Super long hours, depending on the store, if you are able to sell you will make a lot of money and a lot of politics. It was a great job, outside of all of the politics."
good,10 hour shifts with  45 min lunch break. Weekly 7am sales meeting on friday. the commission is based on a quota of assumed sales based on year over year growth expectations making it difficult to have a steady pay check or know what to expect financially.
good,"Amicable environment."
good,"I enjoyed learning a new experience at Verizon Wireless.  I do feel there should have been more hands on actual phone training and not so much classroom time.  One on one training would have been easier at least for me.  I liked dealing with customers, co-workers but often felt the technicalities were over my head.  "
good,Verizon is a good place to work due to the flexibility it offers its employees and the salary and benefits are good. A very good place for young graduates to start a career and learn new things.
good,A typical work day at Verizon included investigating cases and either forwarding them to a field technician or referring case back to a customer service rep.
good,"Along with reviewing the T&E, I helped with resolving problems with the T&Es submitted to expedite payment. We worked as a team to get all the T&Es audited that were submitted and resolve the problems in a speedy manner. "
good,"Management in control of your advancement. Difficult to get approval to advance or to leave current job functions. Business units are very sequestered. Although they have been moving to a more unified model, they are behind in this matter."
good,"Interesting and challenging place to work due to the highly competitive, fast paced market situation. Collaborative environment with proactive management support for team success."
good,"Verizon Business was a good company to work for.  Kept us busy because we always promised to be ""UP"" 99.99%.  I was able to learn from your basic ""POTS"" to fiber installation.  When I started with the company analogue is all there was."
good,Verizon is a good place to work with good benefits.  They provide decent flexibility for work and life balance.  They also have a friendly working atmosphere.
good,Verizon is currently re-inventing and undergoing transformation in several key areas.  The future of Verizon is dependent on whether the company can thrive in a un-plugged wireless business and consumer environment.
good,I would say Verizon Wireless is a good company to work for. They offers good pay with great benefits compared to other companies.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is  a competitive telecommunication company which is value driven with a customer service commitment to its customers
good,Goals increased on a monthly basis but with work were attainable. Sometimes fun as long as you had a good boss. Got laid off due to cost effectiveness.
good,Great place to work for. Takes care of their employees. Flexible and willing to work with the employees when needed. A variety of different interacting groups. Fast paced environment.
good,This was a great place to work.  The company was very supportive in developing their employees.  I was fortunate to be able to gain the skills and professional experience as a corporate trainer.
good,Usually I Have Good Customers And Sometimes Have Rude Customers But I Always Use One O My Skills Which Is Being A Peoples Person. I Make Them Laugh And I Convince Them Into Buying Our Products. I Also Speak Another Language So Sometimes That'll Help. Most Hardest Part In The Job Was Talking To Rude Customers In The Cold But At The End O The Day I Get The Job Done.
good,"The company has great benefits and exceptional training.  The training is continuous, which can seem tedious, but makes your actual job much easier.   Coworkers really worked as a team and all got along for the most part."
good,This Company overall has a decent work environment thought the hours and pay aren't all that great you do get to meet a lot of people and being around all the new phones and tablets that come out is a great plus
good,The core of this company is solid. There is no room for advancement and the mid level management is poorly trained. If it wasn't for the solid core this company would fail. most beginning techs have 15 or more years.
good,"This company was flexible with my hours, as well as my needs. They accommodate for any needs you have. They give a good perspective to students in the Engineering field."

good,the buildings is a place to work comfortable and gain experience while getting use to call center life style. building nicely put together
good,A typical day at work is meeting with vendors and internal project managers.  I was responsible for project managing my cell sites with my vendors. Escalation to vendors when on delays.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,No work-life balance. Excellent management . More Politics . New Technologies . Hectic Work . Work Pressure and Load . Good Co-Workers.
good,Good company to work for and provides good benefits to its employees. Major Corporation so be mindful of all that comes with that.
good,Good learning experience gained from working at verizon . Great benefint and good pay . Not a good place to look for job security .
good,Autonomy to do your job and run it as your piece of the business.  Co-workers were great and supportive.  Environment changed constantly.  Company started many projects but at my level finished few.
good,"day starts intensive with updates from Europe and Asia that affects my customers in Region. Making daily adjustments to keep projects aligned with the timeline, scope and budget. People in the office are fun but sometimes is challenging to deal with people outside the Americas."

good,"Dont like the fact that management and workers have to go on strike to get issues resovled. "
good,Performance driven retail environment. Supportive managers with open door policies there to help you develop and succeed. Co-workers work as a team to ensure the stores success. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting first access to the latest technology.
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for.  "
good,Company gives you many days off and personal time also great opportunity for growth. In the call center you usually start off answering inbound calls and have the opportunity as you grow to work on optional projects and positions throughout the company.
good,Productive and fun workplace with fair management.  Room to move up and expand.  Good benefits and lots of team work encouraged.
good,"Very old culture, Very conservative. If you question management in any way they look for a reason to get rid of you until they find there way to oust you. DM's think they know it all."
good,"Fast paced position in an dynamic and ever changing industry.  Great pay and the benefits are amazing, but you will work for every penny you make.  :)"
good,Worked with talented Engineers. There are management challenges but nothing that was a show stopper. Projects were cancelled and restarted.
good,"The company as a whole is fabulous. Everyone receives a yearly bonus based on company and personal performance that can be quite substantial. There a definite issues with management though. There are a lot of uneducated leaders that are in position due to length of service and not leadership skills. They need to take heed to employee complaints and assess the people that they have in those positions because it affects the morale on the floor. We have several very vindictive leaders that will try to make your life miserable if you are not in their ""clique"". If you can manage to get away from them and into a better department, the company is great and you will love."
good,great place to work  and had a lot of fun. good people. 8 hours of selling. tons of pay off. and good benifits. hard part would be selling  during the summer.
good,"It is a great place to be if you are shy, because it brings the out going side of your personality. Management cares for your success so, if you are willing to work hard you can reach your goals. It is a fast pace learning environment so, it really tests you as a person and what you have to bring to the table."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"During an average day at work I am obligated to make sales to a standard, uploading signed documents, making phone calls, answering phones, handing stressful situations and calming upset customers, and multitasking. "
good,The company had great pay and benefits. Enjoyed many years but a lot of favoritism when it came to advancements. Solid company overall to work for. They paid for your college education.
good,Working at Vzw was a great experience. The hardest part of the day was dealing with escalation issues. The positive feedback I received however from my other customers allowed me to not dwell on the negative. Vzw has amazing benefits and an exceptional vacation and time off allowance.
good,"It was fun and a very productive place just wanted something way better. We would work with the verizon cable company. I would basically do the technical part, for instance you would call and we would fix whatever is work with the tv, internet, or house phone"
good,"Loved the customers,  Built a strong relationship with many of the customers. However as with many large companies its all about the bottom line so after many layoffs I was finally cut so that more jobs could be sent overseas."

good,"Verizon is one of the leading telecom service provider in US. Every day it would be fun, exciting to learn new thing."
good,Extremely busy work environment. I learned alot about the wireless and telecommunication business. I worked with highly motivated and driven people as I managed 20 or more employees.
good,"Nonobstant, le côté procèdurier qui prévaut au sein de l'entreprise, il est relativement difficile de parler d'une journée typique car en réalité, elles sont toutes aussi différentes du fait des problématiques nouvelles qui se présentent au quotidien et qui ne  se résolvent jamais de la même façon. "
good,Good place to work with lots of chance to build a career with different departments which you can choose based on your area of interest.
good,If you love technology then you will love working for Verizon. Verizon will teach you about the equipment that you will be selling and using. You will also have hands on experience with the customers which allows you to make a rapport with the customers to ensure you make customers for life.
good,"Great Company - Great Training "
good,"Verizon is a great place to work as far as money and benefits goes, but they expect you to make it your life. I also felt like there was a lot of pressure to lie and cheat customers if you wanted to be successful."
good,"This is a fast paced, ever changing atmosphere that will challenge you as well as exasperate you at the same time.  I have great co-workers and an approachable supervisor."
good,"Lots of opportunities, great pay and benefits. Standard retail hours so schedule varies from week to week. PTO and paid sick days"
good,"A typical day of work was dealing with a team of 15-20 direct reports and collaboraing with these members to deliver great service to Fortune 500 companies and government sectors. The day to day environment was very fast paced and the goal was deliver daily with less than needed. Experience and team work is required. The ability to deal with people and be creative is essential.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the companies weal spots all while trying to maintain the powerhouse image that comes with being employed with Verizon. You will find yourself wearing many hats as the term doing more with less is very applicable.  All in all, this is a great company to be employed under."
good,Typical day included spending time answering customer phone calls and escalating above when needed. The hardest part of the job was answering phone calls all day.

I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Was responsible for all store operation and sales. Was micro managed a bit too much. Was able to build lasting relationships with customers.
good,"8 hour shifts"
good,I enjoyed my time very much with Verizon.  I was a proven leader that showed results in obtaining service excellence for the customer.  I was given the ability to work with little supervision and management had an open door policy to discuss way of improving processes and procedures.  I was able to work in many departments throughout my tenure and it is only because of the closing of the Chicago billing department that I left.
good,It's a fun place to work because of the people you get to meet on a every day basis. you get to sale phone and help people with there phone porblems
good,great job gave me lots of valuable experience. enjoyed my time there. no complaints good salary also. needs more opportunity for advancement though.
good,Verizon has great assets and some great people. The Sr management is stuck in the old Telco world and can't make a decision to move forward leveraging their assets.
good,Everyday offers something new to learn.  Able to learn how a call center actually works behind the scene.  Change occurs quickly in the call center world you must be able to adapt quickly.
good,"This is a high paced company where performance is highly valued and your numbers will determine your future. If you don't perform, you may not have a long career."
good,great training. fast paced sales based environment. Coworkers are easy to work with & willing to help if you have questions.
good,I was a technician for several years and never had a major problem. Great place to work and to retire from. Loved every minute of it.
good,"Great company to work for, but high stress. If you are okay with that, I would recommend Verizon. Very scheduled day. Task oriented day."
good,Commission based pay program. Can be very lean months if you are not meeting your quota. Any company as large as VZW is bound to have some red tape nightmares.
good,"This is overall a great place to work however the management  will leave you feeling like you are just a seat filler and are replaceable at any given time. They are not flexible and up with todays workforce, due to the fact they are not flexible in movement at all."
good,Working at the verizon was like a treat. I looked forward to goimng to work. Teamwork was very important. Mhy co-workers didnt mind stepping in and helping out others when they were behind on their work. I would definetly reccomend this workplace to a friend.
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is providing education to customers to explain their bill in detail so they would understand what they are being charged for.
good,"On a typical day, I sold wireless service and attended to customer needs. I learned that customer service can sometimes be challenging. My management was decent. My co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell during the recession. The most enjoyable part was interacting with people."
good,"Projet SAP et formation du staff au logiciel SAP"
good,Having a good experience working and gaining more knowledge and also providing ample amount of service to the clients. Having a enjoyable part of the career.

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Nice company, great location, easy parking! Employees are provided with free work laptop and  cell phone (hey its a wireless company)!!"
good,"It was a decent store, had a lot of good customers come in, had the chance to learn how to work and operate all cellphones and tabs."
good,"Can be very rewarding but very stressful, great coworkers excellent benefits with a strong union. I disliked having to negotiate a new contract every three years."
good,"I was in the Corporate and National Account segment of the company, management was supportive. Co-workers were a cohesive team to work with and the most enjoyable part of the job. Compensation became capped and not in alignment with similar companies in the marketplace. This was a challenging part of the job."
good,Retail hours are just that.. retail hours.. There is no set schedule and changes each week.  This is difficult if you have young children.  Many people stay because of the benefits where are amazing.  Pay is really good but be prepared to give for that pay.  The hardest part is doing things that you might not think is right or the proper way to sell.. but it is expected from all levels within the company.  Failure to do this will stop your upward movement.
good,"A typical day at work involves many different types of interactions with many different types of customers. Building connections with customers is one of the most important skills that I have learned at Verizon Wireless and I will use the skills that I have learned to further my career. Management at Verizon Wireless is very behavior and results oriented, with constant pressure to improve sales behaviors to drive sales metrics."
good,verizon is a good company and they really try to teach you more than just about your job duties but more of where the company is trying to go towards the future

good,"Good workplace. Good mix of young and old. Promotes healthy lifestyle. Good work-life balance. If you are interested in new technology and marketing, then it's a good place to grow."
good,"The job is your typical call center job, great benefits, management was just okay. The training is pretty good but there is a lot you need to learn for the job. Overall if you like working in a call center it was a  good job."
good,"The company is a great company to work for. As a manager, there are few opportunities for growth. Since customer service is a cost to the company, so our focus is cutting cost."
good,The typical day at work was assisting customers with purchasing and fixing their products. I learned to work well and assist customers as well as fix their products. Management were understandable. My co-workers work easy to work and communicate with. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the customer was always satisfied with their product. The most enjoyable part of the job was working to make sure that customers' issues were handled.
good,One of the great things about Verizon is that change is always happening. I have been with the company for over 13 years and I have yet to be bored.

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."

Making sure that they are happy with their devices. Making appts. with device specialist if necessay.  Conduct workshops with customers on their new device purchases.  Help customers with trouble shooting issues on Android, and Apple phones and tablets, ans MS phones."
good,A typical day at work consists of 10 key data enty and researching bill payments. My co-workers were very nice and easy to get along with.
good,"I enjoyed being face to face with customers and helping them with their individual needs. However we were commissioned sales people and some problems could pull us off of the floor for hours on end. Quotas (minimum production) on a monthly basis have more than doubled in the last year causing hours on the floor to increase from necessity and still end up with half the pay. I addition to that i have had 5 weekends off in 3 years including vacations. A work life balance is preached there but it is virtually impossible to attain. On any given week I could close 3 or 4 times. That means getting out of the office sometimes as late as 10PM. The company did stay on the cutting edge of cellular technology and this was a fact we all took a great amount of pride in. It was necessary to check inventory daily and any new incentives or promotions that may have come out the night before. Despite the feeling of an extreme uphill climb and virtually no support from store management, it was a nice place to work. I enjoyed what I did and always placed among the top in the District and many times among the top in the state."
good,I worked at different levels and gained valuable experience. Worked with a great team of professionals and I would definitely recommend this company to anyone.

good,Great people for a large company. People have the sense of caring about what they do within their departments. Overall a good company to work. I was proud to be an employee for such a diverse company.
good,My position was between Customer Service and Financial Services.  If our customers went over on their Data or Roaming we would contact them trying to help them change their account to lessen the charges.
good,"Every day was a team effort, i enjoyed working with everyone. There was something to learn everyday. The hardest part of the job was navigating bureaucracy."
good,"productive and nice place to work, in house gym and cafeteria facilities, nice co-worker worked on Java J2EE spring hibernate jdbc technologies."
good,good environment but it depends on the location and manager. Pay can be sporadic at times due to variety in foot traffic. (ie. Busy during holidays)
good,"Create and implement monthly incentives, Responsible for new member recruitment and active member participation, Track and send monthly statistics, Manage monthly cafe events, Perform Fitness Assessments, Create individualized fitness programs based on assessments, Conduct 1 on 1 and group training classes, Oversee safety of members, Coordinate lunch seminars for building employees."

I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is such a great place to evolve and grow. It is never boring and every week there is something new to learn. Such a great place to better your resume and learn more about the products that are out there in our culture. You will learn about how the cell phone industry works and how it benefits your customers in their daily life. The hardest part of the job was the metrics that were set monthly but if you did your job and came in with the right attitude, you wouldn't have a problem. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely working with the customers and finding solutions for them and getting them the correct product/solution that best suited each of their individual needs"
good,It's a nice place to work and corporate environment is very good
good,"great diversity, training, challenging calls.  opportunity to grow within the company, plenty of overtime available, nice benefits."

good,"working with costumers on daily basis "
good,Managed the installation of DAS systems in various buildings in NJ.
good,I was able to walk away with a vast amount of learning.  Job Culture was pretty good.  Management left something to be desired.
good,"This job was a door to door sales commission job. I would go to the office from 10am-12pm then start heading to the ""field"" to work. Then at 8pm I would head to the office and do a daily wrap-up with my manager. I would also make sure that those who worked under me were on the right track. The hardest part about this job is that it is not a stable job. It is strictly commission based, and I need a stable income. The most enjoyable part of this job is teaching others how to do better and working with others out in the field."
good,"Helping customer and co-workers accomplish their goals and help the business grow."
good,"customer service"
good,"Working in an environment with sales quotas is always a challenge, but when you work for an indirect Verizon branch the challenges intensify. Location is the key."
good,"I was able to work with wonderful people, I would go into work very motivated to be there we would have a schedule in what is needed to be done that day. A list would be printed out in what customers we had and what customers had our product and see in what areas that did not have Verizon and see if we can try to offer the product we had to see if the customer would be interested to purchase."
good,"good place to work and learn"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,Overall good place to work. Lack some IT resources in various departments/application teams. Managers are very supportive and great work/life balance along with compensation package.
good,"Verizon has outstanding benefits and 401K for their employees.  I have learned through training a multitude of information on new telecommunication products and services.  Being detail-oriented and a multitasker is a must in the industry.  Your colleagues work with you to aid in any complex billing or order implementation.  My coworkers help me to smile and laugh throughout the day, this makes the day even more pleasurable.  The most enjoyable part of my job is investigating and resolving the customer's bill problem or order implementation request from cradle to grave.  I get satisfaction knowing that I provided a resolution and was able to turn the customer's frown upside down."
good,"Overall, employees desire to make change but resources, IT automation/development costs, lack of expense & network capital hindered the companies ability to move ideas forward.  Acquisition of various companies has diluted proper focus.   Verizon is accommodating to life events and family responsibilities.  Verizon offers very good benefits.   However, working periodically during vacation or personal time off has become normal."
good,Good work life balance and lot's of training available with chances to grow
good,"Never had more fun at a job. It's hard work but if you're willing to work, Verizon is a great place to work."
good,I love everything this company provides. So much potential with the services that are offered to clients.
good,"As a COEI technician, I would receive a spec from engineering to do an installation (or removal, modification etc). Often times I would do a pre-start walkthru to familiarize and/or correct different aspects of the job. I would then write a MOP detailing the work items and submit it for approval. Once approved, material would be delivered and staged in an approved location. Next I would inventory the material, and make any requests for specialty tools that might be required. Work was performed individually or in teams, depending on the particular requirements of each job. Some jobs take weeks to complete, others only hours or days. As part of job completion, I would power, test, and turn-up, stencil and bar code as required. End of job paperwork and a final walkthru and then on to the next job."
good,Verizon is a company with many great career opportunities. The work culture is creative and highly energized.

If you are fast as well as good at sales you can make good money. The down side is that if you are looking for advancement, it won't matter what your education level is or even how compotent you are at manegerial type work. Above all, you must be a poletition to get promoted. Good luck, and don't forget to get the right people to like you."

It is a very diverse workplace, and you remained busy. The hardest part of the job were the commitments you made everyday, and the stress that came along with it. The benefits were great."
good,"There is no company that can compete with Verizon Wireless for quality fo work life balance.  Their flexibility and accommodations for working parents is unparalleled.  The work is not as challenging or satisfying because the staffing more than covers the need and for those of us looking for a sense of accomplishment on a regular basis, Verizon Wireless is a hard place to work.   Compensation is lower than market but the benefits are extraordinary and make ""Total Rewards"" about 125% of salary (100% match on 401K and steep wireless and cable / internet employee discounts."

good,"A dream company for most, if you are hired full time and regular. The benefits are great and they seem to be endless. But you have to be a full time regular employee to reap the benefits. Temporary employees do get perks but in an uncertain economy without full benefits stress can creep up on you very quickly."
good,"A typical day consists of being ready at the assigned start time for calls that come in fast and furious, broken up by one 15 minute break in the morning, a half hour lunch and one 15 minute break in the afternoon. Occasionally, consultants are allowed to be closed to incoming calls for off line work or, rarely, for group training. Calls are monitored by supervisors for consultant ""coaching"" purposes, but that just adds to the stress of trying to resolve customer issues since coaching reviews are generally negative. Interaction with co-workers is only possible during breaks and lunch. However, co-workers often get together to enjoy activities outside the office and have established lifelong friendships. The best part of the job is the union negotiated wages, health, dental, and vision benefits, 401K, paid holidays, floating days off, and increasing number of vacation weeks based on time in service. The company rewards the attaining of sales goals with points toward merchandise or trips. Longevity of service in increments of five years is also rewarded with merchandise. If it weren't for the generous early retirement package, I may have left there in an ambulance...for the second time."

There were already DMs in all our markets and a vice president of sales in place, none of who were moving or advancing anytime soon due to the fact it was a indirect agent company and we only had 20 stores with no more opening anytime soon.

My co-workers were fine, I just had to learn how to be a co-worker to them! The hardest part of the job must have been working a full day with no sales at the end of the day.

Management is always available to assist when needed, and the agents around can also assist as well.

The most enjoyabele part of the job is all the new information you will learn from customers and from the job its self."

good,Customer service is first and foremost through both speaking directly to your customer base as well as providing the best trained staff. Verizon Wireless is a team focused organization that relys on everyone working together to provide the best solution at all times.
good,"I was a customer service representative, I would assist customers with their bills and accounts. I learned about the cell phone industry.  The management was very helpful.  My co-workers were okay, the hardest part of the job was the different shifts they would give you weekly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was free phone service."

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon Wireless was a great job even though advancement was difficult no matter how great your sales numbers were. There are a lot of managers all with different management skills and approaches. You would get information delivered to you in a number of different ways from all the different managers which made doing your job more difficult. You would get praised by some and reprimanded by others for doing your job depending on their approach to management. There was no single way to do something which made pleasing everyone very difficult. I would say that was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers get the services and products they needed at the best prices and teaching them how to use them both to their full potential and having them come back to thank you and refer business to you was very rewarding. A typical day at work would include setting the store displays up according to plan-o-grams, taking inventory of products, making sure all banking and deposits from the day before were done properly, Then assisting customers either face to face, or over the phone with their phone, service, or accessory needs. Finding out what the customers basic day was like, then using that information to get them the correct device, accessories and plan to make sure they got the most out of their device with best service plan, and helping to simplify a customer's day by teaching them how to utilizing the correct applications that were best for them. You would also have to answer billing questions, take payments, and do your best to"
good,Good Workplace
good,"A typical day would be logging into my systems, start by greeting and assisting each individual customer with their needs and concerns. I help customers maintain their cell phone service by taking payments, and if needed setting up payment arrangements to pay bill at a later date. Some customers apply for new service with our company also. I would get the customers personal information and input it into the system, at the point of approval I would advise the customer of serveral different plans and promotions that we offer. You learn about different people daily and different circumstances they go through to cause them to become behind on their bills. By working for this company I have learned how to mutltask with a average handle time on every call while providing excellent customer service to each and every customer. I have learned knowlege of serveral computer systems and attend serveral training classes to maintain and learn more about the industry. The management staff is there to help and assist you if you would ever need information about a certain issues. My co-wokers are in cubicles right beside me and we interact with one another serveral times during the day. The hardest part would be having to advise a customer that they are not approved for service based on credit ratings. At that point we can turn it around with a positive and offer other service for the customer such as pre-pay service or providing a co-signer. That tends to make the customer happy that they I provided them with other options to get service. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I"

good,"Fast paced environment where an eye on detail is very important. I follow a grid that tells me when and where I need to be. It changes rapidly and staying focus is very important. I take incoming reservation calls. I set up conference calls for parities from 3 to over a thousand. I record audio calls ,as well as, upload and record net livemeetings. Use excel to send participant lists. Work closely with our unattended instant meeting customers and troubleshoot problems as they arise. Answer incoming callers rapidly to get them into their calls as soon as possible. Verbal speaking skills are very important because many of our customers require special scripting or ask for special introductions for the speaker on their call. We need to chat on Instant messaging constantly to our scheduling department or to other co workers when their a change to a call our schedule, or in need of a supervisor."
good,"Always important work to do, just a matter of how far down the list I could get each day."

good,"This was a fun company to work for. It can get stressful, but it is balanced by some downtime as well. There were a lot of trainings for new products or changes to existing products. Management was always available to help you out if needed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a customer's account that had no prior documentation of an issue they had called on previously. The most enjoyable part of the job was bonus time because thats where you saw your hard work really pay off."

good,Working daily to meet and pass sales quota goals providing great customer service to customers and placing them on the correct plans of service.
good,"Call center invironment. Rows of desks separated by plastic dividers. Slightly mentally discomforting. Most managers really great, some not so much (like most places). Learned a great deal of customer service/sales skills, and had great co-workers. The company tries real hard to make it a pleasant working enviroment with a great cluture. The job itself is a bit daunting to handle high volume calls, with a lot of escalations."
good,"My typical day includes training clients, writing, researching, reviewing and upgrading reference guides and course curricula.

good,"Loved working for this company. Was my first real foray into the wireless industry, and i thrived. Goals were realistic, and I excelled."
good,"I loved working at Verizon for 14 years (1 year as a temp and then perm). My peers were very professional and knowledgeable. I got to learn Peoplesoft, Payroll, and how to assist 40 engineers with travel, timekeeping, and supplies. I had many side projects too, like running the Verizon art gallery in the Headquarters building, handling the building moves, and PC inventory replacements. My two managers were so encouraging and supportive when I decided to go back to college and get my degree, which really helped me to reach my goals. It was a nice family environment."

good,"Every day was different, could be doing hardware, software, or network repair, or installs. I learned how to find the information I needed to repair various types of equipment. I saw or spoke with my supervisor about once a week. The people I worked with were best. The hardest part of the job was the workload, out of five IT techs in 2002, I was the last one when I left in 2010. The most enjoyable part of my job was the freedom to organize my work day."
good,Verizon Information Resources provided small to medium sized businesses a way to connect buyers and sellers
good,"Dealt with customers and their billing concerns, questions and phone troubleshooting. Great coworkers and better management. A real team aspect"
good,"I worked as a Greeter at Verizon, a job they have now outsourced to an iPad and a store manager. I technically worked for a temp agency that I was sent to by Verizon, not Verizon itself. I basically stood for eight hours a day in the same spot saying hello to people and taking their names down to be in line to be helped by a store associate. I did not receive any of the benefits the actual Verizon Wireless employees got, such as a free phone as well as 50 percent off of their personal phone bills, as well as other health benefits. A few of the managers were nice to us greeters because they had been greeters before, but the ones who started as sales associates completely ignored us on a daily basis, or treated us like involets. I was taught at the end of my stay there how to do some technical things with phones in the hopes that I would be able to get a job with them or another location as a customer care technician, but the only thing available in all of Massachusetts at the time was in Cambridge, too far for me to travel. Overall, I realized I needed to be more fit than I was for the amount of standing I did all day, I was yelled at by management for talking to customers, or I was looked at funny by customers because I was not allowed to speak to them about their issues."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,"80+ incoming calls per day w/inquires on billing, service and equipment. I've learned how to be tactful and show empathy when appropriate. My co-workers depended on my knowledge of the buisness and experience in retention when dealing w/potential clients. The hardest part of the job would have been the day I left. The most enjoyable part of the job was that no 2 days were the same."
good,"Load/ unload postal trucks, stock machine, store/ count inventory"
good,"If your not selling you don't make money. Try and do as much outside sales as you can. Hardest part is going into work and not making money after being there for 8 hours. There are good days that balance things out but if you want to be garunteed some type of salary this job is not for you. There is a lot of potential if your a ""go-getter"" and get a lot of sales outside the office though."
good,"The healthcare and salary are great, but it is an overly political place to work."
good,It was fun but working for some managers was not that great not all the managers are the same.
good,A day at work would include paying invoices that were due for payment by checking our rates to the vendors and if any discrepencies either dispute or accrual.
good,"Verizon Wireless Corp. only owns 20% of it's stores, there are several privately owned companies; when considering working with Verizon make sure you know who owns the store you are considering working for.

I was able to learn how to handle and resolve problems for customers with billing or credits issues. I had good immediate supervisors that guided and supported me. I was able to make a good team to work with and build long lasting friends. The hardest part of the job was to get a call from an elderly person that was not able to install or understand their bill and the most enjoyable part was to get an appreciation call to thank my fast and courteous resolution to a problem."
good,"I worked for UUNet/WorldCom/MCI/Verizon Business for 8 years. I believe the company has changed quite a bit since I was there last, so my review isn't going to be terribly relevant."

good,Fast Paced and competitive
good,"I was very excited to get this job and I loved the excitement of everyone about its products.

good,"Verizon was a wonderful company to work for. The benefits were outstanding. I have met many people and formed lasting friendships with Management and co-workers. A typical day at work consisted of taking attendance for the office and the field and reporting to management. I would answer phones and record appointments in the system.

good,"The present company I have worked for has really taken advantage of me, there moving me around alot. There making it really hard for me to build my customer base. New management has come in and she has a very weird way of doing thing. CO-workers are great we all get along. Hardest part of my job would be building a new customer base.
