rating,review
bad,It was absolutely terrible. So many inconsistencies and angry upset customers. Very very unorganized and poorly managed company. There was no communication with the company itself and the business who partake in the coupon systems.
bad,"I would never, for any amount of money ever go back to this company. Senior employees got away with everything. Management was almost afraid to reprimand. It was a complete joke."
bad,"This place is stressful, without any growth guarantee and a lack of management. Managers bully their team members into lying to clients to obtain and meet goals. The company sees no problem is underpaying their employees while expecting them to work to the point of burn out. It is a revolving door with no loyalty to its employees. Employees are made to feel replaceable with many looking for other opportunities shortly after beginning with the company."
bad,"Groupon started out as a great company.  It cared about the city, it cared about its employees, it cared about its customers.  Now?  It's a shell of what it used to be.  It's money hungry, creatively stifled, and hemorrhaging talent and funds like nobodies business.  I expect Groupon to be the next Enron."
bad,"poor communication, lay-offs are rampent, managers are terrible, upper management does whatever they want no matter who/what it effects, no clue how to run a business"
bad,a lot of immature manager and still trying to figure out the opportunity and what it all Intel. Not a lot of clear direction or incentive to thrive with the company. Pay plans was changed three time in my tenure with the company.
bad,"It was great in the beginning then it all went south.  Poor work life balance, poor management.  Lots of internal politics."
bad,The worst organization I have ever worked at . The management is so careless and no skills in running a business and it shows in their market results clearly.
bad,I have handful of experience in the field of hr.  I've done two internships during my academic peried where I got good professional exposure
bad,"When I joined Groupon I had a thought of what it would be, based on coming from a technology company like itelligence.  Groupon surprised me in many areas.  My boss was 5 years younger than me, and was not fully experienced to fully manage a large market like Houston.  Shortly after joining the Houston team, the team was dissolved and I lost my position.  The average age at Groupon was 23, and the processes in place showed that dramatically.  I do value my time at Groupon as it showed me what kind of organization that I did not want to be a part of."
bad,"They won't take even a second to stab you in the back. Extremely unprofessional, fear based leadership model. Yet that behavior is rewarded with promotions instead of censure. The worst place I've ever worked at."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Groupon does a great job at having a training program that feels like college all over again, they do this to hide the fact that once you get out of it there is little job security, no money to be made, and you are constantly micromanaged. You will get a few emails a day from your boss who sits right next to you to do better, then a couple G-chats asking if you can commit to doing better, then finally a meeting or two where you will be asked to do more."
bad,"Certain teams might have decent culture but in the team that I have worked it was school like atmosphere with micro management, unnecessary guidelines and overall no pipeline of work."
bad,They laid us off when they partnered with grubhub. The supervisors were power-high and inefficient. Working remotely was cool but the work was daunting. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone mainly because the position no longer exists.
bad,"Chacun s’ignore, que se soit les managers ou les collègues. Tout le monde se rejette la balle et surtout les managers. J'ai jamais vue une société avec autant d'arrêt maladie. Ça en dit long."
bad,"Constant changes in performance metrics, clueless ""managers,"" little  tier 2 support. It's like someone went to a dorm and hired everyone there for their first big boy job. There are some good people here but they are highly outnumbered by the loud morons. The most unprofessional workplace I have ever seen."
bad,Over staffed and poorly managed. When they are busy you get your hours in. When they slow down they want to often send you home. Lucky to get 32 hours in .
bad,"Leadership for GSO  supporting  team is a revolving door.  Latest Management is unprofessional, bias and untrustworthy.  Very political"
bad,"Simply put...This place is about to be shut down... extremely disorganized, many times a day, orders and entire pallets of product could not be located"
bad,Good luck getting promoted if your not best friends with your manager.  They seem to think you need 5 years of experience before your ready for a management role.
bad,"If you enjoy working in an environment of stress and mismanagement, then this is the place for you."
bad,"The outside sales position for Groupon is a very entry level type role."
bad,job is boring managers care only about them selves groupon does not care about there employees. the only time your able to get 40 hours is during peak season. there health benifits are extremely expensive. it sucks working there
bad,"Mucho estrés, envío de trabajo a ultima hora, desorganización"
bad,"Metas impossíveis, cobranças imediatas e estabilidade zero"
bad,"typical day: 2-4 meetings with business partners, cold calling, emailing and preparing proposals. hunting for new leads and accounts. reviewing deals previews and corrections mistakes and changes. Handling after sales payments. Creating new deal themes and ideas."
bad,"Groupon is a company that moves very fast. Changes are a constant in the sales organization. That change can be motivating to some, however over the last year those changes have been short sighted. Lot's of the changes made have not taken into account the businesses we work with or how certain changes will make the sales side of Groupon more difficult. From a sales rep's eyes Groupon is changing so businesses have less control over their campaign on Groupon's platform and Groupon is asking for more money from the businesses to run these campaigns. These two factors impact sales reps directly and ultimately lower Groupon's ability to bring new and exciting businesses to their subscribers."
bad,Management has NO CLUE what they are doing. No vision. No idea. No one knows what one department is doing. Our entire department got laid off one day with no warning. Then I found out this is Groupon's M.O. and they do this all the time. BE WARNED!
bad,Would advise against working working here for a long period of time.  On the positive the culture can be fun and opportunities to move around.  On the downside it can be very hard to get promoted and hard to believe in direction the company is going
bad,"Writing this from my desk, I really wish I never came here. Unless you enjoy cold calling really terrible, really rude businesses and attempting to sell them a broken product that the rest of the business industry doesn't see going anywhere, go work at Starbucks. With the $32,500 pay they offer, you'd probably make more there anyway."
bad,"Condiciones económicas buenisimas : tickets restaurant y  altas comisiones. "
bad,They don't seem to have a strategy for the fact that their main business model is failing. Engineering is being sent overseas and corporate politics are wreaking havoc on established teams.
bad,"Te despiden asi como asi, fui victima de racismo por parte de una supervisora o team lider como llaman ellos. Obviamente le cai mal entonces habian insultos y ""bromas"" veladas que uno no tiene como comprobar para interponer una denuncia. Al fin y al cabo todos ahi trabajan con miedo tensos con miedo de ser el proximo a ser hechado todo detras de una nube de paz y buena camaraderia, pero eso una nube..la gente finge no es feliz ahi."
bad,painfully lacking in direction.  very young staff with little/no experience.  Zero management direction.   Strategic planning typically looks out only 2 weeks.
bad,"You have to be totally self motivated here. There is no team, mangers support, help from anyone,very little and poor communication. It's dog eat dog and it's either sink or swim. No formal structure or career advancement. There is a laid back nice working atmosphere but that is more down to the people that work here. Rules are constantly changed and never in the favor of the staff."
bad,The management of groupon in chennai is working worst under kumarika. She gives promotions only to her friends. If she dislike a person she will send them out telling some invalid reasons.
bad,"Expériences professionnelles négative., licenciements abusifs, promesses de CDI à la signature du contrat non respectée."
bad,"Overall I enjoyed working for the company. However I was not happy at the fact they laid us off and knew months in advance they were going to do so. They should have informed us so that we could have made plans to look for new jobs. Instead they outsourced, had us training the agents and informed us in case of an overflow of business due to the upcoming hurricane."
bad,malisima ya que no fue justo que me dieran la baja sabiendo que iba  hacer padre podrian haberme pasado a cualquiera de los locales evaluarme al  menos y no despedirme sin causa
bad,"I worked as a contract fraud analyst during the holiday season. Brutal shift work. I went to hospital during the gig and nearly lost my ability to swallow. I received emails where it was cited that I had been less than 15 minutes late, and my pay would be adjusted accordingly. Changing shifts made a hash of work-life balance. Nothing enjoyable about the job, unless you love panic attacks. Contract ended abruptly via email from staffing agency on the only day off the contractors had in common."
bad,"Management turnover was happening fairly quickly while I was working there and this changed the whole work culture.   Lot's of issues around trust and people stepping on others trying to get ahead.   Very young, inexperienced crowd working there."
bad,"Very loud call center environment. Ping Pong, free soda, good location, good training. Very high turnover, fun job if you love cold calling, consultative type style of selling."
bad,They want everything from their employees and give nothing in return. They will tell you that you are working a 40 hour week but will send you home in 30 or if it is busy they will say you are working a 8 hour shift and tell you during the business day that they changed it to an 12 hour and if you refuse to stay they will point you. Even though they did not post OT the day before
bad,Groupon is a bit of a chaotic place to work. The company still hasnt figured out that its customer is the merchant so it continues to pander to ocnsumers and the company continues to lose merchant trust. There have been massive firings to keep media unaware of what should be massive layoffs. Sales goals increase EVERY month...comission is terrible and it keeps changing too. Pay cuts. Leads are bad...a machine tells you what to call on...you can't close what you know you can close and use rapport and personal relationship so being an outside rep is pointless. The company has not figured out and does not value outside reps and is looking to change that...but hasn't...you are constantly defending your job. They turn you into a inside rep inside your home. Goals are set by the finance dept and if someone gets fired...your goals go up because you now have your stuff plus theirs. 
bad,Um dia típico de trabalho é um dia em que você não consegue saber o que irá acontecer no dia seguinte quando chegar na empresa.
bad,"They Don't Care,they treat every one poorly.Lots of turn over,layoffs just sad place to work.They cut my hours from FT to PT and they acted as if they were doing me a favor.How is a person supposed to live on 20 hours per week (?)"
bad,"Company is devided in 4 lines of business (goods, Local, National and Travel). It can be a very different picture between each department, each team and who is your manager. Unfortunately the company only listens to managers and staff have no input when it comes to feedback besides a stupid survey that gets sent once a month."
bad,Groupon is a workplace where job tasks change constantly with the potential of being laid off. I learned more about the pace of corporate America along with the level of unorganised leadership in this particular company.
bad,The company's structure is different in comparison to working in a formal professional setting. A lot of work needs to be done at Groupon from the top to bottom as there is a lack of professionalism across the board (from Senior management to junior employees)
bad,"I love the idea of Groupon, but the company as a whole lacks accountable leadership at just about every level. Don't come here hoping to be in a great company. Most of the leadership is very young and lacks leadership, people skills and experience.There are people that care and work hard but you are on your own most of the time with very little support. They often will not back fill positions for months on end so they can look better on paper for quarterly reports. This causes huge support gaps for our customers and creates frustration among employees and customers. They have paid me late several times and still owe thousands in back compensation. Just a bad experience over-all unfortunately."
bad,Human capital is expendable... Very young and inexperienced management.
bad,Bij Groupon is het binnen halen wat je binnen kan halen en zo snel mogelijk.
bad,"It was great at first. I guess I started at a good time when the commission structure was awsome,  then it changed, and changed all within a 9 month span. It got to where I was making half of what i was when I started. Not to mention the ever changing progression structure. IDK. it's just hard selling a product that no one likes."
bad,"Strenuous training program, with no relevance to the product or services and entirely focused on the methodologies of selling the ""Groupon way"". "
bad,"Groupon used to be great, but those days are over. Compensation plans are CONSTANTLY changing, the only consistent aspect of the comp is that its always sub-par from any relative industry standards. The company has become a terrible place to work, employees are continually growing more and more disillusioned, management adheres to a activity metrics driven environment over results."
bad,una giornata tipica consisteva in 24 ore di lavoro.
bad,-Great learning experience.
bad,"Do not work here."
bad,I found the management at Groupon very poor. A lot of blame culture with not much support. Sometimes staff felt bullied and there was a lot of negative energy in the office. This lead to Groupon loosing a lot of good talent which is a real shame as the company has so much potential.
bad,It’s a temp company. Really didn’t have the job I really wanted to be at. They was never trusting when they said they had work. They would send me to a place that wasn’t the place the one they said
bad,"They are very unorganized cannot keep employees. had a lot of lost orders. Felt like I was not important to the company. This job included picking,packing and finding missing/aged orders."
bad,Ik heb met plezier bij Groupon gewerkt. Het was een sales functie
bad,"Every day is the same at Groupon. If you're from a traditional retail background, working here won't help you and you will find it hard to adjust. They say they want you to plan in advance like a normal retailer, but you will find yourself firefighting constantly to find deals to go live, often within the same week of finding them."
bad,"While the compensation was great for Groupon, everything else did not measure up.  As a manager they expected 60+ hours a week from you and they did not work with you when it came to your work/life balance."
bad,Non intendo lasciare dichiarazioni in merito. Qualora si presenterà l'occasione farò una recensione in privata sede.
bad,"L' organisation est un peu anarchique voir chaotique. A ses début la société et ses dirigeants ont été mal préparés suite au succès colossal de cette entreprise."
bad,"This place is great for people fresh out of college, but not a place to develop your career as a sales professional."
bad,"In the two years I worked at Groupon the salesforce was subjected to what seemed like an infinite supply of poorly considered changes."
bad,"Philosophie du groupe très attractive, mais peu de promotions, pas d'utilisation correctes des capacités de chacun."
bad,This place is falling apart fast. Management is making big bets that aren't paying off.
bad,For a long time Groupon was a great place to be and work.  The issue was we were a bit too cocky in our approach to the great flash deal land grab and really put a lot of businesses in a pickle by sending them too many people for far too little margin.  This hurt so many small businesses.  This ultimately led to the hardest thing to sell at Groupon was selling against Groupon itself and it's old ways of doing business.
bad,"A company that has structural problems, they provide a high amount of small perks like free soda, but have a culture where it is implied that things are so fun there's no need for more money or advancement."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Groupon in the environment it was when I left.  That was over 3 years ago though so I'm not sure if anything has changed.
bad,It is a good company but we cannot assure job security there. Anytime anybody can be thrown out of this company even if you have personal issues.Our hard work doesn't have any meaning there.
bad,You cannot job security with the current management. Zero percent Job security. Work culture is the only thing which every employee will enjoy. Other than that no use of the manager or the team lead. Growth is purely depends on politics.
bad,"Only those who have been with the company a long time are happy there. Special privileges given to those who are there many years which others can't benefit from."
bad,"Hiring rapidly, firing rapidly, downward spiral all the way around (culture, management, stress)"
bad,"A typical day at work would depend on the month. "
bad,"Could be better, could be worst. Where it can go keeps you around."
bad,"Management is horrific. Frequent organizational changes. Personal reviews and quarterly reviews basically non-existent. No opportunity for self improvement and managers will claim they support you and your career advancement, but actions will speak differently."
bad,"The company was not worker-oriented. The company I worked for owned by Groupon was sold with only 30 days notice. We were promised to be hired by the company merging with mine, but I and many of my coworkers' applications were never considered. This caused a lot of emotional and financial distress."
bad,"Groupon takes care of its management. The compensation structure is very top heavy. The staff, seniors, and other employees who work hard every day to ensure that profits are rolling in are not included in the bonus structure. Additionally, they are compensated well below the industry average."
bad,"A young company plagued with issues, bad business moves and poor leadership."
bad,Expectations are unfocused and non realistic. The main focus is ways to give the higher management praise over backing the work ethic/ policies set forth for the front-line and management teams. Each department is so detached that it is difficult to foresee longevity.
bad,"liever niet, het management, de arrogantie, het teveel belust zijn op geld ipv kijken naar de eigenlijke wensen van de klant. Veel veranderingen doorgevoerd die niet tegoede kwamen van het concept en de klant."
bad,"Talented engineers, great team spirit, projects are consumer focused, fast paced and make big impact. Great place for self starters. Work-life balance may not be great at times, projects can be stressful with changing priorities. The company's growth plan is not clear."
bad,"Upper and Middle management do not communicate clearly together, and management styles and metrics vary from manager to manager.  One manager tells you your doing great, then you get transfered to another manager who fires you with no prior warnings or notices about job performance.  This is not a joke, it happened to several members of my team.  There is no relief from calls at all, this place is SEVERELY understaffed for the volume they handle and you are expected to not only manage calls immediately after the previous, but also do projects and work emails simultaneously.  There is no clear direction here.  No one communicates.  If you have a computer issue with their provided computers, the policy says it does not count against you, but they count it against you and you basically work emails or projects for days while waiting for IT to maybe stumble across your ticket.  They have a great culture if people would embrace it though.  They pay in office staff more than at home employees who do the same job.  I had a friend in office who started a week after me who made $5.50 more than me hourly."
bad,"Deal of the day website"
bad,"The number one issue with Groupon is its inability to keep top talent.  Good people come all the time, but they don't stay long.  It's good for building up some experiences, but it isn't a long-term career type of environment."
bad,Trabalhei lá quando o mercado já estava instável. Muitos vendedores para poucos clientes.
bad,"The pace is comparable to a ""Kenyan sprint."", extremely chaotic at times and an environment of high uncertainty."
bad,I worked with Groupon for 10 months.
bad,"Groupon seems like a fun place to work, and they have tried very hard to maintain the image, but after working there for over 2 years, a lot of the luster wore off."
bad,"I was working at Groupon when they were going through significant growth and pressure. It was a mess: leadership was disorganized and they strategized poorly. This instability created an erratic work experience. I can only imagine the company (and market) has ""right-sized"", recognizing a more realistic competitive strategy and a humbler view of themselves. This sort of stability will, I'm sure, make the company a more attractive place to work."
bad,Groupon has a great environment in which to work. The sales positions are very hard to master and keep. Lots of turnover due to personal performance and company performance as well
bad,Job security at Groupon is unpredictable. Leadership team not properly used. Need more improvements in technology. Still manual processes are implemented. Biased system completely with no proper business goal.
bad,"Good work place. "
bad,"•	Generate and expand relationships with assigned customers and prospects to maximize revenue opportunities and minimize customer cancellations."
bad,"Groupon's environment is fantastic. You work with great people. The work life balance is great. They're flexible. It's relaxed. However, it's the only thing that keeps you there - people & comfortability. They now require that you make 35 calls a day which is nothing, but it's how they compare you. They quota you based on points which have 0 compatibility to the amount of profit you make for the company or how good the business is. It's a completely unknown number. They change their goals, mission, outlook, and commission every 2-3 quarters based upon Wall Street. It's senior leadership, specifically on the sales side, is incredibly poor and short sighted. Very good people, but they have no idea how to run a sales force. They reward behavior that shouldn't be rewarded. Most importantly maybe, they have zero clue on long-term outlook. For example, if an employee leaves there is no procedure on accounts, etc. They make decisions without knowing how to manage the rippling effects. Very, very poorly run. If you're a kid out of college go for it. However, they don't know how to develop sales talent/skills, nor retain it."
bad,"Groupon is currently and swiftly being reduced to framework/infrastructure teams in the US, and all new development outsourced to Bangalore. "
bad,call center life is not the life for an educated person.  I feel underutilized and therefore am looking to relocated to a new employer asap.  I know I am more valuable than what I am able to show due to the remedial position I currently hold.
bad,"The job wasn't challenging and was told to ""JUST TO YOUR JOB"" when asked if I could take on more tasks.  Job opportunity for job advancement what so ever."
bad,"Great people but upper management can be frustrating, office is always stocked with snacks and drinks. Systems and processes are very manual."
bad,"Groupon likes to hire fresh college students that are not aware of what they should be paid for the amount of work for which they are held accountable.  Certain VP's have said in large meetings, ""Your chair is more valuable than you are"" and ""I don't care if you like the product, if you're not selling it we don't need you""."
bad,"The positives are superficial (free drinks, relaxed dress code, etc) and overall there is not a lot of room to advance or build a career unless you are interested in dedicating your life to sales."
bad,"Get ready for a VERY fast paced work place. People are young which is great but it's like being in High School again. Sink or Swim mentality and they work you so hard that by the end of it all, you are emotionally drained."
bad,Manager's fair. Dealt with some upset customers but always able to resolve. A pretty good job until all of us remote employees were permanently laid off with out notice.
bad,"From the outside, one would think of Groupon as a very good company. However, once you start working there you'll realize how much management doesn't care about it's people. They feel that you can easily be replaced. You never truly feel comfortable there because they will find a way to get rid of you. It's only a matter of time. Keep your resume active because your gonna need it sooner than later. They will fire you. it's simply a matter of when."
bad,"I have learned so many good things like team work,how to handle work load.Very supportive employees.Co-workers are always helpful."
bad,"Warehouse Associate at Groupon. "
bad,"Enjoyed working here when I first started a year ago, since then there has been a lot of changes, stock going down, departments being eliminated and Groupon Now! dissolving. They hire people who are inexperienced to do managing positions. Co workers are awesome, very young environment. Free soda, coffee, tea etc in cafeteria."
bad,"Empresa joven, divertida, dinámica y flexible. Hacía falta solo un poco de estructura y cultura organizacional para evitar la dispersión de los equipos."
good,Not much room for advancement but over all ok work place. Liked the employees didnt cafe much for management team. Hard work ok pay hard to get noticed
good,Beware this company will lay you off out of the blue. No warning at all.Just BAM...no job.. Pay is decent if you dont have rent and bills. best thing there are the coworkers
good,"I enjoy woking here and the people are nice.  Welcoming.  It's very fast-paced which is fine but I was thrown in.  Learned things fast, on my own and now would like some more challenges.  :)"
good,"new company teething problems"
good,"Une énorme opportunité de carrière de pouvoir arriver dans une startup à l'évolution aussi fulgurante et avec tout à faire... Un vrai défi technique, d'énormes contraintes de charge, des besoins infinis... Une ambiance de fou, un vivier de jeunes talents..."
good,"Dealing with various business I have learnt what type of marketing works for them and what doesn't"
good,I enjoy the flexibility in the work place and most of the people are enjoyable to work with
good,"If you needed to switch to more morning shifts it was merely impossible, lunches were planned for you in time slots, had to make them quick. Hard to balance life if you're a single mom. Really had hoped I would have been able to stay with the company. It was seasonal but permanent jobs were being offered but the flexibility wasnt there."
good,"easy job, but if you miss a few days might be hard to meet your target.  great entry level position for someone just getting into the sales field or out of college."
good,This has been a great place to work for with wonderful and caring people.  I learned a whole new operation system on my won.  People were helpful when they could be.
good,"Work hours are long and unorganized. Good potential opportunity, but overall structure is not sustainable. Very competitive work environment and not much team cooperation."
good,"There is no career growth, and the company lost sight of its mission and values"
good,"Communicating with internal employees and suppliers. Promotion is not done from knowledge of the job. Workplace culture is okay. Hardest part of the job is the no compensation, but expected to take a bigger workload. Most enjoyable is working on the computer all day. Very low phone contact."
good,"Although Groupon Customer Service has been a apart of my life for the last 2 1/2 years, I really enjoyed working in the Getaways department. A typical day at work would consist of me being a liaison between the customers and hotel management to resolve reservation issues."
good,"fun place to work but lacks in comp and advancement "
good,I'd only suggest working for this company if you're looking for a quick pay. The energy is good in the start but it spirals down slowly and makes you reconsider working. I enjoyed working here in the beginning but the constant changes were unremorseful. The tactics were unrealistic to relay to the customers.
good,"If you are an engineer or upper management or an HR representative, job security and pay grade is good, life is great, for anyone else, life sucks."
good,If you don't know anything about e-commerce this is a good company to learn e-commerce.  They are still trying to figure out company culture and direction.
good,"I've been working at Groupon for the past two years in Outside Sales."
good,Groupon is a great company with a very rich & fun culture. Some of the toughest parts about the job involve the lack of potential advancement and little pay.
good,"Company is struggling in general, makes it hard to achieve sales goals.  100% remote, little support.  Good base salary."
good,Most of the Sales Managers haven't done a sales role before!
good,"This company is fantastic at sales training. However, you will want to move on after a year or two."
good,"Empresa que exige muita flexibilidade e senso de urgência, acompanhei diariamente a rotina da equipe comercial, auxiliando nas atividades internas e externas. Obtive um ótimo relacionamento interpessoal, funcionários jovens e descolados. A parte mais difícil do trabalho, é que não existe meritocracia. A parte mais agradável é que a empresa é muito dinâmica."
good,Hiring decisions are based on popularity. Not skills or experience.
good,There are def. favorites and not everyone gets the same growth and learning opportunities. There are also a lot of people that do not work / while others have to work twice as hard to make up for that. Management and others do not want to create conflict so they try to avoid issues instead of streamlining or trying to help people which would help teams and grow the business.
good,Groupon's main problem is that they do not value their employees. They said many times that everyone is replaceable. VP's and Executive team are detached from reality and don't really understand the day to day.
good,"Experiencia interessante para profissionais em início de carreira, devido a sua cultura e forma de interação com os profissionais. Quem esta interessado aprende muito, pois há mudanças rápidas e é preciso muito dinamismo e jogo de cintura para garantir os resultados."
good,"Lead sales and operations for the Central and Southeast regions.  10 Managers and 145 sales reps."
good,"Um ótimo ambiente, porém com política salarial muito baixa e benefícios sem revisão a anos. Mas com pessoas incríveis que acabam valendo por tudo."
good,People change jobs almost quarterly. High Stress put on by management to hit high growth expectations.
good,"Es un lugar bastante agradable en donde trabajo con un buen sueldo, es el área de Soporte atención a clientes de hispanoamerica."
good,I loved it until they had the women take over and she was literally doing cartwheels in the office because she was a cheerleader in college and thought that would motivate us to sell. Was annoying.
good,"Company has a good call center overall, I worked remotely and I know there is a difference in experience versus working in the actual call center.  The call center was filled with a diverse group of dedicated workers who all wanted to legitimately assist people."
good,"Era uma ótima empresa quando da minha entrada, porém com o tempo foi perdendo a cultura e o ambiente agradável. Muitas decisões precipitadas e que foram culminando com a crise em que entrou até que a matriz (EUA) resolveu que deveria ser vendida a operação brasileira."
good,I felt Groupon was a bit unprofessional and relied heavily on management decisions without employee imput. There was also a great deal of micromanaging at the company that made working difficult there.
good,You had limited support from managers.  We had daily morning meetings which we just spoke about our daily goals.  Also monthly meetings in office.  Other then that we didn't see or speak to our mangers.  Very isolated.
good,Repetitive daily tasks. Constantly encountering the same issues and concerns as if it were Ground Hog's day. Data is challenging to work with. Not a friendly environment.
good,"nice place to work ; they never had the right tools to work with like no boxes to pack the merchandise are you stand on your feet 12 hours and sometime you work 7 days straight over work pro the people was nice to everyone and for your hard work you got nice gift,"
good,"Des journées bien chargées avec beaucoup de stress car les objectifs à atteindre sont élevés. Peu d'opportunités d'évolution.  L'aspect le plus difficile était la gestion du temps, le plus agréable étant l'ambiance qui règne au sein de l'équipe."
good,"This company has their favorites and promotes the wrong people who are not fit. "
good,"Groupon has really diversified their business after a rough IPO launch. Tons of young employees, so you can understand why the operating profit was an issue for years until the recent management decided to find other avenues for revenue. Groupon has the ability to become a powerful force in customer acquisition, as well as fantastic consumer destination, but they are definitely focused on the numbers after a dismal start on the market. With that said, the business is on the upswing."
good,Needs to work on safety and security. Much to lean in the warehouse. The management are new and need to work on there job culture.
good,"Was a fantastic company to work for with great vision and direction from the Management."
good,- very good training
good,"Typical day: edit copy and write a few pieces. Usually hold/participate in meetings concerning copy style, brand KPIs and weekly objectives."
good,"Initially the office was exciting, everyone around drank the kool aid and told you how big the company was. But, if you sat back and looked at the management you wouldn't believe it any longer. It was a ""fun"" place but not somewhere to invest your time"
good,We work in night shifts and assisting the customers. At the start we use to have good work life style but later on it keep on diminishing with the management style.
good,"Great company, great people to work with, but again, the same issues all tech companies tend to face - work/life balance is pretty minimal, all of our focus is on work, not life."
good,"This is a fun company, growth opportunities are great and ample. You could expect easy going management with a great focus on your career development."
good,"Workplace is pretty modern and work culture is great. The nature of the job isn't too stressful, but working emails gets monotonous after a point of time. The pay I received was very good in comparison to what my classmates working in other companies received. Overall, it is a good first step into the corporate world but I wouldn't recommend staying for over 2 years."
good,"The company is struggling to find it self when going from a startup to a corporate business, it will still take some time, but they are making progress. There are great opportunities to for advancement if you work hard."
good,Not a fair job for outside sales. Chicago based employees have an advantage. No opportunity for growth. The company changes rules very quickly which makes sales a moving target.
good,"Good atmosphere but no vision for employees."
good,"- Great place to start your career"
good,the company is good overall not a unified company. the unlimited pto is a great option. but not all managers are equipped for the responsibility alot of merritt due to friendships and not skill level.
good,"I was hired to work from home as a customer service representative. There was very little appropriate training before I, and many others, were put to work. Once we started working, the only time we had with our managers was via live conference with our group of others under our manager. We were an “experimental” group, and it showed."
good,"Limited growth opportunities in the greater Kansas City area, great perks for products and services offered by merchants. Great customer guarantee on services and products."
good,Groupon is an OK company to work for. Towards the end of my employment I felt as if they were picking with me due to the complications i had during my pregnancy.
good,Lots of fun at workplace. Annual Offsite are awesome. Management is always approachable. But company could not convert into success due to frequent restructuring. Lack of vision of the leaders of the company.
good,"Really fun office with great, young people. This is an energetic office and it definitely makes for a competitive atmosphere. If you're solely looking for sales experience, which I was, Groupon is the place to do it. As fun as it can be, at the end of the day it is a sales role, and if you don't hit your numbers they will not hesitate to terminate you."
good,"The people are great, I don't think management has the backs of employees often. It is nice to really have a positive impact on how features go, but situations like that are few and far between"
good,"I would really like to work here for the following reason,"
good,Coming out of college not a bad first job but there a lot of better companies to work for. The work life balance isn't great but could be much worse.
good,"Work day consist of scouting for new business. I've learned that to whom much is given, much is required.  Management is resourceful and helpful. My co workers are fun to be around. The hardest part about my job is getting merchants to commit to a product/service that haven't seen in the flesh.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making my clients happy and offering them the best product/service for their business needs, even if that means not going with Breadcrumb."
good,"On the phones, in front of a computer all day.  Job amenities were great, colleagues and people are great, but some of the management is pretty horrible.  Aside for a select few exemplary individuals who supervised the individual teams, upper managements could care less about their employees as long as they are making money. Have been discriminated and singled out, and also felt under-appreciated for work.  The best part is the overall environment with the people you meet."
good,Great place to get inside sales experience and learning how to adapt to constant change.
good,9h Conférence téléphonique
good,Fun work place. But there is no job security at all. Growth in this company cannot be assured how much ever hardworking you are. Politics is a key among the management.
good,"An enjoyable company to work for. There is not much opportunity for career progression in Ireland, however. Would recommend the account managers position."
good,"I liked working at Groupon. I actually worked from home.  Calls were back to back almost all day,  and most calls were fairly easy,  but the pay was below average for call center work."
good,"good workplace culture, interesting & challenging job makes me love the job- encouraging team leads- learned a lot about hard work and time management."
good,Groupon is a good company but they don't allow much autonomy. They are are you 24/7. They listen to your phone calls and mirror all emails. Better watch your back there. EXTREME micromanagement.
good,good company. learned lot. good environment. good people. good food. outing.cab movie. outing hotel. night shift. chennai work location. every thing good
good,"If you think you’re gonna come into this job being paid what you’re worth, think again. Just like any other job that want to pay younrhe least and work you the most."
good,Great employees and people to work with but some of management lack professionalism great pay and benefits long breaks and lots of overtime must work fast and well with others have to keep your production rate up at all times
good,Empresa multinacional com muita pressão por resultados. Operação foi fechada no município de Aracaju por mudanças estratégicas da empresa.
good,"at this point probably hard to start new there and make the kind of money you want. management doesnt care about you, you are just a number to them. as soon as u start making good money, they somehow force you out"
good,"Groupon is the best place to work. But, there will be no reorganization for your efforts and there is job security. There are some seasonal benefits. But, there is no salary increment plan."
good,"Used to be a great place to work and I would normally recommend, but the past few years they have cut quality and laid off tons of US employees.  Operations are now overseas the but service is trash"
good,I felt cut off. It was hard to interact with other since I was at home and there was limited contact with my manager. I enjoyed not having a commute. I did not like how they laid off everyone without any notice.
good,"Working in the Chicago office was a great experience and there were many perks in the office, such as ping pong, pool, xbox and free beverages.  The downfall would be sitting on the phones all day."
good,"Nice office with ping pong table, fusball, free soda, fooda, cafeteria, enchanted forest and the space cat. Good view of the Hancock tower. Nice people around."
good,"Good place for a day job while pursuing an artists life."
good,"Melhorei a habilidade de adaptação, pois a empresa passa por diversas mudanças de diretrizes, processos e métodos de avaliação."
good,"It's a nice place to work if you are a fresher or starting off with your career, for others I would say, they might get frustrated of the stagnancy. In general, it is a fun place with very casual and chilled out atmosphere, but still, most of the people at higher positions are not quite satisfied with the way things work in the organisation or their growth rate."
good,"Working at Groupon provided me with great experience out of college. It's an extremely fast-paced, ever-changing environment that tests your ability to adapt."
good,"Es una empresa dinámica en constante evolución. Un buen lugar para aprender a trabajar en equipo y a actuar rápido para resolver conflictos y desafíos de diversa índole. Ese ritmo de crecimiento es, en sí mismo, un desafío, por lo que hubo ocasiones en que la falta de organización a nivel superior complicaba el día a día."
good,You will have to come to work day in and day out ready for the challenges of sales via telephone or email but you are surrounded by people who are willing to help in a high energy work space.
good,"This company is still very young in the goods aspect.  They are constantly making changes and pushing the boundaries to ensure they business is not stagnate."
good,"Groupon provides a nice work life balance, and friendly people.  And given the size of its business, enables one to work on many things."
good,The many layers of management makes it at time difficult to achieve progress and politics often become involved in any decision making.
good,"Groupon is an exceptional company to build lasting professional relationships and gain quality business/e-commerce exposure.  Unfortunately, the company largely views people as replaceable and allows politics and at times short term goals to dictate strategic decisions."
good,"Strong sales training. Like most entry sales jobs, it is a sink or swim setting. Strong support from management that is willing to help out employees."
good,"Have fun while it lasts.  I would not plan on making this a long-term commitment, but it is a great place to learn for an entry-level position"
good,"Posititv:"
good,My experience about this company was overall good in terms of work and life balance. They had provided all the help and support that we need to execute the tasks.
good,"Empresa que traz muito conhecimento e nos permite autonomia diante de todas as situações."
good,"Extensive opportunity in HR Business Partnering, Change management, Succession planning, Employee Retention, Employee Relations, Performance Management, HR Process Integration, Talent Movement, Workforce Relations."
good,"Lots of room to move into different positions. Most mid-upper level management are Senior employees with little experience managing people. Also very poor communication of requirements/goals."
good,"Overall experience was very good. I had good experience in dealing with the people and the overall culture was very friendly and supportive. It has great perks like free food, ice-creams, etc."
good,Somewhat of a disconnect from outside sells and inside sells reps.
good,"Call, email, close, repeat.  I've learned how to think on my toes - create unique experiences and marketing campaigns for hundreds of small businesses.  I've learned how to handle huge swings - highs and lows - and consistently sell regardless.  The coworkers are great - young company, smart people."
good,"My daily responsibilities involved handling escalated customer situations either via email or over the phone, coaching and advising direct reports, provided productivity metrics and feedback to individuals. I learned how to communicate effectively, both verbally and written, identify strengths and weaknesses in subordinates, and how to establish beneficial working relationships with constituents on all levels."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, buena empresa para aprendizaje de negociacion y busqueda de proveedores nuevos."
good,"Un trabajo normal,nada fuera de lo comun. trabajo en oficina"
good,"On an average day I am talking to between 50-80 customers and resolving issues. Generally all issues fall within several categories.I have learned to provide efficient service while maintaining a positive attitude.  Mostly I have learned how to use key words to address issues in a quick and pleasant manor. The staff is filled with wonderful people, however it does feel like we are disposable. The most difficult part of the job is to find a challenge or room for creativity. The days become repetitive very quickly. The most enjoyable part of my job is the staff and chance to work with a large and fast growing company. "
good,"- Tasks: agent de seconde ligne, prise en charge de social media du point de vue CS, envoie des massmails, traitement des plaintes FOD"
good,Groupon is a large company that is still very much a start-up. There is an abundance of opportunity to contribute significantly to the company.
good,"Groupon Belgique offre un environnement dynamique, agréable et très jeune. Beaucoup de jeunes diplômés forment son personnel et le style est informel. Certains collègues deviennent des amis, et les afterworks sont nombreux"
good,"At Groupon I worked with Groupon Getaways. Groupon Getaways is the purely travel dedicated platform that really appeals to the travel savvy subscriber base that Groupon holds. I worked in the Midwest and Canada region. What I would do is call on three star properties and above to feature them on the website for seven to ten days. I learned a lot with Getaways, especially how to be strategic in what you are selling. This includes prospecting and the art of being able to close deals. The valuable experience that I gained from Groupon will be something that I will be able to use throughout my entire professional career."
good,"Groupon allows their outside representatives to set their own schedules. The lack of contact with managers and ever-changing commission and goal structures make it difficult to stay in the loop. Goals jump in high percentages every month and commissions fluctuate, but the base salary is very competitive."
good,"Tough job but with resilience and consistency, you'll do well. Opportunity to learn a lot and develop personal skills. Management however is questionable and other employees can tend to be very childish."
good,"Groupon is an excellent company to work for to get your foot in the door and to start off your career, however, other than cool track jackets for 2 year & 5 year employees, there isn't much of a reason to really stay at the company. Due to this being a primarily young company with the notion that everybody in the office is replaceable, they get away with being able to pay below the market average for certain job roles and skill sets.  This often comes as a shock to HR in exit interviews, but there isn't incentive to retain good employees once they realize their market worth.  I came to this company for the experience, with the understanding that this wasn't going to be a long-term company to stick around with, and the culture at Groupon truly cannot be beat.  However, it is not a place to have longer than a five year plan, unless they work on ways to incentivize tenure and compensate based off of skill set and duties."
good,"This is a great job to get sales experience on a corporate level.  Young, inexperienced managers, make it tough to advance and turn into a career. High turnover,"
good,Empresa funciona em ritmo acelerado sempre com foco em alta performance
good,"Hard to advance. Not transparent. Fun activities. Great people. Recommend for right out of college. Great office location. Love Chicago, can make a lot of money but most people don't."
good,Great potential but have many process changes instituted and changed again before seeing full benefits. Spur of the moment decisions affecting long term goals.
good,"Good place to work because of great people. Great people make great companies. Fun atmosphere, 8-5 M-F, nice office, kitchen with beverages (hot & cold), small game room. Management always supportive, coaching, helps out on calls when needed. Daily smiling & dialing job."
good,The work culture and everyone you work with are really great and you'll enjoy coming to work to be around these people. But the pay is extremely low and sometime your just a number there.
good,"Professioneel, harde werkers. leuke jonge collega's, bedrifjspand midden in Amsterdam"
good,"good company as general parts, but buying team is not very strong enough, couldn't really learn too much from the buying job here."
good,"es un lugar que se mueve rapido, un dia es como una semana, se aprende mucho, falta orden y vision."
good,Good work/life balance and company could do better to incentivize and reward employees. There is a lot of opportunity to make a big impact. You wear many hats on the job.
good,"A typical day at Groupon involves the entire sales process. You have the opportunity to generate leads, evaluate a prospect, discover pain points, create/propose a solution, and close all in the same day."
good,"A good day working start with a meeting with my co-workers and the team leader. We imagine how will be the day, and what we need for get our objectives. One day with out learn anything is a day lost. Always when I was working in Groupon learnt something about the job or about the life with  my co-workers."
good,"This was a great environment just every unorganized. I learned more about working with WMS, RF Scanner and many other thing so I can say that it was a great deal of opportunity to learn many things. There were just shift being switch around like every months."
good,Talk to grumpy customers ALL DAY!!! Quick Training. Fun Coworkers.
good,"I enjoyed my employment at Groupon in the first 6 months. I had been working with great, smart people who adopted the work hard, party hard approach. I've learned a lot from my superiors and I had faced great challenges that stimulated and pushed me to excel at my tasks. "
good,"Groupon has fostered a young, vibrant environment by employing talented graduates from all walks of life. However, the growth of the business in other corners of the world is beginning to take effect on the creativity and innovation of the UK branch. "
good,I learned to work very closely with multiple team members to execute a great ad on time for the client even though I was home based and my team are in Chicago. I also learned communication is very important on both sides of the parties especially from management when dealing with a very large company. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the success the merchants had when they were very reluctant in the beginning to work with Groupon and myself. The most difficult part of the job was moving to North Carolina and being assigned a territory so underdeveloped that I had no back up power to help me launch this market. Instead I was told to close business in Fayetteville NC where the actual landing page and majority of the businesses closed were from Raleigh. Majority of the subscriber base was from Raleigh. Fayetteville needed a marketing campaign to launch this city and to have their own landing page with their own deals not combined with a very large city over an hr away. The management staff who have never visited Fayetteville didn't see it worth their time to make the necessary changes to develop this market.
good,"I started working at Groupon a year ago. I left a really good job to move to Chicago and work for Groupon. It was an interesting experience to say the least. If you prefer a job where you have high income potential with a certain amount of luck and skill, then this is for you. However there is the other side where many people fear that they may get fired that day, and where really good sales people are put in a position that most certainly will not succeed. It is a fun place to work. Young energetic people are all around you. However there isn't much room for advancement unless you want to change markets to a bigger one which could end up being a demotion. It also is hard to figure out what you need to do to make a lot of money because they change the commission structure every month."
good,"In general Groupon has a great culture and people who want to see the business grow. Unfortunately, the company can't seem to get their vision right. Groupon's problem sits within it's senior leadership.  They lack focus and strategic long term vision.  As a result they do massive reorganizations about every 6 months and continue to disrupts the teams ability to make progress. Rather than looking at the leadership or processes as the problem, they just move people. Its toxic and they lose talented people as result.  Which is why I left."
good,"Overall good experience management needs upward growth. They have too much politics involved in promotions. Also, too many failed products and too much turnover in upper management"
good,Fun place to work. Very young company with young management. Changes a lot on the fly but overall a good experience. Clear career pathways are needed.
good,Overall it is a great work environment and benefits! They are definitely all for volunteer work and making sure that their employees are involved in their community.
good,"Groupon has fantastic sales training, on occasion almost too much.  Sometimes they would have one too many meetings during the day, which would take away from selling, if you were a selling manager.  The culture @ HQ was much better than if you were off campus in working from home, it can get a bit lonely."
good,Es una empresa muy dinámica pero promueven la competencia desleal interna
good,"In general, the company doesn't seem to have a clear cut plan of action. Needs to figure out their direction. I love their products and would like to see them take that to a new level."
good,"If you are fresh out of college, with no responsibilities just yet, this is the place for you.  Ping Pong tables, free coffee, pool tables, video games, etc.  If you have a family, home life, children, etc.  This is not the ideal position for you."
good,"Good place to work. Not competitive work. "
good,"Great company over all. Very aggressive sales culture, great place to learn the ropes. Great culture but you were only valued if your performance was optimum. Pity the company doesn't exit anymore"
good,"This role typically put earnings ahead of family life."
good,"It's a relaxed atmosphere, where you work hard. The people there are very friendly and easy to get along with. I've definitely learned a lot about Excel and how to manage my time well. Management is young, which makes it easier to relate to them. The hardest part of the job at the beginning was working in cubicles to open floor seating."
good,"Fun place, good life work balance, encourage job advancement"
good,"Bij Groupon werken we voortdurend aan de lange termijn relatie met onze klanten en consumenten. Ik ondersteun het team in hun keuze van het maken van de beste deals voor zowel de klant, de consument en Groupon. Het gaat erom dat er voor iedereen een meerwaarde in zit. Naast het ondersteunen en aansturen van het team ben ik verantwoordelijk voor het trainen van nieuwe accountmanagers. "
good,"Made good money during peek season. Relaxed environment"
good,"nothing bad to say.  Good company to work for, just very stressful.  If you don't mind hearing about daily metrics until your head explodes, this job can be very rewarding."
good,"Each day is challenging at my position, i am called on to solve issues that are barriers or obstructions to production needs."
good,"Groupon has had a reputation for being a fun and forward-thinking place to work. They outgrew themselves, though, and outgrew all that."
good,"Van een chaotische start-up naar een multinational die in meer dan 40 landen actief is. "
good,"The people you work with here are the best people. Working in a call center can be mentally and emotionally exhausting, but Groupon is quickly rolling out a work from home program as an attempt to help fight burn out."
good,I get in at 8.
good,"Lots of learning, great sales training and working with some great people. Able to learn Salesforce CRM, work with big brands and learn how to really sell. Great manager and always able to ask questions, very approachable!"
good,"Working at Groupon is fun and energetic. No work pressure, employees will give freedom to work on their own. Management is not up to the work and can be changed."
good,"Working at Groupon is by no means terrible. You will have a comfortable job, but most likely few challenges that utilize your education or skills. Most days I did the exact same thing, over and over again, down to the button click. This is why I eventually became bored and had to leave. There is room for advancement, but you have to be able to get through the monotonous entry level jobs before pursuing that, which proved difficult. Management leaves a little to be desired, but it was a very young company when I worked there. Chances are they've improved since then. There are a lot of great pros to working for Groupon too - flex scheduling, relaxed environment, and of course the other amazing staff members."
good,"- Fun environment"
good,"Fun atmosphere. No real dress code. High activity driven sales. Don't miss your monthly sales quota. Great entry level job, but compensation could be better. Be open to changes, as they will happen every other day as the company is still young and trying to grow."
good,Its a great company to work for .But they do have some un realistic goals for their teams to meet .
good,The office is very cool. The people are all very fun and young. The company will also put on some very cool parties. Everything is great except for the job itself. Selling solely over the phone is not for everyone. It is quite repetitive and with a product like this you can often times find yourself getting cussed out by potential clients.
good,I love the company attitude. I work in a very low position and every time I point out a system flaw to my manager the information is taken seriously and immediately escalated to the appropriate person. My only real complaint is that my salary is very low and I feel like they are not taking into account any of my prior work experience when considering promotions.
good,Core sales training. Management and organization changes a lot but flexible people do well and are happy. Positive experience and dynamic environment.
good,"Working is good "
good,"Empresa boa, com bons benefícios."
good,Online is snel en processen veranderen elke dag. Veelal directief management.
good,"When I started to work at Groupon Taiwan, it was at pre-IPO phase. The focus was to grow revenue. We tried so many different ideas. It was a fun time because all ideas were welcomed and given a chance to try. Yet, it required quick success or else nothing would last."
good,Empresa muito jovem com muito a desenvolver mas que durante o período de crescimento faz com que seus funcionários cresça profissionalmente junto com a mesma.
good,"I enjoyed working at Groupon very much, there was a lot of opportunity for me to get my work finished from home in a quiet environment with few distractions."
good,"There are plenty of interesting and exciting things to do at Groupon, and they have a good package of benefits and salary."
good,"Luego de la separación con EEUU, la compañía perdió su identidad"
good,"It seems that keeping good team player is a real challenge in Groupon. However great people - not so great management."
good,Boa empresa para aprender se você é jovem. Resiliência e flexibilidade são palavras mandatórias. É uma empresa onde você consegue implementar uma ideia se ela for inovadora.
good,Une start up puis entreprise qui marque par son esprit de famille et d'appartenance.
good,"Groupon is a fun place to work if you love customer service and dealing with more than 50 phone calls per day.  This is a fast paced work assignment that requires you to type, listen, communicate effectively and complete the customers request with a limited time frame."
good,"leuke, open werkgever, je kunt 100% jezelf zijn."
good,"Telefonate come se piovesse, più chiami e più ha possibilità che qualcuno ti fissi un appuntamento, poi sta a te chiudere il contratto. Sicuramente ci vuole molta dialettica e predisposizione al contatto con cliente. Lavoro molto impegnativo, ma di grandi soddisfazioni."
good,"Ok for a while, not much management support. Advance opportunities slim due to not having enough associates. Need more team building ideas & associate growth support."
good,Groupon is a good company and a fun work place. Job security is not so good. Culture is western. Management changes happen every 2 years. Lots of confusion in the management.
good,Great company for those looking for a first job out of college. Pay is on the lower end but the experience is worth it. Would work there again if the pay was adequate
good,A good place work on and share your own ideas.Can be flexible and no working hours set.A good place to learn and a place which provides you onsite options.
good,"Nesses 5 anos de Groupon, acompanhei o crescimento da empresa o desenvolvimento de muitos projetos."
good,"Trabajar siempre en grupo, muy importante para mí aprender muchas cosas"
good,"Great place to work that will work with your schedule, sometimes you want to go the extra step for customers and policies will not allow you to."
good,"Really fun company to work for. Lot's of benefits and compensation is good. However the management there was pretty bad, and they go around firing whole teams out of the blue."
good,"Was part of two starting branches, which accounted for a lot of cons to the job (lack of direction, not a lot of job training) but work was very interesting. Very young company and people were very fun."
good,"Empresa Dinamica, com pessoas pro ativas e politica interna boa"
good,There is always something to do which I enjoy. Expected to work hard but never overworked. Good officer perks such as free breakfasts once and week and drinks on a Friday. Able to work from home which is the biggest positive!
good,"Mi trovai molto bene a lavorare per Groupon perché ho avuto modo di confrontarmi con varie realtà e con colleghi collaborativi."
good,"ad oggi, 2019, non è l'azienda che ho conosciuto nel 2014. nessuna prospettiva di crescita o di carriera"
good,This is a great place to start your sells path. I loved the people that I worked with and it was great to work with others of different backgrounds...
good,Groupon is a different type of sales job because no business is alike and this allows you to be different with your approach to selling. People are smart  here too.
good,"I enjoyed working there.  Generally people seemed happy around me.  Job security is a bit shaky."
good,Cooperative work environment. Learned new things. supportive management. friendly workplace culture. Delivering project within critical time with team support.
good,"Good people, less stressful, some management issues. Raises are not predictable and some people get to be promoted for a reason that   is not clear to the rest of the staff. Pay is average"
good,Excelente ambiente para crescimento profissional e para networling.
good,Assist marketing department in organising different marketing campaigns and handling documents related to sales and marketing department. Energetic working environment with good colleague
good,"I liked Groupon they have a nice indoor&outdoor break room. They also have a playroom, but that place is filled with drama. And they always go by the he said she said. Its like high school all over again."
good,"Une ambiance jeune et dynamique et une culture d'entreprise forte, qui vous font vous sentir très impliqué. "
good,"Work is busy as soon as you log in, and stays busy till you log off. Phone lines close at 8pm CST, and open at 8am. Management review your work on a weekly basis, and discuss areas of improvement and what you are doing exceptional at. Doing this without making you feel belittled. Co-workers are great people to work with."
good,"Fantastic environment, positive and engaging. Young and vibrant, Great training, really look after staff and generous lunches."
good,Nothing bad to say about Groupon. Great for young adults fresh out of college that need direction. Feels like a frat house at times. Work life balance great. Lacks transparent career paths.
good,"While Groupon has a variety of offerings from yoga classes to sailing excursions, a person who is adept at working with restaurateurs will do quite well here."
good,"When we arrive on a job we work together as Team. We do not Play around everyone played there position and we get the job done,we would laugh and have fun at lunch time. I enjoy every day."
good,A great place to work although head office management could be improved with respect to communicating information and decisions.
good,"No geral é um bom lugar para se iniciar uma carreira, é bem aberta, conseguimos conversar diretamente com a gerência, você não tem retenção de conhecimento por parte dos gestores."
good,"Entepreneurial, high speed and open environment where you are given the chance to see and learn many things and have an impact."
good,I appreciated Groupon because it gave me the opportunity to sharpen my Qa skills.  I also learned how to work with API/JSON.
good,"Ambiente lavorativo giovane e vivace."
good,"Your peers help you achieve productivity as well as helpful with things."
good,Result-driven environment. Less concerned with what you look like or what you wear and more interested in the skills and drive you possess. Great entry-level position.
good,"Groupon is a fun, young company that encourages employees to connect with each other and help each other grow. It has a young management team, which can lead to increased politics at times, unstable org chart, and constant changes to internal structure due to juvenile-like decision making"
good,"Groupon is a growing company that offers a great product. "
good,"Everyday is different.  Groupon is constantly changing.  From the site to the internal structure.  To work here you must be willing to go with the flow."
good,Un esperienza stupenda e indimenticabile. Mi ha fatto crescere professionalmente.
good,"fun place to work and you could really meet some amazing people, but it's hard to sell a product that the majority just do not want in a constrained time frame."
good,"- courrier à retirer, contrat à faire signer par les dirigeants, traitements des réquisitions judiciaires, traitement des droit de communication (fisc), gestion des baux, traitement des plaintes clients (DGCCRF, associations de consommateurs ou cabinet d'avocat), Courriers de mise en demeure aux partenaires, suivi des factures honoraires (cabinet d'avocats)."
good,Typical sales job making cold calls and trying to close deals to hit sales goals but what makes it unique are the types of accounts you work with and all the young people who work here.
good,Groupon is a great company to work for.  The managers care about your success and work with you when you're struggling.  Keep in mind it's still a young company so changes happen frequently.
good,It is pleasure working with Groupon. I learned lot of things in Groupon. I molded myself as a QA by performing all the role of a QA. It made me grow myself in my career.

good,They are a company that believes in celebrating their employees. They come up with amazing ideas to say thank you. Groupon is a great starting point when you are not use to being in the working class. It will teach you patience and diversity.
good,Call new/existing merchants to schedule features of businesses
good,"Awesome place to work with great benefits, very flexible positions available."
good,Everyday is truly different from the day prior. Priorities change quickly but I enjoy working in such a fast paced environment. This is a very rewarding company to work for. In the past year and half I have watched it grow it a real power house in the e-commerce industry!
good,I work hard to create strong relationships with clients and ultimately produce revenue. Very faced paced atmosphere with a lot of young people who are creative and bright.
good,Busy and very entertaining. I learned how the website works and what groupon is all about..
good,"Groupon, was a bargain sales business, extremely high pressured environment. Great company culture. Company was liquidated. "
good,Not much room for upward growth. Ready for something with greater responsibilities. Low pay. Young staff. No work from home opportunities.............
good,"It's a very ""work hard play hard"" culture- the most successful reps work 50-60 hours a week. Pay is good, but you have to be creative and strategic to find the wins."
good,Groupon is a  great company. Unlimited PTO and good pay. The two biggest downsides are that upper management is good however direct managers are not trained to be managers and it creates a negative space. The second downside is that 90% of the work can be done remotely however work from home is rarely allowed which is very frusterating
good,"So, it was an internship, so the pay wasn't great:  $12/hour.  But I got to work on Inclusion and Diversity, and the I&D department is incredible!!!  Really the most advanced I&D work around.  If you're interested in that kind of work, Groupon is fantastic.  "
good,A typical day at work was fast paced and pretty busy.  I learned to be an effective Supervisor for my team.  The culture of the company was laid back.  The job wasn't hard because all the information needed to resolve issues for the team was available.  I just enjoyed resolving the issues for the customers in a timely manner.
good,"Groupon, does an exceptional job on work and life balance. However, the job security is quite hairy at times. They tend to eliminate positions on a whim. Finally, the higher level executives, have poor leadership and tend to not take suggestions from personnel very well. Overall, I would give them a good rating but need to work on some things."
good,Groupon est une bonne entreprise. J'ai beaucoup appris durant toutes ces années au sein de la société.
good,"The company is great.  You can make a huge impact with less red tape; however, you're expected to be available 24 hours/day.  There wasn't a Christmas I didn't work 4 hours and pay didn't make up for it."
good,"É uma empresa com funcionários muito legais, comunicativos, e um ambiente confortável e agradável de trabalhar."
good,"Lots of fun hard working people, my day to day varies but I like that it can."
good,good company....work culture is good.......management is superb...cab facility and perks are also good........nice place to work....all the best!!!!!!!
good,"É uma excelente empresa"
good,"Groupon PR, was a fast paced, enjoyable work environment, with helpful co-workers and management. enjoyed working their due to the fact that bringing in deals in every market possible, gives you he chance o learn about a lot of different  business their strategies."
good,The work was about achieving everyday targets. Job was not challenging enough. Co-workers & the management were quite helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was no work from home pressure. We need not carry work to home.
good,"fast working environment, "
good,Empresa dinâmica. Boa de se trabalhar. O E-commerce cresce muito mais rápido comparado à outras empresas.
good,Ambiente agradável para se trabalhar mas peca um pouco pela desorganização em sua estrutura.
good,"Really friendly people, great  work environment. Very fun place to work and you can move up rather quickly. Also had a great christmas party!"
good,"Empresa muito agradável de trabalhar."
good,Working at Groupon helped me further garnish knowledge of Sales as a whole.  Long hours are required in this job.  The people and relationships you build at the company are fantastic.
good,"Trabalho dinâmico.Empresa com muitos funcionários jovens,e bem atualizados.Proporciona muito conforto pro funcionário."
good,"WAs the best work I have ever worked ! "
good,"As a new starter business, Groupon has been constantly chaging and evolving. This has helped me to develop and improve new and existing skills and has given me the freedom to work on my own and with a team. Team has been great to work with and is always encouraging personal growth. I look forward to working with a diverse group of people."
good,Fantastisk artig og dynamisk selskap. Internasjonalt og samarbeid med spennende mennesker med stor kapasitet og innsikt.
good,Get help other than your supervisor. The team is more willing to help. Working remotely is nice you are still monitored and given feedback which is very nice. I do think that we needed a little more training.
good,"I loved working at Groupon. The only reason I left is because there wasn't enough personal development opportunities. The teams are so small that if you come in pretty junior, you're always going to be doing more work than you should but you'll never get compensated for it because everyone else is going above and beyond too. Its really hard to get promoted, and there's not a lot of moving around internally. At least in the satellite offices. But the work culture was much better than other places I've been. People mostly cared about their co-workers and were pretty helpful day to day."
good,"Nice Place to work. Building has free shuttles from major trains. Different inclusive clubs, free drinks. Some departments have flexible work schedules"
good,"Ambiente giovane, smart, stimolante. "
good,"Great knowledgeable people to work with, and super fun workplace.  Company offers a great deal of benefits as well as training. Difficult to move around, but a great place to learn."
good,"Groupon has had some growing pains over the years, but the company seems pointed in the right direction. New 401K match for employees shows management is serious about maintaining employees for the long term."
good,"Internet business environments are always a bit chaotic. Groupon is not an exception, but I think that is the rule. Sometimes you don't know how is your day going to be after you grab a coffee and sit down. But that is what makes it really interesting."
good,"An excellent place to learn new things and grow in your careers. Great people and a great culture overall!"
good,"It's really good chance to work in Groupon. I will help the merchant and do marketing strategy. Everyday I will face different categories such as I am not only working in E-commerce but also increasing the knowledge is different categories."
good,"Productive and fun work place. CEO is friendly, approachable and always concerned of well being of staff.Awesome team to manage.Building rapport and managing relationships with customers."
good,"Management cares for employees well being. Must be comfortable with constant change. Most outside sales positions are work from home so must be a self starter. Typical sales position, high volume cold calling, emailing and pounding the pavement. If you work hard you can make decent money."
good,Groupon is a very cool place to start your career. I learned how to conduct myself in a corporate setting. My time spent here has been nothing but positive.
good,Infrequent meetings and poor working conditions. Would not recommend this job to anyone interested in the healthcare industry.
good,Groupon is a very cool place to start your career. I learned how to conduct myself in a corporate setting. My time spent here has been nothing but positive.
good,"Um dia típico,normalmente é bem corrido, sempre tem algo para fazer, vários casos para resolver interno e externo."
good,"Very good work experience in Groupon. Loft like work environment, motivating co-workers and strong leaders."
good,"I love working here. The environment is awesome, the people are friendly, and the job is not that difficult. If a part time job with great opportunities is what you want, then Groupon is the way to go,."
good,"Starting in a new department was a lot of fun. The team grew from 3 to 80 team members in only two years. I've learned how to manage my time and make certain tasks priority over others. The hardest part of the job was constantly adding daily duties to the department. More work lead to less time with client interaction. High call volume was very frustrating as well. Employees were busy with follow up, and had little time to take inbound calls, which makes it difficult on everyone because the call logs get backed up. Management was in meetings all day long and were not around when escalated situations occurred. Sometimes it was a good thing because you make the best decision for that client, and you do your best at coming up with a resolution for the client as well as the company. There was no advancement within the department. Most of the moves with the company were lateral with no additional compensation. I've learned a lot working for a start up company, I don't regret any of it."
good,"Great office location in the heart of the city, interesting, bright, ambitious and friendly people, lots of change but lots of training, too. Non hierarchical structure, open dialogue, hours can be long but there is a lot to learn and a lot to influence, so very rewarding."
good,"Empresa com um ambiente de trabalho descontraído, bem estruturada, oferece ótimos benefícios em relação ao dia-a-dia como ginástica laboral, sexta-feira temática e cerveja liberada no fim do expediente aos fins de semana. Super agradável!"
good,"My day-to-day tasks consist mainly of prospecting and closing new clients, while also managing the accounts of existing clients and creating reports to analyze sales patterns to continue to gain profit. Working at Groupon has taught me true discipline when it comes to working in a fast paced and fast growing environment. In addition, I have become extremely familiar with the CRM database, salesforce.com, as it is the main tool I use every day while prospecting new clients and also maintain existing accounts."
good,Groupon is a productive and fun work place where employees can give their best. They have excellent facilities as well as work from home option as well as cutting edge work.
good,"Good work place but not standard management. Job security would be an average. "
good,Chances are very strong that if you ask someone why they love working at Groupon they will tell you it's because of the people.  I am no different!  I have been very fortunate to work with such an excellent group of committed individuals.
good,One of the coolest places I've worked based solely on the work culture. No one really hassles me about my work and as long as it's done on time it's cool.
good,"Quite flexible company to work. Manager gives all flexibility the only thing is work should be timely finished."
good,"A typical day at Groupon you are there 9am-5pm although hours may vary depending on role. Each employee has a laptop so you are able to work from home if needed.  Groupon is a very young culture, with an average age of employees in their mid 20s. Managers and executives tend to be a bit older in their 30s-40s. It is awesome to work for a company that is growing so quickly and on the forefront of technology trends. However, because Groupon grew so quickly from the start they change strategy quite often. The new CEO does seem to have a long term strategy for Groupon which is comforting. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to run your own business with very few limitations or people saying ""no"" to you. The hardest part of the job is getting vendors and suppliers to see Groupon as a retailer and not a discounter."
good,"Entrei na empresa durante uma transição do grupo. Groupon em breve deixará de ter essa marca e com a nova gestão, novas estratégias foram estabelecidas para algumas cidades do Brasil, dentre elas, Brasília. Durante o periodo de 3 meses, tive 2 gerentes, nos quais tivemos pouco contato, pois um ficava em Curitiba e outro em São Paulo. Tivemos pouco acompanhamento."
good,"Great exposure. Very friendly atmosphere. Many learning related to e-commerce. Good international exposure. A day at work is fun filled, more like fun at work combo. Common forum to raise staff's concerns."
good,Fun at work while allowing us to learn and experiment to achieve better results. Learn from your peers is the mantra. Always reach the extra mile is expected.
good,"It's a fun company and the culture is great. You will work very hard and work is mostly independent. Unfortunately, most position changes are considered lateral moves."
good,Its an amazing company with good salary compensations and work life balance. The job security is not there in India but globally its a good company. Good work culture.
good,"Nice to place for a fresher to work on technical stuff with nice staff support."
good,Working is good in GROUPON technology.However there is the issues with the pay cycle of the company  the work culture is good and best for a fresher to have fun with work and so many things can a person learn when he/she will work for GROUPON
good,"This a company has great sales managers, good people, but after a while, the product gets old to sell.  No restaurant is a fan of Groupon, making it extremely hard to sell.  It's easy to get burnt out, but not as easy as logistic sales positions."
good,"Enjoyable and informative co worker"
good,Seeking a workplace will high energy and colleagues that are willing to learn off one another. Overall looking forward to finding a company that is willing to invest in me and further my sales career.
good,"L'esperienza in Groupon è stata senz'altro stimolante. I ritmi erano serrati, la mole di lavoro ingente, ma l'ambiente che si era creato faceva sì che si lavorasse in una buona armonia."
good,"Ambiente dinamico e internazionale."
good,"Although the party did end, I met plenty of great people & comedians and had plenty of memorable experiences thanks to the company."
good,"The day would begin at 8:30am (2 morning meetings in the week to cover off previous weeks results, plan and commitments for current week as well as training)"
good,"While the work/life balance and company culture are enough to get them to keep you there, the day-to-day job can get boring. You have to really be passionate about sales in order to thrive."
good,"Empresa dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar. "
good,"Great new workplace with supportive and helpful PA's for new young hires. Moved around all the different parts of the warehouse to learn the process of receiving through shipping, and everything in between!! Great first job!!"
good,"esperienza estremamente commericiale nella quale ho potuto emergere ed eccellere con performance tuttora da record con le mie conoscenze sul food e la mia predisposizione personale. Vita frenetica, relazionale, dinamica, scommesse e obiettivi giornalieri e settimanali, negoziazioni frequenti. Azienda veloce e all' avanguardia."
good,"A great company with the best ambiance.Every employee will say ""I'm a Grouponer"" proudly. You will get what you deserve. Each and every your effort will be counted and rewarded, However, the management sometimes behave like jokers and take wrong decisions on the work processes. You will laugh at them many times. But, you will feel home at Groupon. I mean, you can wear whatever dress you want, bring anything to office, play games in your workstation and keep your desk dirty. But remember, the competition is very high there, and you must prove yourself to survive there."
good,The days can be very long and can be very rewarding. I learned sales techniques that were effective and applicable to other aspects of my life. The Groupon culture is unlike any other and is extremely fulfilling. It is full of highs and lows; it takes a lot of strength to remain even-keeled. I loved my coworkers and the motivations we received as a team.
good,"Minha passagem no Groupon  foi inesquecível por diversos motivos. Entre eles, as oportunidades de crescimento e o reconhecimento do trabalho. Cheguei como redator júnior e saí como editor-chefe. Neste intervalo de tempo, aprendi muito como profissional e como pessoa."
good,"A typical day at work was having a few meetings throughout the day to discuss current projects, any rollout issues, bug fixes, new improvement requests, and making sure everyone is on task for the project to be completed on time and perfectly."
good,"Empresa que presa  a auto performance, investe muito em treinamentos das equipes, no bem estar do funcionário, salario atrativo."
good,Relaxed work environment. Great place to work for recent grads.
good,"El grupo de trabajo era comprendido por 5 personas de las cuales eramos 3 varones y dos mujeres. En la mañana se recibía mercadería la cual teníamos que descargarla y ubicarla en el deposito. Mi tarea especifica era control de stock, (contra remito, confeccionar una planilla de excel donde cargaba cada uno de los productos ingresados que a su vez era comparado con el reporte de envío que recibíamos el día anterior para poder darle fin a dicha planilla con los sobrantes o faltantes de mercadería, esa planilla era reenviada a el deposito general de la empresa lo que se lo denominaba ""informe de entrega"") Finalizada esta tarea realizaba atención al publico con el resto de mis compañero."
good,"Groupon is a culture driven, fast paced environment. I would recommend this business."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in, but not much room for advancement"
good,Groupon sets a fun working environment and allows a lot of freedom.
good,"A typical day of work as a customer support representative at Groupon consisted of six and a half hours fielding phone calls from customers, while the rest of our day was spent answering emails or following up on pending issues."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, jovem e agradável de trabalhar."
good,"Groupon was a fun, energetic company. I called on local businesses and developed online promotions in order to drive business through their doors."
good,"Excellent work-life balance and great perks! I really enjoy working with those around me and direct reports, but there is a general sense of mistrust with top level management. Compensation is also less than what you'd expect for similar positions elsewhere in the market."
good,"Good people, especially direct supervisors."
good,"daily and weekly  phones calls were made by the phone "
good,Was a great entry level sales position.  Very cut throat and a high turnover for those that aren't successful in the roll.  Unlimited PTO and lots of fun outings.
good,Empresa muy didáctica y con una idea muy amplia de lo que necesita tanto el cliente como el agente(términos de comodidades).
good,"Good working culture"
good,"Busco trabajo estable ya llevo varia cantidad de años trabajando a honorarios y requiero de algo mas estable, tengo alrrededor de 5 años de experiencia en el área de digitación."
good,"Worked at Groupon for a year now and enjoyed it as a first job out of college however, there isn't a whole lot to keep you there. A lot of turnover and difficulty to switch departments."
good,"I, personally, enjoyed my experience at Groupon. I did not agree with the poor compensation for the amount of work that was put in. Cultivated great relationships in a well-rounded, relaxed culture. Extensive training program was an ""A"" in my book."
good,"great place to work, good management . gave opportunity to learn new things and new projects. Give value to employees. "
good,"Very great company, wonderful work environment with many friendly people. Work compensation could us some improvement."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, dinamismo. Autonomía para trabajar."
good,I loved working at Groupon - the people were fantastic and the vibe was fun. The co-workers were some of the best people I know and loved working with all of the people that I met.
good,I had a wonderful time working for this company.  The people were fun and the atmosphere was friendly.  Additionally you get a certain amount of freedom when it comes to setting up deals.  As long as those deals conform to groupon's requirements they will be accepted.  More often than not you are helping companies to grow and you will be thanked by those companies if the groupon sells well.  I would recommend this job to anyone who has phone sales experience and is looking for a fun and challenging atmosphere.
good,"I enjoyed working for Groupon nc from February 2015 til August 2016. Although they could have more room for growth, it's a cool company to work for"

good,"Bon esprit d'entreprise"
good,Working at Groupon as a Group Fitness Instructor was fun for me. They like the way I kept things fresh and tried new things everyday. They were also very grateful for the knowledge I'd share keeping it very simple to understand.

good,"A typical day at work was pretty great. I learned to work together with an excited group of young professionals, management from time to time was trying but they always had good intentions. The hardest part of the job was long overtime during the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers, who were a diverse a fun community of Chicagoans."
good,"An amazing place to begin a career--doing way more than I would in the same position at a more established company. Pains of start-up still prevalent: lack of communication, redundancy, confusion but amazing work-life balance, resources, and co-workers."
good,"le cadre de travail est agréable "
good,"Very relaxed atmosphere. Love the flexible hours, vacation policy, and generous paternity/maternity leave. Trust your employees and they'll get things done."

good,I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave.
good,"Die Arbeit war vielseitig, man konnte am Wochenende sich was dazu verdienen und Mails von daheim aus beantworten. Absprache unter Kollegen und anderen Abteilungen hat meist gut geklappt."
good,The management was good and understanding of its employees and a collaborative work environment was always ensured. Team lunches and activities happened often. Workplace could have been more spacious and brighter.
good,"The last three years I have been provided additional support to further my career. This is my favorite part, they do teach and spend extra time with employees to build them up."
good,"Executive Assistants should be paid a higher salary as when I was working there, I was on call 24/7.  I had to ask for the raises instead of them being offered to me for the hard work I put in"
good,I have worked in Groupon for around six months and it has been a very pleasant and eye opening experience. I have learned alot about a profession life over here and this was my first company that I have worked with. It has taught me how to handle pressure and meet the targets on a daily basis.
good,il personale gestito efficientemente dalla divisione HR

good,Challenging and Exciting Atmosphere. Fast paced with changes and carrying out the new processes. Great people.
good,Day at my work is awesome and does not even feel the strain of 9 hours of work. Dedication and determination is what I have learnt at Groupon. Management is awesome to work with and co workers are always helpful and supportive. Never thought that Job is hard to do hence no hardest part that can be described. Job itself is the most enjoyable part.. Would love to work in such an environment.
good,"El área comercial es vivir el día a día, es como la bolsa de Wall Stret, mucho estrés pero diversión. lo mas importante es enfocarse en los objetivos. "
good,"Aprendi muito com  A GROUPON – SERVIÇOS DIGITAIS LTDA , é uma empresa muito agradável de se trabalhar e comprometida com seus clientes."
good,"Tenho ótimas experiências, fi uma empresa que me acrescentou muito profissionalmente, tem e preza por um ambiente de trabalho sempre agradável, metas bem puxadas e rígidas, mas salários compensadores e benefícios muito bons. Gerência no geral boa e diretoria também."
good,great learning experience with great people working there
good,"It was a good place to work, all except for the security you had to go through to get in and out. I understand why they did it, but it was like you were a thief! coming in and going out. that's the only thing I didn't like. other than that and it was a good place to work."

good,"Una empresa jóven, dinámica y agresiva; con excelente clima laboral y oportunidades de crecimiento constantes"
good,"Groupon is a fun company to work for - comprising of young, driven and dynamic individuals. The company encourages creativity, innovation and is committed to helping employees advance professionally."
good,"A typical day involves learning to lead gen and vet proper accounts, call prospects, and ideally set yourself up for success. Closing contracts and GP are going to the most important on paper, but learning the sales process and how not only to sell, but market to businesses and merchants will help you fully in this job."
good,Working for Groupon I learned that you always have to be at a fast pace to get orders out on time. Our leaders are always there to help anytime. hardest part about working there I have to say the young kids doing peek
good,"Groupon is a fun place to work. It is easy to get to, and an easy place to make friends. People who work in Image Design are typical tech/startup personalities, with active lifestyles, hobbies, and high levels of competence. Image designers have relatively flexible schedules, but are required to meet a certain average productivity level, which is measured on a digital meter, so work sometimes feels like a game to get enough points in. At first, it is hard to get in all the points, but you soon learn how to work quickly and effectively. Groupon has many social groups you can join, as well as athletic activities. There is free coffee, free vitamin water, and sometimes free snacks.There is a game room, a swingset, a crying area, a DJ in the elevator, and a giant cat in a spaceship. Compensation was terrible ($13 hourly) but morale was great. Its a really great gig for recent graduates or people just moving to the city."
good,Ive worked here coming up on 4 yrs.  I enjoy it very much.  There is a great culture here and if savvy and a hard worker you can definitely make money.  I just wish they paid managers better as this discourages people from applying for that title
good,"It was a productive workplace although slightly gets boring. Work colleagues are fun and happy to assist. The only problem was transportation wise and sitting in front of the computer all day is not something that I would ideally want to make as a career. However, the experience was overall good."
good,"Ao longo dos mais de cinco no Groupon, eu trabalhei em quatro áreas distintas e vivi diversas experiências onde eu cheguei a lhe dar com parceiros, gerentes e excutivos comerciais, gerentes financeiros e diversos analistas. Foi bem intenso o período pois a empresa possui pouco mais de cinco anos de Brasil e sempre os dias eram agitados. Eu aprimorei e aprendi diversos fundamentos meus como organização em planilhas, tratamento com clientes e fornecedores além do inglês em calls e e-mails. O que mais me agravada era o corre corre do trabalho e o que não agradava, acredito que os erros internos até porque a empresa é nova e esta sempre se reinventando no mercado."
good,"Groupon is a growing company that still has the startup feel and mentality. If you like change, you'll love Groupon. Co-workers are awesome, managers are young but good, you'll work hard here because you need to."
good,"Cool place to work at, and with professional yet friendly group of people.More growth opportunities can be seen in a very short span"
good,A place for growth and development with fun and learning. Great experience and exposure. The management is supportive and acts as a tool for self development. the nature of job is interesting.
good,I worked at Groupon for over 2.5 years and have had great career advancements throughout my time. I enjoyed my time there and left when I had the opportunity to travel Southeast Asia. I had amazing managers that helped me grow professionally and personally.
good,This place made you want to come to work. They played music and allowed you to enter a sweepstakes every so often. They would give away awesome prizes. I liked working with the staff and seeing new product on the floor.
good,"Na epoca em que trabalhei no Groupon a empresa era uma explosão. Como estive presente desde o começo, participei por varias mudanças dentro da empresa. Antes das coisas se estabilizarem, a empresa vendia absurdamente bem e o fluxo de contratos era muito maior do que hoje em dia. Como o que fazia diferença no salario era a comissão, eu aproveitei esse ""boom"" para trabalhar o máximo que pudesse. O que as pessoas costumavam reclamar era sobre a instabilidade da empresa, exemplo, o comissionamento era de um jeito e logo depois mudava, a forma de abordagem aos clientes era uma, depois eles nos apresentavam outra e sempre foi assim. mas como eu sempre me dei muito bem com mudanças, posso dizer que tirei isso de letra."
good,Deal with the leads from sales and search interesting leads for sales as help. Help marketing department co-workers to finish cases by myself.
good,Groupon provided a fun and exciting atmosphere to work in while also creating an environment that rewards excellent performance and encourages and trains everyone to accomplish their goals.
good,"Good start-up culture to work, systematic & organised in work approach, good management, Employees opinion & voice is heard, good learning & experience in coodinating with various people"
