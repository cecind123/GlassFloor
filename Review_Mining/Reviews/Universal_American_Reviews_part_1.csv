bad,"This company sucks...I'm surprised they haven't gotten shut down. Management clique up and cut you down to guard the group they spend excessive personal time together and hardly seem qualified. You could be here today and gone tomorrow because turnover is high. Overtime is excessive and they mistreat you if you decline it.  Always understaffed. Despite all the listings for job openings trust me its a front they aren't interested and you'll never be qualified seems like they were always hiring for the same thing and your chances are not better as an employee, there is no advancement they prefer to hire someone else. They use temp staffing for emergencies and treat temps better than permanent employees. They don't support students. I had to quit, I was on my way to death by stress.."
bad,"Management is very poor at this place. You are constantly micro managed and instead of being a good supervisor, management is always closed up in the office keeping up mess."
bad,"Poor foundation and limited structure as well as training, Poor leadership."
bad,Upper management is horrible.  Turnover rate is horrible.  Employee morale is horrible. The benefits are horrible. HR is horrible. My experience here is horrible.
bad,If you're looking for a place were you feel like you're in jail then this is the place for you. My manager is horrible!! She's In her 60's so she has a VERY OLD fashion way of managing compared to younger managers. She's so forgetful and hates to be wrong. Nothing there is consistent I have NEVER worked for a more unorganized company before. 401k sucks benefits are high!! I just show up for a check and go home THATS IT!!! Looking for a new job EVERYDAY!!!! Every department is different
bad,"Environment very stressful.  "
bad,"The IT system in the company is terrible, which causes the inefficiency and ineffectiveness. The Medical Insurance and the Dental Insurance are very bad, you still have to pay a lot after you pay the monthly insurance. The management in Finance is not nice to the employees, the new employees will not receive enough training but has to deliver high quality work to the management. In addition, the manager plays favoritism in the group. To the employees she dislikes, she is negative on the employee's improvement and keeps being nit-picky on the employee's performance. To the employees she likes, she covers one's mistakes and downplays the mistakes the employee makes. Her abusing behavior caused the employee picked on lack of sleep and burdened with a lot of stress and depression. Very bad experience..."
bad,No work life balance this is a place for someone who can dedicate at least 60 hours of travel on the road visiting providers.
bad,"Universal American is a very entrepreneurial organization. Offering a diverse selection of opportunities and benefits. If you enjoy working in a fast paced, ever changing goals and direction you will thrive. UA offer annual salary compensation raises but the are often disappointing. I advance in my role there several times, and was compensated for each change in responsibilities. I enjoyed working with most of the administrative staff and some of executive leadership. There was a tremendous amount of personal agenda issues and empire building with Senior management. A lot of senior level turn over, But you can be assured there is a good meal catered somewhere every week there."
bad,"Company in transition due to being bought, didn't know what direction they wanted to go in, how they wanted the job to be done changed daily & even multiple times during the day."
bad,"Awful place to work. The best part was other employees who were all very enjoyable to work with. But management was inconsistent, benefits were poor and there was no chance for advancement."
bad,a typical day at work can be best described as long and stressful; I've learned that this is not conducive to personal or professional growth for myself; management will need much re-training; my co-workers remain optimistic from year to year; the hardest part of the job is showing up to work each day; the most enjoyable part of the job is...
bad,Universal American makes changes daily with no real direction.  Management needs training on how to treat their employees. Constant bullying or discrimination from lower management. The less you work the higher you go in the company.  Benefits have been cut recently.  Morale is low as there are constant layoffs with more to come.
bad,It's a company that does not respect the people that are doing the work.  The worst part of the job was the constant micromanagement. Compensation and benefits are a joke. I would not recommend this company if you are looking for a professional environment that promotes growth.
bad,"Treat you like day care. No cell phone and no phone calls on business line, so not a place to work if you have children or family as they cannot contact you in the event of an emergency Office reeks of smoke as all managers do is smoke all day."
bad,A typical work day for me would be reviewing Medicare regulations and creating policy and procedures for the claims processing department. I created a 165 page training manual to aide in improving the claims processing error rate. I look forward to developing training materials for the company's business partner in India.
bad,No work/Life Balance. Nice Location. Good People to work with.
bad,"The company was not loyal to their employees, laying people off, having them participate in a group exit interview and then telling them they could go to the main website and submit an application for any open positions within the company."
bad,"The IT system in the company is terrible, which causes  inefficiency and ineffectiveness, never completely set up to work remotely, work cell phone didn’t work  more than it worked, usually end up having to use personal cell; probably used personal phone 70% of the time.   "
bad,I enjoyed talking with clients. I always learned something from them. I enjoyed giving them the care that they needed. Always disliked having to deny care.
bad,"Hard to Follow company direction."
bad,Company now under new management.  Time will tell if it gets any better but currently does not look like it.  Wellcare people seem unconcerned and don't want to include Universal American people in the integration process.  Their way or the highway.
bad,"•	Ensures staff is educated on county charity programs and able to answer question and direct inquiries."
bad,Had a wonderful group of people to work with.  Unfortunately the company was downsized.
good,"The people that I worked for and with were always a pleasure. I also very much enjoyed the job I did, I helped people. However the turn over rate of this company is very high and even if I could go back I would not. This company needs to show more value of their employees and not turn them over so fast."
good,No job security at all. No room for growth. Company was placed under sanction while I was employed.
good,"it is a challenge, the management is a clique, they do not promote within the company. the doctors are all about money and not about the patients. Overall i would rate the company at a 4"
good,Group worked together to meet the demands of the job.  Many workers have been there for many years but changes in healthcare have resulted in layoffs and salary freezes.  Not much room for advancement.
good,"many hats worn. Was one of first employees hired for the Medicare Part D in 2005.  The company, CHCS Services, was eventually bought out and staff moved to Solon, OH.  I chose not to move north."
good,"It was a good Medicare Advantage company,  I believe the originating senior managers had the patient in their best interest.  It was an enjoyable place to work in the early days."
good,"You are your own boss to a certain extent.  What can possibly wrong with that?  Nothing, it's a beautiful thing.  Get your money!  So that is all there is to that."
good,"Overall, it is a good place to work, because, the people are very welcoming and have the ability to help new employees succeed."
good,"The benefits are not the greatest and very expensive. Good pay for your experience, though not always equal. Overall it is an OK place to work."
good,The internship was a new area of study that I did not know that existed. It was interesting to learn what the process of creating Medicare plans were. The management team was great and taught us to the very best of their ability. My intern co-workers were very enjoyable to work with.
good,I've had the oportunity to learn alot while employed but there some areas of the complany that need some improvements such as management.
good,"Overall, UAM was a good experience while I was there, but the general direction of the company appears unstructured.  I was recruited away from my previous job with an offer of more money, better  bonus plan and growth potential.  Suddenly, about 6 months later they are laying people off and eliminating departments.  My coworkers were talented and great to work with and like many training positions, this one required a lot of travel.  I suppose after all is said and done, I am really confused by the whole experience."
good,AT&T has a very relaxed atmosphere and speaking to the customers was a wonderful experience.
good,Go In to work start working. Management was a bit disconnect. Co-workers was nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job was there was no team work.
good,Very repetitive day in and out. Made multiple calls to insured clients recently DC'd from the hospital. Tried to set up MD apts for client's and keep them compliant.
good,Busy Call Center Analyst. Fast paced working environment.
good,"Our typical workday was standard of any insurance arena, often times rules and regulations change in the middle of the day. Timing is a crucial part of this industry. You have to be able to change and master multiple services throughout any given day. Our management team at this place were not as hands on as I have enjoyed in pasted positions. Excellent coworkers overall a very hard working group of people. The hardest most difficult part of this arena was outsourcing challenge which is to be expected the language and culture difference. The most enjoyable was the group of people who worked together so hard for a company."
good,"I like the culture of my divison, however, I find that the general marketing concept is not as effective as it was in the past which is creating an identity for our division and therby straining growth potential."
good,"Performed assigned functions of retrieval, abstraction, submission and quality"
good,This is a high paced work environment. There is never a dull moment and you're constantly busy making the day go fast.
good,Very disorganized most of the time. Hired as telephonic case manager. Case of constant changing of assignment and duties. hired for one job and then changed around to different positions 3 times in 6 months
good,A typical day of work would be an abundance of redundant reports and projects to review and complete. When I started they were still getting the filing system situated but it was very tedious because there were no set procedures in place and we tend to have to create a different filing system every month.
good,"Job was fine but people were let go in large amounts until they no longer had an office in Weston  after I left, I heard they were sold to a company who treated their employees better with better benefits"

good,"Scrum meeting everyday in the morning"
good,"Productive place to work, with a structured environment, my typical day is to listen to calls for quality assurance as well as service the customer. There wasnt a ""hard"" it was just confusing to the customers seeing that the average consumer wouldnt understand the product. The most enjoyable part is helping others."

good,Enjoyed working there assignment ended. Was able to quickly learn and shift to other projects and learn various programs for each.
good,Universal American offers great benefits and orients their employees with care.  It was such a surpise that 3 months into my employment I was informed my position along with 15 other Telephonic nurses were going to have their positions removed.
good,Universal American was a fun place to work. The management team was very helpful and most of the days you weren't stressed out. My coworker and I were able to capitalize on the resources to enhance our learning and growth with UAM. Only thing negative I would say is due to budgets the pay wasn't as competitive as other health insurance companies
good,I would would make sure claims were processed and paid correctly. We would handle all the irate callers and make sure when they hung up with us all of their issues were resolved.

good,"• Ensure accurate validation of medical and prescription drug benefits"
good,"Most of what makes this a nice place to work is the people.  Co-workers are helpful and are friends outside of the office.  I have a great supervisor who understands my unpredictable schedule as a single mom.  They make sure we do our work but also provide some good social/team building activities that keep morale up.  I""m pretty happy with this job.  I'd say that the commute/going in to the office every day is the worst thing about it.  It would be nice if working from home was an option, at least part of the time."
good,Hours can be flexible. Strong ties to State of Maine for contracts.  Management cares.  Most enjoyable part of the job is support and friendships with colleagues.
