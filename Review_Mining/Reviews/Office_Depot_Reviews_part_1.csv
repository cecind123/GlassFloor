bad,"mi experiencia laboral ahí fue horrible al punto que más de una vez me tocó ver a uno de los gerentes gritoneandose con las cajeras frente a todo mundo. Son rápidos para anotarte los retardos o faltas pero para que te valgan el tiempo extra ahí si de repente todo mundo es ciego, hay falta de personal por lo mismo que el ambiente laboral es tenso así que a veces tienes que dejar de hacer tu trabajo para hacer el trabajo de alguien más y además estar al pendiente de que no te saquen dinero de la caja, aunk todo mundo trae llave. Son poco claros con el horario, ya que te dicen que la salida es a las 10:30 pero si se tienen que quedar más tiempo (que es de siempre) no te pagan tiempo extra."
bad,"Seriously don't get stuck in the career stagnating tar that is Office Depot. Good ideas go there to die, and innovation is a rotting corpse that greed resides in. "
bad,"pesimo trato y prepotencia siempre no deja trabajar como es,ademas no dice las cosas de frente no da la cara al momento de dar las bajas se esconde y envia a representante juridico, mal trato al personal ejecutivo de las tiendas, y se ve reflejado en los resultados de cada una de las tiendas"
bad,Since new management at Office Depot last year there haven't been any black hired. Management say that they are fair but their not. For the heavy work load that u do does not compensate the pay that u r getting. Lots of heavy box lotsof desk too
bad,Stores are made up of cliques. Managers are very lazy and put their needs above the company and the associates. Worst company to work for. Would not recommend to anyone looking for a job.
bad,"Long story short.Want to be forced to scam people with underhanded sales tactics,work with uneducated management who do nothing to foster your development, be paid practically nothing but be told you matter. If that's what you want this is your company."
bad,I hated every minute of working there  horrible management at the senior level  and I was screwed out of my PTO  barely any raises  0/100 won’t recommend at all
bad,Mangers talk bad about workers always on their phone over all it’s ok but they don’t work with your schedule. Sometimes ask u to leave right when u clock in
bad,Had a really good team but we were always short staffed having to fill in multiple positions that you were not compensated for. Having to upsell to customers and rated on the amount of sales you got while not getting compensation.
bad,"When i first started with the company, I loved my job. However, it slowly started going downhill. And now with them getting rid of the client engagement position, my position. I'm out of a job, again. This happened almost a year ago with the furniture position, which was also my position. I don't want to be apart of a company that just throws their employees aside when they no longer have a use for them."
bad,"Working here drained me of my joy of life. Unrealistic goals as well as having to outright LIE to customers about services and what they were doing. Management has a ton of pressure put on them to meet unrealistic goals for rewards sign ups as well as sales. This in turn trickles down to the front-line employees and stresses everyone out. They also cut hours regularly as the company cannot pay its employees any worthwhile wage."
bad,"Was ""temporary"" copy and print supervisor for 6 months and was literally skipped over for the permanent position. I was never recognized for any outstanding review, or anything I did for that matter. The managers play favoritism with the employees. And to top it all off you only get paid $8 per hour no matter how much experience you have, nor do you get a raise no matter how long you work there."
bad,"La neta es un pésimo lugar para trabajar, la paga es mala en si, ahora te lo digo porque fui colaborador Copymax, el problema de ahí es la administración, tanto gerencial como del supervisor, el supervisor de nombre Edwin Romero es pésimo en su trabajo, amenaza constantemente, te trata mal, incluso no te deja tomar agua, entre otras cosas, el sugerente Eladio le solapa todo, nunca te resolverá ninguna situación, la Gerente Mariel, se hace de la vista gorda que nunca pasa nada en la tienda, mi recomendación es nunca trabajes en OfficeMax Metepec, los chavos son buenos (colaboradores) pero el supervisor es el peor que veras en tu vida, si te urge el trabajo, tomalo, pero si no, entonces dejalo y busca mejor oportunidad de empleo"
bad,There’s no movement in the company  there’s no accountability. As an employee you could not show up and still have a job. Management acted like children and never held anyone accountable. Definitely immature management staff as well as employees. Drama all the time. Back stabbing all the time. Don’t waste your time unfortunately. I really wanted to work for this company and they let me down.
bad,"The managers don't talk to each other, I was left alone with jobs that physically required multiple associates, was expected to do basically everything from my actual job to customer service to cashier to print. Felt like I was completely taken advantage of."
bad,"This company will make you work until the work is done one night I didn’t get home until 4am in the morning and was there for over 16hrs and had to return back to work at 11:00am in the morning. I have a son and at times I would drive home falling asleep behind the wheel due to exhaustion and restlessness. It’s not worth the pay or the job, the manager is very rude and is rude and nasty won’t allow you to even use your PTO due to people quitting the job due to being overworked."
bad,Mostly with company standards. Great co-workers though. Management hawk over employees for numbers just because they say so. Which gives tension in all aspects of the job instead of providing good customer relations it dwindles what customers they do get with nonsense they don't need or want.
bad,"boring work place, i didn't like management they were mean. I didn't like how we were forced to wear ear sets so that we could watch over the store.  i felt like it was the security guard responsible for watching the store not the sales associates and cashiers responsibility"
bad,"Horrible place to work, mistreats employees, had a manager there get cancer, worked for them for more than a decade, the district manager said aloud he needed to dig up dirt on the guy to get him fired so he would lose his insurance. Treated the employees horribly, screwed with pay constantly, lied about promotions and pay raises, constantly harping on getting work done that required four people, and only hiring one."
bad,I would not recommend anyone apply at office Depot the management is awful and nobodys cares about the customer's. They do not care about there associate either. If your sick they still expect you to be able be to work.
bad,"If you are a high school student, this isn't a bad job, although you'll make more elsewhere, for managers, find some where else. You get the lowest pay filled with fake promises."
bad,I did not enjoy working there the managers did not give me enough time to train and just threw me on the register multiple times. The only manger that I liked there was tori she understood and helped out a lot.
bad,"I have never felt more uncomfortable in a job in my life. Managers were always talking behind our backs and making us constantly fear for our jobs. Inappropriate conduct accusations were taken as jokes, both by managers and corporate and those who came forward were bad mouthed by management."
bad,"When your current general manager leaves and his girlfriend is hired as the next gm, watch out! When the district manager says ""I will keep you updated"" but fails to do so, watchout!"
bad,Office Depot Doesn’t value their loyal employees & they don’t promote within. They overlook their employees that’s been with the company for years to hire Unknowledgeable outsiders.
bad,They are shady.Incentives you have earned are not paid.They show favorites  and biases and discrimination against female/ employees of different races
bad,"The job was awful, it was easy. But I did not feel wanted there even though I put in my beat work.  Nothing ever got done. The job got less and less pleasurable with change in management"
bad,"Worst experience ever. Managers gossip about you. They act like highschoolers. And just over all, a super lame place to work. You wont get promoted to full time. Call off one time and they cut your hours.  Unprofessional environment.  Don’t waste your time with this location."
bad,"I've worked at 3 different office depot and the management at all of them bend the rules however they see fit."
bad,This company is always trying to downsize and reduce costs of everything. Managers are always finding ways to decrease employee hours. Sales commission is horrible
bad,"I worked print even though I was supposed to be a cashier to start with. The pay isn't different, well for my store. I have had two hr complaints taken as a joke, one the manager called be rasist because I didn't want a coworker touching me, the other one I am still talking with hr about. I have seen more d!cks and boobs pictures than apremium snap due to customers and co-workers."
bad,"I was not work for office depot i was not tell people that this is a good place to work for, not after was they did to me. so that i feel about office depot."
bad,"There is not way i would go back; the mangers would change all the time. once i was told to lift a 150-250 pound desk and put away on the top shelf, when I ask for help they told me to fight it out. I am only 5;1 and about 120 pounds the manger was an ex college football player. Another manger thought a chair across the store."
bad,"The management at this branch was incredibly poor. Scheduling wasn't done efficiently, the physical store itself looked like it hadn't been remodeled in 30-40 years, and the pay was woful."
bad,"Everything was awful here. The management, the customers, corporate, and HR. My store manager was steeling hours and when someone called HR anonymously HR told the manager why they were inspecting them and they told the manager who told them. So HR got someone fired and didn't even conduct an investigation. The manager still works there."
bad,"es una empresa que te discriminan, no valoran tu trabajo, no te respetan no hay políticas ni reglas solo para los jefes"
bad,I worked there for a year and I was terminated because I know for a fact the general manager was threatened by my work. I had advanced extremely quick through the company but only because people are stupid and lazy. I know people who worked there for years and we're only getting paid $8.50 an hour
bad,"No pagan las comisiones, son prepotentes y no tienen educacion"
bad,"Working here was A ok , not the worst , there was poor management, they expect you to know stuff they’ve never even discussed , then when asked about it and you say you don’t know they’d get upset , it would get stressful sometimes because they expect you to do so much for the pay which is annoying  , managers are always late , you have to clock out for breaks"
bad,I have worked for this company for over four years and in those four years I have worked for six store managers and the last one has been the worst of them all.  If you have a problem with an associate or store manager this companies HR department is a joke and is unwilling to help you no matter what. Hours for full-time employees are terrible. The Store manager is a dishonest  unhelpful human being  who feels the need to say bad things about his staff behind their back does not help or support his management team. He comes from a store that has failed big time and is on the books to close which is very odd how he ended up getting another store and is also bringing this store down as well. Office Depot needs to be more careful when hiring store managers especially ones that are unproductive and unsuccessful and have no ambition to say good positive things about the company or staff somebody like this doesn’t deserve to be in a management position and unfortunately that is what you’re getting when you work this store and this company.  So do yourself a favor stay far away from Office Depot and OfficeMax they won’t last for much longer going like this.
bad,"This is a terrible company. They threaten your job all the time, write you up over stupid stuff like your shoes not being black enough. They promote people who can’t do their jobs and they allow people to be sexually harassed by upper management. Do not work here."
bad,Horrible...horrible ... lack of engagement......... no stability..... the organization is in a free fall and it is unlikely to remain solvent in the long term
bad,"I WOULD STEER CLEAR OF THIS PLACE!  DO NOT APPLY TO THIS PLACE! VERY HIGH TURNOVER RATE FOR THIS COMPANY! There's other jobs that pay more and are very laid back unlike this place! This place is a complete joke! You only get hired at 9.00 an hr and no raises at all. You get treated unfairly, be threatened to be fired for not getting a lot of people to sign up for their rewards program which doesn't do anything but spam your email & send spam texts."
bad,"A typical day in Shared Services would be constant work."
bad,"Unorganized, No structure,Low pay, No advancement, Constantly changing things, High turnover rate, Management Sucks!!!!!!!!!! RUN....... RUN .........."
bad,"The IT Contractors are treated like second class citizens, and they will hire an H4 Visa and / or green card holder before a US-born citizen with student loans. You don't receive any discounts for anything."
bad,I didn’t receive pay for 5 weeks and management didn’t seem to make it a priority to fix it. I finally did get paid 3 checks after 5 weeks of waiting.
bad,"Radical changes. Men are getting paid more than women and racism is evident! No work life balance and now with the stores closing and stock prices at an all time low, work has become toxic and  we are barely hanging on !"
bad,". I cried  a lot , like every time you saw me there I wanted to go home . It Was sad to work there but I needed experience to get another job , lucky me. They paid me 8.30 and hour , sad sad sad ."
bad,"at the time i worked at office max it was very slowly and mostly filled with very rude customers, majority of the customers went to staples down the road, it was rare for the building to have more than 10 people inside excluding the workers."
bad,"Horrible leaders at Depot "
bad,"Do not work there the environment is toxic and HR ignores being informed of harassment. Instead of properly dealing with it, they allow falsified docs to fire you not the harasser."
bad,Depot has its hands in too much to be able to compete. They want to be top in tech services but the system is weak. Zero investment in the non existent tech associates. You need to do everything under the sun on one foot and blindfolded. While corporate pokes at you and raise the unrealistic goals so you can lose daily.
bad,"Warehouse was extremely hot, no support under your feet all day, and your constantly moving in the heat with minimum breaks working 12 hrs. After  almost a year of being used up they let me and another associate go because the long hours and constant moving was taking a toll on our body. Yet we were always there on time and never called out. That's exactly why they have a high turnover!!!!"
bad,Do. Not. Go. There. Its sooooo bad!!! The training is terrible. Management is so unstable its ridiculous. I wish I never worked here homnestly I would rather be a billy goat then work here!!!
bad,Office Depot was a good company. But recently they have fired 1/3 of there general Managers. I do not think this company will be around in a year or two. Not making good business decisions. They will be closing stores soon
bad,"They hire bodies because it’s like a fast food court. They know there will be turnover because your compensation “box” movement depends on what projections to shareholders are promised. Your “box” is always subject to “hits”. If you are offered a pay increase, watch out for hidden agendas ..."
bad,My bosses were rude it was very slow and boring. Too much down time. Pay wasn’t good either. I got bored very quickly and ran out of things to do often.
bad,"I was called into an interview at the Homewood, IL. Just like any other interview, I dressed presentable, and went to the interview early. During the interview, it more like a friendly conversation with old friends. It made you feel welcoming and by the end of it she instantly told me I had the job. They were ""excited"" to have me due to my extensive experience, and thought that I would be a great fit for their store. Although she bad mouthed the manager that I was supposed to work for, the environment seemed like a fairly positive one until I actually had the opportunity to work for the management at both Homewood and Highland, IN."
bad,there is so much many things wrong with this store and no one listens. they treat you like unfairly your hours are never consistent. co-workers are lazy and don't do their job.
bad,"They do not follow company policy. "
bad,"Very sexist management, unfair work standards and no recognition of achievement.  Management has an archaic standard of who can work in what areas. By the time I quit there were no other women on staff."
bad,The new manager that took over created a hostile work environment.  He would change the way he wanted things done day to day and not tell you until after you did something the way he had decided he no longer wanted you doing it.  He made every day a nightmare.  He treated experienced workers  terribly.   The more customers liked you the worse you were treated.  He would write you up for things that were completely made up and when you called HR to get some assistance they wouldn't call you back.  He would neglect to give you breaks or send you on break and then call you back before your time was up.  He would get in your face and yell at you and say things that were very belittling.  Just a horrible place to work.
bad,"Low pay for amount of work, terrible management /corporate team,and extremely tedious work / pacing. Apply for anywhere else but Office Max. I recommend against this place for product, services, or a job."
bad,"They change your work duties and add more and more work without compensation. They laid off people, hire new people than lay off more people. You never know who will be laid off and when. Management does not care about people in general. There is no hr people on site."
bad,"The company is struggling to stay alive! Good starter job for younger folks but wouldn't recommend long term! Not a high demand for office supply box stores anymore, there for it make it very stressful to hit day to day sales!"
bad,"Worked there for 6 months, terrible managers, terrible environment, still haven’t received my last paycheck from them (neither has my boyfriend & it’s been months) . Save yourself the time & energy and don’t even apply"
bad,The company has been on a downward spiral. The work environment is very stressful as corporate level executives are initiating PIP strategies with unattainable goals to eliminate the masses. I do not recommend working here.
bad,I started as a cashier promoted to customer service manager I stepped down due to poor management I'm currently being discriminated against Im not put on the schedule or 4 hours a week it's not the job it's poor management
bad,"Job doesn’t pay enough for what you do, even if you exceed expectations. Managers do a horrible job of training, and primarily made me do everything they did not want, or knew how to do. Very annoying and frustrating."
bad,Office Depot is a failing company that as typical big box retailers brick and mortar will cut payroll and suck the living life out of their salaried managers so their shareholders and CEOs can benefit. Cut expenses so they make more profit for them self. Upper management likes to threatened and use intimidation to push their teams to their Breaking Point.
bad,"I worked there for 4 years as a lead. I had 3 different GM and 4 direct supervisors in that time. It is a til done shift in shipping and order filling. Management is poor and not consistent in how ppl are treated. You never know when you will be done, training is laughable and unless you find a person that has been there and knows a lot you are left to figure it out on your own. Turn over is very high, since I left 2 more management had walked away after being there 10+ yrs. Good luck getting a day off you are normally left to call in and that leads to points which then gets you terminated."
bad,"i was promised 34 hours, only got 26 if i was lucky, i was on top of Furniture Sales, and Square Trades after a month of employment, my boss hired a pretty female with a nice body and big boosums and the next week i only had 2 scheduled days so i walked."
bad,"Worst job i ever had theres more managers than staff who have no clue what they are doing "
bad,"I was a cashier at OfficeMax and was hated since I got hired. Every manager tried to find every excuse for me to either quit or get fired. I was friendly to customers, kept the front end clean and cleaned the toilets."
bad,"Poor management and extremely stressful work environment. Wouldn't recommend working with this company for anyone. Very terrible at accommodating personal needs as well (e.g., altering schedule for school)."
bad,"Was told a bunch of things that were not true, was told I was going to be in charge of a department but was turned into a glorified cashier. Also my hours kept getting messed up and I did not get paid what I was owed."
bad,"They don't care about there managers. Everything is smoke and mirrors and done in secret. More than half the managers i started with have quit. They don't care how hard you work, they want you to work harder and longer. You never see your family"
bad,The location were we worked was easy prey for wolf packs of shoplifters. Even some of the teenagers who worked as cashiers aided and abetted same by allowing thieves to leave without paying for mostly tech items.
bad,"This company was the rank number 17 as worst companies to work for, and they live up to it still. I wouldn't recommend anyone to apply for a position there."
bad,"The job makes you do over and more than your job requirements and not in a good way, i dont mind doing extra work but its not relevent to my work or even needed in the work place"
bad,Worst job I ever had. Management was overbearing and demanding.Training was minimal and customers were just the worst. Definitely a place to avoid.Hours were horrible and not one person took their job seriously.
bad,Office Depot used to be a great place to work but in recent years with new upper management it has became not very dedicated to  long term employees or even new employees. The upper management does not  care about the individual just about the numbers only. It is very busy and the right people are not in the right places to make important decisions.
bad,"No matter how much you sell, it's never enough for the managment here. They don't train you or help in the slightest to make you a better salesmen. They just tell you that we needed X amount reward sign ups, and X amount of this and X amount of that. Everyday day you hear the same thing. The managers say it's a team goal but when that goal isnt achieved it's automatically someone else fault. (Me most of the time). The job was pretty good at first, but as time went on it became a TOXIC place filled with rude managers. The customers are always acting like they open ANY product and then just put it back. Ruining the original packaging. All I can say is this job is horrible wouldn't recommend this working for this terrible company."
bad,"This is the worst company i have ever worked for no one has the managers backs not even Corp. Their motto is to make the customer happy but your not making your employees happy. Unethical place to work this company needs to take a close look in the mirror and revamp their whole way of doing business. They would probably be more profitable than what they are today. I see this company closing its door within the next 2 years if not sooner.  Copy and print is this company's biggest problem. The customer don't understand it takes time to finish some of their jobs that ask for us to do. And they want it right now if someone tells them no, they call the 1800 number, someone who doesn't even know what's going on in the store cause they aren't there to see what's happening. Looking forward to leaving this company very soon."
bad,Do not work at Roswell NM store. The managers dont care about you. All they care about is the customers. If a customer says its raining dogs outside then its raining dogs.
bad,"siempre se puede aprender cosas buenas de la gente, pero se dejan guiar por los chismes"
bad,"Horrible workplace lots of drama. The company is dying they even told us it was dying. It has to compete with amazon and Walmart, so this shouldn’t be a long term work place. The opportunities to move up are slim to none. Employees are under paid and under staffed. Meaning they expect a lot of work from you when ur getting paid $9 to $9.50 an hour. They will hire you for one position and place you in another. Horrible management doesn’t seem like they know what they’re doing or the delegate all there work to you. You will regret working there."
bad,"Overall the workplace is awful. The management never corporates with corporate. There is so much miscommunication is actually disgusting how bad it is. People are always quitting because the business is run so poorly. Overall to the company, you are just a number to them that can be replaced they do not care about any of their employees. All the company cares about is the amount of rewards sign up and the number of various subscriptions you manage to get. It all comes down to numbers."
bad,"I was hired as a merchandising stock associate, however I was thrown onto the register with very little training and stayed in that position for weeks. After I taught myself everything, I became quite good at my job- but not good enough! I was constantly talked down to by management, the selling techniques are completely insane and ridiculous, the store was ALWAYS understaffed and in general a very negative environment to work in! I had previous retail experience, worked at Office Max for over a year and was truly a great employee but still only made $9/hr which did not reflect the amount of work I did."
bad,"The main manger is over barring, he’s nice to you until you start not getting rewards, but he doesn’t try to get any hisself. He doesn’t understand how hard it can be to get rewards sometimes. He hovers over you asking why you aren’t getting any rewards, when he can clearly see that you are asking, then wants you to try to pitch rewards, ink subs, or warranty’s even after customers say no like no means no I’m not going to force them to sign up if they don’t want too. I would work other people’s shift, I tried hard to be the best employee. To me it wasn’t worth the stress over 9$ and hour so I left and I’m glad I did now I’m working a job that pays me $12 an hour. It was the best decision I made to leave honestly !"
bad,The culture at this company was terrible and that was due to the management.  Management was comprised of sociopaths who cared little about the employee population.  Mostly males who were a piece of work.  I don't miss it at all.
bad,"This business in Northampton no longer exists, the depot was closed down with all areas moved to both Leicester and Manchester, due to this unable to make any comments."
bad,Your hired full time with  15 days pto and then when work is slow they will send you home and have you use pto to cover hours lost managers sit in office all day employees do what they want. Not the best place to work stay away
bad,"Terrible place to work. They do not train you on how to do things even when its your first day. When you ask any questions on how to do your job, they get upset. Just dont work there"
bad,unless its your first job and your just there for extra money for school then its fine but working in the print center just no never again............
bad,"I would not recommend. The environment is stressful. The customers are rude, especially if you are working in the print department. The staff does not help."
bad,"This is a Call center that doesn't care about knowledge or retaining experienced agents and promotes Nepotism"
bad,while working at OfficeMax I felt targeted because I had a disability they never help me in the ways I needed the mangers where always quick to point the finger when something went wrong. All they care about is making money and nothing else. I never felt like I was respected.
bad,"Not a good business "
bad,"Inconsistent hours, unrealistic sales goals, awful customers, little to no training, no benefits for part-time, $8 an hour, aggressive sales tactics, no holiday or over time pay."
bad,"I was there for years. The company doesn’t care about the customers. What happened to the 10 foot rule, All they want is to bug the customer until they want to leave. Some people want to be left alone!!!"
bad,"Its an unsafe environment my old coworker were sitting and sliding on the conveyor belt but they have the nerve to have osha rules everywhere and cameras. The employees are always in your business and the the managers suck at there job cause they dont say nothing about it, the bosses they let the employees tell them what to do and what there not going to do with there job. My old coworkers had there phones out on the floor talking to people and eating food. People were dancing and never working and flirting with each other that place reminds me of a jungle I witness this with my own eyes and ears."
bad,"I've worked at Office Depot currently for a year, I loved it at first because i would work normal hours meaning 12-8pm on the dot. Now that training is over you never work an 8 hour shift. I havent seen daylight since i started this job and the managers do not care about any life you have outside of this job. They treat you like a piece of meat and they arent afraid to show you that. They select few people from managers favorites who dont have to clean at the end of the night and select others that have to do all the work at the end. They have everyone a 20 cent raise after a year even the people who hit goal all year recieved the same compensation as the people who never hit goal."
bad,No one is there to help you out when you have a long line. You are on your feet all day.. sometimes you can’t even get a lunch break .. the managers are always locked in their office. No social interaction within employees
bad,This was not a plesant place to work as it was around the time Staples was looking to acquire the business. They need to gain more understanding of the market in order to survive.
bad,"The customers are all so incredibly rude. They all come in expecting unrealistic turn-around times for print jobs that would take an entire day realistically. The company does not follow its own policies and will do anything to make a sale. They expect their associates to sell useless tech services that aren't even related to the printing department. They also expect associates to sign up every single customer for a rewards program that is entirely useless, and the only people that still shop at office supply stores already have rewards program memberships. Management requires you to take any and all coupons, regardless of expiration date, and will practically give away merchandise just for various services subscriptions. The only parts I enjoyed about this job were when I got to leave for the day and when I got my paycheck, Seriously, DO NOT WORK HERE!"
bad,When hired they will promise you a set scheduled of 40 hours and rotating weekends.  Expect to work 32 hours a week and work all weekends.  Be prepared to be under staffed at all times.
bad,"Office depot is a total corporate harbor. I don't like the people there. none of them are that friendly or welcoming. They all expect so much to be done, and don't really chat with you. You make one mistake, and it's over. So no promises. It's a stressful job and even more stressful place to work. It's huge and i got lost multiple times.."
bad,due to downsizing most of us found ourselves looking for employment.  in the beginning when privately owned it was a great place to work.  once taken public - shareholders became more important than employees as well as customers
bad,"took orders over the phone for the customers to purchase items sold by office max. "
bad,Manger was very very rude. He talked so mean to this one pregnant lady and he was so mean to me. Everyone is getting together to get him terminated he is a very mean and nasty guy.
bad,"They cut costs on AC/Heating for most stores and if you happen to be shivering or sweating its too bad. They offer a ""Competitive salary"" but you're going to get the bare minimum at best. Your breaks are short and you're normally not even left alone during them. Your coworkers are going to be the only tolerable thing about the job. This might be great if you're just trying to get your foot in the door and get some experience. You can also get a threat to be fired if you don't get rewards."
bad,"On the retail level, terrible management, unreasonable goals, either 0 hours a week or 60 hours a week, lack of trust between management and employees, threatened with unemployment for requesting a more solid balance between work/life."
bad,"Under paid, the only ones making money are management."
bad,Too many managers. Lack of communication between all who work there. No follow through with workloads among employees. Very discriminating. Managers were late and never picked up the phone. Not dependable.
bad,"I've never seen so much micromanaging in one place. The managers will literally stand one foot from you and tell you how to sweep. It's a constant what are you doing, where are you at every 30 seconds. Low moral,  because of the egotistical store manager. Sad!! They also don't follow state laws from breaks, you work 8 hours and don't get the mandated lunch and 15 just a lunch."
bad,"The management isn't very good . its like being in High School all over again . they love to isolate you out , rather your doing good they still will try their  best to male you feel less of a person."
bad,"Managers had favorite associates and barely did any work, work was boring and always a drag  and they need to treat associates better. This store needs to close down."
bad,Very negative people who only bring you down. And management is quick to compare you to other workers. Also if you’ve been there for a while when they hire new people the new people get paid more than you and that isint right.
bad,this company and the management they have is the worst I have ever seen and it is sad the corporation is amazing but the local management and the stores management was deplorable
bad,"I worked here for a year and a half and ended up working my way up the chain pretty easily but I was taken advantage of. I started off as a sales associate and made my way up to Print and Copy Supervisor. However, I always had to work overtime, I rarely got a lunch break, schedules would be changed without warning, and the pay was very low. I started at $8.40 and hour but when I was promoted, my wage was supposed to go up to $10.00 and after 4 months of being promised I would get my pay raise, it never happened. Office Max did have good management and associates at one point but regional managers have a way of driving all of the good workers away. The last manager I dealt with was a compulsive liar and messed with time clocks which ended up in me getting paid less than what I was working for. Sadly, I am not the only past employee of Office Max this has happened too. I once loved my job there but it went down hill very quickly and was an untrustworthy place to work at."
bad,Office Depot at first comes off very employee friendly. To a certain extent they are. It really depends on the manager that is over the store. It can make or break you honestly.
bad,"Awful. The company's rigid and absolute corporate structure completely steamrolls over the human element. The only focus is to reduce the damage caused by Amazon, and save the company, with little to no focus on how the employees on the ground floor are supposed to carry out that mission."
bad,This company is the must that does not have any ethics at all. From the top management to the bottom. The district managers are not doing any good for thee compaany
bad,"Terrible company to work for, useless management that does not do anything. Too much management at their warehouse who waste company time and resources."
bad,"Two perspectives, Management or Nothing. These type are jobs are great for managers as they are secure jobs and guaranteed hours. If your not a manager hours can be cut at anytime and the wages are low"
bad,"I truly don't understand how this company is still around. Not only are they extremely dysfunctional and disorganized, but they have no regard for their employees whatsoever. There are always more people to hire, so this company's firing trigger is very sensitive. We were without a store manager and assistant manager for 4 months because the company decided to fire the managers after they were attacked in our store. We asked for security multiple times, and instead of facing their actions they removed the employees and left our store in disarray for a quarter. Also we were always getting sick because of the lack of ventilation, mixed with the leaking sewage, and toxic chemicals."
bad,"If you value your self respect and mental well being I would never work for Office Depot.. Especially the print department. The combination of the ""I'm special and no one else matters"" mindset and complete disrespect for your fellow man is unbelievable."
bad,"Como jefe de área no tienes vida social los fines de semana y entre semana nunca puedes salir a tu hora. No existe una competencia por el siguiente puesto, ni importan los resultados que entregues ya que solamente  asciende los lambiscones."
bad,Corporate doesn’t care about its workers and wil almost never give you more than a 10¢ pay raise every year its the most I got without having to literally threaten to leave when I was one of 2 people they had for the printing department
bad,"Training is very minimal and they don't tell you everything you will need to know. There were several times I was told to do something, but was never told HOW to do them nor was I properly train to do then. I was basically only used to do my job (which is already a lot for the low pay) and do everyone else's job as well but I was paid the lowest salary out of everyone! Not only that, but I was mistreated by one of my co-workers who constantly did things to try and get me fired and also by one of the managers who purposely got my hours cut down to only two days a week! I worked my whole shift cashiering and cleaning up my area making sure everything was organised, then I had to go to copy and print (mind you they never trained me to do so or offered to raise my pay for me to go over there and do their jobs) and help them do EVERYTHING! Some of the main people working over there were so lazy that they wouldn't even clean up after themselves! My experience there was horrible and I often found myself feeling miserable everytime I walked into work!"
bad,"Stressful and high paced environment, very short handed and poor management. Other employees don't feel the need to help others when it is asked and the work load isn't fair for one person."
bad,They get worse every year. More work expected to be done in fewer hours and low pay. They believe one person can do the job of 2.5 people. Management is awful. No advancement at all.
bad,"Very under staffed. No training for sales or how top approach people."
bad,I worked in the recieving area and would have to first break down all the boxes and sort all the items to later be put up on the shelf. Honestly this job is a dying a job and in 10 years will probably be obsolete.
bad,Chain went bankrupt and was bought out by another company therefore i wouldn't recommend this job. However the people i worked with at this location were great.
bad,"as reflected in their stock price the company is struggling. They are committed to processes that are outmoded, Time consuming and inefficient. There is no interest in streamlining for improved efficiency. The workload/daily expectations are heavy forcing one to cut corners or fail to accomplish required tasks."
bad,The manager that i used to work for used to make me stay on register my whole 8-hour shift and my legs would honestly feel like it was made out of jelly. It was HORRIBLE.
bad,"Management was a joke, General Manager was an alcoholic who would threaten to terminate anyone who doubted his capabilities as a general manager. He was inadequate."
bad,"I remember long ago this was a great place to make money and advance.  Brick and mortar stores are a thing of the past.  Fulltime is a thing long gone outside of the store manager.  Obviously, benefits are extinct as well for newer hires."
bad,A horrible work place and everyone back stabs everyone if you mess up a job.  Manager don't care about helping you.  You are on your own working here.
bad,This company does not care about customer service.  Continuously short staffed.  Little to no training for new associates.  Does not promote from within.
bad,From rvp to dsms so negative it's one thing to say your moving forward and and another to implement  chain wide fast enough to stay relevant. The speed at which you move and the timing are key factors in staying in business. Back your a tions with the speed and passion as your speeches and training videos. Your regs are ancient and systems are slow and inadequate to achieve daily goals
bad,Not able to move up in company unless you had been with them for at least 3 years. Extremely racist against white people. Start at minimum wage reguardless of experience. Worst job I have ever had. Any time we got busy in copy and print the management would just stand in the back and watch us instead of giving us a hand.
bad,Worst job for students. Not flexible. At all. Horrible management. Lazy people. If there was more organization it might be better. No one takes responsibility for their actions.
bad,Office Depot has allowed me to enhance my selling skills and provide excellent customer service while building strong business relationships with clients.
bad,"The management here is awful. You're treated like a moron if you do your job, the tone of all managers is condescending, and as a supervisor, even when stupid and worthless associates don't do their jobs as instructed by you... you're blamed for the lack of work. Like, no, it's not my fault the team of associates YOU hired are a bunch of useless slackers."
bad,I got told i was in one department go that department for them to tell i'm not there either and they also told me no phone call or text you don't come in didn't get a phone call or text for a month so i found somewhere else to work.
bad,Don't do it. They are lazy and don't care about you. All they want is there commission it's not what's best for you. It what's best for there paycheck.
bad,"This company is abysmal. Very low pay, next to no chance for promotion, schedules are awful (3 hour days regularly), management is pushed and stressed and they take it out on employees."
bad,Company went out of business when i worked for them as office depot and closed all stores. At that time company olny care about selling protection plans and what ever possible to do that
bad,I did not enjoy my time at office depot it was very annoying having to deal with poor managing on the part of the GM everyone besides him where excellent to work with that experience severly tainted my opinion of office depot and I don't see the world of office supply retail stores lasting very much longer.
bad,At the time I was there managers never respected their employees. They all except for one never extend a helping hand. It was always you are on your own or that's not my problem. The general manager and my direct supervisor ALWAYS made it known that you are EASILY replaceable.
bad,The employees and management are awful. They are so slow paced and are so focused on not having anyone steal that they drive away customers. Very sad.
bad,"Do not waste your time working here. No room for advancement, horrible pay. Management micro-manage their staff.  Waste of time and effort on any ones part to work here."
bad,"This company does not care about this department at all. It's always short-staffed and it's always busy. You will definitely be overworked. There has been several times where the line in this department was long enough to touch the cash register, and management will still not help you. If you must take a job at Office Depot, PLEASE apply as a cashier or to work on the floor (logistics)."
bad,customers was great management was very very poor employees would now a contest was coming up and we employees would step up the pace to win cause that meant getting the manager out of the store for 2 weeks
bad,Worked there for a year. Very difficult to get pay raises. My manager was fired during my time there. Poor work environment. It was hard to keep good people since it seemed there were new people hired every month. I didn't feel safe working at night since I would be the only person on the floor with a register full of money and a manager staying in the back office.
bad,"i used to work here only stayed one year and in my department the manager is lazy chooses favorites and lets some people get away with alot never even shows up and is always off of work, overall all of the managers slack and have favorites, theres PTO and benefits and you get like 13.50 starting but dont expect 25 per hour, they max you out at 18$ no room for growth the managements lacks basic management skills nothing gets done and the work is very physical very tiring work days with no new hires and if they do hire people quit because this job honestly isn't even worth it don't waste your time"
bad,"OfficeMax (ever since purchased by OfficeDepot) has lost its focus of helping customers and instead we are trained via ARC-3 sales tactics to solely focus on selling which creates a toxic work environment and without proper management , of which there was NOT,  the whole team does not function efficiently due to drama over simple things like scheduling and other people not being held responsible for their jobs. Would recommend NOBODY EVER work here unless you know for a fact management has your best interests in mind because overall, the company does not."
bad,Was fired after almost 5 years because of giving the store manager a bad review on a employee engagement survey. All 8 longtime employees that took the survey (all where negative reviews) are now no longer with the company.
bad,I’ve worked at Office Depot for over two years and I make less than the people do just getting hired. They’re younger than me and have no experience. I do not recommend this job to anyone except maybe someone just wanting around 12 hours a week while in high school. Management is horrible and the associates will talk about everyone behind their back. Not a professional workplace at all.
bad,"aucune considération pour les salariés à qui l on dit ""si vous n êtes pas d'accord,partez!"" aucune discussion,faux dialogue,seuls les actionnaires sont entendus et payés gracieusement.Un mélange de loies françaises et américaines…."
bad,"Management was horrible. The store manager was a push over with certain employees which brought down morale. No actual management skills needed to be promoted into management role so there was a lot of incompetence. If you are used to a professional environment, do not apply for lower level sales consultant job here. Obviously."
bad,"Not a great place to work. "
bad,This company has to be the worst company to work for in America. The pay is low you are overworked and the turnover ratio is extremely high. I remember a time when I had a manager yell at an employee in the store while customers were still there. I often witness employees crying in their cars for the treatment they were receiving from their superiors. Also I remember when the district manager got fired nobody in the district received a yearly pay raise. I'm really not sure why this company is still here!
bad,"Management is abysmal"
bad,"Probably was where I worked, but they weren't helpful. It was like being in middle school. The Store manager was more into yelling then being helpful. When you left HR an anonymous complaint, the manager would go around blackmailing employees to tell him who sent it. "
bad,"I liked the job at first until we got a new store manager, now everything is HORRIBLE!!! Management lacks leadership. Not enough hours and no advancement opportunities"
bad,"I've been working at Office Depot's corporate HQ for a relatively short amount of time in the IT department. I was hesitant to make the move to this company because of the mixed reviews I've heard. However, I really feel that some of them are overly negative, and it's actually a great place to work."
bad,"Ambiance de travail peux motivante...."
bad,"Started out great. I had a manager that worked with the employees, the new manager is intolerable. If I took a meal/break it was within two hours of my shift ending. There was no support for the print department, it was impossible to properly train the new staff. Each shift was only able to have three associates and one manager available to work at a time. The store manager told me I needed to remind him that I needed a meal/break. I missed a lot of important events with my family, because I was called in/scheduled or was being constantly being called or texted on my cell phone to answer questions or give instructions to tasks pertaining to work. I have even had to go into work (unpaid) to fix something."
bad,"Tiene buen ambiente de trabajo ,hay muy buenos jefes ,la actividades son interesantes y aprendes mucho.."
bad,"In three years, the same store had three different managers. There was even more turnover at the lower levels. Bad pay. Bad benefits. Disorganized benefits department. Bad communication about benefits available that even the lowest person could access. Promotions were based on who you knew, now time in service. Stated they would rather hire within, but displayed they would rather hire someone they knew, even a relative of someone else just to get brownie points with that someone."
bad,"A job that can give you a paycheck, but not much more than that. Not a place to work if you are looking for a great career. A place to work if you are in your 20's."
bad,"District Managers not engaged, we had massive LP and theft issues and when presented with facts just put info on post it note and no follow up done.  career advancement, at the time, was slim to none for female leaders"
bad,"mucho tiempo perdido sin paga extra, bajo sueldo, supervisores despotas, quieren todo perfecto al mas minimo error ya estas llenando actas administrativas inutiles."
bad,"There is way too much emphasis on meeting sale goals/metrics.  Managers want employees to upsell and force everything from reward signups, warranties, ink subscription, paper, stamps, etc onto customers.  Most customers don't want these stuff and just want to be ranged out.    Unfortunately, employees are pressured into being annoying pushy salesman that scares off customers."
bad,just wasn't a good place to work. The people i worked with were nice just management did not care about you or your fellows co-workers..................
bad,"Computer technician and sales associate, removed harmful software and viruses from customer laptops and PC’s, custom built PC’s and laptops for customers, suggested virus protection programs and software."
bad,"Greedy management is exploitative of the customer and employees. you will be encouraged to treat the customer like a piece of meat and give the bare minimum politeness and interaction while trying to sell them things that they dont need or want. They train you to be a sleazy, pushy salesman and have no concern about the customer. The pay is very poor and there is little opportunity for raise or advancement."
bad,Pression sur les salariés. Objectifs pour les commerciaux impossibles à atteindre donc pas de primes.restriction sur tous les budgets on doit se procurer stylos papiers soi meme sans compter Que les ordinateurs sont toujours en panne...rapport a faire à son manager si 5mn de retard...licenciements abusifs...la societe fait tous les 3 ans un pse qui lui permet de licencier legalement et prend des interimaires à la place ce qui est interdit. Les syndicats se battent mais la direction se fiche des lois....de nombreux licenciements pour inaptitude car les salariés n en peuvent plus.un taux d absenteisme et d arrets de travail élevés qui démontre le mal etre des salariés.delocalisation des services en Roumanie .nepostulez pas c est une société qui vous rendra dépressif
bad,"District and store management were terrible. Would on short notice disapprove previously approved time off requests. Store manager was unwilling to address conflicts between department managers and associates and allowed insubordination to occur with our consequences, Showed favoritism in scheduling and required only certain managers to work all holidays and all closing shifts even though company policy required a rotating schedule with managers and all management available on holidays."
bad,"You will spend more time there then at home. There is an unwritten policy that management rates female employees on a scale, and if a low score is given they will spread rumors about that person and write them up for unecessary things (going to the bathroom twice in a five hour period) until she quits or is fired."
bad,"Low wages, poor management, horrible staffing. Hours are scarce at first then when you bend over backwards then you get noticed and work all day, everyday."
bad,"The store manager told many people that they task/work to much, and all you were suppost to do is stand around. But when the job wasn't getting done you got introuble for that as well!"
bad,une entreprise qui se soucie guère de son personnel
bad,"You are just a body and the more you do the less appreciated you feel, because then they want more from you and stop caring.  For instance, I increased sales 33% in my department, and I told management I wanted Mon-Fri hours which for the Copy and Print department is realistic.  Management agreed to my terms, and then reneged on those terms, also was supposed to full time, but rarely go more than 30 hours."
bad,Felt taken advantage of as an employee of this company. Worked here for numerous years without any merit increase. Each year my workload would double and my pay would remain the same. It was a terrible work envionment with horrible morale and awful leadership extremely disconnected from its people.
bad,"This was by far the most horrible place that I ever worked at."
bad,Bad work environment a lot of favoritism no room for growth Low pay for the work that is done bad management no training  low hours And just an all around bad place to work
bad,"From the hours to the management, everything about this job is worse than heII. It was a last resort option for me and the minute I found something else I got out"
bad,"If I did my job and my team outsold the boss, then I would get called in the next day while the Store Manager would lecture me about not getting the Pen wall perfect.  Hapened every time my sales beat his by 20%."
bad,muy mala administración de la empresa y tratan al personal como su uno les hiciera el favor.
bad,"Lawton Oklahoma would be considered a military/baby boomer city. In the past, stores that sold computers and supplies worked very well. Now a days, you have to have a catch. Service packs, package deals, add ons and tech services is what drives the company. It's kinda scary knowing that employees don't have to meet qualifications to fix computer these days thanks to the companys YouTube videos. Office depot is now servicing, the third world business man. The hardest thing about working for the company was knowing about the lawsuit, but lying to customers about pc tune ups. Even when addressing to customers that the company has a new way to diagnose computers. The system is actually the same one from the past, just polished up with more questions. The company gives you so much false information, that everyone working will give you a different answer. With so many sales goals, but lack of customers. It makes it hard to function as a business. The staff is always changing, and every year the store has a new management team. If the corporate lets things change so much, then what makes the employee feel safe?"
bad,basic customer service job / doesn't pay well / hours are low / room for advancement in managing if retail is the career for you. don't expect much in return for your hard work
bad,"Most of the employees are poorly trained as a result of the poor management. New associates are held responsible for mistakes that none of the uppers informed them of. They expect everyone to learn things on their own. The managers themselves don't even have knowledge of some areas of the store. If you don't make this job your life, they will not appreciate you."
bad,The maneger will have there best person by talking to them haveing fun laughing and they protect there best friend employe this  maneger Marrty  and the supervisor mellisa white gril is mean she gives u a bad look.
bad,"It was unbareable to work at Office Depot. Manager would frequently humiliate me in front of customers, would insult me and my family personally, and sexually harassed me. At one point I was also getting two hours a week."
bad,Poor management at several locations with a lack of training. Copy and print department has only one person in the department when there can be up to 7 customers at one time.
bad,Working there was hard to recover from. 10 hour work days during busy season as well a chance of working 7 days a week. Friendly people always willing to help when they have a chance to.
bad,"Poor leadership, acute favortism. Place was a joke unless you were an 18-yr-old girl... then management treated you like a princess and if not you were treated as 3rd world laborer."
bad,"My biggest grip was the schedule. I would be scheduled for 8 hours but after the store closed I still needed to stay and help stage shelves for the next day, and that could take hours."
bad,"Worked at Office Depot for 4 years "
bad,"When the company merged was a disaster, i was working for almost 4 years and eliminated my position, then they hire another HR person. The company never accept new ideas, everything come from Corporate. No opportunities to growth or advancement."
bad,"Stop trying to get me to write reviews for every single one of my old jobs, you should ask me if I would LIKE to do so, instead of forcing it, in order for me to apply to jobs."
bad,Laid off 2 weeks after i finished training.  The severance package was nice but overall this place sucked to work at either way. its a dying company to say the least
bad,Worked for Office Depot for 14 years. Worked my way up to assistant Store Manager. There is constant restructures of the company. Corporate is in unappreciative of the hard work their employees do. You are just a  number. I would not recommend to work for this company.
bad,"Office Max was the worst place I have ever worked. The pay is terrible for all that you do. Where i worked, the manager was not a nice person who only cared about herself. It began with me hurting my back outside of work and bringing in a note from my chiropractor that stated “no heavy lifting for 2 weeks.” She then proceeded to tell me “that sucks because youre doing chairs.” Then made me lift chairs and desks by myself no matter how much i had asked for help. She verbally abused me constantly. Called me names. And HR did NOTHING the 2 times that I called them. Most disorganized place ever as well."
bad,"The head manager takes pride in making all employees at some point cry about simple tasks that are blown out of proportion, via those perks cards or some other very small scripted tasks. If at any point a employee or their spouse is ill and must rest, then expect to either be replaced in a matter of two days. This location also violates copy right laws DAILY! Printing Disney and various other well known corporations and publishing houses, for the sake of ""Well we need the money"""
bad,"Unrealistic goals with no support to managers, no opportunity for a healthy work life balance. There is minimal support for the staff and unrealistic expectations."
bad,"The store is terrible, the customers are often angry and aggressive, the managers are apathetic and provide little or no guidance despite immediately expecting results."
bad,it was a ok first job I think I was just put with not very nice people if that would have changed then I think I might have liked it I did learn a few things that I never knew
bad,"Management was terrible, pay was low. There was no training for working in Print Department. Customers were unhappy and management would not always be able to help."
bad,Nothing really good to say about this place. I guess they did leave you becwhen you were working. It was just too much chaos and pretty poor management.
bad,this job is stressful ...no home work life balance... no room for advancement once you are store manager ...they hire external instead of giving internal employees an opportunity
bad,This is not the kind of job people stay with. I was there long enough to find a job in my field. This is an okay place for teenagers or someone to do while they find something better.
bad,I worked for office depot for many years at different locations and all of them pretty much had the same issues in the print department.  We were over worked and under paid. No one wants to work in the print department so the hire whoever applies and keep them even if they arent doing their job so they have a body there
bad,"Help customers and provide them with excellent service, help design and print business cards, stock shelves, hardest part of the job was time management"
bad,"Able to move up quickly, but tasks are endless. Always redoing company standards. No actually training for leaders or team. Cutting payroll during busy times to look better to stock holders. Poor company business plan for the future."
bad,"The absolute worst job experience in my 18 years of working. The company rolls out new programs with no explanation and all of the equipment is constantly breaking because it's ancient. Instead of upgrading the actual computers, they just keep updating the junky old ones with new technology which constantly makes them freeze and crash. They even decided to cut back on energy costs by shutting off half the lights in the store which only makes customers complain that can't see and therefore can't find what they are looking for. They keep reducing the amount of management and full time positions, and reduce the amount of payroll given to the store but expect you to get more things done with less employees and man hours. This company is laughable!"
bad,they have very poor management. They do not respect employee's. the company is going under for not giving management lessons on how to work as a team .
bad,"Go in handle things like refilling paper and then helping customers helping with cashiering if needed I do pretty much a little bit of everything I learned cashiering and patients management has increasingly become belligerent towards their employees and their needs the hardest part is not getting the hours needed begging for them just so you can survive but them hiring, even more, people that they don't need to the most enjoyable is having friends there"
bad,"For seventeen months I have work there, the pay was not that great. I would recommend you work there if you need some extra cash or need the money or help"
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone. The company Corp office is all over place. Upper Management is in a false reality of what is really going on.
bad,"Was hired as a manager trainee and after a few weeks there was a 'restructuring' and was bumped back, as was almost every other manager to an hourly position, less hours, fewer benefits and no firm schedule."
bad,"Favortism, bias, unethical, ignorant, and unprofessional. Long hours to due to poor management skills. Uneducated management. No room for advancement unless you are a friend of management or kissing butt."
bad,They will pay you the minimum and load as many responsibilities on you as possible. Extremely understaffed because of the manager's poor management style. They will ask you to approve unethical transactions with customers. It does not feel safe to work for them. In the span of 1 year two convicts were hired and stole thousands of dollars out of the safe and cash registers. NOT RECOMMENDED
bad,"Poor Management, Unsavory Employees, Rude responses from both about everything. The only thing pleasant about this place were the repeat customers. It is baffling as to why they come back and I am retaining the opinion that is was only location that keeps them in business. I could write a book on the misdealing and tragedies of this Location but to what result? When the corporation turns a blind eye to the store chain operations the whole company is in crisis."
bad,"The company is gone, Office Depot bought a start up and never really wanted it.  They ultimately dissolved the company and removed its own credibility in the field."
bad,"Do not apply here if you have any self-respect whatsoever. You'll regret it.They will pay you less than you are worth, work you like a dog, and never be satisfied. They will push you to the limits of human endurance, and then rain criticism upon your head like holy water at a baptism. Stay as far away as you can."
bad,I can't say my experience at this job was all that great. The store was always very slow and not really booming with customers and manager would get rather nervous if there isn't enough customers.
bad,I'm  a recent employee of the Office Depot in Mesquite 0156. After only 4 months I decided that the environment was not a good fit. So I gave my Store Manager my resignation given her 30 days to find a replacement. Then all of a sudden she started degrading me along with her other managers. I decided to resign to days before my 30 days was up. ASM started sending me harassing text message so I decided to call HR and file a complaint. Someone from regional called and never heard back from Human Resources. So now I'm about to get a lawyer. The reason is if you don't say an thing or report the abuse in the work environment companies like this thinks it okay. Nevin Thomas (ASM) Karen Bowers (SM). They are the most unprofessional people I've ever known worst experience ever in 15 years of management.
bad,No respect for employees who invested years in helping build the business and then actually penalized them with a 30% or more pay cut and eliminated their positions and offered lower positions in departments they were not familiar with and given no training.  The culture had changed so much that I left after 14 years on learning I would not be considered for management because of my position that when I expressed concerns and needs to managers and was told they could not do anything because the company did not want to spend money to fix staffing issues and a variety of others problems inherent in how they did business.
bad,"I was wrongfully terminated.  My GM sexually discriminated me when a co worker witnessed it first hand in a meeting,  he reported it to corporate shortly after I was terminated!"
bad,"I learned in order to make real money I had to go back to school, the pay was poor management was OK the most enjoyable part of the job was I got to work with computers"
bad,"The location was a mess, too many managers, and too few employees. Constantly understaffed and the training was minimal. Resulted in under trained employees handling their own work and that of 2 other jobs. Compensation was minimum required and certainly no benefits supplied. The job was stressful and dehumanizing, pay was so low I was homeless for a few months whilst working there and lived on pasta and potatoes. "
bad,"You literally stand there all day in a boring and slow moving pace of the day. you learn mostly nothing while there and until I moved to operations it seemed like I could fall asleep and nobody would care they say they are great on customer service but really they are only good on customer service to the rich looking or people who spend money on there ""insurance plan"" which does not cover what they say it does and once your item breaks they tell you its not there problem when they tell multiple people that they can come on in with it and they will take care of everything"
bad,"Office Depot was my first official job, and I regret working there every minute. No benefits and extremely low wages. They make you pay for your own uniform, and breaks are really short."
bad,great place to work if you want to dedicate your life to ungrateful and inconsiderate people. the customers are rude and so are the managers. They do not accommodate for their employees because they think of themselves first.
bad,Typical day is very stressful and unorganized. Manager Team are very un-employe oriented and more into satisfy the customer and give them the reason at any cost.
bad,"The management at all locations I worked at were poor"
bad,not the best company to work for. does not provide good benefits or good pay. very mismanaged. constant problems and issues. would never work here again.
bad,"Never did like that job all that well that was very minimum wage and the uniforms were bad and uncomfortable to a point where I didn't enjoy job, but that is be expected on 1st job in 2003."
bad,"Office depot is what Office depot always was, a franchise where you do not find advancement within your own environment. Most people would look to find advancement within their own establishment; however that is hardly never the case at Office Depot."
bad,Office Depot was very stressful and nerve wrecking at most times due to lack of training and experience from most employees and management. Management leaned on employees to do all jibs in the store.
bad,I work in the warehouse in kck the gm don't know he's doing fires good ppl and hires all his friend worst job I ever had.I was promise for a year I was gonna be a lead I was getting paid 13.35 after a year and was doing my job and a leads job at the same time. While charlie was putting other pol in the lead spot that didnt know noting about the department. I was a picker and I was there wen it was still office max. This place will suck the life out of you and you will never go no where with this company with the gm they have.
bad,"Work is inconsistent. They make sure to only work you part time so they do not need to provide benefits to their employees. Their goal is to over charge and up sell their customers and they push their associates to do this actively with every customer. Scheduling is inconsistent. Threat of losing your job if you stick around too long to finish helping a customer towards the end of your shift. Hostile, hot and dirty workplace. I was provided a used uniform shirt that did not fit and had bodily fluid stains and told I had to wear it or lose my job. Refused to provide clean uniform."
bad,A typical work day is show up early get told to do things go home tired if you are working hard enough. Management does not keep their promises and likes to threaten your job on the daily. Pay is subpar also. Corporate and district managers are a joke. They only care about themselves. Nothing about this job was enjoyable and the hardest part was dealing with forcing rewards sign ups down people throats who do not want them.
bad,The schedule I was it was extremely awful it was night shifts and the paid wasn't worth it. a lot of work I hurt my back and they didn't care about it that why i have to leave the job
bad,"I dont think office depot itself is the problem.  At the time of my employment at the particular retail location, management seemed to be in a bad place.  The higher-ups were constantly on you because they knew had bad of shape the store was end.  They feared for their jobs, so they made you fear for yours"
bad,"I was a cashier with hopes of moving up. I had the experience and drive, my numbers were the highest in the store and I always managed to cover for others when needed. When it came time to be moved up into a management position, I was informed that the other person needed it more than me and that there would be other opportunities. They were later fired, and I was then offered the position but it was just too late. I felt a person should not get a job based off need."
bad,"Do not work at Office Depot. The equipment and sales procedures are completely outdated and everything is always breaking down. They lie about how many hours you will receive, and managers are allowed to scream at associates in front of customers, threaten to blacklist you if you quit, and say things (in front of customers), ""Have you been gaining weight? You know the skinny sales associates sell more protection plans."" I got next to zero training."
bad,"Es una empresa que no ha evolucionado ni actúa en el tiempo presente. "
bad,Store was overly concerned with their production and not the quality that was produced. The management was not qAULITY. Not a good place for a college student
bad,"I have a degree in Graphic Design work part-time $8.00 hr.,working 10 hrs a week or less, favoritism based, work for pennies a day, no breaks, very bad"
bad,"if you want a job where everyone watches you work, then apply for this place. you will work and everyone will say that you dont work hard enough........"
bad,Very unorganized very untimely with raises lack of leadership and consistency. Too much Red tape for promotions. When warnings for job performance no follow up paperwork.
bad,Worst place to work they never had enough staff managers were incompetent! They made you work ridiculous hours! I regret ever working here. Luckily this place closed down!
bad,"I worked hard for Office Depot for over 8 years. I was in management. If you consider working for Office Depot in ANY position, you can expect to be beat down about numbers on a daily basis. You will also be subjected to frequent job threats if you don't ""perform"" the sales and incentive programs."
bad,"When work was flowing, everything was fast paced. Management wasn't always available to answer questions. It was a temp job, but I did find myself making some good friends to this day."
bad,"There is an impossibly high sales goal and pressure to push ""Insurance"" computers and printers.  The management are the worst people in the world as they are doomed to work in this trap for the rest of their lives and they pass the positivity on down the line. "
bad,"They are a terrible, selfish, unprofessional company to work for in Byatown Tx. Garth Road. The upper management was filled with gossipping, fat pigs.They did not allow enough hours for the people that deserved them and were rude to the employees."
bad,"Working with office depot has helped me to realize that  when your work isn't appreciated you arnt appreciated,so it lead  me to believe  that my hard and honest  work  will  be appreciated  elsewhere."
bad,"While working there I was ridicule because of my disability by management.  They refused to give me reasonable accommodations.  I was hired for one position which paid one dollar amount, but was told I wouldn't be good fit for that position and was moved to a higher paying position but pay stayed the same.  Several of their Computer tech were scamming and stealing from customers and many times got away with it to my knowledge."
bad,"Long work days, loading trucks, bad management, hostile work place  you do not know what time you will get off getting off"
bad,"The management at my store was horrible. As a salesman, my hours got cut whenever I sold more than the store manager. Eventually I was pared down to morning stock person, with most of my shift before we even opened, and was expected to keep my sales numbers up. Products were mediocre at best, the 'protection plans' were a sham, and all of the 'repair services' could have been done by kindergartener."
bad,"a typical day at office depot was easy at times but it could also get very stressful, and the workload was very heavy. The customers were rude but that didn't bother me and we got paid bi-weekly."
bad,"Worst company to work for. Not a secure job, they do not care about employees.A typical day at work was very stressful. Hardest part was the drama."
bad,"Management was very lazy and didn't want to assist customers with questions."
bad,"A typical day at work is stocking, recovery, and customer service. Along with other task thru out the day. I learned more about sales, computers, and printing different sorts of jobs. Management is okay but not the best. Co workers are friendly. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unfriendly public. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing planos because thats what I enjoy doing."
bad,"This place sucked, they didn't offer benefits if you weren't working full time regularly and the culture and management sucked."
bad,The branch I was a part of was shorthanded and struggling. It seemed like no one really knew what was going on. Really no punishment or repercussions toward negative actions
bad,Not a fun place to work. I can not think of anything good to say about this company. No one gets promoted to store manager. They all got hired from outside and trained in-house from my experience.
bad,"The title basically says it all. They do not value their employees like they should. Overworked, underpaid, and minimal hours. And they think people want to work there?"
bad,Management was poorly managed from the top all the way down.  Benefits were less than sub par.  Employees were treated poorly.
bad,"Horrible company, under paid, they have been in two scandals, no benefits, they only want money, horrible service. The manager would bend over backwards for the customer only have it lead to us being yelled at because we couldn't reach our numbers."
bad,"Office max is a very hot unkept and unpleasant, it is a isolating environment. I wouldnt recommend it as its a poor sustained place and there is a lack of training"
bad,"Very low staff. We find ourselves having to take on many jobs in one shift, mentally and physically putting an overwhelming strain on the whole staff. Customers are not understanding and impatient."
bad,"N/A I worked their for 4 yrs and was an operations manager, very diverse employee  atmosphere, and opportunities for growth."
bad,"Horrible company"
bad,it was absolutely horrible working for office depot.  They only care about the bottom line dollar made every day and couldn't care less if they were ripping the customers off.
bad,"The company itself is a joke. They continue to cut payroll, continue to hire terrible managers who don't provide any support. And they don't tell you when you work until a few days before."
bad,"I love my job but , I need to do something different in life. I work hard. It is a print shop. We do a lot of orders. My co-workers are nice people. People not listening. Enjoyable time is when the orders go out right."
bad,"When I started working here I believed they'd let me into their clicks after a while. A year later and I was still the odd ball out, everything was my fault, even on things I didn't ever touch or know about."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had. Constantly changing schedules, no communication between employees and management. I started coming in at 7:30 then changed to 8 then to 9. Now it may change to 10. All within 3 months of working here. When it's busy they expect you to work 12+ hours everyday and when it's not they try and keep you under 40 hours a week off a minimum salary! No matter you're experience they will start you with bottom pay. When I had my interview they told me the starting pay was 12.50 hr for equipment operators. I asked for 13.50 and never heard anything else about it. Turnover rate is high and nobody is ever happy to come to work. It's a lot of people who are itching to find another job do to the treatment of employees. I always wonders why they called me within 5 mins of me putting in my application. The only real positive I can say about this job is the people you meet but even that's not worth your sanity."
bad,"Management does not care about their employees. I feel like this company is going to go down hill. All managment cares about is how many rewards sign ups you get. Store is always under staffed. No one wants to help you. People call off all the time. As with any retail job, you are constantly repeating yourself. Customers are awful, always throwing money at you etc. The pay is absolute garbage for what you have to deal with in any given day. District Managers have no clue whats going on in their stores, or about customer service. Using slogans and key words isnt going to convince people to get a serivce and spend more money. I wouldnt wish this place on anybody. Stay far far away. Its a great job if you are 16 and have nothing to do with your life. People quit and walk out all the time. Good Luck"
bad,Upper Management comes and visits every couple of months and finds problems that aren't there. They are an unorganized company. They fire good managers and put even worse ones into power just to prove a point.
bad,"My typical day at office depot was always pleasant. I loved my job and took pride in my work. I learned how to use Photoshop, excel, word, power point and I also learned how to make business cards, flyers, banners and booklets."
bad,Bad pay and not good benefits. I also feel that the management is not very good at all they need to find new management that treats the employees better.
bad,Don't ever work for this company or any of its subsidiaries.  They are failing and under incompetent management.  Unrealistic goals set for employee with harsh punishments for not meeting them
bad,"Office Depot is a failing dying franchise. The managers are being squeezed to do anything to make a sale. Working there the fear and panic was palpable."
bad,"I've worked for this company for four years. In that time, I've gone from making a good bit more than minimum to making minimum wage. I was promised a promotion twice now and both times it has been given to someone else, someone brand new to the company."
bad,Probably one my worst experiences in every way. unfriendly work environment with little sense of team work and weak management led cooperate to shut the branch down.
bad,Before the merger OfficeMax was an enjoyable workplace. after the merger it became obvious that it was not a merger but a buyout.
bad,"muchas áreas de oportunidad, buen ambiente laboral, buenos jefes"
bad,"Micro management will make your head boil."
bad,Employees are undervalued and over worked. The training programs are terrible. If you're a good salesman then you can maybe make an extra few dollars a month.
bad,I do not wish to divulge any information at this time. All I can say is after the corporate merger with Office Max and Office Depot the whole infrastructure needs a reboot.
bad,"The company only cares about their bottom line. Benefits lame. Pay lame. (I made more on unemployment than full-time!)"
bad,fun work place with supportive managemnet. decent amount of red tape and plitics. limited to 3rd shift and located in a bad area.
bad,"i thought i already did a review on them but i have no problem going back over the horrific time i had working for this company they hired alot of  individuals which made the work area kind of hard to work in because these were all l men . As a young 21 year old man i had never been approached by someone who was head of operations in a l manner but this sadly happened multiple times while at the Office Depot Located On Post And Paddock In Grand Praire , TX . While at meetings our manager would throw l slurs at his male staff very unbusiness like"
bad,"Be sure you check your schedule often as it will constantly change and you will talked down for not showing up on days you were not originally scheduled. One co-worker would take pictures of their schedule with their phone to keep this from happening. Do not expect anywhere close to 40 hours. You will need a second job to support your family. You will have to work Thanksgiving evening. You have to pay for your own Office Depot shirt even though they require you to wear it. Take another regular shirt to change into during your lunch break or when clocking in or out, because if a customer stops you on your way you are still expected to assist that customer even though you are off the clock. You only get 30 minutes for lunch. Bathrooms are cleaned only when a certain few are working. If that isn't bad enough you should see the refrigerator and microwave in the break room. The manager has her favorites who will take extended ""breaks"" watching football in the break room or on the Tech's computer and not a thing will be said. One assistant store manager went to sleep in the office and employees were on their own. You are expected to be excited to work for the company and show them loyalty while it feels that they treat you as expendable. Be prepared to bust your butt so your store manager can win bonuses, trips to concerts in Vegas and NYC and other incentives. Do not expect job advancement at this store. I saw 2 long time employees passed over and outside people hired instead. The passed over employees had to help train the outside hires for the positions for which they were they"
bad,Nothing but drama there the hours are NOT flexible at all! Nobody stays for long. You will be judged and talked badly about. you get scheduled when they want you regardless of your availability.
bad,"Manager was horrible, she was bipolar and took out her bad moods on the employees.  During christmas she scheduled no one to help in the busy area causing dissatisfied customers and added stress on me.  Got in my face threatening me."
bad,This company shows you no respect. They treat you like animals and expect more than the job pays. They are an awful place to work at.
bad,Not the best place to work at. They don't care about staff and the company is unstable from a financial standpoint. Overworked and overlooked is how they view employees.
bad,"You are expected to know everything and do tasks that are not for unskilled workers but are paid as such. If you work in copy & print department you are expected to design, do passports, book bind, create stamps, trouble shoot programs and other technical issues, be certified in shipping for both UPS and USPS and that's in addition to the normal retail duties of checking out customers and sales. There is also tech support and other department that require intelligence and skill but they only pay minimum wage. "
bad,Rude managers towards staff. Disrespectful towards others.  I learned just to do the job and then clock out when shift was complete.
bad,this job was horrible. angry customers constantly screaming and cussing at you. supervisors do not care how rude the customers are. they rarely took calls forwarded to them.
bad,nice place to work but the managers are very strict not fun to work with. Very poor management. Days are vey slow and the co-workers are good an lunches are fun. Every day you learn different stuff.
bad,"Management is a joke. Your hours are ridiculously dependent on staying from 1-10pm at night. Also you take the blame if you get hurt, that is right. You get hurt! If management messes up on your attendance or just doesn't like you because of something someone says you basically get in trouble for no reason. "
bad,"Typically you try to help customers when they can't find something. I learned that having a manager that knows what they are doing will make a big difference in the workplace. The manager was in and out of the store constantly, never could make up his mind or give clear directions. Even accused a couple of people of stealing money from the register, even though store cameras assured that they weren't. The co-workers were the only thing that kept me at that job for as long as I worked there. They were friendly hard working people. The hardest part of the job was trying to finish any task given to you by the manager, since he never gave you clear directions on how he wanted something done and would get mad because you apparently didn't do it correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the store manage would go home for the day because the store would suddenly start running smoothly."
bad,No room for improvement and poor direction on how to get to where you want to be. Not to be taken seriously due to the lack of leadership.
bad,good job for college students long hrs low pay no advancements dirty and dusty work environment management is inexperienced and undertrained
bad,"As with any job, there are pros and cons; however, I enjoy working with all of my colleagues and employers. The hardest part was the balance of three jobs. The best part of this job was communicating with the public."
bad,"Las labores inician a la 7 am, cambio de precios ,promociones,se baja el top y el mid,se surte mercancía,se atiende clientes cuando es necesario."
bad,"Store Manager of an Office Depot Store, but feel more like an owner than just an operator. I am responsible for P&L driven annual sales of 4 million in a 18k sq ft store. My number #1 priority is Customer Service, as Store Manager I spend a great deal of my time on a daily basis on the sales floor taking care of customers and associates alike. I greet customers as they enter the store and say thanks to them as they leave, along with being responsible for recruiting, hiring, and training of all new associates and managers. I train associates to perform as a team, and spend alot of time cross training for multiple positions within the store. I train and develop assistant and department managers through the delegation and follow up process until they are prepared for the next level. The store is maintained by the team using training, coaching, counseling, follow up, feedback, etc. I am responsible for ensuring all tasks are completed through the delegation process in a timely manner to include; merchandising, planograms, stocking, scheduling, inventory control, and cleaning. I personally oversee safety, loss prevention, management recruiting, and the overall well being of my associates. The duties and responsibilities of a Store Manager go on and on. The most important part of being a manager is taking care of people."
bad,I only got 4 hours a week because the boss was mad at me for 2 months what is that
bad,"its a terrible place full of terrible people. they don't help you understand what to do, then when you do it wrong you get in a lot of trouble. the people are rude. your expected to do a whole load of work for close to nothing and do it as fast as you can."
bad,"Do not work here."
bad,Stores closing down and constant layoffs.  Not an ideal place for employment.
bad,"the worst job you could ever imagine.. now multiply that by 1000 and that's Office Depot. I was the assistant manager for almost a year and then they restructured the company and did away with ""assistant managers"" and they cancelled overtime ($7,000 they took instantly away from me! and the district manager said ""I understand if you need to get another part time job to supplement the lost income!) then made me an associate manager.. then 3 months ago they brought back the assistant manager position and didn't give the old assistant managers their title back or overtime. The only good thing about the job was after you worked you 40 hrs, that was it. I worked every single holiday and almost every single weekend.. not family friendly.. no advancement  opportunity.. and they have to work 8am-9pm on thanksgiving... your soul will be sucked into a deep dark hole that will never see the light unless you quit and get another job... needless to say- I quit.."
bad,Wasn't the right job for me. Poor management. Nothing was ever consistent
bad,job and family balance hours constantly changing and no communication with te reg employees and mangement
bad,There is no structure at store #02138. No one communicates and you work for more than what you earn.
bad,"No proper training, disorganized, management needs improvement or be available altogether, and not a ""team"" friendly environment. Slave driving company that demands full attention. This job requires as much hours as possible, staying later and doing over time is no surprise. It's a very demanding environment that is not recommended for people going to school or have a 2nd job. "
bad,I resigned my position here at office depot due to the horrible treatment I received from my boss.
bad,"Manager was fired within the 3 months I stayed in this dump (and he worked there for over a decade) . There was no notification of his departure, I had to find out by asking a co worker ."
bad,"This is just my personal opinion for the Aurora store."
bad,temp work.... hard work long hours. Great pay. Some benefits
bad,I did not enjoy working for OD at all. Management is terrible. Only stayed for 4 months.
bad,"if you have a family especially with small children this isn't the job for     "
bad,A customer will come in and ask for something.we show them and they checkout.its as easy as 123.
bad,The manager was very helping towards women but acted like the men should already know what to do and would treat every one differently.
bad,"Ready to change career, been in retail for over 35 years. Looking for a mon -fri , Customer service and managing peoples has been my strengths."
bad,"I hated working at Office Depot, they cuss you out all the time and expect you to know everything"
bad,they closed with out no warning they treated us well til the end
bad,"There is no way I could possibly be paid enough to work for this company again. I basically managed the ImPress department, while the man with the title of ""ImPress Supervisor"" refused to learn new technology and continually argued when things weren't done his way. Co-workers I trained were given higher raises and brought on at higher grades of pay than myself, even though I had the highest customer approval rating in the District. Only FT position available was given to a new hire with no concept of what they were doing, who took work orders and left me to finish them on time. No commission for graphic design, no claim to any design created in-house, but serious punishment for not making customers happy. In the span of 3 years I accumulated a total raise of $0.41 over my original pay grade, in spite of five-star reviews."
bad,I have caught 5 employees stealing from the company and reported it to the store manager.  The manager does nothing with this information.  I contact HR and I get a final warning for termination.  I have no write ups or occurrences.  This is just a backwards company who protects the poor work ethic and punishes motivated and hard working employees!
bad,"I loved my job there."
bad,The store was very under staffed and could not communicate to get things done.
bad,"not really a good place to work at. certain mangers do the job right...but they never teach you... a different work area. they want you to learn new things on one day. if your a fast learner you will get it...but if not, be ready to get annoyed. Ill never tell a person to work there. horrible job and horrible employees... you been warn"
bad,"A typical work day at the distribution center can be compared to legalized slavery.  You work your butt off to only be told it's not enough.  Managers have goals that they don't understand themselves because of their lack of knowledge of the systems.  I learned that if you want to be treated like an adult do not work for this company.  Office Depot treats everyone like their a number and has no integrity.  They try to put numbers to things that can’t be judged by a number.  The co-workers are fine, they are people who know no other way but warehousing so the company takes advantage of them.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of appreciation.  Asking people to do things you can't do yourself.  To fully understand the productivity of a job, you should at least try it once.  Otherwise you demanding people do something you’re not even sure can be done.  An average is just that, a number obtained by a high and a low.  To know how the system can be cheated you must do the tasks.  The people below the line might be more productive than the ones above it who know how to cheat the system and many other variables. The most enjoyable part of this job is the last day your there."
bad,"Treated poorly by management"
bad,"no room for improvement, "
bad,Only benefits is a 10% discount on certain things in the store. Other than that they work you only when needed even with an open availibilty. 
bad,"The job is fine loved the customer they came through most regular. But the management give you no respect, when you're badly sick evening when you're in the hospital. they still expect you to come in to work or you're job is on the line."
bad,I worked there for 5 years and couldn't get full time or get a decent raise(45 cents total in 5 years). The whole management team was a joke. They would come in late everyday and the store manager would come and go as he pleases.They told me they couldn't make me full time because they didn't have an opening for one and yet they would hire a bunch of part timers to take up the hours. I called the hotline about a manager and she confronted me on the floor during business hours about it and started to go off on me. She didn't get in trouble for that. Office Depot is garbage!
bad,"Office Depot was a very slow paced job, not really much going on with the store. The staff there were not very helpful and the managment was not either."
bad,"If you enjoy being Yelled at, Belittled, Undermined and treated like the lowest form of life on earth, then this job is right for you. The management team is TERRIBLE even after MULTIPLE rotations out of new management they are the same if not worse than the last crew. One manager is a complete Pathological liar, the store manager only cares about things if it makes him look bad, all while tooting his own horn about how awesome he is. As well as taking credit for other people's work. The other manager just argues with you to where she always wins, and the other manager is just trying to keep his head above the water."
bad,"This was a very stressful job. As a cashier they expect you to literally do everything. You have to answer all phone lines, ring up customers while greeting incoming customers. They want you to ask so many questions to each customer and you end up upsetting them by the end of the transaction. If you do not get enough worklife reward cards and protection plans they cut your hours extremely. A lot of the times I was the only cashier for several hours before I would get anyone else to come in and relieve me for lunch or to get off work. The only thing I enjoyed about working there were my regular customers. They made it worth coming to work and dealing with all the stress of being a minium wage cashier. I was there for about 2.5 years and never once got a raise for all my hard work."
bad,I gave it my all and received ungrateful attitude from managers. Things were always stolen. Only one or two cameras in the entire store. Barely security. Didn't get promoted/advance regardless of the many compliments the customers put out for me. Some of the customers recognized me because of my service and smile to them
bad,"Its good for what it is, but then again I hated it"
bad,A typical day at work for me starts at 8am i come in turn on all machines that need to be turned on and look over jobs that were left to be completed from the night before. Until about 11am i work on jobs that were left from the night before or jobs that have came in during the morning.From this job i have learned patience and just to keep working hard and never give up. The management here sucks. The manager is rude and so aggravating at times. Half the time you can't ask him a question without getting yelled at. We done get long enough breaks we are told to hurry up hurry up. Half the time we get call stupid or worse. My co-workers are wonderful very positive and willing to help everyone. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to work with wonderful people and getting to help all the customers.
bad,terrible company to work for! Do not know what they are doing. No family values.
bad,"I was mislead about my position from the word go. I came to learn it was a pilot program and after ramping up from scratch, the entire team was let go after only 6 months!"
bad,"In my store, management talks down to you and treats you like a dog. Regardless of how much money you can make for this store, you are made to feel as though you are not intelligent, and a waste of their time and space. This is the worst job i have literally ever worked for. This is why the associate turn-over is so high because for all the work you are expected to complete you are not compensated monetarily."
bad,A fast pace retail floor. I was able to apply my knowledge and skillset of what takes to dominate a maket.
bad,"I was the morning customer service speacilist who helped customers with returns/exchanges and ring up the purches. I also I had to answer the phone calls and if the employee the asked for was to busy i took a message. I had to stock ink every friday and monday and make sure to keep it stocked in between new shipments and stocking that on fridays and mondays. Sundays I would go in to help tear,print and set add for the week."
bad,"Hours are not conducive anymore, no advancement, and poor pay. Not valued as an employee, poor management."
bad,"Extremely poor leadership, and the level of micromanagement was unbelievable. The usual lousy pay for retail work. Updating over the headset of your location and activities constantly was the most ridiculous example of micromanagement I've ever encountered. Only one break every six hours. The store director had a penchant for screaming at employees on the floor in front of customers for various irregularities in the shelf stocking. Bad system for clocking in and out via the computer...I worked there over a week before it actually worked. Also, the store director insisted on a doctor's note for absences due to illness, which I've never encountered before. Unrealistic goals and expectations were the norm since the implementation of the ICSE program. Two weeks there was all I could take."
bad,nothing was good I hated this job the only thing was i made money there and got some hours.
bad,The Business was unprofessional. Managers were unprofessional. I also wanted to get away from the retail environment.
bad,This job had very unethical and unprofessional management. All of the managers hung together outside of the workplace and during work they would all huddle together and converse amongst themselves ignoring any calls for help from a manager.
bad,"Office Depot was one of the WORST jobs I've ever had. Horrible pay, Horrible management and being forced to work overtime cause me to fall behind in my classes in college"
bad,"The Office Depot I worked at refused to compensate adequate work and experience with the varying levels of promotions that were available. The work was commission based focused on selling tech services and repairing of PC's, but they'd use commission to cheat you out of your pay. The commission IS NOT individual based, but the rate is store based, even though your sales are individual based, resulting in a contradictory system that guarantees commission failure."
bad,"Manager at my Store was horrible. Cares nothing but for himself. Not thinking of the workers, and only worry about the customers on how big you can fill their basket with stuff that they don't want nor need."
bad,lacks leadership
bad,Not enough time there to form an opinion.
bad,"This place is not a good place to work. Every few years they fire everyone including supervisors, and the only one who gets to saty in the SM even though they are the problem in the stores. You don't dare complain about any harrassment from anyone because you will be fired. This company is a joke and stay far away from it as possible."
bad,The companies new ICSE program is making people leave left and right.
bad,the store was closed down what else is left to say. i did not enjoy working here. the job was stressful when it didnt have to be and i think all the employers were thrown under the bus when corporate told us that we would be closing
bad,This job was god awful. No one was respected in the work place and the management didn’t give jack about the employees. They played favoritism heavily and it was just an overall embarrassment to work there
bad,"The only goal pursued by Office Depot is profit. Only Store Managers and above are looked after by Corporate and the high turnover of all other employees is indicative of how the ""lower ranks"" are treated. While I enjoyed managing the Copy/Print Department, during a ""Staff Consolidation,"" an exceptional Department Manager was laid off and I was coerced into absorbing her position along with my current duty of Managing the CPD. I was suddenly yoked with more responsibilities for the same pay. I offered to step down if they kept her in her position, but I was told she had already been laid off and nothing I did would change Corporate's decision, and the laid-off employee asked me to stay and look after her people. "
bad,This company cares nothing for their employees. it is all about loyalty sign ups. There is constant pressure trickling down from management to coach staff using a device that is mostly unavailable. The stress level for Management is very high and their is no team spirit
bad,"The management staff was great when I started however, through my tenure the management was more stressful and difficult to work for.  My last manager was out to get me and degraded me every time we met.  even though I had performed (in an excellent manor). When on special projects she discounted them as not happening.  You must be a super star each day.  Any person with tenure was treated harshly and was forced out of the company.  If you do not believe me I can produce names."
bad,"Corporate is entirely disconnected from day to day stores and will needlessly impose various numbers for you to meet that simply add stress to and inhibit the initial purpose of your job. Managers vary and some are good but, many simply will take a ""no excuses"" policy towards your behavior but, constantly make excuses for the behavior of those in management. Typically asked to do a variety of jobs at once and then at times criticized for not getting them done despite legitimately not having the time to do them due to customer interactions."
bad,"Lazy managers, it’s literally all up to floor associates. Managers will watch Netflix or stay in the office all day. Customers complain about needing help, but usually there’s only 1 person on the sales floor. If you show the ability to work in multiple departments they won’t bump your wages. But they expect you to do all of the departments in one shift."
bad,"You stood all day looking at a screen and checking people out, after they close you clean up alone with no help, the company is gonna be out of business in a few years"
bad,"Everyone that works there, hates their life because of it. It would be a little better if the management would improve. Management currently does not work with their employees schedules, instead schedules to benefit themselves. The work flow isn’t too bad and the job itself is not that bad. I would not recommend working there."
bad,"Manager was sexist and racist . Only promoted women and treated men like slaves. Pay was bad, and payroll was always low so never any hours. Made to do several jobs  practically by yourself not limited to cleaning bathrooms and forced to make sales with little incentive."
bad,"They do not respect their employees.  They are rude to say the least.  I never got a break , lunch or bathroom.  They treated their customer base awfully, after I struggled to change the climate to regain their trust."
bad,"I absolutely did not like working at office depot/office max. It could have just been my location, but everything about it was the worst. From how dirty everything was, to the management.  A year after I had left, I had learned there were anti-union preachings from the same company ( which is illegal where I am)( which all of that makes sense when looking back towards my management).  We were supposed to call a cleaning crew in to clean the bathrooms at least a couple of times a week... But that never happened. The first day I was hired I had also learned that the same building I was working at would be shutting down in three months time... and that I was virtually jobless. Despite that, I continued to work in the short time I was there, and I had learned so many things from those around me that endured the h e l l that was office depot. When I asked about the salaries of those around me in the print center I was told everyone else was making up to three dollars more than I was as well and that the men who were working made even MORE than that.  They provided 0 customer service skills and would get frustrated when I would try to help certain customers to the best of my ability even though I wasn't trained... Oh and speaking of another horrible thing, they never trained me! not even for a day! not for anything! I was thrown into the trenches of mad customers and nobody even offered to help teach me the ropes. This was my first real job, but before I had been very used to volunteer work so I assumed some things would co-align. Obviously, they did not and for me starting the journey"
bad,After working for OD for about a month my schedule was being changed without management letting me know and my hours were cut down from about 30 hours a week to four hours a day four days a week.
bad,"Very stressful job when its busy, specially during back to school. The customers are very rude. You will receive very little training. You're expected to multi-task as cashier/Customer service/logistics. This company doesn't take care of there employees just there customers."
bad,Problems with upper management lead to the many changes in the company that make it hard to be an in-store associate. I do not recommend working for this company if it can be avoided.
bad,"Tough sales goals to meet: pushed to sell services while company spends no money on ads. Inflexible managers. Leave requests submitted months in advance cancelled for managers' convenience. Good luck getting breaks. A/C doesn't work. No overtime, if you go over you're written up. Poor business practices overall except customer service. No manpower to keep stores clean or the shelves well stocked. Inadequate equipment and tools, if any. Everyone is stressed because they are doing the jobs of multiple people. Print center associates are not paid more than cashiers but there is a lot more skill and expertise needed plus extreme stress. I have seen every print associate I've worked with cry at least once (there have been a lot, people stop showing up). Volunteering encouraged once a year but already overworked, underpaid store management expected to coordinate with community rather than corporate. Management is expected to canvass in community but never given time. Unreasonable expectations given resources available."
bad,"Very little direction , everything is shoot from the hip .   systems are slow and most time fail. Very slow paced .Culture focus sell. Would not recomend"
bad,"If I could put 0 stars I would - I was treated horribly by the supervisors, and was constantly being sent home early (alongside others) without being able to complete hours. They don't appreciate the effort that employees make. I worked there for 4 years, and was never given any respect or appreciation. Think twice before applying to this company."
bad,"Too much favoritism for some employees. A place where you feel discriminated. Buy the bosses . Don’t let you have a water bottle in the warehouse couldn’t listen to music , very uncomfortable old building with 2 toilets for a crew of more than 45 men ."
bad,"management has no clue how to win business,  they treat employees with negative pressure, very little help.  worst company i  have ever worked for, stay away!!"
bad,"No hours given, low pay but wanted you to work like a horse. I spent more money on transportation than my actual salary. The managers pretended to care but didn't."
bad,"Working for Office Depot is not fun. Between the petty managers and the insanely rude customers, its too much to deal with. Working in departments you're not supposed to be working in, nor applied to be in is great; esspecially when the store manager makes you do the work of both departments at the same time because he cant figure out how to hire new people or hire them correctly. Go somewhere else. Dont waste your time with this terrible company"
bad,"I had a particularly poor experience when I worked here. One of the managers was very rude and controlling. The other managers seemed to be scared of her so they never stepped in, even though she was a low-ranking one. Expectations were high because sales were low, everyone was stressed with not much to do. The other employees were good people and were good at their jobs, always willing to help."
bad,"The company is failing fast. When I worked there we had an average of 3 or 4 people manning the store in a day, horrible management that berated employees for not making unrealistic rewards sign up goals, scheduling changes the day before a shift, almost unbearable AC issues, late lunch breaks, physically exhausting work for logistics employees. I could go on for hours about all of these issues,but the biggest issue was $9 hr pay while being made to do cashier duties, pushing warranty attachments and signing up customers for non-working, predatory subscription services, and doing physical work such as hauling freight on flatbeds or pulling down desks and chairs from top stock. Management is incompetent and treats employees like absolute garbage because high turnover allows them to just hire another poor soul who doesn’t know how bad it is. If you’re reading this, I’m begging you to work at literally any other retailer or fast food place, they have higher starting pay and aren’t making you do stressful work for $9hr or less."
bad,I always wonder why they had a hiring turn over rate.  They have a point system that ends at 8. It's almost you have to be a single person to work there . Not much offers for part time position if your part time you on get one 15min break and basically you have to be there a year before any benefits are offered to you . Full time you never know when you getting off. a lot of kids work there so there's always drama. Management pick favorites and sides. A bunch of ignorant people with attitude not a friendly environment. Managers are never around for your convenience . Only good thing about this job is having the weekend off
bad,"Yeah, where to begin. They did a corporate restructure. I was chosen to be laid off. I was a business pro. The guy who trained me, he worked for Office Depot for 21 years, he got laid off as well. The guys who made the call didn't have the stones to tell us why. They said the call came from above them. They lied. Just found out it was entirely their call. I was chosen because several months that back, my laptop was stolen. I left a job for this job, and they laid me off with two weeks notice. Two freaking weaks. I'm a single father in Virginia Beach. I was ranked 14th in the nation for sales growth and they laid me off without so much as an honest answer why. But I know, it was the laptop that got stolen. As if I could control that. A detective was able to find it getting pawned at a pawn shop. So I got the laptop back, but screw them. I can't believe after all the late hours and chamber events they just let me go, and they still haven't sent my severance packet. These guys are crooks. Don't trust them. Resort to them for a job if you need one, but have a backup plan because they will throw you under the bus the first chance they get."
bad,I enjoyed working at Office Depot. I like my co workers and most of the managers while I was employed there. My co workers were the best part of the job as well as the customers.
bad,"This store is a disaster for employees.  A very shady set of managers. My whole experience was very bizarre. They lie and use you up while they need you, and then will treat you as if you've never done anything right once the need is gone. It's like highschool all over again, except with 90% middle aged women. Jealousy is a real issue, and if seen as a threat; you will be targeted. Gossip, lies, rumors, and sabotaging is a sport for them. The store manager sets the tone, and the others follow. Employees come and go VERY frequently, largely due to the fact that the management team is horrible. No matter how much you do, it will never be enough. Also, the workload is very high in comparison to the pay rates. Promises of promotions and schedule considerations are not upheld or honored. I am very happy with my decision to further my career else where!"
bad,"I've worked for Office Depot a little over a year now and have come to a conclusion that its ran terribly and coworkers do not work together. A typical day consists of running back and forth while also having little to no help at all from coworkers. Your also barked at to get reward card sign ups, and your hours are based on meeting these quotas for them. Your basically fending for yourself when it comes to help from your coworkers, and management is a joke. You can tell them your availability and it goes in one ear and out the other, as they also change your schedule without you knowing. Management also treats you like a child and have a "" I'm above you so your word doesn't matter "" mentality, they also really only focus on themselves and don't care for what the employees have to say. Management also is quick to play favorites as well, and last but not least, the hours are terrible, there's no room for growth, and resources are extremely scarce. So if you want 20 hours a week while having meager pay, with work that isn't worth the pay then Office Depot is for you."
bad,Management was the most unethical.  The manager was very unconcerned about issues concerning supervisors bulling other employees when brought to her attention. The female supervisor used obscenities and was very rude to other co-workers.  When I informed the manager she brushed it off and never addressed the supervisor. Very poor management.  Employees mistreated and very unhappy. There is no team work at this store.
bad,The store always looks terrible and the managers don’t do anything to make the store organized and easy to shop in. The manger is racist and very unprofessional and unproductive. I would not recommend working or shopping here.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of you standing at the register for hours, waiting for customers to come up. Upon ringing their items, you also have to push certain things that are on sale. For example, if you don't offer paper, and a customer notices, you get in trouble and have to give them a free pop. Management is so pushy about sales and everyone competes for their comission on certain sales. The print department works extremely hard and deals with rude customers all day long, and the store expects everything of you. Stocking is a nightmare, nothing is organized at all, so it takes an entire day or more to stock. Putting up sale signs and taking old ones down is a good way to ruin your weekend. This job is something that I can't imagine anyone enjoying."
bad,"* Te absorben todo el dia, de 7 de la mañana a 10 de la noche."
bad,"Overall soul sucking job, but it pays well, so you end up keeping it because you get used to the money... Poor management. Untruthful to customers about products and services. Unstable scheduling."
bad,"I was able to learn a lot of about customer service and sales.  I am grateful for that, but the job was not a good one.  The company struggles to appear to be modern and 21'st century but is failing miserably.  The 'back office' uses 90's dated computers, which is technically illegal because windows XP was no longer an accredited, secure operating system.  Aged, malfunctioning equipment.  Always short staffed and still expected to meet impossible sales quotas. The stores have horrible bandwidth that would often fail while servicing computers. The company is partnered with many third party services providers which failed more often than delivered, so many of my sales got returned after the fact through no fault of my own."
bad,The job itself was great and rewarding. I made some great friends that I still have to this day. the work life balance was what I myself had an issue with.
bad,"Typical day at work:"
bad,"Does not care for employees, lack of advancement. Worked there for 3 years with no complaints made against me and exceeds expectations on all my reviews, made one mistake and they decided to fire me. Management does nothing all day. and they will just ignore what you say, they are a numbers only company."
bad,Office Depot is a great job to have very flexible schedule with the opportunity to advance in many departments a lot of great people became managers through working at Office Depot it was a great pleasure to be an associate for the time I was their
bad,"Management is not organized, is not understanding with employees, low pay for increasingly high responsibility, low supervision, not a welcoming atmosphere for employees"
bad,I hated working at office depot it was the least paying job I've ever had. The job was so boring and on top of it the would never give me enough hours.
bad,On a typical day it was all about getting big print orders done as well as taking in new job orders for business cards or taking small print jobs that are done within minutes.
bad,Management team is horrible! The whole company is a sham. My store went without good lighting for as long as I can remember. Everything is overpriced and the pay is inadequate to what we're expected to deal with. The managers literally talk bad about their associates behind closed doors like high school kids do! Such a miserable place to work.
bad,Management was terrible. Would cut your hours to an unlivable amount to 'teach you a lesson' about selling more service plans. Lots of brown-nosing and retail politics. Employees try to take credit for your sold services. Company demands you stalk customers and ask them multiple times if they need help. Pray that they don't say no when they leave with an electronic.
bad,"Where to even begin?"
bad,"Working at Office Max was crazy to be nice. There are promises to be trained and be promoted in the future, none of which come true. There is a promise of training to know what your actual job is but you have to teach yourself. 9 times out of 10 you will not be doing what you are actually hired to do. The most enjoyable thing about the job is going home at the end of the day and hoping you never have to go back."
bad,"Office Depot was an easy laid back job, but there seemed to be more drama on the floor then needed, I loved my job when I first begun, and then as time passed it seemed like. Very judgmental environment, which makes working for a living hard to be motivated for."
bad,"Things were expected of me that was not my position, for example I was not trained in technology but I was expected to sell printers, etc to customers. They were unorganized and many times the managers didn't know how to complete their tasks, so we're unable to give me assistance when I started out, I often figured it out in my own."
bad,"backstabbing, could not trust anyone, if management didn't like you, they would do their best to fire you, low pay, high turnover rate, no respect, expected you to do everything, were not concerned for health and well being"
bad,"The manager at Tyler, TX store is over-bearing and cruel.  He does not teach anything, just demanding.  He uses people but does not promote their futures.  Corporate has expressly endorsed his positive bottom line without regard for how abusive he is as an employer."
bad,"Realizing a store manager could demand an assistant manager that the district manager turned down to be installed as the first indication of bad management. Realizing the district manager had reasons to protect his interests in his overall operation only to be overruled by a store manager and subsequently, watch as the location deteriorated into harassment and intimidation.Having people either quitting outright or being fired on account of the assistant manager was an even greater revelation that said person was as toxic to the enviornment as cancer is to a body."
bad,"Corporate would give us more and more to do with less and less people. They had a practice of bogus and fabricated disciplinary write ups to get you to quit before being fired. This was done to"
bad,"Changed Management several times, Days are stressful with no direction. "
bad,"Been here almost a year. Started out on logistics (fancy name for freight). Was upto 25 hours weekly... slowly over the year my hours have been cut back to 7-8 weekly. Store manager doesn't have a clue as to what he is doing. Punishes people if they don't get enough rewards sign up, punishes people for calling in sick or asking for vacation. He has cut everyone's hours back and blames it on corporate. Easiest job is the customers, hardest is the aggrevating customers who think you're supposed to give them everything under the sun."
bad,"CPD / Impress is always understaffed and you are expected to not only do your job, but juggle the jobs of others as well. There is not enough slack given to the printing department."
bad,"A typical day at work would depend upon the job that you are scheduled for that day. Typically the day would be spent focused on customers, and you would have very little time to complete other tasks, such as, stocking shelves, completing print jobs, or taking care of the front end."
bad,"The stores are open way too long, there were days where we didn't have coverage so I had to pull 10 hour days, but then we weren't allowed overtime so I had to find ways to cut my hours later in the week, which was frustrating. My boss was under a lot of pressure from upper management to get surveys and rewards signups and by default we were under constant pressure. The work environment in Print was stressful, and there was no system of checks and balances, so you could have 40 people in line at one point with one person behind the counter or no people for 4 hours straight."
bad,"Worked for this company for 5 years doing any and everything asked of me. I was always in the top of my group with regard to sales, training and everything else they gauge success on. I started working there at a pay rate of $22.50 an hour and received a pay raise every year and yet I left there with a pay rate of $21.50 an hour. I was number one or number 2 in sales every week and every month for every store I worked at. I trained entire staff and got them to improve the stores overall sales. Our store went from ranked in the 700's to ranked #3 in the entire company in 2014. Our store ""grading"" system is a 0.0 - 3.0 but technically you can get a 4.0 as well though it's nearly impossible. Our store was able to reach the 4.0 point while I lead our store and our store lead the district in a new program for repairing phones. We had been #1 since it's inception and never lost the title. Then they fired me for ""performance"" Figure that one out. The district manager retired right after they fired me and his unethical behavior was shared throughout the district with 9 of the store managers (the ones I worked with at one point or another). The store manager who replaced him as the district manager also happens to be the one who he got to fire me. She's actually not as bad but was put into a situation without knowing what was truly going on. This company may not be terrible. But I can only give my opinion based on the district I worked in. If the rest of the company is the same as district 28, run away as fast as you can."
bad,"The managers treat people like garbage, the high pressure sales tactics are a bunch of bologna, don't think about being sick! They won't believe you!!"
bad,"Ho resistito un paio di anni ma ho perso molta clientela, un servizio agli agenti e alla clientela pessimo, grandi riunioni stile religioso epico evocativo ( dio è con noi e odia i concorrenti, per dare l'idea)."
bad,Management changes often you get some good ones and sometimes you don't and it causes the whole work environment to go down.
bad,"Its sad to see how far this company has fallen within the last 5 years. Practically all of the honest good managers and employees have left the company on their own will. I started working at Depot at a time when they had Direct TV and if you worked on Sundays during football season, you could watch Sunday NFL ticket when it was slow. I also remember the company having district and regional Holiday Parties. "
bad,"The only time it is a team is when you are asked to do more or a favor for management. Do not offer any ideas, advice or corrective measures(it is frowned upon and management simply does not care). Everyone has been tagged with having a bad attitude the odd thing is they cant seem to figure out where it stems from. Management is unavailable to ensure trucks get loaded properly or equipment is inspected and ready. Management will also lead you to believe that folks in Florida told them how to run the routes along the Northeastern seaboard and they are not permitted to  make corrections. "
bad,They kept changing management so it was getting progressively worse. District manager changed about three times in two months! Also the in store managers also changed frequently and they made us take training sessions that we already did the year before.
bad,"A typical day was either starting at 5am or ending at 10 PM. "
bad,"Expect to be overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated. Wasted too many months of my life to this garbage retail company. Office supply companies are on their way out, and it's never more evident than whilst working there. Policies are antiquated, management is incompetent, and you have to play a song and dance of BS to have even the foggiest hope of advancement. "
bad,I spent 7 years at OD as a Store Manager at the largest volume store in the Bay Area before I was shown the door for doing something I was told by my previous DM to do. Now you couldn't pay me enough to go back even though they went through 4 Store Managers at my old store in the 3 years I've been gone. All the good managers left a long  time ago. Only the back stabbing Dept. Managers remain.
bad,"No advancement opportunities, low pay, low - mediocre benefits, no structure. Work related production issues never addressed or fixed. Typical low paying concentration camp type sweatshop."
bad,I love working with customers and helping them with their projects.
bad,"The place was one of the worst places I've ever worked. Management were cynical jerks and didn't care about you, talked down to you like you were nothing. Pay raises were almost none, even for good employees. Benefits were passable."
bad,The company was not flexible with scheduling. They did not have enough help during a work day. Management was always in the office and not on the sales floor.
bad,"I have worked for more than five years there. But, when the company start struggling and its share dropped badly they start pushing employees too much to quiet or be fired. When I called many times the hr manager she did not reply to me. Then I tried to email her about what happened to me with the manager at the store who just got fired, two months ago, she did not replay to my emails at all. It was ridiculous."
bad,"Harassment in the work place, no training. Horrible work environment."
bad,You get yelled at and bossed around all day by manager but its not like that when the big bosses are around. bad pay. no breaks sometime would NOT recomend this job to anyone. management plays favortism towards other races and who ever make the most money. boss dosent know how to work some departments but always has feedback. worst job i have ever had well really worst boss. lead by example please.
bad,No opportunity for in house advancements. Minimal compensation and benefits. Selfish management and power controled enviorment.
bad,"I worked for the company on a part time basis (to supplement my income) and I only lasted a few months. I had noooo issues with the schedule or the type of work that I was assigned. However, the store manager was VERY unprofessional and lacked people skills. Most of the assistant managers were great with the exception of one! She lacked the ability to talk to others in a respectful manner & would usually talk down to employees in front of customers (and in most cases the customers didn't appreciate her tone towards the employees). She made the workplace VERY undesirable! The store manager was afraid of her, therefore she got away with it. I LOVED interacting with the customers & my co-workers. Avoid the OD on College Dr in Baton Rouge at ALL costs!"
bad,Good customers comes in to Office depot but management are the worst. Lies to customers to get their sales up. Bad attitude from management and treats employee with no respect
bad,Office Depot Works its employees without any extra compensations. Does not care about its employees stores are understaffed. Office Depot gives a lot of responsibilities to employees that are unable to fulfill tasks and employees are underpaid.
bad,There is no job security since they recently did a company reconfiguration and eliminated positions. It was a decent company when I first started. But it's gone way done since then. Corporate can careless about the employees. Everything comes back to the profit that corporate can get and not take care of the store associates.
bad,"Benefits were very expensive!!! Hardly can call them benefits!! $300+ per mth!!"
bad,"The job was easy for my first position. However, there was little to NO training and management was very lazy and did not help me at all. I had my employee number changed twice which created problems with my paycheck and in spite of my urgency, the management had no urgency and they got very mad at me for quitting due to their lack of care. I enjoyed most of my co-workers but often found myself feeling alone and isolated in this position. The workspace was messy and unorganized, nobody communicated ANYTHING with each other, and blamed each other for complications, including management. This company doesn't care AT ALL about customers or customer satisfaction and the store manager took a vacation literally every single month for three weeks which created A LOT of problems. The job is super easy and there is literally NO expectations for the employees; however, it can easily be just as frustrating as it is easy when nobody cares about their job there."
bad,"Associates are micro-managed, overworked,  and continuously held responsible for the shortcomings of the store and its general manager. Store management is lax to inept - too many instances of inappropriate behavior within the workplace (to include 'adult' themes, racist remarks, and rampant 'call-ins', general ignorance of job duties). Favoritism runs rampant, allowing for untrained associates in supervisory positions who, naturally, micromanage those who are actually capable of performing their job duties. Its calamity -- and not the hilarious sort."
bad,Was hired for a job and they had me do something else at a lower pay. No one likes to help and it's all for them self's. No proper training. No proper communication
bad,"Benefits it's ok but not the job, safety is a word they don't know what it means,I wouldn't recommend people to apply there;I had bad experience there."
bad,The environment had absolutely no structure & I quit after just a few months. Managers were very unprofessional and would make sexist/inappropriate comments to employees acting very immature. Some of the management would leave their work for their shift to play on their phones and have someone else the next day pick up slack. If I worked at another Office Depot I guess things could've been different under real management but this was one of the worst experiences out of all the jobs I've worked.
bad,"The quota you have to make every day for sales is often unobtainable. Even if you had a good day with sales, if they didn't reach their mark, they make you feel like you need to do better. Ive seen many employees turn to tricking customers into signing up for things instead of informing them what it is they're signing up for just to make their numbers look good. They base their sales off of what they made last year. If the store made $15,000 July 2nd last year then they need at least $15,000 July 2nd this year. Apart from that, they want you to push rewards memberships, credit cards, extended warranties,  ink and toner subscriptions,  add on sales, computer repair and diagnostics,  and more. It is too much and they want you to be pushy. They dont care about their employees,  they only care about numbers. Management is poor, everyone is stressed constantly.  The way they run this business, their goals and their pushy attitude are unethical"
bad,"Just go read the Office Depot subreddit. That should give you a RLY accurate look into the company, from entry lvl, to corporate. I'd be surprised if this company is still around in ten years."
bad,"Only a few follow the the rules of ethics conduct to team members. Send you home early if you dont meet  IP. Manager will come up to you like this. Have you finished your labels, if not... finish the ones you have, you can leave your done for today."
bad,"Pay is good,but you never know what time you will ever get off,you could come in at 10 am,and not get off until 3 am in the morning,lunch time is different all the time,no consistency"
bad,"I was expected to be ALL-IN on company policies which management MINIMALLY explained to me.  The ""dashboard,"" mandatory morning standing ""circle"" talk, and other individual performance indicators were fully public to everyone, so it created an overly competitive environment where the drivers compared ""stops"" like ""fish stories."""
bad,"After working there for five years, the minimum wage went up faster than my pay raises, and they had to adjust my pay to match minimum wage. My pay was not adjusted further for the raises I had received over the years, so I was making the same as new hires, after working for the company five plus years."
bad,"Toll me that I would be a manager, in two month, all I have to do is start as a warehouse associate and they will  train me, two month pass and went I ask they toll me that they did not say that, next day I put my two weeks notice, and the next day the gm let me go."
bad,All employees are not fairly treated equal.  Certain members of management mistreat employees and are not held accountable.  The Tipline doesn't work in the interest of employees.  The same person who the complaint is about gets to deny the complaint with little or no investigation on behalf of the employee.
bad,"You are expected to pull miracles when other staff don't want to do anything. There is a lot of favoritism and schedule is very inconsistent. If you have kids, good luck on seeing them as much as you want because they would much rather make you work then be with family. The benefits are way too expensive (about $400 a month just for one person)."
bad,"Worked for 5 store managers, 3-4 DMs and gave 23 years of my life to a company that fired me in return. If you like working for years without a raise and being treated like a tool that can be replaced with cheaper (not much) part time employees or wasting your time trying to make the store manager look good, this is the job for you! Otherwise, for the love of all that's Holy, PASS!"
bad,"I worked as the Copy and Print Department Supervisor. The department needed at least two people, one to watch the front counter and one to actually work on the orders. Cooperate would not allow us to be fully staffed so I was left doing it all. By the end of a few months, I was using a cane for the first time in my life because the work was so taxing."
bad,"Most managers don't care about their people. Leadership doesn't spend any time developing their managers. If the don't know how to lead, how are they supposed to develop their team."
bad,"GM talks down to the staff. He's barely there, yet when he is prepare to be micromanaged and scorned if the job isn't done with in the time he wants it done."
bad,The company benefits are awful the deductible is really high when you are performing good they will throw bad accounts into your bookset so they don’t have to pay you out above 100%
bad,"CEM's. Beware!!!"
bad,"no appreciation for what you do. very little acknowledgement. no stability, no growth within company. Most enjoyable part of job is going home at the end of the day."
bad,"Due to the lack of organization employees are often required to work long hours.  Employees are often told the volume will get better and their hours will be reduced, but because of their inability to stay competitive the staffing is never where it needs to be."
bad,"Working at Officemax taught me alot. I never knew much about printers and office supplies until I started working there. Although I don’t work there anymore because of complications, its a recommendable job for elders."
bad,I dont recommend this place. I dont recommend this place. This place is horrible honestly the only thing i have to say about this place is to not work here.
bad,"Micromanaged from district management. Negative culture. Not treated with respect. No one wants to work here. Horrible pay, horrible payroll Laurent for stores. Over worked and underpaid."
bad,Managment is supperior to everyone but bad decisions made daily orders falling by the day has been bought out and employees are worthlessnow for level of wxperiance they have because OD mentality is a agency worker can do tht
bad,Upper management is not inline with the stores they have high presssure sales tactics and believe that subscriptions will save the company from going under
bad,"A typical day at work included standing at the register or walking through and helping customers."
bad,DMS hiring former employers vs hiring within.  Multiple DM's did this. Not a good situation for the store level moral. I have finally learned what cutthroat retail is like.
bad,Not a lot you can say but to say that this was not the place for me. There are way better companies out there that have to offer many things that this company did
bad,"entreprise très mal dirigèe."
bad,No matter how much you do or how hard you work it's never enough for the minimal pay.They always want more from you. You will do the work of 5 people for a very low pay.
bad,"You will be given so little autonomy that you may as well be a puppet. Whatever management seminars they have at corporate summits aren't effective, and the tech bench regularly must spend 15 minutes looking for one of their tools that was taken by another department whose own tools had ""mysteriously"" gone missing. Then, when things get busy and the tech specialists are called away to man a register, they get reprimanded for not having completed their tasks in their own department."
bad,"So many layoffs of tenured people. Keeping the lower paid sales people that are lazy. "
bad,Under new management you don't have the right to report harassment and if you do it is easy for them to find reasons to let you go.  Company policy states you shouldn't feel retribution but they don't do anything to protect you either.
bad,"It's boring to work here. A good first job if you have no experience, but everything this company does is not worth anyone's time. Underpaid, and too much of a hassle."
bad,Managers constantly changing and managers don’t take the time to train and learn about their associates and always pushing them to do things that they are obviously not capable of doing.
bad,"This job has the potential to be a good one, but there are so many issues with the store and company that it makes it hard to want to stay. Low hours, low pay, and they are constantly understaffed. You have huge workloads compared to other retail positions and unless you are lucky enough to get full time hours, you can kiss benefits goodbye. When you do have long days you get one 30 minute long lunch and no breaks even in a 8+hour role, which for a job that has you on your feet and usually standing in one place for that long it's too taxing. Store is unorganized, pay is abysmal at best and the management is superior to the point of arrogant and stuck up. It's not a good work environment to work in, even as a tosser job."
bad,They would work you to death and then replace you if you happen to die. They pay absolutely poorly and did not care about work life balance. Store manager was good and there were advancement opportunities.
bad,"Company run by morons who care little about their retail employees. Upper management (above store level) has no idea what goes on in the stores and sets very high goals for people making just above minimum wage. No paid holidays for anyone below store manager, Out dated equipment(cash registers crash all the time!) , most stores don't have working AC, very little payroll that gets cut every year; are some of the biggest issues with office depot. "
bad,"In short I was yelled at, reported, and nearly moved to different shift days because I ""reminded a manager of her daughter"" thusly making her think I always had a terrible attitude. It was just awful."
bad,"Its fine for a high school/between college part time job. Don't get involved full time or intend to make a career. This place is crumbling and it shows. Hours are terrible there is absolutely zero work life balance. They expect you to sacrifice everything for the Store, and for awful pay and terrible commission. It's a greedy company. Management is typically lazy and expects everyone else to do everything in the store while having no one working to save money and then proceed to yell at you because of bad customer reviews or low sale numbers. Not possible to be everywhere at once. Met some awesome people, and they are fun to work with. But outside of that just awful structure."
bad,"When I first joined i absolutely loved my job. It was both rewarding and the culture was fair and ethical. By the time I left, i had to re-interview for my job twice. That's after 13 years of service."
bad,"After finishing what was my actual job for the day, which was a receiver and would take between 8-10 hours, I was always asked to help other sections. It wasn't necessarily mandated but as a new employee and with being told that they want to go home too, it felt like it was. I was also initially supposed to operate a fork lift but never touched one."
bad,Co-workers and supervisors were amazing! The reason I didn't stick with OfficeMax is because the manager was in no way shape or form a leader. He always seemed very inconvenienced with everything especially when employees had questions concerning the job. I would rather do something wrong than ask him for help. He would also regularly talk bad about other employees and supervisors to others.
bad,Relaxed environment. Management lacks backbone. Favors customer complaints even if present during a conflict. Very few Advancement opportunities given.
bad,Working here stressed and depressed me. The customers are rude as he** when they're only paying like 15 cents for copies. I've had customers yell and threaten me.
bad,"The people I worked with are great, but things are run terribly. The print department has horrible resources and not enough staff so customers constantly get angry waiting a half an hour for a few prints. Its really annoying taking all the flack because customers don't know who else to yell at. I wouldn't shop at Office Depot."
bad,I worked at this place for 8 months and it was horrible. They hours kept changing and they kept lying stating that having us come in early would get us out early but it never happened. Then I found out I was pregnant and I wanted to operate the stock picker they certified me and told me they would raise my pay even though I was pregnant. I ended up losing the baby so when I let them know they never changed my pay like we discussed and told me that they would change my pay after I've been on the stock picker for 30 days but they gave me the run around never letting me operate.They gave me PTO but wouldn't approve none of the days I asked for so I had to call off and they gave me a point each time so my points racked up needless to say I was on my last point when i quit. If u can't dedicate ur life to this place this aint the job for u.
bad,"i worked hear from about 6 months. IT WAS AWFUL! i was logistics. i arrived at 530am to start unloading the pallets, and stocking shelves. and assisting customers. we would get 14 pallets in and they would expect to guys to stock and unload all shipments buy the end of our 6 hour shift. it wasnt possible.. but they still expected the impossible."
bad,I spent 3 years working for Office Depot and I can honestly say that it has been a roller coaster.  There is no stability. Budgets are changed to prevent Store Managers from receiving bonuses.  District Managers have unreal expectations.  They claim to value the work-life balance but all store managers end up working 60 hours a week just to get by.
bad,my experience hasnt been the best just like any other workplace it has space for improvement. very slow during the winter but picks up in the summer. can be stressful when you are expected to do the job of 3 people because there is no payroll but overall you can keep busy if you find something to do.
bad,"I worked here for 3 months and I did not enjoy it at all. The hours sucked and the district manager cut hours all the time and the manager made excuses for her. Parents and teachers would come in there daily with attitudes because of the limits and the manager felt as if we had to become friends with these people in order to have great customer service. People that have come into this store want to get in and get out. They come in with children who are misbehaving and touching different items. The parents are very aggravated and will not respond to small-talk including, ""Hello, how are you.?"" My manager was very rude and she did not know how to talk to her associates very well."
bad,I worked at OD for almost a year. I didn't get a review. Got hardly any hours at minimum wage. I got jerked around by management and talked to like a dog from hateful employees wanting to be bosses. They expected me to create sales for over priced items.
bad,"management issues, no decent commission for the work, expected too much for far, far too little pay and reward. just mundane and grim."
bad,Sr. Director Management is very poor.  They are only trying to get themselves promoted at the expense of the employees.  They are harsh and micro manage you all the time.  Work day never ends and they fire any tenured associates.   Not a place to stay more than 2 yrs.
bad,"This is not a place for corporate professionals.  This is a good job for young individual with no corporate skills"
bad,"Management is terrible, there's a serious lack of communication between management and employees. A typical work day includes trying to help a store full of customers the best you can while you probably only have 3 (or 4 if you're lucky) other coworkers, which includes the manager trying to help customers and print associates who are only limited to print services anyway. The hardest part of the job is trying to be reasonable with rude customers and trying to please them as much as possible without doing something that can potentially make you lose your job. When that's still not enough and you decide to call a manager they usually just ignore the issue and leave you to figure it out yourself. Office Depot. takes pride in great customer service yet the managers don't even know how to provide average customer service. To top it off they put so much pressure on you to meet certain sales goals and customer loyalty goals while not reaping any benefits for doing so."
bad,long hours management and gm were horrible breaks were short and specialist took the power to there head i learned how to use all the lifts there thought i guess that was one good thing
bad,"I left a decent job to work as Office Depot as a computer salesman. However, when I started I was placed in a minimum wage stocking position and told that I would begin sales training in about a few weeks. I begrudgingly accepted this. After working there a few weeks, there was no further mention of sales training. Every time I brought it up, I was told it would begin soon. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that it was never actually going to begin, so I left this job. The conclusion: working at Office Depot is a huge mistake."
bad,"Learned alot. Met some great people Great hours. Great vacatoin time. WAGE PRETTY DECENT Over time was available at times.  """"No week ends"
bad,"When I first hired in the manager we had was wonderful.  Unfortunately he was transferred and the new manager didn't know people skills, how to manage, how to schedule time.  It was a mess."
bad,"Horarios nada flexibles y agotadores. Buen ambiente laboral con tus compañeros de trabajo, aprendes tareas básicas para futuros trabajos."
bad,The warehouse in Grand Prairie. There is no a/c and you will be begged to stay longer because of people slacking off. Management doesn't budge at all and if you are part time you work 6 hours and only get a 15 minute break. But that break begins when they call I not when you get into the break room so it's only like 9 minutes.
bad,"Not what i was used to from a traditional big box. Small sales teams, low sales volumes and store traffic. Not a lot of advancement opportunity unless the DM knew you personally."
bad,"Sales Representative"
bad,"Worked here for 2 years and i used to enjoy it because it was my first retail job, but soon after i seen the dysfunction in this company."
bad,"Co workers are great. Everybody works hard for the company,but the pay is so little."
bad,I am now 60 years old and the 2 years I spent with this company in management was positively the worst experience of my working career.
bad,Es una empresa que a pesar de un buen salario obliga al empleado a tomar jornadas de trabajo excesivamente largas y con un alto indice de discriminación a los empleados.
bad,"people are unfriendly, lazy, and stand-offish. entirely too much work for the pay. you only get promoted if you work out and go to bars with the store manager."
bad,"work hard and get told you could do better,I learned that management don't care about there people,At this time management at one of the Sarasota stores is very poor,My co-workers for the most part are the best,The hardest part of the job is doing the job of 2 people because there short handed,The most enjoyable part of the job NONE."
bad,"I spent a lot of time and energy trying to help make this place successful. But in the end, when I needed help, my management team was not willing to work with me."
bad,"im a hard working person, that get along well with my fellow co - workers. working at office ive learned many things, the management isnt that great, but they always make the day ok. ive learned alot from my co-workers, we all share idea amongs each other. But the part is the challenge of the work everyday. The part is the end of each day we all complete the job."
bad,Do you like to work hard for minimum wage?Do you like to be tteated poorly?Then this is the place for you.If your 16 and live at home then go for it.If you are older and have bills to pay them run away from this company.They will use you and abuse you.
bad,It's not what you know when it comes to working at Office Depot.
bad,I'm grateful to have a job in this economy but the reality is that I do not receive sufficient time on the job nor do I make a reasonable amount. I am a 25 year old college graduate who works alongside individuals 5-8 years younger than me that earn more than my $7.25 an hour. The store does not receive very much business therefore at times management will verbally complain of boredom due to the frequent slow pace.
bad,"Simplicity of the job, you are not required to do that much. Also during my time at Office Depot I got paid pretty well (over $20/hr)"
bad,"Pay rate between 8 to 11 dollars even with experience you will be in that range as a associate"
bad,"Working at OfficeMax had opened my eyes even more to the ills of working in retail. It is not a very employee-friendly environment and the culture is more like high school."
bad,"Worked here in high school. flexible hours, but never got any hours, worked 3 hour shifts which was a waste of my time. manager was very unexperienced and mean to all employees. i would not recommend working here if you're looking for a good paycheck."
bad,"I worked there for over a year I decided to walked away from there. "
bad,"Unsuccessful management team has laid off another 500+ positions.  New plan in place to move forward without any ground level strategy.  2 years ago same process took place and again 2 years prior to that same layoffs took place.  None of the past 3 reorganizations have left the company on a path to success.  "
bad,"Unfortunately, the top brass feed endless busywork to the stores regardless of our capacity to accomplish it. No one at my store actually likes working there."
bad,General manager is unable to relate to college aged associates. Treats them as if they do not know how to complete everyday tasks. Does not give associates a chance to advance in career. Hires management that knows nothing about the company
bad,"3 managers. 3 asset managers. 3 assistance managers."
bad,"Your job is essentially to move boxes from one place to another all day. The building is very dirty and ugly. You have to listen to nonstop music telling you to be happy all day over the radio. Literally Pharrell's ""Happy"" came on the store radio playlist once every 90 minutes. You make barely more than minimum wage and you're really never going to make much more than that. My coworker had worked there 17 years and did everything for them and they still only paid him $9.00 an hour."
bad,Management is horrible PERIOD!!! Package handlers never show up for work so that means you have to load up all of your stuff. Fix your own problems cause the management/HR don’t have a clue. No guidance and training is a laugh. All he did was gossip about the management and other employees. Only good thing is the benefits PERIOD! No job security so watch out. Guys been have been there for 10 years are fired for  simple reasons.
bad,"I had high hopes when I got the job in late 2003 but after one manager was fired and his replacement was always on the phone (he was fired after I left) I'd had enough of bad management. The 1st manager was nice and hands on but not very smart (he allowed tech employees to have the key to the stockroom and they proceeded to steal a bunch of product). The 2nd manager was an inept ""figure head""; he was on the phone more than the floor and he was unwilling to give proper training to people who wanted to learn. I wanted to work in the printing area but he would just put me in there as a body to ring up customers and then when I was not able to properly print large orders it was considered my fault not management's."
bad,This was a job I took to have while searching for a career. You should not expect to climb the ladder from a Retail store such as this as it is an unreal expectation.
bad,Worst place ever was supposed to hire me on the same shift as my uncle so I can have a ride to work didn't do that hired me for a totally different shift got sick one day wouldn't let me leave so I left and got fired for being sick hot as all get out don't care about their employees the only good thing about the entire company is the management staff.
bad,"Laid off from Office Depot twice, once while five months pregnant.  There was little regard to a work/life balance and communication was lacking.  Work environment was highly stressful with little to no coaching from management.  In my eight years as an account manager, I had three different sales managers, two of which were highly incompetent and were terrible leaders, and higher salaries were offered to outside hires for comparable positions.  The company held layoffs over our heads and kept taking away benefits, and there were days I felt like I paid the company to work for them.  Attaining or exceeding goals was challenging because the compensation plan was incredibly unclear and goals were often not distributed until several months in to the year."
bad,"I had good experience working at the Office Max location in Cottonwood Arizona, but unfortunately upon transferring to the Rogers Ar location I learned how stressful a work environment can be with severely poor management and an over-stressed store manager."
bad,I use to love going to work but now under the new manager and supervisor it's just terrible. There's so much stress the management talk down to you they don't appreciate the hard work you do.
bad,i was there for 4 years and worked my hardest for nothing at the end. their management process is more of a family/friend situation.the location i worked at mostly hired college student or people who were just there for the paycheck and nothing else. you were lucky if you got regular hours. the district managers looked as if they expected more than their employees could give them. they need a better hiring process. they also need to be more organized. rude customers all the time. they mostly serve higher paid customers.
bad,"I was transferred to this location from another store and given little to no training for my role other than standard video clip style information.  Office Depot does not give commission on sales or any other quantitative measures of your performance.  You either meet the goals, which are often unrealistic and ignorant of the store's location, or you get fired/pressured to quit.  "
bad,"They hire too many people and cut hours for those who have been there for a long time.  They consider part time 12-15 hours a week and don't hire any sales consultants for full time. You have to sign people up for their rewards cards and sell, sell, sell or your hours are cut. Poor management. Do not care about their employees."
bad,"Was a delivery driver. I was there when the merger took place. I was hired as an OfficeMax employee when they merged with office depot. Once the merger happened it was completely one sided and it didn't matter what the drivers said, it was office depot's show from that point forward. The stops per truck went through the roof and you were not allowed to come back to the crossdock until you were empty. My manager became very stressed out and just didn't care about what we thought anymore. They didn't care anymore. Poor management all the way around. I quit due to all of this, to this day they still can't fill my position and its been since 2015. You even have to come in extremely early and load your own truck. Yeah no more."
bad,Lack of focus and direction from Headquarters as it pertains to system infrastructure and inventory management.  Should bite the bullet and upgrade the WMS.
bad,"It doesn't matter what your job title is, you are a salesman, and your numbers are all that the company really cares about. The only ones who benefit from your hard work are upper management."
bad,"Save yourself now. Keep looking elsewhere."
bad,When I first joined the company before the merger it was a slower paced environment but overall was a good place to work. After merger everything changed for the worse and anyone who worked on the Officemax side could count on receiving less consideration than the office depot side.
bad,"The management if you can even call it that sucks, contact schedule mixups, cut hours never constant, never an organization in the store from manager to manager. You'll find a couple of good people to work with but the management being so bad doesnt really make up for it."
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for in my entire career...My job had no direction...Upper management  has no clue ...Please do not waste your time with this company.."
bad,Minimum wage and the only raises were when the government raised minimum wage. Management used to use positive reinforcement to motivate then company changed to slave driver with threats of firing to motivate. Some how they survived bankruptcy because the government saved them. No one even shops at any office supple store any more.
bad,"Initially working there for the first year, job was great.  Stock started crashing, started laying off entire divisions.  If you were good, you would keep your job through another round of layoffs.  Eventually you knew there would be a time when your job would come to an end via layoff."
bad,"Sure the job is pretty easy. But the higher management only cares about numbers, so be ready to always be worrying about that. They also are going out of business and closing 300 stores within the next 3 years, so no job security. If they do let you go, you will also only get a 2 days notice no matter that you worked there 6 years."
bad,"We are constantly understaffed and when logistics doesn't get things done then the managers yell at them. Since we are understaffed then logistics has to help with the customers. Since they have to help with the customers they fall behind on their work. In turn the manager gets mad at them for not finishing the freight. The manager tells them to stop making excuses. It is funny, because the manager will use the same ""excuse"" for why they couldn't finish unloading a u boat. The pay is terrible. They do not have competitive pay. It is a lie. Several of us asked for a raise and no one received any even though they agree we are worth more than what they are paYing us."
bad,"Office Depot paid (some of) the bills in college, but afterward, there was no room for advancement or raises.  My coworkers were great for the most part, and I enjoyed working with most of them, even some of the store management, but that alone couldn't sustain me."
bad,"When I first started I worked as a freight team member, breaking down the truck and stocking shelves. After that was done it was usually helping customers until my day was over. About 2 years later, I was promoted to Senior Sales in Furniture. With that title, you would think I would start taking part more in sales in the furniture department, right? For about a month, sure, until the meth head they hired to take my place on the freight team stopped showing up. Then it was back to doing my old job, plus trying to deal with my new sales goals that I couldn't meet on a good day, let alone meeting them while doing my old job. It probably wouldn't be so bad if there was ever more than two people on the sales floor at any given moment. Whenever it got busy one of those two people would have to help out on registers while the other had to calm down the upset customers because they all aren't getting the help they need. And where are the managers in all this? Either sitting in the office talking bull all day or sitting on the furniture pad looking at all the customers not being helped. "
bad,"My evening always began with: an excessive amount of print orders for one person to handle; a large line of people dropping off FedEx packages; and notes lefts behind by management/co-works that were not very instructive. While working for OfficeMax I did learn how to used the fax machine, accept FedEx packages, print on different machines, laser cut paper stacks, and laminate items. Most of the co-workers were grumpy, not toward customers, but towards each other. Management was confusing because the store received notice that they were going to be shutting down at the end of the year and there were mixed messages coming from corporate. The hardest part of the job was balancing all the demands of customers. As the only impress associate/design consultant on shift, some days having one pair of hands was not enough. The most enjoyable part however was working with some customers because they were so happy when I could tell them ""I have a solution. Let me take care of that for you""."
bad,"I hope no one applies to this place. We had 7 people walk off the job in the 2 weeks I had put in my notice that I was leaving. After I left, everyone else quit their jobs on the spot as well. I didn't get paid until I had worked there for 2 months and I made minimum wage at a place where they work you to the bone. I was one of the top 3 sellers in our 17 store district and I was punished for it. If I didn't make a sale, I'd have a manager pull me aside and tell me what a failure I was and that I had to try harder. We made our sales goal one month and the store manager saw that we had and changed what the goal was at the last minute. I even had a manager right after I started grabbed my arm and dragged me forcefully away from the register causing me to hit the cabinets behind the registers because I didn't know how to ring up a very unique transaction. No one had taught it to me before and I ended up getting chewed out for 15 minutes for it after being physically dragged. If you weren't selling enough, they would write you up for it and do everything they could to force you out of the company. Our store wasn't the only store where it was happening though! Just a couple miles away, those employees dealt with the same problems! So I know it wasn't just our store, this company is evil."
bad,The company was very un organized they never had me on schedule and I was never knew what I was doing for the day I never really got far in the company because the managers were everywhere except where they needed to be
bad,"friendly and knowledgeable service to the customers. Loading and unloading vehicles, and assist with stocking shelves and with maintaining an appealing appearance of the store isles and shelves."
bad,"I am the only person in my store that has lasted this long.  I have been there through three store managers, 13 department managers and have watched the staff turn over completely at least 4 times.  It is not uncommon to have 2 or more people walk out in a week.  People calling in sick or simply not showing up at all is almost a daily occurrence."
bad,A typical day for me was not to get fired. Management and some co-workers were lazy and didn't know what team work meant. Management would play favorites and would get highly upset if the bilingual associates were helping out the Spanish speaking customers only. Hardest part of the job was not being able to quit without finding another place of employment first. Only enjoyable part of the job was when I would clock out to go home.
bad,"No appreciation for Military members"
bad,"Office Depot/Max is a company with no direction. Bad employees are not only kept around, but in some cases promoted. At least that was my experience in the sales office located in Columbia, MD. Terrible management. In the case of the corporate office, individuals with no experience in certain fields were placed in high management positions."
bad,"enjoyable co workers"
bad,"Office Depot is NOT a company that I would ever recommend to anyone interested in a rewarding and upbeat environmet. The higher management is oblivious to the needs of it's management team, but rather enfrces a culture of constant threats of job replacement, no just with new managers, but with those of over 10 years of tenure with this company."
bad,"I worked for this company over a real good portion of my life, I watched them go from a great place to just another  corporate greed robot money hole. "
bad,"Unless you have to, or your local store is differently managed don't work for office depot, hours are sporadic, pay is terrible and generally speaking so is company attitude."
bad,"The company has a flawed business model, hiring 80% of their workers to be unskilled laborers, paying them barely above minimum wage, but still expecting premium results. The benefits are a joke. It's no wonder the company is going under."
bad,"While working tech support for office depot, the store never had a consistent store manager. For 8 months we had none at all, with four or five from other stores periodically coming in. Each had their own standards, and none understood the work involved in the tech department. The pay rate was abysmal, making $7.50 an hour repairing laptops and computers, with the neighboring competitor paying more than double the rate. Part of the company contract however forbids you from working with competitors for three years after leaving the company to prevent corporate sabotage, effectively trapping you in a terrible company.  Paired with the abysmal pay-rate however is their scheduling system, which dependent upon the manager you spoke with was either ""automated"" or ""manually entered."" In reality it seemed they actively scheduled some people outside of their availability, and others they'd schedule a night shift then opening the following day, and repeating that, making doing anything outside of the work impossible. Quite possibly the worst company I've ever worked for."
bad,What can I say...the customers were great. Having any kind of advancement opportunity however felt like it would never happen. Your work never felt like it was finish and with declining sales more and more was added to your workload. Also most of the computer services offered are extremely overpriced for what you do and it just makes you feel like a dirty crook.
bad,"This was an extremely positive environment when I first started. Since there is a different manager every month or a few, you get to see a variety of management tactics. Positive results are only celebrated depending on who you are and if the manager likes you. A year ago, they were celebrated any time you achieve a goal which helps the store succeed, no matter who you are. The scheduling, hours, and positions are very inconsistent (again, depends on who you are) and makes it difficult to estimate what your biweekly checks MIGHT look like, unless you’re a full time supervisor. Some of them are quick to point fingers before knowing facts and can be very childish so you have to tread lightly. Others are very competent, know mutual respect, and are easy to get along with as long as you both work."
bad,My new manager invokes new rules on our print center every other week without helping or acknowledging our work overflow during the winter season. His methods are unhelpful and make our job experience harder and overly stressful.
bad,"Environnement de travail désagréable, un manque d'organisation. Du fait du contexte social de l'entreprise."
bad,"First off, the staff is really friendly. It definitely feels like you're part of a family. The problem is that 9 times out of 10 there's only one worker in the Copy and Print area and there are WAY too many tasks to do for only one worker. You have to help customers with varying custom print orders, answer the phone that rings every 5 minutes, help customers ship packages, complete online orders, and send customer faxes and/or emails with usually 3 or more customers at once. Since the area deals with custom jobs, most jobs aren't as straightforward as most would think. For instance, some people bring in flash drives and want a copy of everything on it while keeping everything in order, or a simple scan and email job can become something like scanning a 80 sheet stack of documents one sheet at a time and sending all 80 individual files for multiple email addresses. Some customers are even in copy and print for hours trying to get every little detail perfect. There is so much focus on paying attention to every little detail for each and every customer whether they come in person or order a print job online. It's extremely overwhelming to take on that much stress alone especially since the store is one of the busiest Office Depots in our city. Plus, just about every customer waits to the last minute to order a print job and try to ask for it to be done the same or next day for a job that should take 3 - 4 days to complete. This makes job deadlines horrendously challenging to meet. Even if you try to tell a customer that you don't think the job can be completed in such a short time,"
bad,Senior leadership has no strategy or ideas how to save this company.  There is no support for managers just threats and false hope company is on the right track. Entire senior leadership team from regionals on up needs to be fired with no golden parachute.  Its almost to the point of no return.
bad,"Recently got new management. But it seems like things are just the same. Service to customers possibly got better, but the treatment towards employees didn’t. Obviously there’s favoritism. "
bad,Boring..no chance for advancement. Asked to use restroom one and a half hours of being there and was sent to lunch instead. Knowing i would not be able to take a break again for 6 hours.
bad,"Just dont. I started as a client engagement manager, was unwantedly promoted to operations manager and did the work of ALL managers. Got paid 15 an hour to do the work of an entire staff, please, if you love yourself than the money doesn't matter. That is the one and ONLY good thing. Money."
bad,"To keep this simple."
bad,"Avoid working in this company, and in this industry, it is shrinking/dying.  The high level of management made some serious mistakes resulting in terrible sales.  Recently 600 people were let go, 400 sales people."
bad,"The company is trying everything possible to stay in business... closing stores, cutting payroll, changing policies and procedures, lowering titles and compensation"
bad,"The job itself was fantastic, though sometimes management could be an issue. Sometimes you would spend several days setting up plan-o-grams and then them change the next day because management didn't agree on how things should look. The corporate decisions that consistently made doing my job more difficult is the main reason i searched for employment elsewhere. They made decisions that made a job go from a 2-3 hour assignment, to one that would take several days just because they wanted to go from adhesive ad stickers, to ones that you have to completely take the shelf apart to apply. Also extremely short staffed at all times. When i left we had only 9 people total on our payroll and we were open 7 days a week."
bad,"Company culture is all rhetoric and no substance.  Expectations of leadership for daily worker is unachievable and, therefore,  employees are set-up to fail."
bad,Your boss is not suppose to be your friend. Your boss shouldn't publicly insult you or do so behind close doors. Your boss is not suppose to play favorites or get chummy with people that get drunk on the job and fall asleep in the main office almost daily. Your boss should not be lazy or take days off when they are not earned.
bad,"good job for people going to school full time. works with schedule and other things along those lines. not too shabby to be bluntly honest, just wish the guests weren't so rude"
bad,I was not a fan of working at office depot. The only reason I stayed so long is because they worked with my schedule for college.It was nice that they worked with my schedule but was not a fan of the rest the job aspect.
bad,"I hated it, the mangers were rude and cocky, worst job I’ve ever had and don’t plan on going back to the company ever again and I don’t recommend this to others"
bad,"Awful. They would never hire anybody and offloaded the extra work onto us while the store manager sat on his rear. Absolutely 0 accountability for anyone or anything, and there was no way to complain or contact anyone. I never want to work in this kind of environment ever again, even if it was the easiest I've ever gotten."
bad,"After working for the company for more than 7 years, I discovered they are working on a old business model.  Brick and mortar stores are slowly getting outed by online giants like Amazon and Wal-mart.  More emphasis on products that are only found or available and rework of the management structure is needed."
bad,"No true advancement, unwieldy focus on micromanagement of lower level employees, and mandatory and often arbitrary 'training' gimmicks. A sell first, ethics later environment that pushes services the customer does not need."
bad,For being a company that specializes in organization you'll be surprised that they aren't that organized. They demand too much work for the low payment.
bad,"Management was the worst I've ever seen.  Inconsistent, micromanagement, abusive, lacked vision, refused to listen to the field.  required specific number of hours per area store and the gave much less to accomplish"
bad,at best a place to work at during the summer to make a few bucks.  This company does not care about its employees.  Most managers are incompetent and lack management skills.  Employees are undervalued and are encouraged to sell protection plans which are a total scam to customers.
bad,"The company is outsourcing more and more, and they will say your job is secure one day, and lay you off the next. It used to be a great place to work, but no longer."
bad,"Got caught up in their merger. Company does not have respect for their employees.  "
bad,"work environment was not the best. management wasn't the best. easy job overall, but could get very boring most of the time since office depot doesn't get much customers. wouldn't go back !"
bad,Company was a great company to work for when I started. The company seems to have moved away from caring about the associates  and customers. they now seem to care more about making the next dollar than the next good impression or returning customers
bad,"The most difficult part of being at OfficeMax was balancing life vs work environment. Majority of the time, I'll be working from open to close, and if you know retail, those are long hours."
bad,Office depot es una empresa que promete mucho y cumple poco
bad,this is not the company to work for if you are looking for a career. it is a job for young kids to start out in. I do not see myself making a long life decision to work here.
bad,"When I worked there, it was just OfficeMax.    They were not proactive in driving sales and making changes to remain competitive.  Each store manager pretty much operated their store individually and so there waqsw li8ttle continuity from store to store."
bad,Es mala trabajar ahí mal salario el gerente prepotente y te grita
bad,Office Depots company culture is the worst among a lot of retailers. Job security is terrible and so many changing procedures and processes. I definitely would not recommend them. Also a lot of politics. Upper management lies a lot to cover themselves.
bad,I'm pretty sure this is probably one of the worst places I've ever worked at.  I got over worked to the point where working 10+ hours a day was mandatory. If you didn't work your hours it was counted against you. They wanted everyone to work weekends but didn't make it clear that it was mandatory until that Friday. If you have a life outside of work you can say goodbye to it if you work here. Even if you are looking for a part-time job just know when they say part-time they will ask you to work 35-40 hours anyway and then not offer benefits. I've worked at other warehouse and this by far was one of the worst ones. I would never till anyone to work here unless all you want to do is work and not get appreciated for it.
bad,"supervise all aspects of day to day operations."
bad,"Employees are very difficult to work with.  Most are young gamers that spend most of the time playing World of Warcraft.  Many don't bathe or brush their teeth.  The majority of the public that shops there are unreasonable and in a bad mood.  A pleasant customer is very rare.  Management at the store level is very understanding and supportive of the employees, however district and corporate management are extremely difficult to deal with.  Trying to balance a family and life with work is very difficult."
bad,"I work in the print department, which is the most stressful place. "
bad,It was very fast paced and a positive enviroment the manager was very cool and had a great personality the Co-workers were positive and always a big help to me the hardest part of the job was dealing with hard customers other than that i really enjoyed the job.
bad,"big culture shock, some people not friendly, no time for training pay and benefits are good, location is ok, communication with employee is half and half. information comes out too late"
bad,Office Depot is okay my location was just blah because of managers not wanting to do their jobs.
bad,working with customer by showing them were the different products were located in the store.
bad,Office Depot was one of the most professional office supply stores I have visited in over 30 years of administrative occupations.
bad,"Its a job. But i would never recommend it to anyone. You cant advance unless the management says so, and there are no full-time positions only part-time. All around a annoying place to work."
bad,"This company has gone from ok to just horrible. My location is located in downtown so, we are extremely busy and we entertain a large amount of low life scum. In the beginning it was ok working at OD but, as time went on and any competent dept. managers and workers kept dropping like flies it became more and more difficult to report for duty. As of late the company has gone through an overhaul and let me be the first to say this was a failure of the most highest order. Managers have always tried to get out of doing work but, now its actually encouraged for them to be the last person to respond to a customer. All you see are 2 or 3 managers in a circle talking about, God knows what."
bad,"The main problem with this job was the management felt like they were learning their jobs as they went along. They were often unable to answer even simple questions like...""are we going to be busy today?""...or...""Are we going to be working overtime today?""...we could ask that second one less than an hour before we were meant to leave and they still couldn't answer. It was so bad in this way that on several occasions we were told we had to work overtime only ten minutes before the end of the day, which made life outside of work impossible to plan for."
bad,"avoid, take another opportunity. Advancement will be slow. Probably a  typical situation in today's times. My personal experience has not been enjoyable"
bad,"At my store atleast, the management was awful. Anything that wasn't what they wanted, was wrong. Refusal to work with changing situations, low pay for the work expected, unfriendly environment all around"
bad,"Customers made the associates feel very low, constantly rude and pushy, the lack of understanding of technology made a lot of customers hard to work with. I mained the print department where I was the only person of a staff of like 12 that knew how to do my job in my department, never had much help. Customers created terrible and tight crunch lines when we would be overfilled with orders and behind and we were berated by customers for being busy. Terrible treatment and no help from store manager."
bad,"Do yourself a favor and stay away unless you are looking to be unemployed in 6 months.  Management is ineffective, preaches cultural principles they don’t practice.  The company is disorganized, with effective and clear communication between departments hard to come by. Upper management constantly changes what they are looking for and struggles finding consistent direction."
bad,"This is a great job as a first time job or for students, but there are no promotions ever or raises even when you do your best everyday and try your hardest everyday to push something you don’t care about. They don’t actually appreciate their employees."
bad,"At a store level, the coworkers and SM might be good to work with but the clients are the legit worst and logistics are awful. Pay isn't usually bad but I wouldn't say worth what corporate office expects of your understaffed store. Expect no help for your team when you encounter problems with their systems."
bad,"I personally did not enjoy my time at office depot very much. Employees were constantly quitting. Management was not the greatest; however, the job hours were flexible."
bad,"Very low paying job with absolutely no benefits whatsoever."
bad,"I had worked at officemax before they were bought by office depot. I moved up to operations manager and then stepped down due to lack of support from upper management. After being bought out, the company continued to introduce new services such as computer repair, software installation and cellphone repair. They expected the associates to learn to perform all these services but they refused to compensate them for all the extra work or stress from working on such delicate things as cell phones."
bad,Office Depot is in deep decline; not sure how they stay in business with so much competition from other retailers and the lack of clear direction from their corporate office.
bad,They pay every one the same without taking in consideration your knowledge and degree.  When you ask for a raise they indicates that you need to up sell all services.  That way you may be consider for a raise.
bad,The Company is perfect for those who do not care to advance in the company.  The hardest part of the job is not knowing what time you will get off and constant start time changes. A typical day consists of me receiving products and detailing them to either be stocked in the warehouse or shipped to another store. Meanwhile you have to deal with poor communication on managements behalf. Failing to approve time-off request. They show favoritism towards people and it is like everyone in management are best friends who side together and treat their employees like children.
bad,"The merge made working as a Delivery Driver worse! Beyond stressful, piled with alot of stops, working on a strict time frame, and dealing with a manager with a poor attitude! Avoid working here as a Delivery Driver! You'll thank this review later!"
bad,"Ambiance de travail avec les collègues au top Culture d'entreprise aussi ainsi que les clients anime les journée."
bad,"I was a Sales Consultant, Print Services Employee, and Cashier. The job itself isn't awful, you just get paid so little to do so much and you wear multiple ""hats"". Many decisions the company makes and the way they operate as a whole makes me think the company won't be around for much longer."
bad,Lo que mas gusto es que me dieron oportunidad del crecimiento laboral
bad,What I learned here was that the hours weren't reliable. I was able to learn different positions in the store which was enjoyable. It was a good overall experience.
bad,"En esta empresa solamente valoran tu trabajo si eres joven y guapo, yo como ya era una persona mayor ¡ nunca me quisieron promover !, pero eso si, vi el caso de muchas jovencitas que no sabian ni la O por lo redondo y las promobian. En una ocacion paso que mi gerente robaba en el area de atencion a clientes y di aviso a prevencion de perdidas ¡ ellos nunca hicieron nada !, al contrario le hicieron saber al gerente que yo lo habia acusado y el luego me amenazo con correrme si seguia habriendo la boca., y como estos robos ya me estaban afectando a mi porque me decian que como atencion a clientes era mi responsabilidad yo tenia que ayudar a pagar lo que se perdiera, francamente esto no me gusto porque yo con mis propios ojos veia como mi gerente entregaba a los clientes la mercancia, se las cobraba pero nunca la registraba en la caja registradora argumentandole a los clientes que no servia el punto de venta y que despues lo registraria ¿ que si no necesitaban su tiquet de compra ? y claro los clientes que le decian que no necesitaban el tiquet se hiban sin su tiquet sin mayor problema ¡PERO MI GERENTE SE QUEDABA CON EL DINERO DE LA COMPRA!., todo esto lo supieron los altos ejecutivos de la empresa ¡¡¡ Y NADIE ME CREYO !!!, luego despues tuve que renunciar para evitar que me hecharan la culpa a mi. "
bad,A typical day of work was not very busy. I would assist customers in they shipping and ring them up for items. Working for office depot I had learned a lot in sales.  The management term was great and helpful as well as my co-worker. The hardest part about my job was there wasn't  many hour. what I enjoyed most was working with the customers.
bad,The store manager had no family values and would rather anyone work 12 hours than get time with their children.
bad,"Office Depot USED to be very promising, entertaining, and educational. I used to LOVE working there. In fact, there was a point in time I actually considered Office Depot as a possible career! All of my previous co-workers at that time were GREAT, and the teamwork was phenomenal! Our ratings and market baskets made us the BEST in the district, customers loved us. . Despite the 2/5 managers who harassed employees, Office Depot back then was just awesome!"
bad,"Cashier, Computer Tech, customer service specialist, helped where i can"
bad,"Being that this was retail and sales type employment, dealing with the customers was the most difficult part. But as I advanced in my knowledge on the job, I realized that there wasn't a chance of me advancing in the company. Plus, my work hours almost vanished completely."
bad,"The company culture is all about the numbers and whether or not you are achieving them. Plus they keep piling on more and more programs and services; but of course they would never increase you pay or give the store more payroll to compensate. The ""say yes"" to customers just makes them able to abuse us and carry no responsibility of any sort for anything. Coupon expired, sure; way out side the return policy,  whatever."
bad,The management was typically very understanding and willing to work with you. You always kept busy. The best part of the job was being able to help set up customers with items that you knew would make them happy for years to come.
bad,"Managers don’t understand when you don’t understand something, you ask for help and they just blow you off. Nice company but the workers are rude. And you never get enough hours"
bad,The work could be easy in the department I'm in but the pay is not worth the labor put into it. Working with many different individuals reaches you who works together well and who is not good to work with
bad,Worked there for a year. Worked with lovely people but witnessed corporate offices screw over our location and multiple people many times. Very unfortunate.
bad,"Despite the valuable experience that I gained while working there, the ONLY reason that I gained that experience was because of my store manager, a good person who was willing to let his employees use creative but corporate-safe methods to complete the job in a more efficient way.  I would recommend my former LOCATION highly.  That being said, I have nothing positive at all to say about the corporate-level management of the company: anything at all that looked good on paper was then forced upon store employees, oftentimes with either methods or timing that actively prevented us from doing our jobs effectively.  At one point there were literally corporate employees spying on store employee radio conversations to make sure we weren't talking unless it was strictly about work.  "
bad,"Because the store I was working at was slow paced, the company pushed up to make up the sales in add-ons, which was fine, except I began to feel like I was forcing sales, so we would lose customers, best they felt uncomfortable and cheated."
bad,"This job has the potential to be a good one, but there are so many issues with the store and company that it makes it hard to want to stay. Low hours, low pay, and they are constantly understaffed. You have huge workloads compared to other retail positions and unless you are lucky enough to get full time hours, you can kiss benefits goodbye. When you do have long days you get one 30 minute long lunch and no breaks even in a 8+hour role, which for a job that has you on your feet and usually standing in one place for that long it's too taxing. Store is unorganized, pay is abysmal at best and the management is superior to the point of arrogant and stuck up. It's not a good work environment to work in, even as a tosser job."
bad,"The experience at Office Depot is not the best due to the poor management that was held throughout my time working there. Unnecessary drama and stress was created between other assisting managers and staff. The work load of my position, freight and logistics specialist was unfair and taken advantage of."
bad,"The company was fine the first two years in, and after the new CEO and the wanting to merge with Staples it became very unrewarding ,to say the least . Tons of micro-management that left you busy doing other things instead of the reason your there..... TO RUN A BUSINESS."
bad,"Es una empresa que paga bien. Pero su principal objetivo es auditar. Te la pasas en las carpetas y es facilisimo un empleado te haga salir mal. Ahi no manda el distrital. Ahi manda el auditor de prevencion y su jefe wilson. Se la pasan aliandose con la gente que no trabaja con los flojos para hacer y enterarse de los chismes. Los jefes y sub gerentes no tiene  responsabilidad. Todo es el gerente. Si no le caes bien al wilson y le echas en cara que su equipo de guardias no sirven, que no cuidan el inventario no tendras futuro en esa empresa.como que le dan una pension por mes ya que les cree mas a los guardias  que a una persona que fue contratada, con examenes socioeconomico etc. Y a los guardias los traen de la calle. Ni telefono ni estudios ni dato alguno tienen."
bad,Office Max was a great company however when the company was bought out by Office Depot the company went down hill. They drasticly cut my pay and changed my position without a second thought. I would never work for this company again.
bad,Company is very unstable. With the consistent realigning of Districts and positions it makes it very hard to advance. You could have worked with a DM for the past 3 years be on a great career path and all of a sudden that guy is out of a job and you have to start over. DM's micro manage the stores being a store manager or assistant isn't really that. I would not suggest what so ever. The only plus side is the work life balance working here was awesome hourly assistant manager made it east to have a life.
bad,"Check the part of the email address for misspellings or missing letters. (If you find an error, you might need to correct it in your contacts list or address book too.) "
bad,"Let me start by saying that I have no issues with this specific store..."
bad,5 por el personal que se relaja mucho no  trabajan
bad,"Was hired as Print Supervisor, and began to experience poor management quickly. The way some managers spoke was the most unprofessional I had ever experienced. Demeaning, controlling, hateful talk was par for the day. I even wrote a six page letter to corporate about this, detailing incidents and dates. The equipment broke down regularly, or did not function properly. That did not change the dates of completion, and if it was late, It's your fault. It's like running a major operation on less than a shoestring budget. Very unprofessional."
bad,My current manager is more of a bully then an person she never treated me fairly she is rude to me and has called me useless and shes called other clients and employees stupid.
bad,"I was told this was a relationship selling position which have about 10 years of experience, I was placed with a manager that wouldn't know a relationship if it walked up and hugged him. He just sat in his cube looking at numbers and also did that at home after hours. Was not a pleasant experience and with Amazon getting into business office supplies I don't see a bright future for OD/Omax because it is a dying industry."
bad,"Retail is a dying business, especially old models of retail. Office Depot Office Max is seriously old school. Without up to date technology, sales tactics, and employee well being being on the forefront of this company, I don't see many people ever wanting to work here."
bad,"If you're a student looking for a part time job, Office Depot/OfficeMax would probably be good for you. If you plan on being a full time employee, be prepared to be overworked and more than likely under paid."
bad,The manager there is very rude and a corrupt person i did not enjoy working for him because he acted like a child and everyone left the store because of him and how inappropriate and weird he was.
bad,Need to pay people more money . There is never enough staff on hand. I really dont like it here. You only get a break about 2 hours before you get off.
bad,It can be a decent job depending on your manager or if it's your first job. But most of management have bad attitudes and don't know how to treat their employees. Over worked and underpaid. They forget humans are not robots.
bad,"Not a great place to work, but a good starting point. The management at the store I worked at was awful, and the DM was even worse. It seemed like they didn't care about their associates at all."
bad,Although all the talk is about changing how we serve our customers there is no real desire to change.   Everyone is used to functioning in their own silos that their is no incentive for cooperation.   Employees have gotten so used to functioning in their own dysfunction that change is seen as a threat instead of as an opportunity to improve a business model that needs revamping.   The culture doesn't lead to cooperation instead employees are on the defensive feeling that they have to justify their every move.
bad,I expect this company to be bankrupt by 2020 upper management is clueless. Company thinks slogans and keywords are teamwork.
bad,Started out as a good job. Loved what I did until management had a turn over. Management isn't fair to their employees and they don't back them up.
bad,"Great place to work,  management lets me sell and manage my customers / business and territory as if I owned it  this is big reason for my success."
bad,A typical day at Office Depot includes assisting customers and team work.
bad,"I was in charge of Copy and Print at Office Depot on my shift, as well as being a cashier.  I would create jobs for customers such as resumes, invitations, flyers or basic copying or faxing for them.  I learned how to use the photoshop software. I loved my coworkers, If I couldn't understand how to create a job my coworkers would lend a helping hand when they could.  The hardest part was not getting proper training on all the software or being able to create certain jobs for customers.  I loved meeting new people and building a bond with my customers."
bad,My Review of office depot is . I got fired for my so called job performance when all i ever did was dedicate my life to office depot and no one even call to find out about why that has happen to me.
bad,Too much work. No manager support and you have to teach yourself if you want to succeed. Management will Lie and throw you under the bus when they are done with you. And will leave you High and dry.
bad,If you’re looking for an after school job this is a great place to work but other than that everything else sucks. No one is willing to help you as an employee and it is unbelievably understaffed but not as bad as it used to be. Staff is poorly trained. You will be expected to do much more than you should have to do because of this. Corporate closes on holidays but you are required to work so if you have any problems you cannot reach out for help from them. Sales goals are unrealistic especially for logistics team who rarely cashiers is expected to still meet quotas and everyone is expected to sign every customer up for rewards or some type of subscription.
bad,Worked here for almost 9 months besides from the store manager going on vacation every month to the assistant manager that took more smoke breaks than actual managing my time there was good for the most part.If you looking to move up in a company this is NOT the place for you
bad,I enjoyed working at office depot for my first year until a new manager came. The one i worked at was the location on hayden and osborn and the current manager and DM basically forced me to quit. After the new manager was 40 minutes late last year i sent a complaint to hr and the district manager ended up informing the store manager that I was the one who put in the complaint. A couple months later we got a new manager who was fantastic but then had to leave because of medical reasons and the old manager had come back. I got called up to the DMs office where I was told that I could either deal with the manager or find a new job.
bad,"Favoritisme, clan, harcèlement moral, histoires, agression des client sur le personnels, sans soutient de la direction, ce qui donne suite à un étouffement de l'affaire, ce qui arrange celle-ci."
bad,"The store manager is extremely rude and is never willing to help.  the one thing I leaned from this job is that I do not like working registers, the best thing about the job is my co-workers, they are the best"
bad,"Management was poorly, only looked out for herself, pay was the worst didnt matter how long or how are you worked still wasnt good enough. Other co workers were great"
bad,Unfortunately the location I worked for at that time the training was not up to par. Management was never to be found and an extreme lack of all around team work from poor direction and leadership. Found another job 2 weeks into my 90 day probation period of employment for officemax
bad,Not a good company for adults but more for high school kids. No pay raises for long time employees. They will rather start new high school employees at a higher pay than pay current employees.
bad,"This used to be an amazing company with great compensation and opportunity for advancement, but corporate changes and new ""strategies"" have completely changed the culture and work environment to one that is unsustainable.  Stores are poorly supplied with merchandise and are not given adequate budgets to hire and schedule sufficient qualified staff.  So many additional hours are required to complete the work in the alotted time that it isn't possibe unless the salaried manager works double shifts.  And just when you think you've caught up, there is another mandatory ""initiative"" and you have to completely change how you market and merchandise your store.  The wrtiting is on the wall -- I buy my supplies from Amazon."
bad,"I didn't mind most of the people I worked with here, great staff and excellent team work."
bad,"I worked at the distribution center in West Chester ohio. The plant manager, who I understand is still there was one of the worst people I ever worked for and the reason I left. He had a turnover rate of over 50%. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the plant manager. Talking to him about anything was a lost cause."
bad,"You're at work, and it's your job to man the register today. You're doing your best to ring up the customer in front of you, but it's going very slowly because your register was made in the 80's. The customer isn't overtly rude to you, but they're clearly in a hurry and not happy to be kept waiting. They don't feel the need to be kind to you at all. You ask them the five different questions that you are required to ask. They respond in grunts. You are currently the only person on register, and the line of customers waiting to check out is stretching out into the store. You call for backup on your radio, but you are met with silence because there are only two other employees in the store right now and they are busy helping customers elsewhere. You could have sworn that a new employee was supposed to be here today, but they're late and no one has heard from them."
bad,Gained most of my experience working on computers here.  Did warranty work for IBM and performed upgrades for people who purchased computers from Office Depot.
bad,"Not a good work environment, contract position, culture not there, bad environment, no room for advancement, customer service non existent, management does not care"
bad,Nada más con fijarse que contratan a cada rato pues la gente se va por el trato que los jefes les dan pues te piden una producción que no la vas a cumplir si los paran para regañar a todos casi una hora porque van atrasados varías veces al día.
bad,"The Warehouse that I worked at was the most stressful job I have ever worked in, Management was horrible (with a few exception) and while hitting the productivity can be easy, other employees can and will try to stop others to reach said productivity range."
bad,"Do not work here unless you're a teenager whose parents are forcing you to get a job. Managers come and go, frequently, and are usually clueless. They most likely got the job due to good 'ol nepotism."
bad,"It was a retail position, so it was mostly interfacing with the public and helping them find the products or services they needed when I wasn't in the stock room."
bad,"Base on salary and management and not enough room for progress, or advancement, I would not recommend OfficeMax for employment, I alway question the stability of OfficeMax"
bad,Don't leave the company as they refuse to rehire former employees.  Lots of upheaval.  Lots of craziness.  Not many employers in south Florida so they can treat employees poorly.
bad,"Much information was needed and nobody responded to questions.  This was at a corporate level.  Store Manager was awesome.  They started a program, hired me at a wage and then switched to straight commission.  With as difficult as their communications were I would have never hired on for straight commission.  A less than professional situation, in my opinion."
bad,"The hours are never predictable and only favorite employees get issued enough hours. The whole store reeks of failure. Everything, from item to services are overpriced and poorly supported."
bad,It was a tense workplace. Jobs were offshored and we were told 6 months ahead of time we were losing our jobs. Have no clue what stores are like but the call center was not friendly.
bad,"Good place to work, always busy, good manager, take care of their people, challenging, conveniently located, good perks, mainframe technology, would work there again"
bad,"The location I worked at would sent another cashier home just to ask me to stay and work. I was a target for one of the managers that would try to have me perform duties that none of the other cashiers did just because they were a manager. AWLFUL experience, I would not recommend that location to anyone ever. I'm pretty sure those people still work there."
bad,"I worked in Shaker Heights when it was the OfficeMax headquarters. Feuer was presidents and the culture was oppressive, lacking in teamwork, and not forward looking."
bad,"I enjoy challenging jobs, where I can show my abilities in managing the group, time, and productivity. I have worked in different countries with different ethnic group, and learned how deal with the hard situation and people who I work with. I try to be happy in my work area and create a safe work place for my crew."
bad,Management has been there since the company started and are unwilling to change their approach.  There is a lot of competition in the market that was not there before.  Amazon is making it virtually impossible for this company to survive.
bad,My coworkers were always pretty nice but my last boss I had with this company was terrible. I would never get acknowledged for going above and beyond on my customers projects. I was constantly thrown under the bus by my one other coworker who was always taking credit for my work. Boss was very unprofessional and would yell at me in front of customers. He would also always change my schedule last minute without notifying me which would cause me to miss days. Only good thing about working here were the friends I made.
bad,"I gained valuable experience in team work by working alongside a variety of co-workers. I was able to learn how to assist in managing a store whenever the store manager needed assistance, and someone to take the mantle. Amazing experience was cultivated when I was working in the business services department where a co-worker and I would create and help manage portfolios for business's that needed them made with information that they provided. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet continuously walking/running for 9 to 11 hours with only a 30 minute break where I could sit down. The most wonderful times though were being able to network and gain new knowledge every single day."
bad,"worst company to work for....the company is doing lousy, the training and selection programs could use a lot of work...not very geared toward satisfying their own employees"
bad,this company was great working for because it was teamwork orientated
bad,This company is so understaffed (Because of the turnover) that they would have stockers fill in for the technicians.
bad,The manager was absolutely horrible. they need to train their managers to trust their employees a lot more than they currently do.
bad,management was bad and so were the other coworkers. they wouldnt give hours to anybody and no business there
bad,"I loved my job, and did a great job at it, until my commission kept getting smaller and smaller on each check, with no major difference in sales. My manager was placing my sales under his name to usurp my commission to pay for his newly built home."
bad,Hired as a receiving clerk at the crossdock. Enjoyed learning their inventory system created exclusively for Office Depot. Enjoyed interacting with the management team at the facility and at the corporate office.
bad,i was a cashier.
bad,Just not a good place to work. The staff is back biting and the pay is incredibly terrible.
bad,Good place to work and interact with customers. Growing one customer at a time.
bad,"Tenured employees remain, taking roles: field sales, customer service, that had been performed by newer employees. Starting to fill positions that had been vacant, offering less pay, fewer opportunities."
bad,This was a part Time Sales Associate with no benefits and I could not make a living on this as well I went to school to better myself!
bad,"cada mes  había capacitación y integración.aprende a valor mas a las personas,unión trabajar en grupo y compresión."
bad,"Un día típico: Hacer nuestras juntas diarias para motivar a nuestros colaboradores para alcanzar las metas laborales y personales. ya que es de gran impulso compartir el conocimiento y darle confianza que se puede alcanzar los que se proponga."
bad,I had the best group of people any co worker could ask to work with. I have missed this job ever since I left.
bad,These People (Corporate) use you and dont care about anything you have to say. The Loss Prevention department are always confused and dont care about their employees. Once they feel they got everything out of you as an employee you will be terminated with no explanation.
bad,It's a typical retail envoirment. Long shifts standing on a concrete floor.Fussy customers. Managers seemingly trying to get you fired.altogether not a great place to work.
bad,Beaucoup trop de stress beaucoup trop de problèmes entre les collaborateurs qui ne sont pas réglé par la direction les employés font ce qu'ils veulent dans le magasin et la direction s'en fiche éperdument. Je recommanderais un poste au sein de cette entreprise à personne qui veut avoir une grande carrière professionnelle non respect des employés non-respect des règles de sécurité non respect des horaires non respect de la personne non respect de la vie privée harcèlement moral et j'en passe
bad,"Everything is number driven.  If you try to help by mentioning an issue, YOU are the problem.  Not the fact that you have to hunt for products that are not entered into any locations!  No breaks.  You better have a great bladder because you have to beg to even get a bathroom break!  Incentives have gone by the wayside.  You have to get rewards sign ups, protection plans, ink subs but do you get paid for it?  Nope!  Kids these days want to be paid for not working.  You bust your tail and they slack off.  Forget it!"
bad,Pay sucks horrible management heavy turnover best part of the job was talking to the coworkers and the free food when there is free food other than that nothing
bad,"Throughout the time I worked in Office Depot, I learned how to operate a cashier, restock, aide a customer, online orders, take calls and to organize shelves. However, the reason why I quit Office Depot is due to it's unorganized work ethnics. There aren't only angry customers that act upon their frustrations, so do the older workers. They are rude to the customers, replying condescendingly or immaturely. The hardest part of the job is dealing with impatient customers. There were a total of about 4-5 people working per day, one per section of the store, meaning I usually worked cashier alone as the lines get long."
bad,"Una compañía que se aprovecha de sus empleados, las posiciones temporeras te hacen trabajar duro y más de 12 horas al final antes de cumplir los 3 meses te sacan, mucha discriminacion y favoritismo. La mayoría de sus empleados trabajan por visa.  Son falso te reúnen los managers y te dicen qué hay posiciones para que trabajes duro y no te vayas antes de los 3 meses te sacan y te quedas sin trabajo. Nunca había visto una compañía tan falsa. Ahí se los dejo  buena suerte a los que apliquen."
bad,"It was a very stressful job.  Understaffed mostly. I had to fill many roles. There were no weight belts for picking up heavy products. Was always pushed and reprimanded for not enough ink subscription sales.  Was talked down to by management.  Treated like I was stupid. I felt like I was under surveillance, if a customer didn't buy a plan for ink or PC repair, I was asked why and then scolded for not selling any.  Hostile work environment. People were leaving constantly."
bad,Work environment is getting better. The pay sucks and they freeze you in the winter and make you sweat in the summer. Not too mention you get no benefits what so ever.
bad,"unload trucks, stock shelf, backstock, clean store, close or open, lead team, inventory, guest service, sales, placement, stocking, planograms, interviews"
bad,"Fun to work with people who try to do their best even if the managers are not friendly at all, and the work is bad to much to do for not enough employees"
bad,"Had me working between 36-40+ hours a week, refused to promote me to full-time. Technically a part-time employee, getting paid $9 an hour for an extremely stressful job. Management was also aware I was a full-time student. No paid time off, management refused to hire more associates for my department to help."
bad,"Bad experiences with upper management.  Structure was weak, no consistency in culture of management.  Unreasonable requests made of middle management conducive of being let down by the company.  In example 5 year run with no raises.  Higher, longer term managers replaced with lower paid incoming managers.  Merger with Office Max forced several associates removed unfairly due to overstaffing with store closures."
bad,"No one cares if you advance, or are happy. Management isn't existing. Culture of giving away product to satisfy customers. No one was happy, and It wasn't a great place to be."
bad,"It was an okay place to gain experience and knowledge in the copy and print center as well as all other operating systems within the store, such as inventory or freight."
bad,no advancement was available after becoming Customer Service Manager. Manager at the time did not support or help staff grow to potential. Was required to run other departments as well as front end.
bad,"Fellow employees were friendly but it was like dealing with a high school drama. Some managers would fuel the drama. They would even participate. It was very competitive, but a higher rank of employment was almost unattainable. I loved working in copy and print but i hated the people."
bad,"I worked in the Blue Springs location, management is manipulative and promises job opportunity to get you to work for them but after 7 months of working there was told they couldn't offer more opportunity or more money. The managers can't help in Copy and Print section they don't know what to do so if you work there you are on your own. The pay is horrible for the amount of work you have to do and horrible customers you have to put up with. I do not recommend working at this location."
bad,"I worked for Office depot on and off for the last 7 years and each location I worked at, just went down hill. When I first started working for this company, I actually enjoyed it. The manager I had was amazing, and he taught me so much about technology and how to properly run the Copy and Print department. "
bad,Customer inquires relating to there goods they have purchased -we would follow through to the point where the customer has received everything in time and to there satisfaction
bad,"all they care about was sales, and lieing about warranties. most people were very angry about everything. would not recommend this job to anyone. They shutdown our store because it wasn't making enough money."
bad,"Empresa con mucho déficit de compromiso con empleados "
bad,"A pesar de ser una empresa reconocida y grande su administración no es la adecuada, existen problemas entres jefes y subordinados, discriminaciones y relaciones personales entre los compañeros en horas de de trabajo."
bad,After 20+ years of struggling to work at this company I'm moving on.  This company does not care about its workers.  Its no wonder the stock price at one time was only 73 cents.
bad,Providing customer service to differnt individuals as a cashier.
bad,"Times are hard and I believe that any job is better than no job and this employment opportunity stretched me in every direction. The store was clean, the co-workers were friendly but the wages and hours were awful. Time flew because I stayed busy and I enjoyed interacting with the customers. I rarely got two days off in a row which I think is important. Some days I worked 1st shift and other days were 2nd shift. I prefer steady full-time hours and this position was part-time irregular hours. This job position is great if you only need to earn few extra bucks but not good if you need to provide for a family unless you become a manager but then you will still work crazy hours and if that's what you like then you would be fine."
bad,"Not trying to ""flame"" this company, but mid-upper management might as well have been chimpanzees. The company was poorly run, and it reflected on the customers faces."
bad,Stocked all incoming freight/merchandise. After I was done I worked as a cashier/customer service.
bad,"A typical day starts with cleaning your station for the day. Then you assist customers find what they need and check them out. At check out you have to push memberships and you need to have at least 60% of your transactions to be a member or sign up to be one. At this location you may be doing things not in your original job description, such as switching to the copy and print department or to be a tech specialist as needed. My biggest complaint is always feeling understaffed even when everyone is there and accounted for. A typical day will have one cashier/sales person, one copy and print person, a manager, and maybe a tech person or logistics person. This leads to being overwhelming when you need to pull something from a top shelf for a customer and you have no one to watch the registers. Also the chairs kept on the top shelf are way too heavy for one person to safely get down. I love the interaction with customers and helping them find what they need. One manager is amazing at positive reenforcement where as the other manager focuses on the negatives excessively and can be quite rude about it. The culture tends to be act like you don’t see a problem so it can be someone else’s problem. Mostly applying to cleaning. Also they advertise their positions as full time here on indeed but once hired you will find out that policy says only managers can be full time."
bad,"I worked for Office Depot in 2017, and I hated it. The management was constantly fighting with one another, there was disrespectful comments and gossip from bosses and direct supervisors  it was very toxic and difficult to enjoy working at  I know now they have a different management team, so hopefully they aren’t doing as poorly"
bad,"Upper management will replace you just as quick as they hired you if you disagree with their methods. Constantly under staffed, constant changes in store mangement, no consistancy"
bad,The company is under tremendous pressure with both the retail and office supplies market in decline. That pressure comes down from Management to the teams and creates a very difficult environment to work in.
bad,"From the store manager up.. district, regional, area, it was the worst management I have ever had to deal with ! The store Manager was so afraid of his incompetence that he threw his team under the bus on a daily basis. His poor management skills brought the whole team down. They promised training and never sent anyone. This store had the most incompetent chain of command I have ever experienced !"
bad,"We could really use more employees, other than that office depot is a amazing place to work. The company does seek advancement, sometimes we do not get breaks due to lack of help."
bad,It's every man for himself. Corporate gets upset if you don't follow sop but still gets upset if a customer complains about you following sop. Everyone is either underpaid or getting fired because they get paid too much. Lost a store manager after 20years of service to save the company money. Every company Office Depot buys gets investigated within a month.
bad,Worst place I have ever worked at. Manager would not promote my pay but made me do the job as Print Services Manager. Was verbally teased by my own managers at OfficeMax. Never want to work there again.
bad,"Do not attempt to get a job there if you have ANY type of physical disabilities. NO accommodations will be made for you. Even with a Drs note stating the issues you are suffering from and to please make a small accommodation, such as a stool at a register for several orthopedic based issues."
bad,"I am not a huge fan of working at office depot. Although some of the employees and customers are great, the majority of them are rude and overall not the greatest people to work with. There are days where associates don't get any kind of break, no matter how long a shift is, and there are also nights where there are only 2 people working the entire store (an associate in printing and a manager running the front register). It is hard to want to come  to work when you don't enjoy being there."
bad,"Let’s just start with this. I've worked for Office Depot + Office Max for over 4 years. At first, it was very fun, relaxed and inviting place to work. As I was a teenager at the time, the costs of living expenses were much lower. I worked there for a year and received a pay increase of $1 USD. It was great! I worked throughout the latter end of highschool and the first few years of college. Stepping in to year three and four of working there, I inquired about a raise in pay. However, of course the managers insisted to work employees more and not pay a sufficient wage. In closing, the amount of work one in expected to do is not adequate to the pay that is often time deserved / earned. Moving on, depending on your store’s location, your manager may either suck or be the best yet! My manager, often times came of as “unapproachable”, “stiff”, “not compassionate” and more. When I initially joined the team, I worked alongside approachable, friendly and inclusive managers. Once we received new transfer, things were different and everyone knew it. From my experience, manager[s] would rather talk to associates through the assistant store manager instead of one on one conversations. Moving on, your fellow sales floor reps and associates are very nice; working with some of the coolest peers is what kept me sane and wanting to even come to work at all. However, some of your fellow co workers may have the inclination to call off more often and even do “no call, no show”s more often. Furthermore, with the management and hiring team being so poor, those already working their shifts during"
bad,"I worked in the warehouse. First off, they only have coolers so during summer time it is HOT. I worked there for 2 years thinking i could move up as i learned more and more but no, it was always the managers favorites who did. I put in a lot of work for them and the pay is not that great and i never got to move up. I feel as if this job is great for people who want to get into warehouse work for the experience but not as a long term job. I did my 2 years and got out as soon as i could. We were always short staffed and a lot of people who would get hired, quit within the first month which meant extra work for everyone else. Scheduling was horrible, changed all the time. Some employees were very rude and even some managers. The work is simple and easy."
bad,Not that hard of a job for warehouse work. Management at the Phoenix warehouse very terrible. Hours are always changing and try to cut overtime. Short breaks sometimes you don't even get all your breaks. Turnover rate is very high.
bad,"I have never seen a warehouse ran so poorly. The computer system is outdated so inventory and daily operations are a joke. You never know how many hours you will work from day to day. It could be 8, it could be 12. Not a family oriented place to work. You can't make plans because you don't know when you'll be off work each day. Overall, not a place I'd recommend to anyone unless you like a lot of overtime and don't have a family."
bad,This company has the worst benefits from anywhere I have ever worked. They don't even allow you to enter your own money in 401k which caused me to pay taxes. They are cheap and do not value new employees and it was a mistake leaving my last employer.
bad,"This company cares very little about associate advancement, nor proper training. Associates are expected to perform tasks far beyond their skills, and not compensated fairly for what is expected of them. Constant negative feedback leads to an overall negative environment."
bad,How to get along with people that didn't do their job. Management changed to often. Required to put out trash and that was someone else's responsibility. Customers are always right.
bad,"Management was up and down all the time I was there(problems and they went through so many managers.)"
bad,Struggling to find their identity and future.  Not sure if the want to be a mass retailer or a tech Company.  Doing both poorly.  Neither is a core competency
bad,"I'll start off by saying that I did gain necessary knowledge for future jobs while working at office depot. But with that aside, the things I experienced there team-wise were ridiculous. Nearly everyone acted as if they were in a high school. Gossip and rumors spread around like the plague, making certain people feel isolated. It even got to the point where the manager themself seemed to pick on the ones being outcast."
bad,I have worked for Office Depot for nearly 10 years and have survived 6 rounds of redundancy. If i am completely honest the business is cyclical and does not learn from its mistakes. They have far too many mid level managers.
bad,"I wouldn’t work here again if I was given  the opportunity.  I always end up doing  work that nobody else wants to do, my coworkers don’t care, and they don’t care what the store looks like. The management is good but they’re not good leaders.  They’ll ask people to do things and my coworkers will tell them no or that they don’t want to do it. The longer I worked here the more I realized that you have to pick up other people’s slack."
bad,This is the worst job I have ever had. They have this thing called reflexis that make the schedule. This system only give people 10-15 hours per week like that going to pay bill. This job is a joke.
bad,"Help customers find the products they are looking for, stock/straiten shelves, unload trucks, sweep floor, cashier, reset store planagrams, Sell electronic protection plans"
bad,"I love to work but hours were constantly cut back. The store was constantly under staffed. My frieght crew needed at least 4 people on it, we were cut down to 3 with two of them only working 4 hour shifts. The management was cliquish and communication was lacking."
bad,"there is no set schedule and saving pay roll is their priority. Dusty and drives my allergies crazy, they never clean. Barely any hours and pay isnt good."
bad,"was an ok place to work to learn office supplies and products, how to work in a office setting and to learn to make copies, booklets, business cards, pamphlets, etc"
bad,"It's a fun place to work at but at the same time, the registers are outdated. Everything is very slow and boring. If you're looking for a part-time, this is good for you. For career advancement, not a chance"
bad,The company was in flux when I worked there.  Management did not seem to have a good handle on what was going on. Employees were left without leadership.
bad,I was a cashier and was just mostly standing around doing nothing could not leave my post so was pretty dull when no customers were around. Must sell there free card.
bad,"When I first working for OD/OM I loved everything about it, from my immediate supervisor to the store manager, and everyone in between. The best part was learning the fundamental copy and print center skills, which were taught to me with kindness and patience during the first six months of my employment. Tired of menial cashier jobs, working with at Office Depot was an entirely different world for me; one where I could use some of my own creative influence to help customers see their ideas come to life. I would describe it as a 'whirlwind of learning' and I was thrilled with all the new experiences. "
bad,"The work I put into the job did not at all equal what I got out of it. Employees were easy going, fun and attentive at times (for the most part) but the stores and organization, including management, are run poorly. Not recommended."
bad,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, excepto que no hay montacargas y cuando se requiere bajar papel o subirlo es muy peligroso por las escaleras que están muy estrechas y lo alto de las cajas es de 6 a 8 metros, urge que usen montacargas ya que cada caja de papel pesa 37KG y diario bajábamos un compañero y yo 120 cajas arriesgando caernos de la escalera, (otro compañero se fracturo el tobillo al caerse) deben de mejorar su seguridad ya que siempre tendrán rotación de personal si no reaccionan ya. por otro lado gerencia solo exige las cosas y no apoya, que diré de recursos humanos la persona cree que todo es fácil porque ella no carga nada. No respetan horas de comer ni la hora de salida, en el contrato te dicen otra una cosa y en la vida real es otra cosa Peor, simplemente crei que era mejor empresa para trabajar y realmente no lo es, volveré a Lowe's México una empresa 100% socialmente responsable."
bad,This place was a horrible and frustrating place to work. I worked in the Business Center as a Customer Service Specialist and I was in charge of printing. First of all they don't staff enough people to work in this area of the store. The pay was aweful and the management had no clue about running the business center.
bad,"The workload is immense and it is expected that you will complete it hours before your shift ends. It is a lot of physical labor early in the morning if you're working on the logistics side. You're also expected to actively engage every customer that enters the building regardless of your workload and to sell them things they may not want or need for the sake of a bottom line that was almost never reached due to overpriced items and lack of customer flow. It was a hellish, soul sucking experience and the manager made me cry on multiple occasions."
bad,"Not a good company to work for, I was there for 5 years and never had the opportunity to advance, also only had one raise. Management is not good and you are overworked for the pay."
bad,"I worked at the copy and print area and the managers would copy and print photos, etc for themselves and not pay for them and I tried doing it once and ofcourse I got in trouble. They're terrible people and it is a very unethical place to work at. As long as you're Mexican they will like you but if you're another race they will be racist."
bad,"I managed the copy and print department for a good majority of the time i was there. Working for 10$ an hour with no commision. I had the highest workload in the entire store. Handling most transactions that came in, and even a staggering amount of those who didn't even need anything in my department. Tech associates get commision on the overpriced items and extended warranties they sell, and have a much lighter workload altogether, yet they still make way more than i did in a management position. Fortunately one of the lower level managers was able to fill me in on this injustice and i quit immediately upon finding out. Can't wait til they become staples."
bad,The problem with this company is they want you to work extremely hard but do not want to give you many hours I understand not having the hours but when you have a employee that goes above and beyond you should let them know they do a good job you could work here for years and not ever get a promotion.
bad,"*Typical day at work: Walk in to realize that minimal amount of work had been done."
bad,"Typical day of work: "
bad,Horrible job not the best place to be with high demands of work with little pay. Management was fair instead of the store manager very prejudice towards minorities.
bad,"I only worked there two months because the manager was absolutely terrible.  He was racist, sexist, and had NO idea how to do his job.  Poor management of hours and funds, lead to skeleton shifts near the end of the month which was blamed on the associates.  Poor training for associates, which of course was also blamed on associates."
bad,"Terrible Management and hours, poor communication skills, however, you will gain experience in customer service, cash handling and problem management."
bad,No room for advancement ideal for students needing part time employment or seasonal employment. No perks to working here was simply a I need something now this is what is available
bad,"I worked there for two years, only got $.20 cent raise after every year completion. only get full time if your part of management positions. people come in go because theres no benefits to offer."
bad,"un día típico en el trabajo era llegar mandar apertura de la tienda contar caja fuerte  dar dotación al cajero  hacer paquetes de ventas "
bad,"The basic functions of the print center consultant to use creativity and excellent customer service are fun and often rewarding in knowing that I helped make someones day better."
bad,In a little over a year I reported to 3 different managers and input 4 different operating models. The company is closing stores as fast as they can and will soon become staple which means even more store closings. Store managers are expected to work over 50 hours per week and only hire part time employees at a max of 20 hours.
bad,They do not care about the employee at all. They will use you up and discard you like and old rag.
bad,"A typical day at Office Depot is running the copy center the only way I know how, Multitasking and making sure all customers are acknowledge and cared for within a right amount of time."
bad,"stressful and busy days with out breaks.no benefits,main management has poor communcations"
bad,Stock shelves. Learned about new products. Management was easy to get along with but made poor decisions on weekly job hour postings. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job was top stocking printers on high shelves with no support from co-workers or machines. Most enjoyable part  was completing objectives.
bad,"Terrible pay and doing multiple task which can cause errors. Fastipace enviroment, a hectic schedule, and lack of management expertise."
bad,Office depot is not a good company to work for. They're very the backwards in the way the do things.
bad,"There is a lot of mis trust, mis direction and shady doing within this company"
bad,Too much favortism and not enough drivers for the routes that were covered. They wanted amazon results with a fed ex crew. EVERYTHING is next day delivery. If you like being overworked and underpaid and trying to count your steps on your fitbit this may be the job for you.
bad,"Horrible Management"
bad,"Company is sinking fast. Online sales are taking sales out of the stores. Company is not drawing customers to the stores enough to drive sales. "
bad,"You get to work with some amazing clients. But you are going to be treated like a number and be constantly reminded you can be replaced. Office Depot is a company that needs to realize there associates are more important, since they are the face of your company."
bad,No one is sure what the answer is so they keep plugging the holes with the latest new idea. Don't go down with the ship. It's only going to get worse until it's finally sunk.
bad,My manager was horrible. The played around with compensation making it hard to hit your bonus targets. Goaled you and accounts already lost. Expected on a 17% + increase in sales on accounts that had already left.
bad,"the Store manager, is really nice but will not stick to any schedule and usually no one knows what they are doing. Though the employs work great together and it can be a fun place to work."
bad,"never knew when you were starting and leaving.  No guidance from management, (supervisors, etc.)  constantly changing job requirements.  when asking a question, mostly didn't know (super) or was ignored!"
bad,Recomendable en descuentos para el personal pero muy mal para trabajar te ponen hacer más cosas que te dicen q vas hacer
bad,"Office Dépôt n'est plus la gloire d’antan."
bad,This place was great before the merger with office max. People used to be happy to go to work and you could see it on their face when you are with them but after the merger ALL of that has been lost. And  it looks like it will never be like it used to be.
bad,"I had a terrible, terrible experience working at my location. The managers were awful and unapproachable. Thankless and unfulfilling work, though it did provide a variety of experiences."
bad,When there was nothing left to do they started with the busy work that wasn’t necessary and management was overall rude and dismissive. Their organization was a mess and the moral was like the employees had the life and joy sucked out of them.
bad,"Title was Merchandising Associate and often was a sales associate. As merchandising associate mainly did freight and inventory. On non-truck days, did ""outs"" which was a way of replenishing items on the shelf that were empty. "
bad,"The management at the store that I am at is lacking. The DM doesn't seem to care that the 13 out of 14 staff members want to walk out do to the SM's treatment of us. He makes threats against our jobs, cuts hours if you don't something, will write you up with out discussing anything. If this is the type of managers you want running your store and your district, I don't want to be a part of it."
bad,"was promised and guaranteed a raise after my 90 days,  never got one. had a review with the district manager was told I was going to get a raise and a better schedule.. never happened. The manager didn't know how to correctly schedule anyone, you pretty much had to beg to get a day off that you needed. not much team work involved,"
bad,"work here if you like working for absolutely nothing with terrible management, hardly any vacation time with no benifits! greatest company ever... said no one"
bad,"My comments only pertain to my store, your mileage may vary based on other locations. "
bad,"Everything wrong with the depot can be broken down by draconian business practices, trying to catch up with newer trends/ideas/thoughts. Extremely heavy workload, combined with awful customers (clients) make for a very stressful work environment."
bad,This position was temporary.  There was no real direction for upward mobility.  No room for family life it is retail and shift work.  Need to pay management better for the amount of work that was done.
bad,"I applied in the interest of a full-time position. The general manager called and said to apply for a part-time seasonal position and that I could become full-time after back-to-school season, which I was assured would come with a pay raise as well. Of course, I was not made full-time, nor was I given a suitable pay. Then the other seasonal cashier workers left, so I was taken off of the sales floor and made to work the cash register (which is a dreadfully slow and boring job at Office Depot as they get very few in-store customers) for the remainder of my employment. "
bad,"If you like to be treated poorly and told that you’re stupid, come work here. Store manager yells at everyone and makes the workday very stressful. The store is completely dead most of the time, especially Saturday nights. Sometimes the customers can be extremely rude or act like children to get what they want. Also you feel like you’re working in a hot factory during the summer because the AC breaks every year and they don’t replace it. Same with the heater in winter, it gets chilly. Definitely don’t reccomened working here to anyone."
bad,Hours are so inconsistant. Store manager is a complete moron and rude to not only the works but the customers as well. Didn't even bother to train me on first day. I just got pushed into the job and learned the register all by myself.
bad,The job just didn’t fit my Living.  Management never  stable! And all hours was going to out workers from other stores to fix up the store I was at. Just put me in a really tight spot with bills.
bad,"Lots of unfair expectations. little support. little to no corporate advertising, so hitting sales goals is challenging. Priorities out of whack, needs overhaul to stay current."
bad,"There would be days where I would resent having to work here. After 2 years of working there I got a $0.10 raise even though I was one of the most knowledgeable people on staff. I constantly was the one to answer questions and help other people perform their jobs, even the managers occasionally asked for my help. That job was the kind of job where you wake up to leave and you just want to quit on the spot."
bad,"Management was not performing like they should have. The main store manage was a bully and we were always understaffed. There were times that I had to run the tech bench, print center, and be a cashier all at once."
bad,There was never enough time to get the work done.  The store manager was absent most of the time and provided no guidance or direction.  The corporate loss prevention manager found several deficiencies and short cuts being made in the store.  They don't have the payroll to do want they want to do.  Minimal employee discount.
bad,"My experience was terrible, Managers rule over like little kingdoms at war with other stores. WIll never side with lower employees over managers, expect filling multiple job roles, force car salesmen like positions in Printers section, but dont provide those salesman like benefits like commission.  Encouraged to lie to customers to get sales."
bad,Working for this office supply retailer is only good first time job seekers. The management staff threaten employees when sales goals aren't met and do not praise when they have exceeded expectation.
bad,"Before the Depot/Max merger, this was a great place to work, this is no longer the case. The current management does not care about the associates. Do not plan on working here while maintaining a personal life as well."
bad,This company appeared to be more concerned with selling add-on purchases such as product protection plans than it did for the welfare of the people who worked there. I would not recommend this company to anybody who is looking for competitive pay and a good work environment.  The management was very poor.
bad,Was expected to do every job but my own. Your management team can be good people but policies are what people operate under. All the metrics are developed by headquarters and not realistic.
bad,"I worked in the copy center for almost four years. I will say that I learned a lot about copy equipment, the Microsoft Suite, and Photoshop. I enjoyed helping the majority of my customers (I seldom encountered rude or awful customers, but they do exist) with their projects, and pointing out the best ways to do what they wanted."
bad,"I loved working in the print center, it was an amazing experience and taught me many things to further my experience in printing and even graphic design. But due to lack of communication, poor leadership, and a manager bullying associates, it is a stressful environment. Management does not know how to deal with confrontation or conflict between managers, managers and associates, or associates. It can be/is a very toxic place."
bad,"Great people, but as a corporation they just don't care.  As part of the management team, we got hours. But no one else does. Makes it hard. And you get chewed out by regional and vice presidents if stufd isn't done, when there is no help."
bad,"first was hired not trained on lifts right away ton of injuries occurred "
bad,"It's a good place if your're trying to build your job experience, for teens graduating and trying to complete school while working they provide decent amount of hours not over worked."
bad,"From the new associates to upper management and higher, the company is a mess. There is no room for advancement and I have never seen or heard of anyone getting a raise even if heavily deserved. There is no organization and so much employee turn out that they can't sustain continuity with its staff. In less than a year, there have been about 3 store managers and numerous sales associates."
bad,They are so big it's hard to value the little folks.  It's hard dealing with the public none stop and the company has a never say no rule that allows people to walk all over you.  You will hate it everyday you walk into work.
bad,Generally understaffed.  Impossible to reach goals based on foot traffic.  Managers at store and district level are ineffectual.  Not a great place to work. Pay well below other retailers so hard to get quality people in as employees.
bad,"The management was not considerate of employee needs at all, and frequently disobeyed the laws on disability services."
bad,Working here was only fun wen the managers were not around. Often times customers would even complain about management. They do not go by the schedule only what they want.
bad,I worked part time and setup my schedule to have 2 days off the only days I went to school. The manage didn't schedule me for a whole week after that. Then when I finally got scheduled it was on the only 3 days I asked to have off so I could go to school.
bad,"Llegada a laborar a las 6:00 am y revisar el programa de embarques para circuito foraneo y local,esperar a que se reporten las lineas transportistas,posteriormente avisar al supervisor conforme van llegando. El supervisor o coordinador en turno me asigna una cortina de embarque para cada transporte. Lo siguiente es en rampar la unidad y cargarla conforme a destino y tienda. Una vez terminado el embarque, los scanneadores me daban el mapa de carga para revisar e imprimir desde el sistema toda la información de el scanneo,posteriormente realizaba una auditoria del mapa de carga y la información del sistema una vez que estaba al 100% se cerraba la carga y se enviaban documentos a trafico. Se realiza el folio con toda la infomacion de la carga para cada una de las tiendas y se le da salida teniendo GPS al 100%.La parte mas difícil solo fue al principio ya que es un procedimiento largo y muy a detalle.En general buen ambiente de trabajo,no hay oportunidades de crecimiento pero en general bien."
bad,"Work was mundane, Management was terrible and not very helpful. Not enjoyable and would not recommend. Stores were not kept up in appearance and the Managers had no sense of identity."
bad,"Fun job good workers understanding management. The job is super easy, but very boring unless you like to stand around for the most part of your shift and do repetitive jobs."
bad,"Co-workers and management are all nice, work environment is fairly easy going in comparison to some industries. Great job for students really, but hard on someone trying to support a family, pay a mortgage, or pay their student loans.The training was the ol ""here is the deep end of the pool, lets see if you can swim"" method. No real training given our truly allotted for. A fun part of the job is I get to use my graphic skills. A frustrating part of the job is that I am not paid to use my graphic skills."
bad,i love working in the copy and print department.But the pay isn't worth the bad attitude you deal with from impatient customers.Maybe if you are a copy and print supervisor it may be worth it.But regular copy center employees are minimum wage......Its just not worth the money to be mistreated.
bad,"My goal was to be the best I could be, and made every effort to make that happen, with  impressive results.."
bad,"5 years I spent with Office Depot/Max/Staples. The management is very poorly trained. Most staff is given a crash course and then left to sink or swim. "
bad,"Back in print center, you sit back there all day when there are no customers for printing, you don't get a lunch because there is only one person working at a time, and when management gets stressed he takes it out on everyone working."
bad,"They promise room for advancement, but unless you are willing to stab others in the back to get ahead you won't get far.  Its a great temporaty job, but go in and start looking for a better job because its not a good place to stay long term.  Dealing with customers is hard enough but having management set unrealistic goals and expect you to push credit card signups one under $20 purchases is just not right."
bad,"Total work culture is bad. Usual day starts at 8 am, but people show up on around 8:45 am and the day may extend even upto 6pm.You don't learn anything from there as they are not even coming out of Struts 1.1. lacks a lot on professionalism.Some Co-workers are very exceptional, but most of them being there for more than 2 years, lacking exposure and thus don't know present industry trends."
bad,Turbulent Environment with the new announcement of the Staples buyout. Much consolidation of job functions and redundancies across the board.
bad,The company was not financially stable and went out of business in our city.
bad,"Have had a lot of problems with office depot lately, a lot of hours have been cut."
bad,"They need a lot of work."
bad,"Working with the customers was great. The different skills for the job I enjoyed learning. The management and co-workers are ignorant. The co-worker that was assisting me didn't want to help. She gossiped about other co-workers.The manager and her laughed at me (being sarcastic) when I couldn't get something right, needed more assistance, or simply asking where something goes.This was my first day on the job mind you. I wasn't going to automatically know the entire store from one day. They weren't really concerned about each customer. They just looked for the sale. Overall, the environment was totally unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was working with lousy co-workers and manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging customers and learning good skills."
bad,"The Atmosphere is dead"
bad,Ran the store for the store manager since he was hardly there each day
bad,They are driving me crazy. Put this stock away. Pull this stock out. This has to come before everything else. Get to the register to assist. Heaven forbid there should be one person waiting. Customer walking through door. Drop everything and greet them. Sell sell sell. Must sign up x number of work life rewards. Must sell x amount of PPPs by x pm. Must finish PC repair. The tech bench is full. Oh no. Must stop work on PCs to run after customer. Ugh. Isn't a customer's PC repair also customer service? Then try to understand a customer's question when manager is barking orders and stats through the Borg ear piece all employees must wear at all times. Oh yeah. The place totally rocks. I have a call in to my shrink. May have to go to ER. I think I'll die or hurt someone else if they keep this up!!!
bad,"Stable job, allows people to underperform and there is no accountability to other who under perform"
bad,"Lack of direction and new ideas. "
bad,"typical day is boring.....not much to learn........havent been getting 8 hours in forever. Management is horrible, beliittle you, make you feel wortheless. Most of them are young and have no personalities...they only treat their favorites with respect. This is the worst place I have ever worked at. The money is just ok...the place was great at the beginning but as the time went by they starting taking things away, which is usually how it happens...basically the place isnt a good place to work"
bad,"Compensation was terrible, commission is a joke. Training is impossible you ask for it and you get shoved around day to day. Co-Workers get away basically with murder, they don't give write ups appropriately."
bad,"Stocked shelves , helped customers find what they need. Learned how to work and delegate in the stock room."
bad,"great working with so many new people, but the company lacked team skills and leadership skills. Every one was doing their own thing rather then working as a team and some didn't work at all."
bad,If you want to learn about supply chain it is a good place to start.
bad,in 2007 they laid off the entire transportation department. they are now completely contracted owner operated
bad,"The job itself was enjoyable for the time I spent there. The management on the other hand was sub-par. They insist on managers focusing their days on irrelevant tasks to the every day goal. (i.e. - slideshows, games, food, etc.) There is zero lead by example management skills and was shown at times when certain managers tried to step in and help when there were call ins or the days work was very heavy. They struggled to know the ins and outs of everyday tasks."
bad,Retail as a whole is not easy its very demanding and you get not many real world skills when your are done. Unless you just need a part time job or a summer job i would only recomend high school students or retired people to work there.
bad,"Part time hrs, never same schedule. Lied to, to get members sign ups. No commission. And only hear bad reviews from Customers, none ever heard good reviews. Got fired for having surgery and going to be gone for 8-12 weeks."
bad,"Worked very hard for this company, and got let go for receiving a sprite from a customer for great customer service. They ambushed me after coming back from my vacation from visiting my grandkids right before Christmas. Walked the store congratulated me on the stores improvement and for making bonus the previous quarter to then inform me that I was being let go. The HR department is also the worst I've ever dealt with in my entire career, and I work in a right to work state, they use that to when its beneficial to them. They don't even  know how to read their own reports, we as GM have to hire do I-9'S, background check and training. So what does HR really do nothing, they just there to try and prevent law suits. No support what so ever. When I myself didn't get all the proper training. Worst of all they lie, and have no loyalty to hard working associates and managers."
bad,"Office Depot benefits, and compensation are competitive with other companies it's size. There are professional people who work at OD that are a pleasure to work with. A few individuals, have mastered staying employed at Office Depot.  However the rest of us had to exists in an environment which pretty much lead to you partying ways with OD for one reason or another.  Office-Products sold in a physical-store is a dying market. So the company is fighting to stay a float.  The CEO is trying to right the ship by diversifying into the services industry. The purchase of a computer services company, and a professional services initiative are examples of things they are trying. But the revenue isn't there. So, OD lets people go. The game of trying to be that employee who gets to keep his/her job, leads to a lot of unprofessional behavior between employees. I can say my time at Office Depot was among the worse in my career."
bad,"I worked at Office depot during high school and I learned a lot about myself and the real world. The hardest part of the job, honestly, was dealing with disgruntled customers and the many closing duties assigned to me."
bad,"Too focused on customers, not on employees needs and stockroom/inventory. Poor communication between management and operations, often leading to conflicting priorities and confusion for logistics."
bad,"For $9.00/hour, unloading, carrying heavy boxes, unboxing, and stocking merchandise within strict time frames was hard enough. I received no formal training and learned on the seat of my pants. I couldn't always locate certain articles of merchandise and couldn't always pinpoint where certain merchandise was located. On top of all that, management wasn't the most helpful. Whether it was stepping outside every hour for a cigarette break, technological glitches during work hours that were out of my control, lack of training and motivation to get better, or employees talking behind each other's backs to get someone in trouble. Overall, it is a good starter's job for a high school student, but not a full time, or even part time, job."
bad,Worked there for about a year and a half and in that time frame we went through at least 6 or 7 different managers. They cut our commission but still expected us to sell with no incentive. I was working multiple positions but only got the base 9 dollar pay because they didn't want to spare the extra cash. Scheduling was pretty flexible except when you're understaffed or when back to school rolls around . Will never work there again.
bad,Compensation changed 7 times in 18 months    Would randomly say that there was an accounting error and deduct money from your check   When they owed me money it was too late and past the payroll cut off
bad,Corporate office is very confusing and has very unethical decisions at times. District managers are not well organized. The company as a whole is very stretched with brain power.
bad,"I loved my coworkers, but the company overall is trash. Stores are extremely understaffed, underpaid, and corporate expects a lot of you for little in return. Would not recommend."
bad,"Consistently work 12 hours even on slow days."
bad,"I worked with Office Depot for roughly 2.5yrs and spent all that time in copy and print. For the last year of working there I was the supervisor for that dept. During that time it was honestly just miserable, gms treated us worse than trash, one stole money from the store and was a liar, new gm is even worse, but doesnt steal. The only thing that made it good was my pack of friends there and we all went through the misery together. The amount of managers fired was unreal."
bad,"The store I worked at I was hired as a sales consultant because of my Best Buy experience. But instead they stuck me in the printing center in which I had no experience, and that would've been fine if the printing supervisor day in and day out wasn't completely abusive. Every day was filled with constant harassment and verbal abuse. Soon I would find out that it was pretty much all of management that was like this, even the so called ""Store Manger"" who was too lazy and rude to assist with customer satisfaction. The final straw for me was when I got inured unloading a pallet where a printer fell and hit me in the head. My eyes were completely bloodshot and I had a concussion, but all that was done was they gave me some ibuprofen and told me to get back to work, not even having me fill out an incident report. So I do not recommend working at the South 8th St store in Colorado Springs, Colorado."
bad,"When I worked at the warehouse, there was never knowing when you were getting off work.  Management were horrible.  Always talking about the women that work there.  Playing favorites.  Really demeaning to me on many occasions.  I've heard there is new management so it might be better.  Anything would be better than it was."
bad,"Worked there for 20 years and enjoyed each day helping teammates and customers. Miss my second family there but thanks to social media, we stay in touch,,, lol"
bad,"""Office Max is no longer going to be an office supply store it is going to be a services store"" That was the line that was pervasive throughout management. I was a temporary hire and worked there for 10 months until I couldn't stand it anymore and left. The tasks are menial and unfulfilling and the corporate atmosphere is invasive throughout the workplace. The training received is laughable and you learn most of it through your coworkers which is often difficult as most of them have not been there longer than you have. In 10 months I became the 7th most experienced person in the store (including managers) out of the 25 or so employees. The store is constantly understaffed and you are often forced to do multiple people's jobs at once. The company is slowly going out of business and is attempting to squeeze out every last penny from their customers. You are always forced to attempt to sell every product and more specifically every service available just in case you get a pea brain or a rich old person to buy into it. You are pressured by management to sell sell sell and though the videos that you are shown for training say otherwise I was told multiple times my managers that the thought of sell sell sell should be the only thing on my mind while working there. It is a poor job if you want it for a career because it pays next to nothing for general hires and has very minimal job advancement. If you decide to go there, good luck. See you in 4 months when you quit."
bad,"It’s verry racial separated work  environment"
bad,"Tienes 3 juntas al día para ver tu avance."
bad,"General manager leads by intimidation, attempts to instill fear; agree or else. There is not a culture in which inspirational leadership is encouraged. Management does not work as a team due to fear factor instilled by General manager."
bad,"I was also told $11/hr to only get $8.50. There is no communication between the managers and employees AT ALL. They literally just threw me in and there were moments when other workers would get upset or annoyed when I asked questions on things I was never trained on. I was not given a login to check the schedule and asked multiple managers to help me only for them to send me to a different manager. This went on for three months. I also missed about 2 weeks of work due to a manager saying I wasn't scheduled until the week after, which resulted in the manager thinking I quit. The final straw was when the manager gave me his number so that he could send me my schedule only for him to not respond, now that resulted in me being fired because I was scheduled for the next day and I had no idea. I don't know if it's the company or that one particular location but, something definitely should be done."
bad,Office Depot was an okay place to work. They  were accommodating with my school schedule but the management was never really on the same page. It was hard to get support.
bad,Manager is full of it. He always stressed out and taking it out on his employees! There's  never enough help to get things done in a time frame that he expects them to be done!
bad,They were willing to work with my schedule while going to school. My only complaint was the lack of safety knowledge. The male employees are expected to do all of the extra heavy lifting for the same rate of pay as female employees
bad,Abysmal management that never listened to concerns or provided constructive criticism. Was promised possible advancement and lied to. Commission program is a joke and if you work at a low volume store you will never get it even if you sell to every customer that walks in to your section. No effective training for computer services.
bad,I'm not happy working at Office Depot the people that I work with are ok but hard to get know. they are not very friendly I think that not very many of them like working there.
bad,Every day about 75% of customers come into the store asking about an item they have little idea what is it called and its purpose and the associates play detective to find what the item is and if office depot carries the item. Our store managers are very friendly and caring but lack the actual managerial capability and lack any type of logistics experience as store shelves can be empty for weeks. Fellow associates are easy going.
bad,Like most minimum wage jobs there is a revolving door of employees quitting and getting hired. Managers are making it up as they go and can be mediocre. Your hours can change on a dime.
bad,Lunches were only 30 min and management never gave the 15 min breaks required. There was no help to me as a print service supervisor during peak hours.
bad,"You get no real training and thrown to the wolves management doesnt care about you personally they can change your hours around for ""a week to help them out "" and they lie to you promising next week will be normal for the. next two months. I dont rember putting an appt in for logistics...."
bad,"I have learned a lot and am still learning.Great customers.I think it could have better managemant in place.It is not good at all.Certain managers make it hard to work there.Over all I have always loved working here.We were part of a team,but it does not feel that way anymore.Too much favoritism."
bad,"I am glad my boss is so flexible with the fact that I have college as well as work to focus on, because if they weren't, I would not still be with this company. Working the Copy Print Center is brutal and unrewarding. Competitive pay is nonexistent. If you are looking for a place with decent raises, this is not it. Constantly short-staffed to the point where I have found myself doing three peoples' jobs all at once. Stressful and not worth it."
bad,"A work day would be stocking, helping customers and ringing people up.  You can be in the stock room in the morning and in the copy department in the afternoon depending on the day."
bad,"I worked in the Copy & Print department and it was probably the most stressful job I've ever had. Constantly having lines due to the amount of customers, underemployed, equipment not working, etc. The list goes on and on, you are expected to push a lot of sales, coverage plans, ink subscriptions and lots of other things. If you can't manage to sell one management will be all over you on why you couldn't sell it. The main reason I stayed was mostly due to the co-workers I had."
bad,I worked there for 4 years and was only given an obligatory interview for an assistant manager position. I suppose that its good I didn't get that position because it was eliminated shortly after.
bad,Upper level management was not supportive.They seldom took an interest in helping you develop and grow into your next role. There was no support for their employees.
bad,"they promise you the moon and give you nothing but grief, advancement is s joke if think you will move up the corporate ladder your wrong. Management at the store I was employed at was a dictator experience, she was a bully and nasty to employees and customers even upper management hated her."
bad,"The manager was for a lack of better words- not a nice person. The hours I was promised to work (20-30) per week, were a lie, I mainly got 17-19 hrs a week. The pay was horrible- $11.00 an hour. My regular paychecks came out to about 350 EVERY TWO WEEKS! There was no room for advancement, they pretty much had their favorites and the managerial positions were already filled before they were even known about. Not the best place to work if you have BILLS and A FAMILY to support, maybe a good starter job for a 16 year old who still lives at home."
bad,En cuanto a compañeros casi todo bien excepto por los favoritos que siendo simples empleados se sienten jefes e incluso hay mucha rotación de personal. Por mal manejo por parte de gerencia y RH
bad,"The contractor positions take an extremely long time to convert to permanent employee 2+ years. I am not accustomed to working as a contractor. As a contractor you are held to the same standards as a permanent employee without the benefits...PTO, early release holidays and etc. The opinion seems to vary by department and whether one is salaried vs hourly."
bad,"company cut every benefit we had rode us into the ground and then expected more and more. this company took vacation times away, gave minimal raises, offered expensive insurance as a ""benefit"".  While I liked my store and the people there it was not a great work environment."
bad,Employee hours were determined by daily and weekly profit dollars and fluctuated from week to week. If their projections fell short of goals our schedule was changed/hours were cut so that the manager could turn in better profit dollars and get a bonus. We had to be flexible and available 40 hours per week but were only scheduled for 18-32.
bad,"I worked at a distribution warehouse. It's like trying to move in a barely ventilated microwave. They want you constantly moving and working but also drinking water and making sure you're not overheated, but obviously that contradicts itself. They want their production numbers up while barely giving you any hours and hardly enough demand since most people order from other places. Don't trust anyone ""above"" you. You are easily replaceable if you work as an Associate of the warehouse. The warehouse itself is hardly kept clean. Machinery breaks down frequently almost every month and seems outdated, with Repair management taking their time on fixing any issue."
bad,"Higher ups are driven by numbers only. Doesn't matter how hard you try if you cant sell something to someone it's because you lack the skills, not because the person doesn't want it. You're expected to cover every single department with little to know training if your sales but that requirement isn't for any other position. Extremely high stress, company will throw you under the bus in every scenario to please a customer."
bad,"I devoted a lot of my time to the company as the computer technician but never felt appreciated by management. When the time came for a raise, it was only .08 cents, so I decided to leave the company and pursue better opportunities."
bad,"La gerente de la sucursal metepec es una persona sin humildad para liderar, siente que el trabajo le queda pequeño, son de las personas que mandan y si se toman mucho su papel de jefe cuando realmente son un equipo, pésima administración y coordinación de su parte gerencial."
bad,"you wear many hats through out a given day. the fact that one would have to be in all facets of the store operations, many a times because labor. had to move people around..."
bad,Slow and sometimes boring. Cleaning was our main focus. I learned a lot about Microsoft office programs. Loved a couple of my mangers throughout the time I was there and equally disliked the other few. I enjoyed the print center because it was a little bit faster pace and you were kept busier than other positions.
bad,"Too many constant changes.  No one cares about the customers.  Just awful.  I constantly had to apologize for my company's failures.  When you would try to bring new customers on board, if the customer didn't fit the exact picture of what they wanted, they didn't want to do business with them.  It was ridiculous.  Felt like they were helping the competition."
bad,"Easy work, but more trouble than it was worth!"
bad,You are one of two people who are responsible for the entire building. Most merchandising is erratic and not well supported. Always in a staffing crisis. Extended warranties is how your employment is based.
bad,I did not have a good experience there and would not recommend taking a position with this company.  there was no investment in employees.  poor management.
bad,I worked in copy and print so my days were long and busy. Some of the customers were super understanding and nice. Management was very strict on saling stamps for some reason.
bad,Did not particularly like due to hard to learn as never done printing and publishing before. Training was short. Wanted a cashier job but was put in printing. Did some cashier but not much.
bad,Inconsistent work flow. Lack of requirements which always changed. Chaos method of development. Lord of the Flies style management. Overall a very poor environment to work.
bad,"Don't work here, especially don't work in the copy and print department if you want to get any ounce of respect from the customers. People need their stuff right this second and will not understand a single setback. The equipment is horribly outdated and setbacks happened almost daily."
bad,"Training is non-existent for the most part, it's a very sink or swim kind of atmosphere. You walked in each day not knowing where things were, how to get to them and the devices you used to find said items either weren't working on there was only one and it was being used."
bad,"I started out part time, within 4 months I was learning receiving. A months later I was offered a receiving position in another store. Six months later I was given the Receiving Manager position. I held that position for 4 years. Started customer service manager.  From that point things went down hill. Left to start another job."
bad,"I had a fellow associate steal over $1000 worth of sales from my name, and management did nothing about it. overall the environment isnt too bad, but if you're looking to make money, then apply somewhere else."
bad,The company does not promote within often and morale is poor. Work life balance is hard to achieve if you have children. Customers aren't the greatest in most locations. They also keep the store open on Thanksgiving night even though they rarely make money from it.
bad,"Managers take advantage of hard workers,ignore short staffed issues,they leave early, move on to different departments,shifts blame when products are late or missing. People leave early cause manager leaves early. Some coworkers help you and some are ignorant   . Expect long hours. You also do most of inventory control's work (maybe only 2 actually do work, the rest punch the keyboard and look busy). Issues of safety, being short staffed and efficiency are brought up but are bogged down by ""we'll look into it"" mentality. They complain about overtime knowing these issues have been around for years! 4 different bulk managers have come and gone in just over a year!"
bad,"Alright I suppose for something while attending college if you don't mind repetitive work,didn't seem to get any real valuable information or knowledge from working there."
bad,"Good company, but could use some improvements. Management does an average job but lacks certain abilities that can make the work place enjoyable. Overall manageable place to work."
bad,They allow over time but the pay is still not worth the stress they put on you. you cant take more than 5 days of pto unless it an emergency. they demote you when slow than promote during school time just so someone else can override
bad,Overall experience office depot needs to upgrade management right away .makes work very difficult for most employees.  And management is very unappreciated with the associates there.
bad,"Being a sales rep at Office Max is a tough one filled with task/customer balance. "
bad,Assisting customers was the highlight of any work day with in company. the simple diversity of the range of ages of the customers never left a dull moment.
bad,"Well when I started working at Officemax, I thought okay cool I will be able to get electronic experience, boy was I wrong...The management was horrible they would schedule way too many people on a super slow day. Almost all the managers/associates were horrible bad attitudes. It didn't help me at all for my career field, oh and they will not give you hours or practically care about your well being...such as there was a major snow storm and all the roads were icy and they didn't accept it as an excuse.  I am glad it was only for holiday help."
bad,"Inbound call centre. Management only care about stats.'Team Leaders' are hit and miss - some are great, some are most definitely not. This is best suited for someone wanting to transition from a warehousing job into a customer service position as I did. OfficeMax will give you a rapid introduction but there is no advancement or major salary benefits to remaining there for an extended period of time."
bad,When I started it was a great company to work for then they got scared of becoming irrelevant. They started implementing products and services without properly training associates before roll out. Stores are way understaffed and associates are unhappy.
bad,No a really good place you want to be at if you're thinking of growing with the company benefits are not all that great the team leaders are not all that great because no one is ever happy their.
bad,As a tech I was shocked to be classified as a sales person after hired. Management had poor training and skills and don't really care about employees. Lack of work hours is always an issue
bad,"Although the job was not difficult, and certain managers did the best they could to ensure an good working environment, the corporate policies rarely seemed to be in line with in store experience."
bad,"New associate lifespan is about 5 months; if they are temp-to-hire, they come on board after 3 months or so -- then bad attendance habits catch up to them, and they are let go during their probationary period. The only ones with any real longevity are the associates who were already there at that location before the OfficeMax/Office Depot conversion. Depending on what department you are assigned to will dictate how thorough your training is."
bad,High reach/order picker. Like the job and atmosphere of warehouse/distribution work.I am very safety ordinates and abide by all company rules and regulations.They Built a new warehouse in Virginia. The company is relocating
bad,"Was good while it lasted. Great  co-workers, lower management could use improvement in employee relation.Gained some computer, inventory control system, various powered equipment and quality assurance experience."
bad,"This job is for high school students or college students. The only problem with this job is that all managers have different goals and is hard to tell what they want accomplish. Since this is retail, there will be happy to angry customers."
bad,"In the last 12 years I have gained many valuable skills during the evolution of OfficeMax, from it's beginnings as Boise, to it's evolution into OfficeMax, and later into it's merger with OfficeDepot. The skills I have obtained during my years as a customer service rep in various departments within the company will follow me wherever life leads me in my personal and professional life."
bad,"While my co-workers were great, there is no room for advancement or full time opportunities. It's an okay place to work during school."
bad,"Company had no direction, sold to Office Depot, no payroll to complete jobs. Stores not updated - old fixtures. Could not compete with online."
bad,"A typical day at work for a warehouse associate includes tasks such as usage of warehouse machinery, operation of handheld RF scanners or wrist scanners, ability to lift up to 50+ pounds, maintaining cleanliness in the workplace, communication, self-sufficiency, and team work. "
bad,"Worked here as Ops for 4yrs, working at 4am to get freight out...I made $5/hr less than the person who came after me and eventually my crew went from 5ppl to 2ppl and we were constantly told to get the freight out (despite more freight coming in!), clean up after night crew left it a mess, and if we couldn't get it done and do it faster they would find someone else to do it."
bad,Prepare to work three jobs as the same time and never fulfill any of the roles. Constantly understaffed while constantly increasing the amount of work that needs to be completed everyday.
bad,A lot of standing and the people are I really can't put in words. I would not refer anyone to this job. Management did take care of us.
bad,"They overwork and/or work employees to death, very little pay, job conditions not good, work atmosphere is depressing and negative."
bad,My work at office depot was to give the customer a complete and excellent service. My job was a cashier and had to keep my area clean and organized.
bad,"Management is terrible, will yell at you for mistakes that are not your fault. Very unstable right now seeming they're being bought out by Staples. Typical day at work looks like building planograms, getting lectured on selling protection plans(yes, including plans on pencil sharpeners). Prices are outrageous and customers will let you know so."
bad,No surprise they got bought out by Staples after Depot bought officmax.  They treat workers like servants with long hours and noncompetitive pay.  Only plus was ability to change locations rather easily.  A lot of room for advancement if you were good.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Management is very dishonest with its employees.  This environment very much supports favoritism, and who can kiss up the most."
bad,"I worked in the print shop doing design layout for clients, I was able to teach myself programs such as adobe photo shop. I also learn how to process high volume print jobs with accuracy."
bad,This company does not allow many opportunities for raises or promotions. Most cases one will not receive a raise even after scoring well on a yearly review
bad,"as an associate, your job revolves around being able to sell the ""item of the week"" and rewards cards memberships. management is less than effective. general manager runs the store in a fair manner but favors higher achieving employees (good ole boys club). First line supervisors harsh and one repeatedly talked down to employees."
bad,"For myself, a typical day at work would be to open up the store, make sure everything is aligned and straight, after the open time is on to make sure that whatever customers leave happy. I learned that no matter what people say to you, it's only their opinion and to make the best of everything that you can. The management wasn't very nice after the first couple of months. My co-workers, only very few were actually nice, they did not appreciate the fact that they had a job and complained about everything. The hardest part of the job was listening to all of the gossip, rumors, and just talk that wasn't about our actual job. The most enjoyable part was that I only worked in the morning, usually my days went by very fast, and I had the rest of the day to do anything I wanted once I was finally back home."
bad,"Challenging workplace."
bad,"Poorly managed, with little employee benefits and incentives. Work place is generally negative."
bad,"Higher management treat the department managers and employees like garbage. They are extremely rude to employees and customers. Employees never get breaks and are lucky to get lunch breaks. There is absolutely no order and there's a double standard for everything. There aren't enough employees in the store to help customers at any given time. Most of the managers are unprofessional and don't know what they're doing. They mostly retreat into their office for hours, no one knows where they are, cutting off all communication with employees that need their help. They allow harassment to go on within the store. The schedule is only made one week in advance and most all vacation requests are denied. Sometimes the schedule is edited after publication without any notice. Managers blatantly lie to customer all the time. Your job position is mostly based on your sex or gender and management fights cross-training in other departments. These days everyone is just happy that the Iowa City store is closing down. The only reason I stayed so long is because the job worked very nicely with my schedule and paid more than minimum wage."
bad,Classic retail position. There is a heavy emphasis on the amount of dollar sales you can bring in. I'm lucky to have managers that like to emphasize taking care of the customer. 
bad,"Being with Office Depot 12 years I've seen its ups and downs. 12 years ago it was a compelling place to work, shop, and invest. However, I've seen our store go from 32 employees to 18. Essentially the only full time employees are management and we work 50 or more hours a week. The district managers are always coming down on us for not making, in most cases unobtainable goals. The culture is very structured and if you make the slightest misstake you are scolded for it. The turnover is close to 40 percent, we were told to expect only a 20 percent turnover with the new culture. As it is now we're having a hard time getting qualified applicants, even in a bad economy when jobs are scarce. However I will continue to persevere in hopes of a new organization that will create a positive work environment."
bad,Poor management made work place a hostile place to work. No promotion within the company.
bad,I enjoyed full heartedly & gain much more experience than ever i had prior to this organisation.
bad,"Break down, organize, and stock shipment of store products, Assembled office desks, and chairs upon customers request,"
bad,check out all costumers
bad,"Pushy sales, very difficult management to work with .. not accomodating to family and life commitments no job security and benefits are non existant"
bad,"It pains me to say this because I used to love working for this company, but unless you are looking for a temporary place to work, PLEASE avoid working here from this point forward!  As of this week, all full time positions below management have been done away with due to company restructuring and all of us full time tech, furniture, and copy center specialists have been done away with only two weeks warning.  If you're desperate for a part time job, go for it.  I love my coworkers and immediate managers to death... there's good people that work here.  But the company has turned it's back on us and it won't be worth dealing with the customers that will get fed up with the lack of service because there is nothing you will be able to do about it."
bad,It is a job if you need it. I've never actual seen anyone get fired for doing something unprofessional but have seen layoffs do to position mergers. Which doesn't come with an additional pay increase that is worth the stress. At the moment company is dealing with heavy competition and are cutting costs where ever they can. The job is great if you have good people around you.
bad,"People there are great. Culture is awful. They refused to acknowledge or fix issues. Their go to answer is, ""don't waste time trying to fix things""."
bad,I became a supervisor after one year of working and it was nothing but a title. I was just a normal associate that worked the mornings in the print department. I had very minimal help while having a large influx of customers. Office Depot tries to streamline things but doesn't think about how they actually work. When I became a supervisor I got no extra training or help on what my new duties were. New employees are not trained and are just placed on the sales floor to look like fools while management spends about 90% of their time in the office unless they are called out by a customer wanting to speak with them. Most stores are understaffed and when they have enough staff not enough hours to work enough people. And the customers are the worst part of working there. I guess because its an office supply store they expect this huge value of things but most of the time it's someone wanting something for nothing. Would not recommend working there at all. So many better places to work at and at a higher pay if you want to get started in retail.
bad,The culture has changed drastically for the worse in just the year that I have been there. The 1 month training for managers is not very helpful for outside hires and little support is offered once you are out of training.
bad,"Not a good place to work,   management was not good,  people who work there was ok,   they didn't have a good system in place for advancement.   District manager never seem to care,  didn't have anyone to go to if problem arise"
bad,"I'll start with the positives: the work is easy and you're compensated fairly for it. Most of my co-workers were friendly and on occasion they fed us."
bad,No matter what position you apply for or actually get hired for. you'll be given task that don't pertain to you're pay is. they dont switch shifts when they tell you they did
bad,"You should only work here part-time as an entry level cashier, a great job for students, no place for an adult. I was hired as a supervisor, with a low salary and the opportunity to earn great bonuses. I was given keys and the security code on my first day and trained myself via checklists to open or close the store. "
bad,Not a great place to work on IT and advance in knowledge of this field. More focused of selling their own third party software then just fixing the computers.
bad,"Sueldo bajo para las actividades que hacen, Recursos Humanos siempre ausente nunca están en tienda te cobran el uniforme, comunicación nula con equipo gerencial se enojan hasta por que salgas a tu hora establecida, el gerente regional solo promueve a su gente, no pagan tiempo extra con dinero."
bad,"Every one at this location is hired part time but all the managers are full time. Copy & Print is extremely stressful & NOT worth the pay. The managers were terrible & always had attitudes. I had a manager clock me out early & when I brought it to the store manager’s attention, he didn’t believe me & said he didn’t wanna change my time because he didn’t want to get involved.. I was never paid for the time I worked off the clock. Employees gossip and there is noticeable special treatment among the MALE employees. Overall, my experience working here was terrible and would not recommend this store to anyone."
bad,"coming in the morning to organize, prep, working the floor. Management wasn't the best but they got by, hardest part is the lack of employees and help usually only about 2 - 3 people register included so it can get overwhelming pretty fast sometimes. Most enjoyable part was the co workers managed to bring some life to the day."
bad,"Push way too hard for services that are over-priced, and really don't work that well. Always understaffed. Corporate only watches out for #1. If you're looking for a place that focuses on making the store look good ""on paper"", but not in actuality... You found it!"
bad,"Both the management and the company were sexist and homophobic, and the job was incredibly stressful as i was either expected to be carrying out the duties of several people at once while checking out and trying to sell to a constant stream of customers, or it was completely dead and our managers would yell at us for standing around doing nothing when there was nothing left to be done"
bad,"I initially left Office Depot (print facility) because of the utter trash management. When they FINALLY got rid of him, I had applied again because I heard the new one was alright. Turns out he's just as bad, prefers to listen to gossip and eliminate employees based on rumor instead of finding the truth of the matter."
bad,Untrained management staff and the CEO is clueless about how to compete with Staples. The website is horrendous with constant popups that irritate the consumer.
bad,"Thought this would be a normal, laid back (not too laid back I knew there was always work to be done) retail environment, turns out of my old store it wasn't any of those things. Me and my assistant manager were doing all of the heavy lifting while everyone else was on their phones or just not doing anything at all. Co-workers would almost never respond/act when being radioed for assistance or help around the store. Not a good place to work at from my experience..."
bad,"Everyday is a challenge.  Most of the time, it would seem like the stores are understaffed with lines of customers appearing all at once at the registers and at the copy centers each demanding that they are in a hurry and wondering why the employees are taking too long.  Fact is: the employees are working as fast as the systems they have in front of them to work with.  Most management try their best to bend over backwards to help the employees get as much work done as quickly as possible, but this means while they are helping to focus on the customers, managerial work-load stands still."
bad,"Lack of management."
bad,"worked with clients on printing projects to determine the right paper, color verses black and white, quantities, etc, helped clients find specific items they were looking for, rang up client purchases"
bad,"I always begin with the good things in any review, unfortunately there are only a few, and that's coming from someone who is normally on the optimistic side. First off, Office Depot/Office Max simply does not lay off or fire, it takes a considerable incident to occur for even a write up to occur. Also the people that I directly worked with were very pleasant and we got the know each other quite well since there weren't very many of us. The managers that I directly worked with were with ranged from fun and constructive to decent. I would say that this depends on the location though so it might not be true for your location."
bad,Horrible management. Sales goals unrealistic. They cancelled tuition reimbursement for employees mid year. Unqualified managers who can’t control the flow of the customers stealing and getting over. I used to be proud to work there stay away if your over 21
bad,"Though my fellow employees were, by and large, enjoyable to work with, the situation with the company is simple:"
bad,"I sold office products to customers... It's a standard customer service/sales position.  I enjoyed my work, mostly, but the reason I left was because of poor management."
bad,"Worked for OfficeMax/Office Depot for over 4 years now. I have had the privilege till recently to work under 2 very Good managers at previous postings. Good Managers however are difficult to keep as they are mistreated or taken advantage of, and as a result, a heavy turnover is expected. I relocated to The Phoenix area, Many General Managers in the Phoenix Area are very unfriendly and have a very negative attitude, and are almost borderline abusive, or have an elitist attitude...Competition gives way to outright negative confrontations and cut throat mentality. This is extremely counter-productive to all Staff. Its also extremely and unnecessarily stressful. Best part of The Job is bringing Joy to Customers. The Hardest Part is being ignored or constantly ridiculed and even undermined by your leadership. I do realize that The Death of Retail Box Stores is coming and everyone is scrambling to save business. But it should not be at the expense of employees well being. I've come to the conclusion that OfficeMax/Office Depot cares nothing for its employees or there morale now.....We are paid peanuts for a Job most wouldn't do given the environment we work in. Office Depot has a Cancer, and its terminal...If your going to work here, do not go into management."
bad,"The management at Office Depot OfficeMax is very poor. The way they treat their employees is an issue. But overall, it isn’t the worst place to work at. The other employees are very friendly & fun to work with. We get along really well"
bad,The store manager allows young inexperienced managers to run the store. There is some flirting that goes on which is unprofessional. Also the gossip is constant and when approached about it there was nothing done. You are given less and less hours until you quit. Employees complain about customers as soon as they leave the store. It is a very hostile and not a comfortable place to work.
bad,"Management picked favorites. Got yelled at for not constantly smiling. False advertisement, which customers got angry that we couldn't provide the services advertised."
bad,"I didn't enjoy working here the pay was very low and the hours were very inconsistent. I received sub par training for my role in the print department and had to figure things out as I went, which I did but it was stressful."
bad,It is a good first job but be prepared to work without breaks and the store getting busy in the afternoon. The management needs to be reworked and the training of new employees/
bad,Unfortunately Office Depot has been unable to support their co workers and part timers. There is lack of communication and the workers wish to leave to find other job opportunities where the pay is good and the treatment to co workers is excellent.
bad,"The pay was low. The hours we short per day but  I ended up working a lot per week as far as covering other employees shifts when they didn't show up. It was stressful because of the short staff and pressures for sales from the managers. They strongly encouraged up-selling at every opportunity and attaching protection plans to everything that could be considered, even slightly, to have a mechanical part."
bad,"Maybe younger people can do all the selling required while cashiering, and answering up to 3 lines of phone calls, and the intimidation involved if you don't learn a ""skill"" fast enough."
bad,"Constantly busy, never really had much help in my area when had more than 5 customers at a time. Very stressful. My experience no one really liked their job, which made everything worse"
bad,"What I've learned is what not to do, most don't put the customer first when making decisions. Systems are fragmented giving a poor customer experience which also makes it hard to work."
bad,"Office Depot suffers from having a great personal in store staff, but horrible overhead management. They seemingly don't believe in raises, as I was stuck at the same plateau for quite a bit of time. The feeling of being an individual instead of a drone seems to be lost amongst the culture of the staff."
bad,"I came in either to open or to close. I learned how to deal with unhappy customers, sell items and services as well as manage my time. There was just not enough budget for all the employees to be kept and students were the first ones to go."
bad,"Stated goal of each associate, as dictated by the corporate office, was to ""WOW"" the customer and provide a them with service above their expectations.  In reality, felt hamstrung by management when I tried to accomplish this and was eventually terminated for failing to follow policies that reduced the level of customer service."
bad,My short stint at Office depot wasn't all that great. Managers micromanaged your time so much one could barely take a breath between customers before being moved to another part of the store to help. keeping the store stocked and cleaned wasn't to bad. Customer interactions where alright for the location. The pay was the second worse thing to the micromanagement.
bad,"When I first started working there we had a different supervisor who was a little quirky in how he handled the store, but we were in the top 5 of regional stores. After a few months, we got a new supervisor who, let's be honest, was terrible at it. We dropped in rank so drastically and the quality of our store went down the crapper tremendously."
bad,"Easy, slow paced job. Pay wasn’t very great. $9.50 an hour. Couldn’t survive off that rate so I left to get paid more. Hours were okay. Management was decent. Work environment was very dead and boring."
bad,"5-10 years ago, the company was in a great position, but as online business began to grow, OfficeMax (now OfficeDepot) began to feel the burden of competition. Low wages, low hours/staffing means high stress days. Frequently will be working with just 2 or 3 other people, often times while handling 3-4 customers simultaneously. Little to no room for advancement, unless you are wiling to move out of state. Would NOT recommend!"
bad,Office Depot pays low salaries and has associate expectations that do not match the pay. Employees are expected to recommend services that may eliminate their position.
bad,Place is a joke management doesn't communicate at all with you no work life balance looks like there is nepotism going on on the floor beware coworkers are very unprofessional
bad,"Office Depot was all in on the sale to Staples.  When that was blocked, they were in no position to continue sucessfully without a major influx of capital..  New top level management decided to do what many troubled companies do in ignorance: get rid of all of the people that support customers to cut cost.  The cost is huge in customer and employee loyalty."
bad,It was a fun place to work but due to new management there has been extreme favoritism and an overall poor work environment where if you aren't the favorite you have no future there.
bad,"A typical day is very slow and on your feet for hours, "
bad,When working here I was belittled and consumed in drama. I would not recommend working here because you always feel like your job is in constant jeopardy.
bad,"Always developing new sales initiatives with all the hype of a new program and then there isn't any follow through until the next new program is introduced."
bad,"great...face pace...enjoyable...awesome mangers...."
bad,"If you're good at dealing with people, particularly those who are short-tempered and always willing to try their luck in order to save a few bucks on some office supplies, then you should do well here. However, you have to put in a disproportionate amount of work in order to get any sort of advancement, so be warned."
bad,"Management team had no idea on how to respond to market trends. Management members were not familiar with company return policies. Many times during the year, employees were called in to work extra hours at the last minute. Many times, also, cashiers would use store recepticles to charge personal phones. One cashier was the favorite of the store manager, even got moved into management (!)."
bad,Going into work everyday not knowing how many hours I was gonna be working whether it was 6 hours or 10 hours. the management or chain of command never worked when there was an issue or safety concern due to lack of care on some of their parts. so I honestly wouldn't tell anyone to work for this company in their warehouse location.
bad,"The location I worked at was very slow-paced and often times I found myself cleaning because there was nothing else to do. And by that I mean I had already done everything I was tasked for the day and there were no customers that were needing further assistance, if any were even in the store. The management was very friendly but could've done more to satisfy the needs of the customers. Not to mention the company seriously needs to rethink their furniture shipping and displaying models that weren't sold in stores. I can't even recall how many times customers got upset then left the store with nothing because of the furniture dilemma."
bad,"Job I was hired for was not as promised. I was supposed to get to do graphic design work, but wound up as simply a cashier/clerk at best. Had to clean toilets and do inventory also."
bad,"I learned a great deal while here - line reviews, POG planning, financial analysis and corporate leadership. I particularly enjoyed the global sourcing aspect of my job."
bad,"I worked for OD for one year and within that one year I was paid much higher than expected. However, it was not worth the stress. We had bad store management that did not want to take the time to hire more people with no experience. The store was horrifically understaffed everyday, therefore leaving current employees with way too much to do as well as asking them to work late every single day. If you decide to work there, apply at the copy center. The copy center manager will always treat you right and help you out. Overall, I personally do not recommend this job unless you plan to work as a temporary hire."
bad,Lots of open positions but only part time available. The work is not hard but  LOTS of micro managers. Company is now under new corporate management with Office Max/Office Depot merge.
bad,The Office Depot management is horrible.  They cut the good people and leave the old.  One girl has 2 babies and no daycare and is getting paid for doing a full time job.  Such a joke
bad,"Lots of downtime with little to do, almost always being yelled at for not making our sales goals even though I was just a cashier and had no control over it."
bad,"The day never repeats itself, and always something new. The upper management likes to micro manage you to the point of not wanting to come in. They do have ok health insurance"
bad,"Boring. Some great managers, some awful -- very impersonable and not understanding. Didn't enjoy this experience very much, although I did have some great coworkers."
bad,"Working in the retail side was awful. Sales demands were out of control as you needed to meet so many upsells and add ons. Then at the register you needed to push warranties and credit card sign ups. The company tried too hard to catch up to Amazon, Staples, and other competitors but failed"
bad,"My review on the company is 70% which is relating to the job security and  the job environment, management is about 20% out of 100% and about the job culture is very goo"
bad,"gets really busy "
bad,The job was constant and fast. Was over worked and under paid. Would not recommend for the light at heart.Working all departments when I was in charge of 3 of the 5 stressed me out on a part time pay check.
bad,"A typical shift at Office Depot runs from 3 hours to up to 9 hours. From the moment one clocks in, they are on their feet; assisting customers on the floor, cashiering, working the copy and print department. Regular associates are what keep the store afloat, managers are struggling to catch up with unfinished work and corporate demands."
bad,A typical day included trying to sale bogus protection plans and virus protection for subpar computers. Company as a whole has a lot of issues. Dead end Job.
bad,"Usually its always 120°F plus in that warehouse year round. In Winter it gets cooler (around 70°F) but that's the ONLY time the temperature is bearable. Feels like you're working in an oven. "
bad,"This company is ok for a single person or someone wanting to make extra income, but the planning and coordinating team , there is a communication problem. They're never on the same page."
bad,"The company was a great a company to work for in the early 2000s, management were great and reaaly cared about their employees. In the last 10 years, the company have become one of the worst company to work for. They continue to recycle business conepts that do not work, they continue to copy whatever their competator Staples does. The upper management at the corporate level DO NOT care for the very people who keep them afloat."
bad,"Help customers at the print and copy shop, place orders, process payment.  Help in other areas of the store.  Customer service is most important.  Track sales for my department."
bad,"Back in the day it wasn't bad working here but since the company is failing, they are taking extreme measures in all the wrong places. We just had small cameras and motion sensors installed to make sure we have a manager standing upfront doing nothing, and that we great all ink customers within 5 seconds. They just took away our commission only giving 5% to the top 500 stores and 10% to the top 100 stores. They expect us to be able to attach all these services to every single electronic that leaves when not everyone wants or needs it. We work with constantly failing equipment but instead of replacing it with good, more modern stuff, they're covering the copy and print counters with some roll on covers to make them look nicer. They don't even care about the employees. They made our store throw away an old office chair that we had in our break room just because it looked bad. Yet the managers were told to store use themselves a new chair. All in all, don't work here or support the company."
bad,We were told that with the merger we would have job security. 3 months later we were being told that they are going to close our office and warehouse in less then 2 months. 13 years of working here down the drain.
bad,"When it was Office Max, it was a great place to work, Office depot pulled it down, cut hours, really don't seem to care for the front line people. sends down orders that make no sense. Got rid of their best people"
bad,entreprise familiale du temps de guilbert ensuite rachat des américains et la tous changer
bad,Its super boring most of the time we are dead most people only come for copy print services i wouldnt recommend working here everything is 20% more than everywhere else
bad,You work over time and even over night. Some of the people who work so much that they would wrecked there cars because they fall asleep. your on your feet all day long.
bad,"lot of responsabilities , low pay,no gerowing opportunities bad management a lot of company policies changing no a good spiff no overtime pay no full time bad security"
bad,"Coworkers quit left and right, there's no one really in charge, you're overworked for no money, advancement is impossible with the company downsizing."
bad,"Working for Office Depot is really an inbetweener job, for me at least, as a student. I am focused in the copy and print department of the store and it has it's subpar benefits. Mostly dealing with the easy talk and more personal connection with customers. The downside is the constraint they put on the employees meaning they are expected to work twice as hard, to twice the jobs, and sell twice the amount while having little to no sentatives or positive outcomes. You get the occasional 7 dollar commission for selling a protection plan (in my case as a CPD associate, you get no opportunity). At the end of the day, it's about getting the sales numbers and that's it."
bad,"Previous reviews are not kidding when they say working here is like working in a sweatshop. Pay is low and the work is constantly getting to be more and more demanding. There is a new system the district manager swears by for copy and print but it barely works. The equipment is constantly breaking down and the customers get furious when their stuff can't get printed. I HATE trying to work with one customer only to get cut off by another one because they can't see I'm busy doing something else."
bad,"If you are looking for just "" A job"" this is the place for you. This department was not at all what I signed up for. waste of time. I have watch people come and go. they do not care about their employees"
bad,A pesar de tener buenas prestaciones el que la desicion de otorgar la planta recaiga unicamente en el gerente (O que Influya directamente) deja muy vulnerables a los trabajadores (Ojo con la sucursal 198 que ya salieron muchos empleados incluso guardias de seguridad)
bad,This company hires horrible management in California. Office Depot in Oregon was so much better to be apart of. This would be a great first job to get experience.
bad,"Poor management, could improve by hiring qualified applications for management positions.  Co-workers were the best part of the job.  Aside from that majority of customers were put off by managers publicly criticizing employees."
bad,"When I started with this company it was employee friendly. Now that there have been lack luster mergers and attempted mergers the focus is all on the company, and no one cares about the employees."
bad,Management was lacking in creating order among employees. Managers would differ in the orders they asked of employees while being inconsistent with the orders.Lunches were only 30 minutes even on 9 hour days. Lunches were not provided.
bad,"At first i liked working for Officemax, but then i started to see alot of things you shouldn't see within a company like this. The management was horrible, and they were constantly hiring new people and could barely afford to pay the ones they had there already."
bad,I enjoyed selling tech. Teaching people about tech. Customer service. Enjoyed working with my co-workers. A good starting out in the workplace job.
bad,"The current leadership does not support the lower level employees. They set unreasonable expectations with little support. In addition, the corporate entities do little in support for answering customers issues, leaving it up to the store managers to correct the companies mistakes."
bad,"I worked in Copy & Print and loved the job itself, but the corporate culture was terrible. They pay you as little as they can get away with and don't really ever give raises. Favoritism is rampant."
bad,"I really didn't like this job.  It was the first one I got as a kid, and I'm proud of myself for sticking with it so long.  Having said that, managers changed at the store I worked at, on a yearly basis, if not quicker.  The demands (quotas) put upon salespeople, which I was one of, were ludicrous.   What's worse is that they tried to integrate it into the culture of the company, so any time there was any sort of gathering it was hammered into us that we had to sell.  Problem is that the store just wasn't making the numbers they wanted it to, and it fell down to the sales folk to somehow catch up and sell more and more, when people just didn't want to buy."
bad,"Good people that work hard. everyday was a busy day, the hardest part of the day was getting everything from the order fillers to load the truck."
bad,"lousy pay, but it teaches you how to provide great customer service. the managers I had were very moody and often absent, just absolute poor leadership. however some were really good, ive learned that comes with the territory. this is an ok gig for teens"
bad,Enjoyed the introduction into retail but low pay for too much work. Enjoyed the work/life balance due to no hours being received. Learn impress and modular and became technologically savvy.
bad,"A typical day as a Store manager starts off with either putting out fires from either not having enough product in the ad or never having it in the first place. Then you get to move on to the issues that the associates are having with each other as you are mainly hiring high school or college students at about minimum wage. After that you get to read about fifity redundent emails about how to sell more servces before you go on a coference call to hear about how you and the district are not selling enough services. That takes up about most of your ten hour five day a week MINIMUM, plus all holidays except Xmas. Overall if you do not have kids, wife, life, Office Depot Max is for you."
bad,"Pros	"
bad,Worst place to work from management that bullied staff and among staff themselves. Racism and play favourite in their staff.
bad,Its a sand trap. Management will not promote or advance you unless you like to suck up. Store Management is disorderly and lacks motivation to do their job. The company will always pick and chose the customer over the employee. Good company to work for if you are a student because the customers will teach you how real people are and company will show you how real management works (sarcasm). Bad company to work for if you want a job/career.
bad,A general day included making documents and copies for customers.
bad,"The managers were too laid back, the communication was horrible, I didn't like the way that store was ran at all."
bad,"depending on the titles, opening the store, receiving inventory, delegating responsibilities and goals for daily sales.  Helping customers find solutions to various problems.  Checking and balancing draws. regulating lunch schedules. assembling furniture, and store displays, clean up of the store."
bad,The company is always changing and volume is very unstable.
bad,This job required me to work 10 - 14 hours a day for salary. This was entorely too many hours considering I was pregnant at the time.
bad,rather not say  it was a great place to work everyone was friendly. respected each other. then management change
bad,"When I got to work the first thing i would do is open the tech bench and start services on any new computers and finish services for any of the computers that had been there before. I would also take tech department calls and assist any costumers that came in the store."
bad,"Totally discriminated by my direct supervisor. It was a living hell every single day. No matter how much I worked, and how much I was dedicated, Management didnt change their attitude towards me"
bad,"bad working environment, hiring freeze in place. They monitor your bathroom breaks. Ten cent raise once a year."
bad,"The store manager is great but assistants could use better training, hours are not great for serious job seekers but okay for part timers, unable to utilize skills to advance service. Overall okay place to work but not high on the recommendation list."
bad,"Typical day at work, extremely stressful"
bad,"In my 6 years with Office Depot, I unfortunately cannot say that I enjoyed my experience. The company was constantly undergoing policy and management changes, often leading to confusion once it reached store level. The company, once considered to be the market leader in office supply retailers, consistently was slow to react to any form of market change. The quality of management would almost be considered embarrassing. Often, videos were made available to employees, detailing why a certain employee was terminated. These videos often contained very personal information, including marital indiscretion, substance abuse, and theft. The company seemed to be very lacking in maturity, tact, and overall responsibility."
bad,"At office depot i only been working there for 7 months and worked as customer service and helped out with with copy center. It was a very poorly store barly customers so had to find extra task to be busy.My brother worked at office depot for 3 years and wish friends so the co-worker, Store manager was sexiest to another co-worker that it had to be solved throught human resourse. currently there is no office depot they have sut it down because of the lack of customers."
bad,"management was extremely poor, changed my schedule on an almost daily basis"
bad,"I learned about the Supplies and Furniture depts.,but was not properly trained on Technology"
bad,"First things first, you will not be working the job position you apply for. Corporate forces the stores to use a shoe-string budget and expects every one to be fully capable of multitasking. (which we cannot and are not given any form of training before-hand.)  Many of our experienced full-timers are gone now after the 'restructuring' (complete elimination of full-time employment) leaving a total workforce of about 3 managers and a random and fluctuating amount of part time associates that work sub 20 hr/week with no benefits. The only real plus side to the job is all my co-workers are very nice and genuinely good people including management however the problem is corporate doesn't seem to understand how a business functions and how many of the poor choices and decisions they've been making in the past year alone (2019) is going to cause serious long-term problems and possibly many of the stores shutting down due to a combination of lose customers, in-experienced personnel, and general lack of employees."
bad,"my coworkers are like family, but the pay sucks even compared to others in the field, no chance of advancement most of the time, the company is doing fine for now but will go bankrupt in about 10 years at longest, dont get attached to working here."
bad,En las sucursales que a mi me tocó siempre fueron las de más renombre en ventas en calificaciones y en afluencia de clientes por eso era algo muy rápido y aveces estresante un poco.
bad,"Managers were busy with their own jobsecurity, not with managing team and team spirit. IT maturity was low and fragmented."
bad,Able to cross train and learn multiple positions which will benefit you in the future. Work well with team members. Assist customers with sales and purchases.
bad,"It's not the worst job I've had, but certainly not the best. If you're surrounded by good people and competent management, then it's not bad. However, upper level management has no clue what they're doing. They set consistently ridiculous daily and weekly goals, and heads roll when they aren't met (which is usually). Additionally, the higher level management considers numbers, and that's about it. To them, you're just a number affecting other numbers. You're entirely expendable, and will do ANYTHING to keep sales high and costs low, at anyone's expense save their bottom line."
bad,"This job at OfficeMax is okay. I would only suggest working here to someone who is looking for a first job or experience to add to their resume. Other than that, I am not fond of working for the company. The benefits and incentives are not good in my opinion. I only work here on weekends so the flexibility scheduling wise is something I can appreciate."
bad,Not a stable place to work. To many Chiefs and not enough Indians. No work life balance. They are closing stores all the time.? Was a good place to work before they Merge with OfficeMax.
bad,The hours are never set on any shift you work till the work is done it could be a 5 hour day or a 12 hour day and thay have a no fault point system and for what thay ask of you it don't pay enough
bad,Beaucoup de manutention plus la route. Encadrement inexistant.
bad,No work life balance.  Had to work until all  orders where shipped.  Long hours and changing work schedule.  Never the same schedule from week to week.
bad,"cant really say anything good about this company but its a job. so I'm just going to leave this vague as possible. I enjoyed my position, did not enjoy management or their corporate policies. im sure I could write a 5 page essay about this place. but im not going too. proceed with caution."
bad,Would not recommend working unless you really need to. Not a lot of room for advancement due to the company down sizing. Worked with great people. Compensation is below retail standard.
bad,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, facilidad de crecimiento y capacitación continua"
bad,"Every year ive been here there has been layoffs. 4 years ago a team was made up of 20 people now has 6 people with the same amount of work and just as efficient processes. "
bad,"High turnover which means at some point they start looking for stuff to fire you for. If someone calls off they’re trucks get splitter between you and the people working that night which you will hate. Heavy stuff, if you don’t wanna get certified on they electric pallet jacks you’ll have to use a regular pallet jack. Pay is $11.60 for the work is definitely underpaid."
bad,"I am over qualified for the position I am in but when I interviewed  for a GM position i was insulted more then once about my experience, saying I wasn’t qualified.  I guess the 7 years of Being a General Manager along with 3 years of being a District Sales Manager are not good enough experience for a Company who has lost 10 GM’s in just the past year due to quitting because the District Sales Manager screams at you."
bad,"When I worked here, it was only enjoyable due to most of the other employees, but aside from that, the management was not professional. My manager at the time when I left would often disappear for a longer break period to do some shopping around the concourse. I would often find said manager on their phone when walking into the back office. Said manager would also not even do much work other than using the company phone to make personal calls. "
bad,"If you have not become besties with management and share your personal home life information be prepared to be an outcast. Your timelines and high proficiency may be a personal goal, but the least productive person is more appreciated."
bad,All directives come from corporate. This is a total top down management culture. Scheduling is not applied to employee strengths. Too many shifts are filled just for coverage. Employees are just a piece of the larger jigsaw puzzle. Too much incompetence is tolerated and accepted to keep labor cost down to the detriment of efficiency.
bad,"Numerous initiatives that are supposed to increase customer service, but are more of a hindrance than help, too shorthanded to get a lunch but other employees can take their breaks on time and daily without regards to who has been there longer that day.  Lack of respect from subordinates who feel they can override your decisions whenever they want and with no support from management"
bad,"My time at OD was short but this feels like a manifesto of why you should not work for OD. If you want to skip straight to my end point, read the last two sentences. So going from OD from Publix showed me another side of retail. My store seemed better than other Office Depot/Office Max stores but there's so much to talk about. For one, I was hired as a Copy/Print employee but outside of two days of a combined 5 hours of training I was trained in my first week and a handful of occasions in Copy/Print when they were desperate for help, I never worked in there. I was always on the register and they kept me on there because I was so good at getting rewards. I couldn't expand into other departments. Scheduling could be an issue as well, as management would change hours on me out of nowhere and not notify me until that day. I kept telling them not to do that and they listened. The managers (depending on your store) constantly hound over numbers such as number of sign ups per day and your percentage over it. They don't fire over it but it becomes very mentally draining because Office Depot customers tend to be some of the worst. Due to the low income of the company, often times its the prime target store for ink/toner thieves, dust cleaner sniffers, and shoplifters in general that steal anything between school supplies to floor model laptops. Corporate does not seem like they care for the company at all. Like, even if the stock at the time of writing this is at 1.67- down, they have the power to switch things around and make the company great again. But they insist on spending millions"
bad,"Office Depot is a company that is rapidly declining and the toxicity from upper management has slowly trickled down to the stores themselves. "
bad,"My time at OfficeMax taught me a lot about the retail environment, customer service, and basic sales. But the further this company goes, the more disconnected an uncaring the management and corporate office becomes."
bad,This place was great until 2018/2019 everything is based off the scorecard.  You can be up with AOV and Conversion but traffic is down and you dinged.  Now pay raises are based off scorecard only and a set amount. It's time for a change for me I dont like giving up 13 years this place is my family but they no longer treat the team as a family anymore. Goodbye.
bad,The department I worked in was very quiet no one spoke to each other only to the manager. There was not much interaction between the employees we were all contractors with no consideration for permanent placement. There was a major layoff in the month of May that had everyone shook and nervous about losing their job. This company is not very stable and they have already made plans to close  about 87 stores before the end of the year so employment is unstable. Although they are still hiring for certain departments they are also still laying off employees in other departments and looking to outsource before the end of the year due to tarrif issues this will affect the company greatly and cause more internal changes to come so I wouldn't recommend employment at this company especially with a major shift taking place.
bad,"This job is the worse retail job I've ever had and I've worked at 3 other retail places, 1 of which was a large corporation and the other 2 were small boutiques. Things seemed so disorganized here in terms of company policies and training as well as the managers themselves. I got barely any training in the Copy/Print department, which is where training would be most important with it being a very technical department, requiring the most multitasking."
bad,The work environment isn’t the best. It may be stressful at times. They need a higher pay raise. More employees to work  night shifts. The A/C needs to be fixed
bad,"Most people come to an office supply store generally knowing exactly what they want or need. Because businesses came in more than individuals, the idea is get them in and out quickly. There are other parts to this store: office furniture, print services, and computer sales and repair. Just like with any store, you are expected to upsale. Most people leave employers, not because of the company but because of the lack of good management.  I left because of terrible management. If you are lucky enough to get with a high performing store and great management, then you will like it here. The only other gripe was the extremely low pay for what I did. If I was just a cashier, then I'd understand my pay but as a Supervisor, it was a slap in the face."
bad,"Office Depot is an inconsistent work environment with limited advancement opportunities.  The initial training was comprehensive, but ongoing training was not always available.  Management seemed to have no plan for growth or turn around, and stores were left on an island to carry out plans."
bad,"Never know what you're walking in to day to day due to lack of communication and poor planning on managements part. Could be a 4 hour day, could be 12. Your personnel life is not a factor. Treated more like slaves then people"
bad,"While I did enjoy some aspects of the job, it was not worth the artificial stress that put on the sales floor. It was a constant juggling act of fixing computers to trying to make sales with a rather unfair quota."
bad,Drive forklift receiving department nice environment ok people to work with all and all ok job would recommend employment here they go off a point system
bad,The work is easy if manually intensive enough and the pay livable but the culture is lacking and the poor management leads to high turnover and long hours.
bad,I would consistently ask my managers for improved hours and was told that I would receive them but never ended up getting over 10 hours over November and December. One of my coworkers also was talking with the manager about a raise and she was told that she would receive it but it took a month and a half to process where she had to keep reminding the manager.
bad,Office Depot warehouse in Grand Prairie is the most childish job I have ever had . The employees walk around like everyone owe them something and when management gets involved there’s no solution. If management get better employees with positive attitudes it would be a great place to work .
bad,"I have worked with this company for 2 1/2 years and my pay has barely increased with the time I have worked here. I have gone from simply being a sales associate to working every non-management position in the store yet I am still paid barely over minimum wage. Corporate is constantly enacting new programs to make it harder to do your job, while being completely out of touch with both their customers and employees. You will be pushed to sell new services with (small) commission bonuses, but they take away the commission bonus without telling you so that they ingrain the selling culture into your work routine without having to compensate you. You don't even get proper commission for technology sales. The product itself gives you no commission, you can only get commission by selling services to go with the item. The services are typically about 20% of the price of the item, and you only get 5% of the cost of the services (ONLY if you go over $100 of services, which they never told me). In the end you get a mere 1% commission, completely pointless. Management is generally pretty good and supporting, it's more the corporate aspect of things that drag everything down. Things get especially bad working for print center, where you are far overworked and end up having to know hundreds of small details to operate the machines, yet never get payed more for working this position. Corporate refuses to replace old equipment that no longer works properly but you are stuck taking print jobs that require the use of these, slowing down the process and making everything more stressful. Overall,"
bad,"I would not recommend to anyone to work at Office Depot. Job is not paid well, some of the supervisors are not that friendly or smiling either. Not worth the time to work there."
bad,"Les tâches a réaliser ne furent pas compliquées en soi. L'immense problème était absurde, les collègues ne savaient absolument pas faire la différence entre la vie privée et la vie professionnelle. Les soucis de certains étaient forcément racontés à d'autres. Le manque de professionnalisme étaient flagrant."
bad,Place was ok to work. no complaints. Pay was ok management not as quilified. Was happy to leave .ccompany was bought out. left with severance package.
bad,The hours are all over the place and inconsistent. Manager would change your schedule the day of and if you didn't make it on time you'd get written up. Also he managers were very lazy.
bad,"I worked my way up from the bottom. When I first started with the company the opportunity for advancement was unparalleled. 12 years later, this company is going under. When you take care of those who work for you, the company succeeds, there is a reason this company is failing."
bad,"It's a retail job so of course, it sucks. People are always rude and stuck up. Your shift is never consistent and no benefits because they only hire part-time just below 30 hours."
bad,"Office depot is ok to work at if you're in high school or something. It would be a good way for kids to make extra money after school, but nothing major."
bad,The employees at the Conyers location are great.  Everyone has a good relationship over all. The problem was with management. The communication is terrible and they are inconsiderate of the employees. Employees never stay and never enjoy it. I would not recommend this store.
bad,A very stressful environment. Very competitive company having to compete with online sales. Must be good with people and always willing to help customers.
bad,"Tijdens mijn korte tijd binnen OD heb ik veel moeten doen. Ik kwam hier terecht als nieuwe sales manager en moest ook meteen in de eerste maand het huidige team ontslaan en een nieuw team bij elkaar halen. Dit ik heb ik beide als moeilijk en als leuk ervaren omdat het nieuw was maar ook omdat ik hier geen coaching in heb ontvangen. "
bad,"Mismanaged nightmare. No actual cross training. Little promotion from within. Stress-inducing work environment. Just an overall negative experience. Often, you are stuck with one job, and that's it."
bad,"The people are friendly to work with and the atmosphere is good, but the pay rate is only good for someone who still lives at home with their parents. You can't afford to live off what they pay"
bad,working at office depot i would honestly never return. management was harsh ans rude. co-workers did not do there duties correctly due to the store being renovated managers did not train workers for positions. management would talk down to the workers when we got confused or asked for help.
bad,"I was a shipping Manager at Office Depot , I was there about 5 years, I moved around an helped them open up five stores ."
bad,"Taking care of customers on a daily basis with printing questions,supplies but mostly selling and repairing computers to customers plus selling service plans also"
bad,"I honestly didn't have a great work experience as an employee. The management wasn't ideal, my coworkers were lazy, and the customers I dealt with were oftentimes very ignorant. I'd highly recommend working elsewhere."
bad,"Okay, to be honest? I loved being in the department I was in. It was fun to help others, and help them create their vision of what their business should look like with graphic design. Most, if not all, of my clients were very pleased with my abilities and my assistance, leaving them very happy with Office Depot as a company."
bad,I would recommend this job as an effective way to advance in the retail field. There is opportunity for advancement for those that want to only work in the retail field.
bad,"Limited hours to staff stores and low pay does not make it easier to accomplish tasks, assist customers and provide complete solutions. Store level management is unable to cope with poor corporate decisions."
bad,"Understaffed, Overworked, and Underpaid. Those are the best three words to explain working there. The turn over was so bad the few long term workers didn't even care to learn peoples names unless they'd made it a full month"
bad,"No payroll to build up staff. You promise associates 20-25hrs a week then you can only schedule 10hrs a week. Daily pressure and conference calls to tell you how bad you are doing and you never heard how good of a job you do. You have to be on group text messages and get text all day and evening. Pressure to keep your mouth shut and not stand up for your rights without repercussions from upper management and H.R. External hires get low balled on pay and internal promotion also get the same if you are not scared to speak up and demand a better offer. Constantly changing upper management and executive. Have to keep your fingers crossed for good luck at beginning of month hoping you are not on the firing list. If you apply, good luck for your first 90 day probation period upon hire."
bad,"Everything I did with this company I already knew how to do. As far as Promotions, you will never get one. I have d8ne as much as I could to get a higher position but it was a no go for most."
bad,"Office Depot/OfficeMax is an okay company to work for if you're a high school student. Not easy to advance, pay is terrible, work environment is okay due to awesome coworkers, poor hiring choices for management. Desperate hiring and low pay is going to kill the company."
bad,Not recommended for people wanting to advance career they always are cutting hours and the technology running company is 30 years outdated. If you’re looking for decent pay this is not the place
bad,A Print Center Associate's role is vital to the operations and work flow of a company's copy room. With a strong… variety of copying and quality control tasks to ensure that customers receive the highest quality products.
bad,"Primary Furniture sales rep, In charge of shipping and receiving of freight, New hire training for supplies department, Merchandising. Inputting new orders for purchases and ordering supplies"
bad,As manager of copy/print center I enjoyed helping customers with their copy projects. I also liked helping other associates be the best they could be.
bad,"Typical workday was very boring, learned how to stock and restock, push for sales. The culture here was generally friendly but not something to always look forward to. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the people employed there to make the most of the day."
bad,"Managers always off the floor, low pay, no benefits, poor hours, poor safety, and lack of sufficient staff, and corporate management that fails to adapt with the tims results in a highly stressful work environment with nearly no benefits and a lot of cons."
bad,"Very politically charged advancement process. High unrealistic sales expectations backed with very low or non existent commissions or incentives. "
bad,"Management- Terrible"
bad,"Our ability to assist customers was severely limited due to limited payroll; at most times, we simply didn't have enough employees to properly assist customers."
bad,good job did not mind woking there nice place to work. alot of older people there but they were really nice and they teach you rything you need ti know about stocking
bad,I could not stand going to work here. Every day was the same long drawn out process. Get to work to help people that didn't want to be helped. Come to store close we would clean the whole store for it to be destroyed again tomorrow (don't even get me started on receiving product shipments.) And then get yelled at if we didnt meet our goals for the day.
bad,Office depot was a great place to work. The only grievance I have with the company is that they laid off all of our crew a few days before Christmas.The store was closing permanently and the com[any decided to keep that fact quiet while we worked obliviously.
bad,I really ddnt have alot of career placement or benefit from working for  this company they didnt pay well and the opputunitys to grow and build my personal brand was not there
bad,"Mind numbingly boring! Not allowed to sit ever, pushed to sell, outdated training tutorials, my store often ignored company rules, safety often ignored, customers would scream in your face and management would support them, and my manager was an idiot that the company loved. They obviously don't know much."
bad,didn't really want to leave the previous work place to work here but I had to due to issues there. but I didn't think that very long due to being able to work and learn how to build things for customers and also being around cool people
bad,Took this as a filler between jobs. Love the interaction with customers and coworkers. Love keeping up with technology. Hate the hours. Hate the pay. Management is ridiculous
bad,"this job allowed me to meet all types of people especially major  business owners from all over.this Job allowed me to see it another aspect, not just having a job. deinantly humbled me. Greatful"
bad,"Current Store Manager and the whole corporation in general is purposely under-staffing their stores, especially the most crowded and the department that makes most their money, the copy center, which should be run with at least 2 people behind the counter. There is always one."
bad,I would only recommend this job to High School kids. Its a great to start off with to make money but this is not a career job. The Assistant mangers were okay but their were times they had very bad manners.
bad,"The pay for the work is unequal for almost any role in the retail locations. It's clear the company has shifted much of the administrative efforts onto the lowest paid employees."
bad,over the coarse of employment there was not much training.  Also the management was quick to do a write up without explaining what was done wrong.  it was not a pleasant experience.
bad,The store manager doesn't seem to care about the employees having other commitments. The store manager seems to give the customers whatever they want despite being against store policy.
bad,"There was very little training and they only did a little in each area of the job. I was never completely trained in aspect of my job.The managers were very hostile,rude,and disrespectful.There was also racism from the manager,if you were Hispanic you were given better treatment.The stress level was high everyday."
bad,Company is always busy and under staff. Some customers aren't friendly and can also make your job very stressful. I often find myself physically ill occasionally and do it only to support myself while going to school.
bad,"Overall good environment if you want a fast pace. You must know basic math and good customer service. Also, crisis management is a good thing to have. You will be on your feet most of the time, so wear comfortable shoes."
bad,"It was a rough stressful p;ace to work, co workers wouldnt pull their weight and all associates stayed stressed. Things would begin to change sometimes for the worst and we werent happy and it would keep us stressed cause the big boss would come and everything had to be exactly right."
bad,"Poor management cost me my job.  I had a micro manager who was more concerned with himself rather than with the overall performance of his team.  The overall culture of the company was counterproductive on the business solutions side of the house.  The process to close business with the client prospects was unwieldy and inefficient.  Most everyone was more concerned about keeping their job, rather than working together to produce more revenue and find a better outcome for the clients.  Worst company I worked for in my entire 40 plus year professional career.  I enjoyed working with the clients and working with my colleagues."
bad,I was the store manger and was hired to run the overall business needs. I hired and made schedules. was also on weekly conference calls to talk about previous weeks numbers.
bad,Company is in flux...not true identity. Upper management changes all the time. Never sure if you were coming or going. No real leadership. Customers can be mix of truly nice and respectful to angry and entitled all in the same hour. With sales dropping more and more payroll is suffering and so is morale. Perhaps a great company in the past but the present and the future are dim.
bad,"A typical day consisted of opening the store, maintaining a clean environment, customer care, and processing sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer interaction."
bad,"As long as you aren't interested in advancing your career it isn't a terrible company to work for. Management has high expectations while you get paid barely more than a high school cashier with no working experience. When concerns are brought to management nothing is really addressed. There is little to no accountability for associates either not showing up for shifts, treating management in a disrespectful way and being blatantly insubordinate. Training is done all through online videos and just on the job experience, if you want to learn anything you have to be very proactive."
bad,"The job was easy, very slow-paced, but management was horrible. The managers would either do nothing except sit in the back room, sit on their phone or twitter all day, or talk about how bad other coworkers are."
bad,"I was with the Strategic Accounts Team, this team was responsible to help all Sales Teams from around the entire United States when answering Bid responses. This was a great opportunity and I learned a lot about myself and how to place my best foot forward when working with a cohesive team."
bad,"Most of my managers were cool, just had constant issues with one supervisor, and when I tried to go higher up, nothing happened. Its a good place to work if you like being underappreciated and stuck in a dead end job."
bad,It was not a position that I would look to as a long term career. I would best say it is a learning job for you to future your career in a management position.
bad,"Únicamente dure ahí 2 meses y con eso tuve en la sucursal de La calma la verdad me extraña pero ah Sido el trabajo donde más mal tratan a la gente nueva,la capacitación mediocre de una semana y ya te dejan solo en un área los gerentes abiertos a las necesidades de los empleados los jefes de piso y supervisión de cajas de lo peor te gritan hablan de mal modo y pésimo ni por favor te dicen y ni chance de ir al baño ,hay ventas nocturnas y tienes que estar doce horas no te lo explican en la contratación obvio no sales a la hora de tu salida, y no descansan cada seis días hasta 8 o 9 a veces para descanzo muy mal y por todo reporte quieren todo perfecto pero incentivos casi no de lo peor,de verdad no vale la pena primero cuiden a su gente y todo saldrá bien."
bad,Your experience depends on your manager. They focus too much on call center metrics and not actual sales. If you have a good manager then the job can be ok
bad,"Took care of counter customers, take in and oversee all incoming jobs, make sure email was checked every hour, cashiering, complete all jobs in job log, make sure the Copy Center area was perfect at all times, make sure we had supplies at all times, make sure all employees were ARCH-3 – a selling tool developed by Office Depot, make sure all copiers were functioning properly at all times, train new hires, packing and shipping and makes each and every customer was happy."
bad,"I do not wish to rate my past employer, but it seems to be a required field. I have seem man changes within the 17 years I worked at this company. Toward the end my department of two was doing the work of 9 people. As soon as I left, open positions were posted."
bad,"After being a proven salesman (top-10 in the district), Office Depot cut my commission pay from 20% to 5%.  This ultimately cut off 30% of my annual income and caused a loss of morale to many employees particularly in the PC repairs department.  It came as no surprise to me that they recently shut down all PC repair stations corporate-wide until further notice."
bad,"I mean all I did was put items back in their belongings and plus their office depot was going to be shut down. Then school was around the corner, so I decided to leave and quite."
bad,Office Depot used to be a good company but recently they seem desperate to improve sales by implementing kitchy demonstrations such as creating coffee filter flowers on Mothers Day & how to make Elmers Glue Slime. It's embarassing as an employee to be asked to take part in such ventures that have no value to the business & usually 0 turn out. In recent years they have consistently cut payroll & increased the task load & expectations of associates with no additional support.
bad,"For being an entry level job as a cashier it was what it is, basic and straight forward. No room for advancement that I had seen followed by false promises."
bad,"This job is simple retail. The pay is what retail pays you, and the management will not tell you that you have days off or tuition reimbursement to save money. Pretty underhanded company that will skimp you anywhere they can due to a failing business"
bad,"a very goal driven business. no praises for reaching them, beat downs when you don't. daily written observations on team members are required. beware of customers just looking, it messes with their conversion numbers. reward sign ups a must. selling is the best part."
bad,"The worst thing about working for Office Depot OfficeMax was the management. Not only are the managers very demanding, but they are also very lazy. There is little to no opportunity to advance to a manager position because they like to externally hire instead of promote from within. The store is always understaffed because the turnover rate is so high. I wouldn't still be working there if I didn't have bills to pay."
bad,Not the greatest place to work at. Wish they would give more hours at this company rather than the bare minimum. They should treat associates with more respect.
bad,"Would not work there, even if they doubled my salary.  Horrible boss who loved to yell at everyone around her.  The worst part, she had 0 skills to do the job herself."
bad,"general manager and assistant general manager walked out of my store on same day, leaving no supervision. people would show up late miss days and nothing happened. not a great place to work, but not the worst."
bad,"Office Depot stresses the need for great customer service, which I agree with, however, they do not supply the workforce, or the hours to get what's best for the customers and the company"
bad,"Nothing changes, even if you go through HR. Company doesn't seem to care about it's own employees. They only care about the customers. My store has an extremely high turnover rate."
bad,"Work philosophy was very different from what I expected, very reactive maintenance.  They experienced high turn-over rate for the maintenance department."
bad,Low pay for the level of mental stress that was out of one's own hands due to such a large variety of customers. Was there before and during the start of the merger/ shift of the two companies.
bad,"I have worked for OfficeMax and Office Depot since 2010. Just when you think you've worked hard enough and finally advanced, and your colleagues think you're one of the best in the business at your job (in my case operations) they cut your hours down to 20% and apologize.  If you're looking for ""just a job"" it's not bad. If you're looking for a career, try a company that cares about your well being and your life."
bad,i didn't like the job environment everything was so clustered and i was always doing things i didn't understand how to do and the managers would never help
bad,"I worked at Office Max for close to a year. The management team scheduled the people they liked to work with them throughout the week, which really sucked when you didn't like working with the manager who liked working with you. After a while, there were so many employees that I struggled to get hours."
bad,"They continue to chase their tail looking for a brand. My hands were tied all quotes came from corporate with no input from the sales rep. Yes P&L is important but you need one big fish, in the area and the little fish will follow!"
bad,"Plenty of down time, but a lot can be asked on you making it feel as if the jobs you are asked to do are just busy work. As tech sales, don't expect to be working with technology 24/7 and fixing computers or even learning how to fix a phone. You will mostly sale technology in the store and connect computer brought in to remotely have someone else diagnosis the computer. You will rarely ever open a computer let alone fix issues by hand."
bad,Good management and decent hours but often time the expectations and goals OfficeMax was you to achieve are not realistic. No Overtime pay at all. My favorite part of the job was helping find computers and also fixing computers that customer brought in.
bad,"The employees and management in the store itself were great, but the upper management left much to be desired and expectations were out of range for the business. Pay was not reflective of the amount of work the positions required."
bad,not really a full time job more like part time hrs only very very hot stocking area only real good thing is the enviroment if u are a people friendly person and good team
bad,I would not recommend working for this company as they laid hundreds of people off without warning. they would rather have outsourced customer service
bad,"Store manager was very unprofessional, gave no leadership or direction, and had a generally poor attitude towards all employees. I will never work for this company again."
bad,"While the money can be good, the culture is not supportive for associates or managers in the field. Managers generally lack proper training in managing a workforce and understanding how to motivate and deelop their team. Focus is more on short term results and hitting numbers vs. trying to find the root cause of the issue and correcting the process. In most buildings, management is overtaxed with reports and does not spend time on the floor to understand the business, and associates are left to muddle through their day, usually with no clear direction and in some cases with no set expectation."
bad,Team members not appreciated for their efforts. Lack of consistent message of vision. No real leadership support. Every person for themselves culture.
bad,I was a temp worker a closing store with the potential for hiring on to another store afterwards. The couple of months there were an absolute nightmare. Many of the employees had fled (for good reason) leaving us over-worked and under-staffed. The store manager was extremely overbearing and had a tendency to micromanage every employee. The only good part of the experience was finding some great deals on quick-sale electronics.
bad,"Office Depot is OK to work for but do not expect job security.Numbers are more important the people. Meet your numbers you will do fine, have a bad year your on the chopping block regardless."
bad,Taking incoming calls from customers and the sales force. Promoted to team manager in 2008 had a team of 15 associates to look after and to ensure KPI's were met through coaching and development. Customer satisfaction was the most enjoyable part about this role
bad,"Depending on your store and your coworkers this can be a fun job, mostly recommended if you are entry level. Its simple stuff and you can be stress free here unless you have to deal with upset customers."
bad,"The normal day is ringing up customers and assisting them with products which are office related.  Also, taking calls and answering customer questions"
bad,"Office Depot is a slowly sinking ship. After news broke that their 'Free PC Tune Up' was something of a scam, multiple stores in New Mexico closed outright and monthly goals were consistently unmet by the various stores left standing. The work culture is corrupted by the lure of greed and money, which placed unrealistic work goals on its associates. The district manager is a joke of a leader who uses intimidation and scare tactics to motivate workers. I was laid off after 3 years of consistent output for the company, while others who frequently showed up late and committed internal theft were allowed to stay. The prices for many of their items are laughably high and it is a place teachers and print customers can go to get ripped off. Avoid working or shopping here at all times."
bad,"Training is minimal,you have to figure most procedures out by your self staff unhelpful,the place dreary,surprise this place is still in business."
bad,"A typical day, you arrive to work; clock in and begin the task that is assigned to you.  It's always the same be it cashier, copy and print or  on the sales floor selling the equipment."
bad,"I was recruited by the district manager under over glorified information, that would up being untrue.  I was hired in and told I would be trained,  3 days into my training we had turnover at my home store which caused me to abandon my training to fill in the gaps back home.  During the gap time with little to no associates, corportate restructured and laid off my boss.  when the new boss came in she was displeased in my inability to do my job (do to the lack of ANY training) which  then resulted in me being laid off.  I had a very comfortable position at Petco, and moved soley due to promises of better pay and better hours and would up jobless and scambling.  this company is headed for the gutter DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,"The company is ok, but there was no room to grow and gain promotions. If you are looking for something part time/ not long term, it is an ok job."
bad,"Typical day for a store manger depends on they location, staffing and volume of your store. Usually early morning 10-16 hour shifts depending on the tasks that need to be completed. I learned a lot about technology and copy and print services during my time at office depot."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Upper Management micromanages everything so heavily that you cannot find time to properly serve customers in a timely manner."
bad,"I'M in charged of driving sales to the store and giving the best customer experience. I'm also in charged of making sure to train and develop new associates,"
bad,"A typical day would consist of light stock, upsells, cart-duty, pushing warrant plans, and reward memberships."
bad,"Fast paced environment for sales primarily due to the many store closings. If you like change, then this is the company for you. Always changing something, whether it be your title or role within the store. Limited staffing with small to medium store formats. People are good and work life balance is great. Good training program for management.  For a technology company, they are severely  behind the curve with innovation and e-commerce integration. Internal computer programs and registers are out dated. Values are questionable with this company and seem to be enforced only when it benefits the company, not the employees. I would not recommend working for this company on the grounds that they are inconsistent with their policy enforcement."
bad,"Office Depot was in turmoil when I was there, and the stores were rife with backstabbing and price cutting despite corporate's directives."
bad,"It was a fantastic company with great benefits and training and development when I first started but, by the time I left it was a train wreck!"
bad,While a few of the assistant managers went above and beyond the call of duty to make the work place a fun and effective machine. The overall general management of the store was handled poorly and caused many inefficiencies in terms of customer service and employee satisfaction and productivity.
bad,"I work at one of the hardest parts of the store which is Copy and Print. Nothing about there is easy and it's frustrating that we only have 3 people who work over there. Sometimes the cashiers will stand there goofing off with eachother while I'm surrounded with customers and they won't come help me even if I ask. Scheduling is an entirely different issue on hand. I'm a college student and working 30+ hours, no help and only getting $7.25 an hour truly sucks!! If you work for Copy & Print.. Don't ever try to call out. They will give you a hard time and try to convince you to come in or better yet write you up for it."
bad,it was a very fun place to work at. loved the people i worked with. but i didnt like not having consistent hours each week. i would handle the cashiers every day i would work.
bad,this place is just a job to me. I feel that management does not care about its employees or the fact that they have lives outside of work
bad,"se  trabaja en equipo el sueldo esta  bien las prestaciones también lo malo es el cuerpo gerencial que no respeta las políticas de la empresa ,te negrean y no pagan tiempo extra, este te lo manejan  como opcional y en realidad es obligatorio y cuando llega la quincena  no te las pagan  tampoco  hay reparto de utilidades , solo un bonito para que no te quejes, no te respetan tus vacaciones y en mi caso siempre argumentaban que no había quien me cubriera"
bad,All about the numbers and service based aspects of the store. Hours are not available to make sure store is appropriately staffed to handle customer flow. Lack of communication of major transitions in procedures and policies. Very challenging at times when busy and no associates to help customers. No overlap of times to ensure employees get breaks.
bad,"Not really a place I would recommend working unless you like getting no hours, and kept out of the loop when it comes to knowing basic business needs/ or changes."
bad,"they hire managers without any experience from the outside.  Promotions from within are virtually unheard of.  The pay is garbage, and benefits are worse.  The company is outdated it's wonder they are still in business."
bad,Print center was the worst place to be. Everyone wanting jobs done then and there while you had a line up of issues. Computer always crashed and wasn't up to date to get things done faster. We had one computer to do all the printing. The pay wasn't worth the stress. I worked after closing just to get jobs done. It was nice getting the photoshop experience though.
bad,"A typical day at work is engaging with key stakeholders for business innovation ideas, building business cases and initiating projects (approved business cases)."
bad,It wasn't the company that was the problem but how the store manager at the time performed shady dealings that in my good conscious I could not let go unheard.
bad,"Working at Office Depot was boring and at times was unenjoyable. Management only cared about sales and didn't care at all at making sure the employees were happy or enjoyed what they were doing. On top of that, the management did little to no work and usually sat in the back office doing paper work."
bad,"The corporate office doesn't know a single thing about how to run a business. If it weren't for the terrible decisions made by this company, this business wouldn't be in the terrible condition that it is now. I sincerely hope that the CEO's golden parachute is a dud lined with iron instead of my hard work, sweat, and blood."
bad,assistant manager did not like the fact that I had to change my schedule because of my school schedule. After working there for a few weeks i was able to add a class and the assistant manager got really mad at me for doing that.
bad,"Assist customers, sell plans, training, self-development. Inventory restock, cleanliness and organization. Hard working managers, and dedicated employees. Enjoy interacting with a wide range of customers. Rewarding to assist customers with what ever they need."
bad,Current merger with Office depot is destroying the 14 years of work of about 300 people in the distribution network. it's sad and a financial mistake.
bad,"Did my job, I learned alot about planagrams how to set up displays.Management was ok. One of them was a little power hungry.There was no real hard part to the job. There is no room for advancement.It depended on the season  of your hours. I was suppose to get 40 hours . and thy cut hours . So I had to find another job. Enjoyable was working with the people."
bad,My time with Office Depot allowed me to interact with the Customers needing help with their personal technology problems. Troubleshoot. I enjoyed this. I did not enjoy promises of future advancement that never blossomed.
bad,no chance of learning much int he store and bad training for the associates
bad,"Used to be fun until the merger with Office Depot.  After that there was very little information getting to the employees regarding policies and procedures.  No training for anything, just thrown behind a register or into the Service or Print Center and left to fend for yourself.  I would never have take the job had I not been desperate for some sort of income.  It's seriously the least amount of money I have ever made since graduating high school 22 years ago."
bad,management are bullies who ignore their own policies they fired the victims not the bullies. they pick and choose who gets treated well and who has to abide by the rules. FULL OF FAVORITISM. not everyone gets the same opportunities. NOT A SECURE JOB
bad,"Very little pay, wasn't happy here. Didn't train very well they would just put you out there to work. Co-workers were great. Management needs a little work tho."
bad,"Like most retail jobs, the pay and hours suck and employment policies set by corporate are clearly meant to maximize churn. The staff and management were generally friendly and competent and there was no drama, so at least my time spent working was pleasant."
bad,"Really enjoy working for the legacy OfficeMax team and currently adjusting to the new Office Depot, Inc model.  What's intriguing about my position is that I am an overlay to support and manage (6)sales teams for a total of 54 general line office product representatives in South Texas.  Each of which have different goals, objectives and personalities.  I am also required to support the Global National Account team for large enterprise oil and gas clients to sell our continuum of technology products and managed services. All of this activity is good and I am fully capable to multi task, build a pipeline, log activity into Sales Force, manage cross functional teams and close deals."
bad,I work at Office Depot part time. It was a good work environment and I enjoyed working there especially for my first job
bad,"Its ok, you will only be a part time employee, benefits are not good."
bad,"I was recently employed as, well the official title was ""Sales Consultant"" but in reality all I was ALLOWED to do was stand behind a cash register all day with little else to do but keep organizing the same five stacks of paper for 6 hours straight."
bad,"Pay is very low, nearly everybody starts at minimum wage with 20-25 hours per week unless you're hired as management. Reviews are once per year and pay increases are minimum, usually around 15 to 25 cents. There are some good managers and some not-so-good ones. Customer service programs are ridiculous requiring constant radio chatter and basically stalking customers (eg. customer in blue entering the store let's get him greeted, customer in blue shirt has been greeted he is now entering zone one, customer in blue shirt has entered the restroom, customer in blue shirt leaving restroom towards zone 1, customer in blue shirt moving to zone 2, customer in blue shirt checking out, customer in blue shirt purchased some folders & paper he had a rewards card and is now leaving the store.) It is probably a good first job for someone, but not something anyone in their 30's should be starting in."
bad,Every minute with this company was enjoyable. The only downside was the company couldn't afford to give anyone many hours.
bad,paint by numbers.  Nothing was hard about the job being a conveyer belt line Pic'er.
bad,"Very sneaky company, upper management does things behind your back, if they feel threatened that you might pass them up in your career, they will go out of their way to get rid of you, even if it means lying. "
bad,"assisted customers will printing needs ranging from school projects to obituaries"
bad,teamwork was awful but the customers and my job duties I totally loved
bad,It was interesting with different personalities. I learned how shipping and receiving works. I enjoyed my co-workers and the management was part of the team and family oriented. I enjoyed everyone. I enjoyed working as a team the most. 
bad,"meeting different people"
bad,Like any other retail job it's just a job. Get ready for the stress of meeting sales and pushing on add-ons and insurance. 
bad,"Quick Summary:"
bad,"I worked for them for a year and to be honest it was one of the worst places that I have worked.  management was very unprofessional,  "
bad,Office Depot is a pretty busy place to work. Management always wants more than what can be provided. co-workers for the most part are cool. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the ever changing corporate plan. The job wasn't enjoyable.
bad,"Empresa en la cual estamos orientados a trabajar sobre objetivos, con sentido de urgencia."
bad,The Management expect way more from the associates than they are even able to do. and than if the associates cant preform the way they want them to they seem very stuck up and negative. The management cant do what is expected of the so y do they pressure the associates. they put there work on the associates making it even more stressful. They promise promotions but then set unattainable goals to get those promotions.
bad,"good if your looking to pay a ""few"" bills...unprofessional... constant cutting of hours along with a consistently changing of schedule... be prepared to get called on your days off 70% of the time.."
bad,Tough place to work in past years. Sr. Executives change every 2-4 years and take the company in a new direction. During slow economic times they really tighten their belt and make life impossible for employees.
bad,the only thing i really learned here was cashier. Management was not to alert.
bad,Not a bad second job. Would not recommend working here if your looking for competative pay and advancement. The enviorment is relaxed and calm and easy to learn. Not bad if looking to just looking to make some extra cash on the side.
bad,Typical day included handling customers questions & concerns about products at the store.
bad,have not worked there for many years. They seem to be on way the out.
bad,Very boring atmosphere with empty promises. Very negatively agressive management. I did not appreciate how our store treated our customers around me.
bad,This job is not meant for people with degrees. The pay rate is horrible and it has limited advancements and terrible commission structure.
bad,Managers are not involved in work instead they give scan guns and watch info from their desk.
bad,My coworkers are great. My manager is extremely understanding and always willing to work with hours. If this wasn't true I would have left long ago. Unrealistic sales standards are set by corporate for products (mostly digital services and protection plans) the posters in the break room and training videos are seemingly aimed at simpletons. Just a terribly mismanaged company hemmoraging money
bad,"Beginning at Office Max was amazing, the managers were friendly and willing to teach skills and help you advance yourself as a person. The work environment was friendly and you felt like an actual team! But after almost three years of working here, the managers have left and you aren't taught anything that will advance you as a person. They push you to get sign ups and are upset if you don't get someone to either sign up or use them. Taking people into the office to tell them that it is unacceptable and that it needs to improve constantly. Some associates are very nice and friendly still but it feels very segmented and it's no longer a team."
bad,"New management came in and made the environment unpleasant. The stocking crew kept quitting leaving me to pick up all the slack. They expect you to get ALL of the truck work done in like 4 hours of your shift, which hardly ever happens. I felt like the management was super passive aggressive and would make comments they thought were funny but seemed demeaning to me. They won’t give you a break, you have to ask for it every time."
bad,"Not one of my favorite jobs. My co-workers were nice but my supervisor complained a lot, even though I had to carry much of the workload that he left me after his shift was done in addition to walk-in clients. Upper management was not very helpful. The only thing I really learned working there was how to work a copy machine and a few other print related tasks."
bad,"Personalmente y a nivel de compañeros, no pagan horas extras en dinero, te las pagan tiempo por tiempo, pero ese tiempo que te deben, muy rara vez se otorgaba."
bad,"This company experience was like the typical ""corporate business"" experience. The higher ups are rude and demeaning to their workers. Our regional manager even threw a penny at the store manager when I worked there. They pay you just enough for the position you got hired into, and then expect you to be able to work every other area of the store as well. Raises are non-existent and when they do offer you a raise, it is only about 10 cents or less. There is very minimal room for growth. It was simply put a very disappointing company to work with."
bad,High pace environment with constant changes and lots of opportunities to learn new things. Long hours and high expectations are the norm. Culture is up beat and surrounded by great people. Management works in silos.
bad,"Just a job."
bad,The supervisor i had loved to micro manage you to deaf. Full time hours were cut in half 8 months out of the year. Other then that i had it made. Some people were on the buddy list of the area supervisors. If you werent on their list it was not a fun place to be.
bad,"I was under trained, but was made to feel as though I should have already knew everything, because I had experience as a cashier,  but to my knowledge every store policy is different? Felt as if It was necessary to pressure customers to be a rewards member, and purchase items. Personal pressuring sales tactics goes against what I believe especially when I've  not been properly educated about the item's. Subjected to "
bad,I have been working at Office Max since February and at first it was a chill job. It’s very slow paced and can boring at times but you rarely work long shifts. While working there I had encountered a manager who was very unprofessional and making inappropriate comments verbally and messaging younger female employees on social media. I was the first one to report it while the others who have had incidents with him failed to do so. I told the general manager and he was very concerned at first and it seemed like he was taking the right steps until he talked to the operations manager for his side and the general manager’s demeanor changed. He basically told me I still had to work with him but he would try his best not to schedule me with him (all I asked). Lately he started scheduling me with him and I was still uncomfortable. So I asked him about it and the general manager was basically putting the blame on me and lying saying that I haven’t worked with the operations manager (when we both know that I have). So I ended up transferring to Office Depot because I couldn’t work at this Office Max location anymore.
bad,"Asking everyone to do much more with much less to the point of it being unreasonable. "
bad,"The District Manager refuses to remove the dead weight managers in the district while the lower paid management picks up the slack, meanwhile he is always confused as to why the district is constantly under performing. It is a failing company."
bad,Went through a lot of management but was with the company for 23 years.. had good times early on in the company but when they became political correct we couldn’t put a Christmas tree up
bad,"the work is mostly boring, the most interesting thing about the place is you'll get cool customers like doctors and vape distributors that have have their own businesses. I don't recommend applying if your'e over 18 because you'll be stocking chairs and furniture in the back and in high places and even though you wont be doing that all the time, for 8 an hour its just not worth it."
bad,I loved my job but management was horrible. Some of the people there were the best but the manager is horrible and doesn't care about the new people and the other employees will talk bad about you to others and customers.
bad,"Coworkers were the best part of the job. Most days were bland and boring, changes in management were often and had to think on feet often as all problems weren't black and white."
bad,"Long hours of dealing with customers, understaffed and never got trained properly with all the tasks for my positions. Rarely would get an actual break for lunch. Had to quit so I could go to college"
bad,"Worked here at the dawn of the aughts when the company was in transition. Great people and the direct leadership was top notch, but the times were a changin' and senior leadership struggled to keep up."
bad,"At OfficeMax, I enjoy all of the people I work with at the store level, with a few exceptions. However, the sales targets set by Corporate are very unrealistic and hard to make, and little to no real incentive is given to make them. It is just tiring and soul crushing."
bad,"A typical day at work was slow except Holidays"
bad,"My time spent at OfficeMax was sometimes fun and very fast paced. The biggest issues I ran into was team morale since rarely anyone was set at full time, so the company could avoid paying for benefits. There tends to be a lot of people on payroll who can only work 2 to 4 hours one day a week, which is very unfortunate for the associates who were available anytime to work."
bad,"I used to look forward to coming to work and now that there is new management and corporate leadership it’s become entirely too stressful. The new goals are unrealistic for the current retail environment, there isn’t enough payroll to have a complete staff in the building all day and the benefits no longer outweigh the bad days. If you’re a cut-throat salesperson that will do whatever it takes to get a sale then Office Depot is the place for you. If you’re looking for a fun, laid back environment where you aren’t pressuring people to subscribe to product delivery and services, look elsewhere, Office Depot/OfficeMax isn’t that company anymore."
bad,"Es una empresa estable hay crecimiento y te dan las prestaciones, falta organización por parte de gerencia y con los encargados de cajas no hay comunicación no te dicen bien cuáles son las actividades que tienes que realizar ya en el puesto cero tolerancia a los errores humanos no hay congruencia en lo que dicen y hacen."
bad,Heel sterke focus op korte termijn winst en vergaande kostensanering
bad,"They worked us long hours and the upper management team was very disorganized. There was minimal opportunity for growth and it wasn't about what you knew, it was all about who you know."
bad,always wanting more from employees while paying less than average. Do not follow their own policies except when it suits them. Management does not appear to be trained well
bad,"As a manager at OD, you need to be able to work at a fast pace and quickly adapt and learn new initiatives.  Stores are not often given the tools to help training and coach new services and offerings, but if you catch on quickly, it is smooth sailing."
bad,"Hours depended on sales. As a cashier, I spent a lot of time on my feet, with no real room for advancement due to limits on employees for both position and promotions. Most of the time, the store ran a tight crew of four, counting cashier, print worker, floor assistant, and manager. Limited space for full-time, and cashiers generally didn't get moved to floor. Managers were usually good, with obvious exceptions. Fellow workers were mostly helpful in my time at Depot. Customers were generally nicer than some of the management."
bad,A typical day was filled with an endless checklist of things to be done. I learned much about category management. The workplace culture  was a little cut throat. Management was not supportive at all. Hardest part was balancing everything. The most enjoyable was going home.
bad,"if you are firm with your boundaries of how much you can work, it works well for a college kid. I had the issue of not being firm enough about what hours i was available and iended up being over worked. It didnt helped that the store i worked for was closing down and people were quitting so I had to pick up a lot of the slack. I wasnt finished with training, they just taught me how to do register stuff and that was about it."
bad,"I worked as both a sales floor and print production associate at Office Depot for roughly 3 years across multiple stores. The job itself can be stressful and most of the time the store is understaffed. This can be especially true in the printing department where you usually work alone for an entire shift. It can be especially overwhelming when you are the only person working with experience within the department; management included."
bad,This job was very stressful the pay wasn't enough to provide for your Family and there wasn't any structure or leadership and everyday was a challenge.
bad,"This company really pushes you to sell to customers. They want you to push sales into customers for things they don't even need. They look at customers and only see dollar signs. If you can't sell or don't like to sell then you won't go far in this company. Also, you get a lot of business guests in there and they can be pretty cutthroat. I would not recommend working here. There are better retailers to work for."
bad,"The managers really don't care what goes on in there as long as the job gets done. And if you weren't there longer than the most recently hired manager, you will get treated differently than the ""veterans""."
bad,"Didn't spend a great deal of time here. Worked hard while I was there little or nothing shown for it. Management at my location was lackluster, and not looking to further train those wanting or expressing interest in cross training."
bad,Quality middle management was sorely lacking.  They were feckless and did not provide adequate direction.  It was shoot from the hip type of leadership and they played favorites all the time.  A very disappointing experience for me.
bad,Office Depot has much promise but many years ago when they called pay and started showing they cared more about the share holders than their staff it become difficult to work for
bad,"It was alright for a first job I suppose. The company lacks presence and enthusiasm. Everybody I worked with, including the managers didn't seem to want to be there. The people were good and I'm still friendly with a few of them. Near the end of my employment there I was actually only being scheduled 2 days a week which is the reason for me leaving the company."
bad,The pay is not sufficient in comparison to the work level and work environment. It is more stressful than it has to be because of the negative work environment.
bad,"At office depot, you learn about the many different types of office supplies that are used on the everyday.whether it is working on your own business or working for a bigger business."
bad,There needs to be at least two people to fill the roles of each job area. There is so much pressure in each area that there is hardly time to breathe.
bad,I work in the print department and our store is in a pretty high traffic area. The work we do is rewarding yet stressful because there never seems to be enough people working within print. The pay for part-timers is incredibly low for the amount of work you do.
bad,"If you hate being a person and being a robot who gets stepped on all day every day, OD/OM Is the place for you. No room for advancement and everyone is toxic. This is the most mismanaged company I have ever seen."
bad,"Depending on the department you work in will determine what your day-to-day will look like.  "
bad,"Management oversold branch capabilities while holding the operations team members accountable."
bad,"lavorando in un call center"
bad,Not the best place definitely did not like that main manager and neither did any of the others. The manager did not know how to manage was not the kindest.
bad,"I've worked at Office Depot now for about a year and a half, and I really, really am sick of it. The customers are rude to Copy and Print employees, and and management is rather poor. The fact that there are only three people who can work in the copy center means that there is minimal chance for a college student employee to have any free time to spend studying or socializing."
bad,"Stress in on your back every day working here. They are not laid back very uptight. Office Depot needs to cut back on how many services they provide, especially if their stores are understaffed."
bad,"Je suis resté 7 ans dans cette structure qui donne  peu de moyens pour faire un travail dans de bonnes conditions. "
bad,"Some of the managers were OK, some not.  No benefits and the pay is not competitive.  As a second job, it is tolerable.  The did at least make sure you were trained."
bad,"Every job has its pros and its cons. Here the pro is you are trained in all different areas of the store, so you get experience in more than just one thing (like a cashier, sales, stocking, freight, tech, copy and print). The main con that I and many others have dealt with is poor management and typically with poor management comes disorganization and a stressful working environment."
bad,Great People in the field. Not sure they know how to fix the company after the merger with Office Max. I enjoyed my time working with salespeople and customers.
bad,You will have multiple managers that have different views and want you to do different things...same as other jobs I guess. Not bad for first job easy job
bad,The main issue with this company is the lack of focus on quality. They want to just sell stuff is the mentality. They do not focus on the customer experience and what it means to really take care of their people and the customer.
bad,Companies future is in doubt.  The merger with Officemax is still not complete.  Former CEO destroy our operational excellence.  Cost cutting has been only path to survival
bad,there are plenty of nice coworkers but he management team does not go by the policies of the company but by there own thoughts. they do not listen to the associates. all they care about is their position and the frieght.
bad,"The job was like any other retail job, the corporate side constantly tried to make it as difficult as possible to do a good job. My stores management was great but the expectations for the store were outrageous and the punishments made it worse."
bad,"When you first start, it's good. After a while people start to leave, and so they give you more hours to compensate those who left. The worst part is you might be given additional hours, even if you have plans. So they don't ask, they force you to stay extra."
bad,"There is very little training with this company, you are expected ""to be in charge of your own training"".  meaning watching videos and looking things up in the computer and if you don't have the wording just right you can spend hours trying to find what your looking for."
bad,Not the company that I grew up in.  I worked for them for 26.5 years and over the last 12 years we just all became numbers.  Now it's just about how much they can get away with paying you and forget about your knowledge or even legacy knowledge of the company.
bad,"Contract cut with little warning. Office Depot is not doing well and are cutting back everywhere. They are only hiring junior programmers and letting go senior programmers, etc."
bad,"Typical day at work usually starts off slow then quickens up during the afternoon, then usually slows to a halt during closing. I've learned mostly how to deal with difficult customers while still keeping a smile on my face. The management is actually pretty decent for what it's worth and can make most days manageable. The culture that I feel is that this place is only a stepping stone until greener pastures are found. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pace when there are times which there aren't enough employees scheduled to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk and converse with your fellow employees because sometimes when the customers aren't there, that is all you have to talk to."
bad,"I used to work at Office Max back in 2012. I worked there as a part time job to help pay for college. It wasn't that bad, but the work/life balance was a bit too much for me, as it was difficult to deal with the various bs that the company required you to do. From making paper and ink sales quota, to dealing with being fake for customers that still treated you like a slave no matter what you do for them. "
bad,"Same routine, based on helping customers. Copy center was hard. It was not easy to advance in the work environment, and the pay was minimum wage, should've been more."
bad,"I learned several thing from working at Office Depot, like inventory and stocking but honestly the job isn't worth it all. Managers are terrible, never have your back, careless. Managers will tell you to tell the customers one thing then when the customer asks for the manager the manager will say something different from what you said and make you look bad. They just have terrible management all around"
bad,The job was not fun at all i know that must jobs are not fun or are not suppose to be fun. But this is different half the time i would just be standing there just waiting and waiting for someone to come in just to be able to do something.
bad,A big responsibility with no commensurate returns. I have learned a lot in Management by dealing various kind of people. NO justifiable rates were observed.
bad,Office Depot is constantly going through changes with CEOs and management.  It is not a stable place to work. ...................................................
bad,no real long term opportunities here......for the most part management is entrenched and very disconnected from reality.... spend any amount of time at Office Depot and it becomes very obvious why top line has been dropping like a rock the past few years
bad,Very top heavy company with an old business model in serious decline. Corporate culture has suffered thanks to poor company performance. Company hasn't made a profit from retail sales in 8 years. Massive layoffs taking place thanks to the failed Staples merger.
bad,"worried to much about results and how to get them. Pushed good managers out of the company because they were not in the ""Good old boys club""."
bad,"Usually pretty boring.  I learned how to use a few different kinds of software and several interesting machines, though.  Management was very enthusiastic.  Culture was pretty relaxed."
bad,"Very pushy managers, forced to wear uncomfortable uniform, very dehumanizing experience all the way through. The only joy in your day is commiserating with fellow employees."
bad,"As with most retail stores, you are expected to work your ""fair share"" of nights and weekends regardless of your title or how long you've been with the company."
bad,"A typical day at work is pretty easy going "
bad,"Llegar a checar tu hora de entrada y presentarte en el área asignada, atender a todos los clientes brindando un buen servicio, por parte de mis compañeros no teníamos problemas con ayudarnos, eramos buen equipo, las reglas se debían cumplir al pie de la letra, en cuestión a permisos no eran muy accesibles, la parte difícil era no perder la cabeza con los clientes que llegaban de mal humor  ya que nuestro trabajo es darle un buen trato al cliente, lo que mas me gusto fue precisamente eso, poder sobre llevar cada estado de animo con los clientes con una actitud positiva y ver al final como se iban de la tienda con una sonrisa, ademas de aprender muchas cosas administrativas."
bad,"Once they got taken over by Office Depot they constantly had stock problems and lacked receiving advertised items in a timely manner."
bad,"For my first job this place was alright, taught me the basics of working in a service and retail industry. The management was my only complaint, because no matter what I did to tell them I had school on certain days they somehow always and consistently screwed up and magically forgot I went to school."
bad,es una buena empresa aunque aun le falta un poco de organización en ciertos aspectos como por ejemplo tomar en cuenta los días de asueto y no solo descansar dos días al año
bad,"Since the Office Max merger things have been declining especially with the pending offer from Staples. CEO is pushing hard to get this merger to go through, he stands to net 45-50 million when he walks away."
bad,"Overall, my experience working at Office Depot was fairly good. I enjoyed the guys I worked with and the environment was usually peaceful. But not always was it so easy. One of the hardest things to deal with was the management was unsure on how to do things around there. Whenever I had a question, It seemed there was no clear answer."
bad,High micro management environment. Stifles creativity.  Office environment is clean and spacious.  Cafeteria provides some amount of options for lunch and breakfast.
bad,Haphazard management. Chaotic atmosphere. Burn out rate is high. Internal mechanisms and tools are a mish-mash and training is weak.
bad,I hated this job so much no hours and really really low pay thats all i can say. the worst job i have ever had. i would not recommend anybody working there at all.
bad,I learned lot about working in retail. I became a sales specialist with in 2 years of working there. Sometimes I had to work alone and didn't have a lot of team help with things.
bad,The worst retail job i have ever had. They expect too much out of you and underpay at the same time. The could care less about the associates as long as the job gets done one way or another.
bad,There was no way to track attainment for quarterly bonuses that was true to payout.  Every manager had their own formulated spreadsheets and would go head to head with the compensation department every quarter.  Often a bonus payout would go up or down 20 points overnight with no explanation.  There is a lot of head shaking and commiserating when bonuses payout as you don't know what yours will be until the day it pays.  Very frustrating.
bad,Do not work at this store location. Bad management. Customers are great and understanding. If you were to work for this company find another location. Avoid by all means!
bad,"Customer with problems,we need to know solutios"
bad,"Drama everywhere. It's almost like the word professionalism is alien to the management.  There is an employee there, who shall remain nameless, who has been known to sexually harass employees and customers, and was made a manager as a reward for his insolence. DO NOT work at the Bossier City Office Depot if you know what is good for you."
bad,"they don't pay attention to the days you ask off, schedule you anyway."
bad,The micromanaging is a bit tedious. Doesn't have the best compensation to work effort ratio. But the advantage is choosing your hours to accommodate school.
bad,"Working for Officemax taught me several things. I started off as a store associate. I educated the customers on the basics of purchasing the most used office appliances and equipment. I had a taste of the sales process. Selling merchandise for Officemax was a unique experience. I had  the pleasure to work with various types of employees, employers, and teachers. I learned the importance of purchasing items in bulk and saving."
bad,"This is a store-specific issue, but my store manager and other store managers (even some of the other employees) had a holy-er than thou attitude towards the logistics team. Logistics is arguably the hardest job at OD (heavy boxes, freight, knowing where EVERYTHING is in the store, filling out list after list, helping customers, ect) all the hard work is almost in vain because logistics members just get stepped on."
bad,There is no coaching for advancement. Upper management doesn't listen to employee concerns. Some management make the working environment hostile environment
bad,A typical day at Office Depot was me getting to work about 15 minutes early like I normally did because I liked to brew coffee for everyone but management began to get pretty lazy and would frequently forget to unlock the door sometimes even 15 minutes after the store was supposed to be open.  I complained about this on a daily basis because it was causing me to be late every day.  Nobody followed up on my complaints and actually started getting mad at me for calling them out on it.  During my shift I was constantly overloaded because we were severely understaffed and the staff we had was so unskilled and non-invested I could do nothing with them.  Frankly I didn't learn anything while I was working for Office Depot Max and I feel like they just took advantage of my skills and willingness to work hard. Management was beyond incompetent not even knowing how to run the departments in his store.  If I had a question about procedure he could not answer it because he had no experience whatsoever in my department.  And on top of it all because we had nobody with copy and print skills I couldn't get out of the store to allow the closing crew to take over.  I was forced to forgo my 15 minute breaks every day and frequently have to skip my lunch break as well to handle the mass of work that needed to be done.  Overall this company was terrible and I can see why they are desperate to conglomerate.
bad,"The work will keep you busy all day round the clock and the customers are in general very nice people.  The managers were nice people but there were times when they would leave out important information and many more when management of the associates was very poor. The hardest part of the job was trying to get a manager to the register in a timely fashion while keeping the customers from getting upset about the long wait.  The best part of the job was my co-workers, they kept things light and fun which made for a very enjoyable experience."
bad,"I am employed as a Sales Consultant. Most of my job requires me to be on the floor to help customers and answer their questions. However, I have trouble answering these questions most of the time, as I have never been informed about the exact specifications of furniture, chairs, and technology items such as laptops and desktops."
bad,"giving each costumer great costumer service, my fellow co-workers were great people although the management there was quite faulty."
bad,Very confused at how the company career advancement structure works. Or the design of the overall promotional process or increase in pay.
bad,"It was a decent starting sales position. So if you are right out of school, this job will be perfect for you. Manager did not know anything about the office product industry so it became difficult to sale."
bad,saturated market no job prospect or fulfillment in this company at present. Major in house clear out making changes for hand over of company assets. jobs in the business are not safe
bad,"They work you hard and they do not appreciate the work you put in. Not a good job/life balance. Don't recommend working there,"
bad,"•Typical day-to-day as a Sales Executive includes will service, sell and manage for the company for all stores in the district related technologies, and facilities."
bad,You work like crazy for no pay and no chance of moving up in the company.
bad,Management doesn't even know what is going on with their own team. Sometimes management doesn't even show at all to work.
bad,"OfficeMax distribution warehouse is an ok place to work. Not much help from management if you want to move up. However, it's a fun place to work. The people who work there are all characters and great to be around. The workload is pretty heavy, but heavy workloads is what I love. The benefits are ok. But there's hardly any room for advancement."
bad,"A typical day at work is trying to provide excellent costumer service. I've learned sales, technology, and also copy and print experience. Management however, is poor and lazy but the upside is my co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of my job is having to disregard my morals just to please a costumer. Office Depot is heading down a dangerous road just to get good costumer surveys."
bad,"The corporate structure had little practical application when implemented in store. The allotted labor hours were never enough. Store management and employees were punished for low customer service ratings but we never had enough associates to help all customers. Because of limited manager hours and little scheduling overlap, managers rarely got lunches and never 15-minute breaks. "
bad,Office Depot is going through a period of significant change
bad,Team oriented job. Rated low because of management. Enjoyable experience with the right managers.
bad,"Management was horrible, coworkers were awesome and customers were great though!"
bad,"Love my co-workers, bosses not so much. Alot of slacking gets over looked and the hard workers are always being pushed to make up for the slacking. Management are racist, biased and spiteful."
bad,"cashier and money handling, sale product protection plans and warranties, Provided general Customer service face to face interactions ,providing customers with fast efficient service, stocking, ordering merchandise, making sure inventories were up to date and accurate, "
bad,"Very low priority on training; they have a sink or swim aproach when it comes to training. Their technology employees are not certified techs. There is an atmosphere of ""do anything to make a buck"". My coworkers were nice and fun to be around. Hardest part of the job was to become a walking wikipedia in 30 days. I did enjoy learning about printers, and everything in the Copy and Print Center."
bad,"Basically unproductive position. Excellent interactive video training program. Manager is a very nice and knowledgeable person, and same for assistant manager. However, they displayed very little time or inclination for personal interaction or mentoring of associates. Management never really welcomed me into the Office Depot family. Recognition of employees is evidently lacking in all areas of performance. What holds that store up is the longer-term employees who know their jobs well and go about them seamlessly. Without them, this store would go the way of Circuit City's collapse.There were no team meetings to exchange ideas and experiences to improve the store operations and sales. When I would spend time with customers to get their needs met and build a long-term relationship (their stated goal of building ""one customer at a time""), I was asked how much longer I would be with that customer, although nothing else particularly important was waiting to be done that I could see. When hired, I was told that I could be a department manager and never heard anything else about that, and it never happened. If you like to sit around and collect a small paycheck, this is an OK job. A lot of ""busy work"" that didn't contribute at all to the store's bottom line, and that was self-generated busy work...there was nothing proactive in their entire philosophy. They want you to say the company motto on the store headsets, but it's just perfunctory.This store and company is probably typical of big-box American retail across the board, and it shows in Office Depot's consistently depressed stock"
bad,"I learn many skills working in copy and print, it was my favorite department. Management was ok. The store manager was not understanding to call-ins or being late. Associates with younger children could come into problems with needing time off due to illness or day care issues. The store manager would never call an associate into the office when problems arised. The store manager would raise his voice at employees in the head set so all the other employees could hear him correcting that employee."
bad,"The job is overall very easy but just the level of laziness that OD hires is on another level. It is literally every man for himself. Management sucks, they're not consistent. Meaning I've had 3 managers in 3 months. None of them know what they're are doing, and they give power to the Inventory specialist whom also doesn't know what they're doing. The only good parts of the company...the occasional free lunch and the Gatorade during the summer."
bad,A typical Office Depot day involves plenty of multitasking. I have learned my skills from working departments that are not assigned to me. Management and co workers are like family to me making any difficult day better. The hardest part of the job is trying to sell warranties to customers. Most enjoyable part is networking and meeting new customers
bad,"basically a good company,but within the last 7 years company lost its focus and leadership,example 6 Ceo""s within 6 years along with a directions that constantly change dramatically,continually lost market share and allow competition to dictate it business i.e staples ...Office deopt should have dominated them but they allowed staples to take over the market share."
bad,"No constant in commission/pay structure. ""What have you done for me lately"" mentality amongst upper management."
bad,"I went in with high hopes & dreams, especially... Considering the fact I had prior copy/print supervisor experience. My manager set me up to fail, by not having all the info herself. I went through racial profiling, to being hired for diversity reasons, & terminated before my promotion I was suppose to receive because of points on my attendance I was unaware of without warning/cause."
bad,"While working at Office Depot, out of four managers and one store manager, only one manager was helpful and helped guide you. The store manager was not helpful and you had to learn how to train yourself. Overall experience at the Office Depot I did enjoy getting some experience with customers and with the work as a first official job! I just wish the management was better and helped the workers feel comfortable at work"
bad,Office Depot once was a great place to work. However new corporate management has taken over and has changed the account manager roles to making it more of a call center.
bad,Office Depot offers supplies to customers. It is not the most fun work to do. The pay is not the greatest and people are constantly quitting or being fired.
bad,"Regular work day , basically with travel "
bad,"Office Depot is a dead end job. The Retail Sales Associate/Sales Consultant is responsible for engaging and providing an exceptional customer service experience. The associate must quickly build ongoing customer relationships and become a trusted advisor by utilizing advanced selling skills and knowledge (including cross-selling of products and services) to meet the customer’s needs."
bad,"This company could be doing great things if it wasn't trying to 'be' so many different things. Their corporate structure greatly hampers their employees and actively works against a smooth and cooperative company culture; instead of promoting internally, they prefer to hire out positions, leaving employee loyalty unrecognized and unrewarded."
bad,"Hard work, low pay have to deal with all kinds of customers. At times it is managed chaos. You have to deal with the issues as they arise. Working as a team which is required usually gets the job done. Not all customers are satisfied."
bad,"At first, I was rather excited to work at Office Depot; however, less than a few weeks in, I started to realize how lacking they were in professionalism management wise. Work schedules were put out one or two days before that next week started, there were unspoken rules that the employees were never told about until last minute or after one was broken, managers called out employees for their mistakes on the radio ( which every other worker could hear loud and clear ). . . Honestly? The job was subpar, not too difficult, but the management style ( or the lack thereof ) was what drove me away."
bad,"This company is good if its your first job trying to get used to the demands of the working world, though dint expect to move up unless you become close friends with management. I was in the Copy and Print department for 2 years and when the Copy and print supervisor position opened up I was passed over for someone who had almost no experience in the Copy center just because they were friendly with management. It might be a better place to work if you get good managers but don't count on it."
bad,"Change in management over the last 5 years and the direct they want to take the BSD division causes hurdles in keeping customer confidence in the direction of the company. Compensation specifically bonues, aren't always structured fairly due to mistaken and unreasonable revenue and margin quotas for current book of business."
bad,"Topical day at work is ringing up customers items and getting them to sign up for the Office Depot free rewards program, the management was very poor, I felt like I wasn’t welcomed to work there at Office Depot ."
bad,Corporate doesn't seem to know how to grow with the times. They want to push everything they can which is off putting to customers and they don't seem to realize it. You're told to ask for a customer's number for a reward sign up rather than ask if they would want one.
bad,"I have been here a couple years and I have tried to make this store change from soul crushing to inspiring and encouraging. I've given up on the current manager and most others above him. If you work hard and know a little you can move up and get decent raises, but being responsible for your managers mistakes and having to apologize to customers constantly gets old. I don't recommend staying here unless you are soulless or desperate."
bad,"Where to start, constantly changing manager, employee seem to quick like a revolving door. Focuses more of services now since brick and mortar stores are becoming a dying thing."
bad,When I first got hired I was told that I was only going to be driving a forklift but my job also included everything I picked for the night I also had to put everything away in a location where pickers would pick the product to get it ready for shipping and if we where not done by the end of the shift we had to stay over until it was done doesn't matter that I had kids that I had to go home to so the wife could go to work if I had to go I would receive a point even though I finished my shift
bad,"While I cannot speak to every store, my store had a grossly incompetent ""Store Manager"". Had issues with a basic weekly schedule, very hands off style of management and routinely their presence was absent. Job advancement opportunities were always ""soon"" or ""around the corner"" in reality they were very unlikely. Any attempt at recognition felt hollow and insincere."
bad,"The old store manager (when I worked there) was terrible. Literally sat on his phone while I explained to him problems I was having, didn’t say he was gonna do anything about it, and left. I heard they now have a new store manager, so hopefully they are better. The rest of the management is a joke, they’re really only there to override the registers and count the drawers. Which sucks, because all of my other managers were great. Most of my co-workers we’re great (if you’re young like me) and I’m still friends with a lot of them. The worst part is the actual job. Constant stress, customers constantly yelling at me because we are understaffed and I couldn’t finish their orders in time, and they’re all so entitled. No one will help you in copy and print, either, because they know how bad it can get. One of my coworkers wanted to leave and they told her they would give her a 3 cent raise to stay. 3 cents. Also, a month before I left, they lost my check for like 2 weeks. If you’d like to barely be scheduled (part time I got on average about 8-10 hours a week, or 40+, no in between) not listened to about your availability, overworked and underpaid, and treated like dirt, then this is the job for you."
bad,"I started as a first job and it was for students who wanted to work and get its job experience in retail services. I was a deaf and hard of hearing which let me worry about a job opportunities and this job does work their way around the limited communication that i interact with customers or other coworkers. They are ensure to be supportive of it but the only downside was making sure how i communicate to people in order to get effective sign ups , ink subscriptions, and getting tech services. Also, some part of lacking in proper job training ( you must learn as you go) Importantly, they want to get sign ups as a cashier and one must have effective communication which i was working on it . The pay rate was minimum wages and the schedule often up change weekly so you must be responsible to look up your schedule. Other than that, it just a starter job for those who into retailing on office supplies, technologies ( laptop n printers), and printing services. Good Luck :)"
bad,"So I'll follow the recommended platform for giving my opinion on Office Depot and start with my ""typical day at work."""
bad,"Management have no real strategy or ability to develop reps. This is meant to be a sales environment but it is more like a call center. If the company wants to improve their sales, they need to hire sales talent and not call center reps."
bad,"Used to be a very fun company to work at, training is not what it was three years ago.  Stores are not staffed fully, due to restrictions on hours.  They start programs for employee appreciation, and then end them after one month.  Managers are embattled due to upper management and HR not following through."
bad,Struggled when I first started because of lack of training. System was very weak and cooperate always changed things that worked best for employees and customers and just made them harder.
bad,The copy and print department is not an easy position but very safe. There I learned customer service as well to work with different programs. The hardest part was when there were big jobs and nobody there to help you while people were waiting impatiently in line.
bad,"The management wanted to do things in the most inefficient way imaginable, and I don't understand why. Nobody else at the time understood agreed either."
bad,"under staffed, overworked, and than blamed for everything. the company spends too much money chasing quick cash and not building the brand name. no advertisements on new services and a lot of pressure put on the staff when goals are not meet due to no foot traffic. claims to be customer focused but will not try to bring in new customers than complains about sells. also benefits are vary lacking."
bad,"This was my first job as a cashier and I was very nervous. My asking questions or needing help was often met with derisive behaviour from a couple of my supervisors and we were constantly pushed over protection plans and customer surveys. Some supervisors would also just play around on their phones instead of helping us. Particularly during closing duties. "
bad,"El departamento de servicenter en panamá necesita de atención para mejorar el ambienta laboral. Es un departamento que puede dar mucho mas, pero en la balanza trabajo vs beneficio no es equitativa."
bad,This is purely a company of the phrase “boys club”. As a woman you will go nowhere or be told you are too emotional. As a retailer it pays great but the pressure for the management tram to perform is astronomical. Just don’t.
bad,Very stressful job as a manager. Tons of pressure to sell services and get loyalty sign ups and surveys. Corporate generates a schedule for you even though you are the boss and you know who and when to schedule associates for business needs and task.
bad,"se puede conciderar como un trabajo con un salario competitivo, pero solo para los auxiliares ya que en supervisores y otros jefes exigen tiempo adicional sin paga extra para este. El beneficio se ve dirigido solo a la empresa y al nivel gerencial quienes respetan sus horarios de trabajo presumiendo que complen con su trabajo."
bad,"day to day is typically smooth when it comes to assisting customers, products and services easy to pitch with affordability to client.  Management effectively operates and delegates the crew with each shift.  Coworkers are typically the best  of the working environment."
bad,I enjoyed working for this company. They had lots of new projects always popping up. But they had too much need for the techs or engineers to  be traveling out of state with little to no break in between. But overall they were ok. Their management was very poor. The jobs would take longer and customers would be very upset because they did not properly prepare and also management was not available to take care of the day to day items needed to keep the company running smooth.
bad,"Management was awful, but most of the staff were ok, boring at times  as i was performing the same tasks day in day out, very few perks to the job and never any overtime to earn extra money.."
bad,"this was a fun place to work. I think because it was working indoors, and we didn't have to worry about going out in the weather, and that was a big deal with me."
bad,"You're not going to find a lot for me to say about the company that's positive. I find the way it treats its employees and management abhorrent and the scheduling to be abysmal. I've worked plenty of shifts where the store only had the barest coverage and I've had to deal with far too much work for one person. The management at my store was frankly amazing, however. I give props to them for putting up with this company. One person tore their rotator cuff and couldn't get proper worker's comp for a month. Employees are often pressured to sign customers up for services they don't need and overall it's just a powder keg of a business waiting to explode."
bad,"If you do not mind having no outside life and working long hours then this is the place for you. As a full time employee, it is very stressful.   There is not much job satisfaction."
bad,"At this job, I learned that cashier is a very tolerable and productive job. I also did inventory, and stock, while unloading the truck on truck days. I always greeted customers, kindly, respectfully, in a timely manner."
bad,"A typical day is based on helping customers to the fullest and we keep the store in order, stock shelves, etc. when we're not helping them. It showed me that some jobs do not reward how hard you work but rather how much you seem like you're working. The management is split between career workers that know how to do their jobs and new hires with no experience. The hardest part is lifting boxes with desks and large chairs with no help, and the best part is helping people who are nice and genuinely grateful."
bad,"My time at Office Depot was generally ok, but seeing what they do to handle theft left a sour taste in my mouth. Rather than try to get to the bottom of who actually stole from them (which was later found out to be a customer), they just fire their tech employees since they had access to the products."
bad,Office depot is a great place for part time and students. Full time associates are over worked with little praise or compensation. Difficult to maintain a good work life balance.
bad,Manager got fired and ended up getting a new one. Hours kept getting cut and it's not an interesting place to work at all. Previous employees were nice but new manager isn't.
bad,"At times it was a fun place to work at, however the management was lacking in their role. They barely helped when needed during busy times, as they just stood around talking to one another."
bad,"Working at Office Depot feels like a full-time job even if your not full-time. Some of the Part-timers work 5 days a week sometimes just for 3-4 hours where the very few Full-timers work under somewhere in-between 31-37 hours. the location i work at has so little pay roll we can not hire enough employees to actually keep the store up to par and that results in employees being caught up at the register or in the copy center and unable to assist or help customers on the sales floor.   Its a horrible feeling when your doing the best you can to do your job but you are unable to do it due to not having enough people on staff. As the only technician, most of the time I cant even get my work or assist my customers due to the fact we will have no one on register, or in the furniture section. Being full time comes with benefits but with the pay grade and hours it honestly feels like you cant take full advantage of them. Job security is good, but is not something to want to stay in unless you attempt on climbing to management."
bad,The ordering system was so out dated that you could not tell if you getting an order for a customer or not if it showed up great if not order it again. Out of stocks were all ways out of stock. Sale items were never enough we would get like 2.
bad,"I enjoyed working with others. I seemed to be singled out sometimes by the manager, who no longer works with the company. I learned the functions of different departments in the store, which help me become more flexible in the company."
bad,Siempre nos ayudábamos para hacer un mejor trabajo todos nos involucrábamos
bad,Muchas envidias y trabas para crcer aparte muy mal trato de los gerentes
bad,un métier pour paresseux. la vente de fourniture de bureau est un métier de zombie.
bad,"Office Max was my first job, and at the beginning it wasn't that bad. But as time went on, things got worse. During back to school, its hectic and ridiculous, but any other time of the year, payroll is AWFUL. You will work one day weeks as a part-time for months on end.The pay is so minimal, and raises are sparse. I have worked for the company for nearly three years and I have made a whopping dollar raise from starting at minimum wage. I have awesome management, but the culture of the company itself is not great. The customers usually suck, and the company pushes the ""customer is always right"" campaign, which just leads to associates being treated poorly all the time. You are expected to learn and achieve very high standards of work for very little pay. The only good thing, which isn't even on the company, was that my manager worked around my college schedule and my coworkers were awesome (but this definitely isn't the case at every store, I promise). Other then that, not worth it. Work literally anywhere else."
bad,While there is chance for advancement burnout typically happens far before then. This company is constantly changing and does not know its true identity.
bad,"I was part of OfficeMax when they merged with Office Depot to become one company. The merger, although publicized as ""equal"", seemed shaped toward Office Depot: their technology, processes, policies, and a clear focus on retaining their/Depot employees (Management/Executive Level especially). The three years after this merger were very challenging as I witnessed the organization lay off good talent and/or watched peers I respected leave the company on their own. This reduction in employees taxed those who remained: our resources, ability to meet-achieve-surpass company set performance goals, our happiness in the workplace, etc. I had great admiration for OfficeMax and really enjoyed my time with the company. Perhaps Office Depot was different pre-merger, but my post-merger experiences with Office Depot Inc. were not enjoyable."
bad,"I was an Assistant Manager at Office Max. I could have/should have reported the General manager for harassment, but I was too afraid to. I was constantly disrespected in front of other associates."
bad,"I worked for Office Depot/Max during the time they merged.  Many top talented managers were laid off.  When the proposed merger with Staples occurred, more talent voluntarily left, leaving entire districts with associates poorly trained as the knowledge pool shrank.  Combine this issue with overall staffing hour cuts at the store level it lead to a very stressful environment as they tried to do more with less.  You can only cut so much before you bleed, and this company, at least when I left in the Colorado metro market, was bleeding heavily."
bad,"While I was working there I was not too fond of the managers or environment however they have changed the manager and a lot of people were let go, but I think it is a good job and after a year the pay goes up."
bad,"I wont regret working for Office Depot. They have offered me alot when it comes to my graphic experience."
bad,The job was pretty good in understanding my need for additional work hours.  The job taught me to be able to build rapport with my customers so that they would have the potential to return.
bad,I managed the entire operation from start to finish. I hired and trained and built sales in the store through community involvement and a passion for my people.
bad,"enjoyed  working there until the merge with office max,  things just slowly went south after that.  Store manager is wonderful to work for.  Hard to understand how someone can be loyal for 18 years, and in a flash you are out the door"
bad,Management was actually fine until said manager was replaced with another manager who was stiff and distant.Before that it was a decent job as a it consultant I usually help maintain my section of the store as well as work with other co-workers to ensure people who shopped were satisfied with their experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers looking for their ideal item or solutions to their technical problems. The hardest part of the job was dealing with fellow IT workers in managing with others workload when fixing computers or dealing what was wrong with their machines.
bad,They have a rather high opinion of themselves and were more concerned about their own selfish individual goals then their customers and employees and getting sales done. Management Mickey Mouse Style and treated you like a Junior High Student. Underlying deception there with poor leadership.
bad,"OfficeMax was the third in a 3 dog race, so was aggressive in trying to gain share.  There was a fast paced atmosphere and they liked to try new things."
bad,"This may be the case for all retail establishments, but corporate consistently created unrealistic expectations and timelines, forcing underpaid associates and management to struggle to achieve success every day, every week, of every year."
bad,Not a good place to work. Management is awful. Never know what your job actually details from moment to moment. Always trying to figure out what is going on.
bad,good work life balance but there is little to no advancement in the work life and the pay could be better but as a first job its alright but overall would not recommend
bad,"Office Depot hours of operation depending on your department can wave up or down.."
bad,"It was a great place to work and was a moment that really want me to put myself to be in the seminary for study."
bad,It is a good place to work if you are just getting started in retail.  After years with the company I realize it is time to move to a company that values their employees a little more.
bad,Downsizing to save a failing company in such a haphazard way ruined many many lives.  That being said they did their best on a store level to support the transition.
bad,office depot is a store. it has office stuff. did you know that your item qualifies for square trade. square trade will protect your purchase for two years
bad,"Management de 25 plateformes de livraison et montages de meubles"
bad,"Job is very easy and I have learned a lot from my time here. Job advancement is not very good and management positions are like a revolving door, micromanaging like crazy."
bad,"Management team seemed more interested in reaching retirement than day-to-day operations of an office supply/technology store."
bad,"This was my first retail job. It was pretty much slow paced. I learned how to work different office equipment, especially copy equipment. The management was great."
bad,"horrible place to work at, a lot of forklift and employee accident due to the fast pace cut throat environment, management were nice people and employees were nice to work with but the overall environment has horrible."
bad,"Stock shelves, plan day, cover breaks, help customers."
bad,"short contract, minimal room to advance, merger killed any idea of possibly being hired as FTE, management didn't pull strings, upper managers made any and all decisions on who to keep and not keep even if they had no idea who you are!"
bad,"Office Depot was an OK entry level job. The management team wasn't on the same page in regards to fairness. People were clearly favored, causing others to have more work requirements than others."
bad,"Perfect place for an inexperienced professional to develop skills, but burnout is likely to occur if you stick around too long. Furthermore, long hours and below average pay, but swell people to work with."
bad,Employee's do have team work. Main supervisor not fit for position total jerk! No room for advancement. They get in huddles and talk behind your back.
bad,"A typical work day: Whenever help is needed upper management will never step up or in to assist. They will sit back and watch you drown. When its time for your lunch there is NO coverage."
bad,Soon as you walk in you already feel depressed and want to go home. Management treated me like I'm their slave and never had a nice word to say.
bad,No Comment.  Since the Office Max - Office Depot merger a day in this life has been filled with a lot of surprises and disappointments.  The company seems to be struggling to keep it's head above water.
bad,Good learning and work experience. Learned how to work with tight deadlines and good customer service skills. Learned valuable sales techniques.
bad,"Typical warehouse work. "
bad,Gained very useful experience in computer repair. I also worked in the Copy & Print center and attained great experience in small scale print production. Management was not very attentive or very good at training employees.
bad,"Would be happy to discuss in person. After 8 years between OfficeMax and now Office Depot Inc., my job is no longer enjoyable."
bad,"This company really isn't the greatest to work for, it treats its employees like garbage as well as hiring terrible managers. The communication between management and employees is lacking and the employees who work with them don't want to be at work."
bad,"Company is on its way out, if your looking to grow it is not the place to did it very political.The days work is for the most part very easy, the sale drive is somewhat unreasonable."
bad,"If you work on a good team that care about each other with inspiring managers, Office Depot is fine to work for. However; the majority of teams around the organization do not care about their employees and do not want to see them advance in their careers. People are expendable and are easily replaceable instead of trying to retain."
bad,"The best way that I can describe the corporate culture of Office Max/Depot is apathy with a strong sense of self preservation. In my 2+ years spent in Naperville, the management in my area of responsibility was virtually nonexistent. No permanent decision could be made on where the responsibility of this department should reside within the company structure and the divisional merchandise manager was changed every 4 to 6 months. Employees worked from home whenever the urge struck them and there were no performance evaluations held to determine acceptable behavior or goals. "
bad,"They worked very well with my school schedule and personal schedule."
bad,"fairly busy, almost always in stock of what was needed. management was fairly decent."
bad,"A typical day at Office Depot is receiving the truck early in the morning and putting the merchandise on shelves before the customers come in to shop. working at office depot I get the chance to use new technology products and learn how they work before I can sale them to customers."
bad,A typical day is to create a exceptional customer experience for all customers.
bad,Typical retail day. Learned that not all large organizations pay appropriately. My Store manager was poor and above him nobody was interested in regular employees. hardest part of the job was low pay and not enough training. Best part was helping customers.
bad,"The people in my store were mostly college part-time employees, so co-worker relationships were good, but management wasn't the best. Often got conflicting instructions from managers, and there is still some occasional drama between managers."
bad,"I was at Office Depot for about a year and only made minimum wage. I was knowledgeable in every area of the store, had decent sales, was the only one who knew everything about the Copy Center and I even knew how to do things management did not. When I asked for a raise multiple times I was told, ""not yet but soon."" Eventually I got fed up with doing everyone's job for them for the least amount of pay so I turned in my two weeks. That was when my manager decided to offer me a raise. However, it was exactly what I'd be starting at in my new job."
bad,Good Co-Workers
bad,A typical day for me working at Office Depot was being at work 8 hours sometimes more. Dealing with office supplies and equipment. I learned alot about different eletronics and being as though that i worked the front end i learned alot about handling customers and different forms cash handling. My coworkers were great at helping out and my manager was very hands on because Office Depot is very competitive.The hardest part about working there was leaving because i grew very close to the employees
bad,"Management was always breathing down your neck. However, they had good incentive programs as far doing up sells."
bad,"Typical Day at work consist of providing customer service, performing cashier duties, obtaining customer orders and performing consultative selling to customers. Working here the management wasn't bad they just never really made clear what they were expecting of you. I learned how appearance matters when presenting things in the business world."
bad,Have a lot of different things for employees. Perfect attendance bonuses. Quarterly bonus. Need to get some more newer equipment. Do a lot of good things for the employees. Need to definitely fine tune somethings and make some other changes to work description
bad,"Lack of teamwork"
bad,"Office depot/Office max can be a fun place to work. Depending on the team you have, including upper management, it can be an inclusive and fun place to work with trust in your peers. Other stores however, are not the same. Again, depending on the team you have, including upper management, it can really be more difficult to find the motivation to come to work. Office max is a company that does not get as much business as it used to in the past so most days at work are very slow. The busiest part of the business is the print department,which often needs more people than are staffed to run efficiently and timely."
bad,"Never have i met so many managers who feign priority of customer satisfaction only to treat their staff like garbage and deride them. While the job wasn't too difficult and i was paid well, the ethics of my store were incredibly poor and so was morale."
bad,ok job. you  don't work weekends pay stay close to the same for years. easy job. supervisor friendly and will work with you.lots of lazy people. schedule mid shift
bad,It’s an okay place to be. The company has seen better days with better management. Many employees have also expressed their distaste for the company’s position right now.
bad,That can stop treating their workers like they ain't important. They need to pay their associates for their skills and not what they think their worth cause then they might get better workers and there won't be such a high turnover.
bad,wasnt the best job but is a great job if you just need something part time. the company and management have always been easy going and truly care about employees. not theplace i recommend if you actually need money for bills
bad,"Working shipping you make the most money starting out but it's not worth the hours. You work till finished, no set hours unless you're part time. The manager doesn't know much of anything about his job duties also doesn't care about much either. The employees there don't really have a good work ethic and are lazy"
bad,"Corporate constantly adding more responsibilities and more things do push without making those things worth pushing. Offers commissions bonus on certain items but takes forever to payout. Not enough payroll so constantly understaffed, new hires don't stick around because there's too much expectations for a new part time and the training sucks."
bad,They do not care about their employees .............is not a good.place to work . They push the ones that actually worl to their breaking point. And the lazy workers get away with everything.
bad,"As a customer service manager I take care of customer complaints, oversee the print department,  Recommend products to customers, run a cash register.  Balance the registers at the end of the evening and deposit the cash and checks.  "
bad,"I left OD over 10 years  ago. I was there a couple of years and moved up from tech sales to assistant manager in that time, but I had to relocate to make that happen. Otherwise promotion and salary seemed very stagnant. Senior management was unrealistic and the district managers and corporate never backed the employees. I would never take any sales position with this company."
bad,never go in as a manager. i did not learn anything from the general manager. they expect you to know everything going in. i had to learn everything on my own.
bad,I believe that the summary of this review says it all. I chose to work at ODOM within the copy & print department because technology hasn't developed to a stage where robots can easily do it. I left ODOM mainly because the pay and benefits were terrible and stagnate.
bad,"Boring job, no job advancement opportunities, minimum wage but work very hard. Good job if your need one immediately they hire quickly. The community was very distant"
bad,This job was more of a stepping stone. It was a fast paced environment and could be stressful at time. The training program was sub-par and no real room for advancement.
bad,"Upper management gives lower volume stores less payroll, while expecting employees to fill multiple roles, while not getting paid enough, and still gets upset when things inevitably end up unfinished."
bad,"One of my first jobs starting out. Moved up quickly at first, but then hit a wall at full time management level. Most stay in my position for 5-10 years. Pitiful salary raises outside of promotions makes it really feel like you're stagnating (I got less than $1 in the span of 5 years, not counting promotions). Corporate level drops new and poorly planned products, service, and programs on already over-worked staff, and expect results immediately. "
bad,The pay isn't equal to the job you are asked to perform. It would still be a decent place to work if we had decent management. The assistant manager is great and tries hard to keep us all in good spirits as we deal with the day to day bs.
bad,They was many favoritism in the company. I would go in at 7 am in load the trailers and stock the  selves of merchandise and make sure over stock were properly put away.
bad,Work day involves too many tasks with limited resources to handle the high traffic demands of the locations. Too many reports and paper work. Do not recommend
bad,"Manger on duty 6-7 hours a day. "
bad,"This company relocated jobs overseas. I will not review this company as there are no job opportunities in the area to support this company. If they were to come back to the area, job openings would not be filled by previous employees."
bad,"First and foremost I believe work is what you make it. Generally a strong work ethic and accountability go far in a career."
bad,Office Depot is where you work while waiting for a better job to call you. Their idea of customer service  is to annoy the customer as much as you possibly can.
bad,I had to stop working there because they could not work with my class schedule. They would schedule me in the morning and keep me an hour over in the afternoon; example 8am-4pm instead of 8am-3pm. Thus I left early and was constantly berated for leaving on time based on when I was scheduled.
bad,"It basically set my career back.  Management is delusional, goals are unrealistic, and the  KPIs put most of the center on plans.  It's a dying model and it seems that management is the last one to get the joke."
bad,"store manager and district manager presented information to staff that was different from the hq conference calls that I sat in on"
bad,"Management Great, Job is fun good for high school or college student, doesn't pay well not enough hours if you need stability this job not for you.."
bad,Everyone needs to be a team player but working with customer service was very difficult.  All the employees were very friendly with a happy go lucky attitude.  Things got done in a timely manner but Management seemed they didn't have that team player attitude.  Customers that enjoyed their service was all ways returning to a Sales Associate that they had interacted in past visits.
bad,Poor upper management but good culture. Low pay but good work life balance. Messy store layouts and difficult merge with Home Depot.
bad,Work is not hard only downside is that its part time. So if you have bills to pay you will need another job. The hours can drag sometimes only because the work is coming in slowly but that's because you don't get a lot of hours to beginning so they push the work out slower. Which  might give you an extra 30 minutes but your pick rate will go down. The job is fine if just don't want to sit at home but not a career move for a Full time college student with Full time bills.
bad,okay employer great pay excellent diversity and work ethics and I would recommend if ever needing new employment it the Corporate Retail arena
bad,"I can pretty much tell you that there is nothing in that store that the Operations Manager is NOT a part of.  Everything in that store is yours from employee training, to shrink, to D&D, to receiving, to cash office, to schedules, to customer satisfaction, to reports, and much more.  Operations Managers in this company pretty much run the store, manage the paperwork, and manage the management team and are accountable for all results in the store."
bad,"In retail, there are better places to be. There's no real employee incentives as far as a discount program. Senior management is nonexistent until something goes wrong."
bad,"Completed associate work schedules, customer, replenished sales floor customer service and cash handling for registers"
bad,get out.  stay away.  specialty retail is a contracting sector and will go the way of the book stores...
bad,"Usual work early mornings, opening with different members of management. Management not always willing to help. Wasn't properly trained, had to learn much on my own. Very short-staffed, not many new hires at all. Hardest part is working freight out to the floor by myself and being expected to finish it all, plus fill any outs we have before my shift ends."
bad,"The typical day at office depot revolves around taking care of the customer no matter what to ensure repeat business. It is a great place to learn about many different things: computers, technology, office supplies, furniture, inventory, retail, purchasing trends, ect. The management however uses bullying tactics to get the most out of everyone performance wise. Now this is effective however it makes it a miserable place to work. Co-workers are nice and friendly and willing to help. The hardest part of the job is the upper management, work/life balance, and a clear understanding of how to help every customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the amazing people who walk into the store and the benefits. Office Depot has a tuition reimbursement program however management is rarely able to take advantage of this program and upper management holds what you want over your head just out of grasp."
bad,I loved working at the Copy Print Center and being a cashier there as well. I did not like how the management were towards their workers. It was also well known that there was NO room for advancement.
bad,I can honestly say that 90% of my coworkers are very intelligent and good at their jobs. I could not say that at most places (unfortunately).
bad,"not accommodating when i became pregnant"
bad,"I worked in the technology department of an Office Depot store to earn additional money while I was taking college classes. While at work I was expected to keep the technology area of the store clean, and organized, and to stock shelves, and set pricing, as well as sell products to customers. Namely my focus with sales was laptop computers, desktop computers, and computer printers, although I was expected to have a general knowledge of everything in my department. My managers were very good at letting me know what was expected of me. Though there was a high turnover rate in management, and I could come in one day with a new set of managers who didn't know who I was. I relied heavily on my co-workers to know what was needed in our department. I believe we were all part-time. There was no one in the store that was the real organizer of that department, so we had to come to an agreement about how certain things were going to work, and the way in which we would go about delegating responsibilities. The most difficult thing about this job was balancing school-work with working in the store. I was always scheduled more than I requested, and would have to make a point of letting my managers know that while I could work that schedule for a short time my hours would need to be truncated so that I could focus on my studies. One week was inventory week, and I counted the store with one of my managers at night. We would show up as the store was closing every day for a week, and we counted the entire store. I enjoyed this meticulous work, and working as a small team. There was another time"
bad,Office Depot offers great pay and benefits. I enjoy helping customers and teaching new employess about customer service.
bad,"La parte mas dificil, es cuando...no tienen tiempo de capacitarte bien."
bad,"I was a Client Engagement Supervisor(Customer Service Manager)"
bad,"It really depends on the location you are at. Some stores have entirely different culture than others. I think most stores have relaxed employee relations. However managers can be very micro managerial but understandably so; the company is not doing well and there is a lot of pressure to perform miracles. Most stores are unfortunately extremely hot and corporate doesn't seem to care unless enough customers complain. A lot of middle age people and elders shop here, so if you have little patience with that demographic this place isn't for you."
bad,"Alot of favoritism, gossip, but alot of learning opprotunities. Just wasnt a professional enough work environment for me. The overhead too stock wasnt very safe, overstock seemed like it could fall on customers or workers who would try and get anything in the cabinets. A new stocking method needs to be made."
bad,"I'm working with office depot but at the same time working like manny and houseman."
bad,"Training is primarily done on computer, once that training is complete the perception is you know enough to help anyone who walks through the door. You do 2 - 3 peoples jobs throughout the day and get paid below livable standards."
bad,"I was originally hired for one thing which was their designer for their pamphlets and whatnot, but even after i signed all of my papers with that title, they ended up putting me as their cashier. I was not happy."
bad,"En toda mi estadía el area de Gerencia era grosera hacia con sus empleados, generando hostilidad y mal ambiente laboral. Movían los horarios a su antojo y disponían de tu tiempo como si no valiera nada. Te hacían hacer de todo porque ""hacia falta personal"" y al final, cuando necesité referencias para otro empleo hablaron pestes de mi. Horrible lugar."
bad,"Daily operations of a store manager. open & close store, cash balancing, inventory control & employee relations. Update & balance payroll hours for 3 managers and approx 20 full and part time employees."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the daily interaction with great people. Store atmosphere is wonderful. Long term customers enjoy coming in and know that the staff will take care of them. May customers know the employees by name.
bad,Your job is threatened everyday. The company is in transition and they are expecting that firing everyone or at least having everyone come to work everyday feeling like their about to get fired is the key to their success.
bad,"I worked at the Morrisville, NC location and I loved it. There were moments I clashed with management but we resolved the issues. Then management switched and everything became hectic and chaotic far worse than before. There is only 1 manager that could've kept me at the store and that I didn't mind coming in on my days off for. She made working there fun, bearable, and almost easy. The new manager switched my shift with a coworker and hadn't discussed it with me AFTER telling me I would keep the same 2 says and same hours, he also put it in writing and had it sent to social service for me. After that it basically seemed like I was doing no calls no shows because I didn't know he changed my schedule. Before I left I was 9 months pregnant and waiting to be transferred I was told by him that he would contact the store near my new location (Myrtle Beach, SC) and let the manager know I was seeking employment. He forgot, I called him back and then he told me he would not recommend me to work for them and that I quit the store and would not be transferred anywhere. I also didn't know they don't have maternity leave plans for part time employees which is sucky. Part time workers work just as hard if not harder than some full time workers."
bad,It was an excellent first job for me; I gained the customer service and retail skills I felt I needed. Consistently understaffed. Management was fine. I enjoyed helping customers with what they needed.
bad,Was a decent job to work at but everything had changed when a new manager had took over the store. Fast pased.  Loved working with my fellow coworkers that helped keep the day going good.
bad,"typical work day consisted of assisting customers with office supply needs and selling services to customers that would benefit from said services. Also ad/planogram set, logistics and cleaning the store when needed."
bad,"Office Max is an ok job for people either in highschool or fresh out of highschool. Management is poor and of very little help. I do not reccomend working here if you are actually trying to make money. They will hire you for full time, but you will never get over 30 hours a week."
bad,"My first year with Office Depot was a great feeling.  I FELT needed and accepted.  I and my fellow could employees find their confidence in each other and push to get the job done.  Then the head management of the store changed, along with a number of company policies I don't agree with and have no say over.  I feel my departure is overdue."
bad,"Due to recent changes in the allowed hours, I have gone from working 30-36 hours a week down to 6-12. It's unacceptable. I was hired to work over 30 hours and I haven't received them in 2 weeks now. There's nothing the store's managers can do since it was a corporate decision."
bad,Very tedious work but will learn quite a bit about customer service as they are very heavily invested in their customer service aspect. Not extremely stimulating but you get different departments to rotate to so things are not always stagnant.
bad,looked for something different i didn't like the mangmentthey had there not good customer service really didn't tell the employes they wear doing a good job
bad,"The job is a job at the end of the day to me it is not a work friendly environment. the pay rate that you are gave is not what you will receive. I say a good 90% percent of the people don't even work in there ""supposedly assigned area"" this company is the devils play ground i wouldn't breath a word that i worked for this cooperate everything is upside down."
bad,"Horrible turnover"
bad,"The management at my particular store does not show respect to its employees. I've been working there for almost 3 years and I am not given the respect I deserve as a reliable, hardworking employee. I can do almost every task in the store and I am only paid 50 cents more than the high school aged cashiers. The management here makes it difficult to want to be there. You get blamed for your superior's shortcomings, and when customers get upset over company policy, the management does not defend you or apologize to you after the customer is gone. Instead, they make you feel as if you've done everything wrong."
bad,"The corporate office adds too many programs to boost sales, causes stores to focus too much on the technicalities than actual service. Working in copy center you have to deal with old equipment that is serviced rarely and odds are you'll have to figure out a special way to do a lot of things."
bad,"Management is okay, some better than others. VERY flexible on hours and availability which is nice. Pay is awful, not worth it to me. It is an easy job though, all you have to do is know how to work a register and have good customer service. Best part of the job was the flexibility of hours. Worst part of the job is the gender inequality and unfair and unequal pay."
bad,"I was an assistant in the print and copying area. It was hard to get any structure in the department when you had no support from the manager. Training was difficult because it had to be done online so it was hard to find time for employees. I had no say in anything, even though I was the manager"
bad,"After the failed merger with Staples, the company has gone downhill. Turnover is very high, they don't seem to care about retaining good employees, only replacing them when they get fed up with the horrible systems and excessive work loads with little promise of compensation increases. When I left, out of the 8 people on my team, 5 had been there less than a year. "
bad,"Nobody ever wants to be here and it shows. It drags on you, feeling the weight of their misery every day. You could call out pretty much once a week though and never get fired."
bad,"I do not recommend working at OfficeMax. The management is uncoordinated and unorganized, there is minimal room for advancement, and you rarely get a raise. There isn't ever very many customers in the store so often you are just standing around waiting for something to do."
bad,"Some departments were quite dysfunctional, while others were not. I  worked in a dysfunctional one and found the experience miserable. Too much middle management, too many meetings, redundant work, long hours working on presentations that ended up in the garbage. I've since heard the environment has improved."
bad,A typical day at work has me interacting with 50 plus customers directly and another 75+ through other associates.  I handle all complaints and special customer Inquiries.  I keep track of attendance and payroll.  As part of management I help to plan out the projects for the day.  The hardest part of the job is handling customer issues that are not caused by the store but by a third party and trying to make everything right in a timely manner.  My most enjoyable part is when I get to work with long time customers that I have been able to have personal as well as business conversations with.
bad,"A typical  work day starts with punching a time card at 8am followed by the morning sales meeting.  The day then consists of maintaining existing accounts with superb customer service and continuous upselling/cross selling.  Depending on the department you get chosen for (you don't get to choose), your duties vary greatly.  People have been there for over 4 years without a promotion and the pay is pretty low.  If you want a strict 8-5 job then it's a good fit for you, but if you want a challenging career with higher expectations of yourself....then it's probably not going to be a fit."
bad,"This a great place to learn inventory management when you consider they carry thousands of products, my only concern is the competitive advantage."
bad,I liked the job that I did. I enjoyed my co-workers. We had fun together. I learned to be quick with counting the money for deposit. My job was not hard at all. Easy to learn and perform.
bad,"Associate and management are great to work with, however the higher you progress in the company the more you understand why the company will not be around for very long. They focus on the wrong issues and can't innovate fast enough."
bad,"travail stressant et mauvais environnement, mauvaise ambiance."
bad,Stock shelves and help customers with any questions and run the cash register and keep store clean and pull orders and organize back room with all over stock items
bad,Not the best place to work if you have a family the work load is huge with not a lot of employees. Sometimes you’re working 7days a week straight. On your feet all day
bad,L'entreprise s'est dégradée d'années en années. Rien n'est mis en place pour le bien être des employés afin de travailler dans de bonnes conditions.
bad,"Buen sueldo, buenas prestaciones, pero un habiente laboral muy tóxico, estresante y lleno de problemas personales entre departamentos. "
bad,I hated this job because the team I was working with in a satellite area was one in the graveyard and two a lot of the employees were not fit for the job.
bad,"Was a good foot in the door, however the poor management and their terrible interpersonal skill left the experience dulled, some of the co-workers i had made the experience bearable for the time but eventually the rudeness reached its peak and i couldn't stay."
bad,"When I worked at office depot the management was absolutely atrocious, the schedule was always all over the place, there was constant yelling and an expectation for employees to complete manger level tasks that we did not have clearance to complete."
bad,"This business may be perfect for the high school kid who is looking for a part time job. However, not if you are a manager with an established company. District leadership often sends out conflicting orders, you have zero authority over your own business. When you try and truly manage your business for the needs of the customer to make positive impacts on your bottom line, your overridden. Instead of focusing on your business needs and on the customer, you have to be on the floor because your hours keep getting cut. If you are in the interview process, get it all in writing. You will be promised one thing then presented another. My advise, stay clear."
bad,"My experience with the company was OK, to say the least. The positives are that everyone works together as a team, the pay is nice, it's fairly easy to move up in the company, and the hours are flexible. The negative comes in for me at my previous location in the issue of being understaffed. I was one of three print specialists at my location and I would work the entire shift with little to no help because managers were always running around the store (as they should), and the other employees weren't really cross-trained. Another thing I do not like is the ""customer is always right"" aspect. There was a situation at my location where I had a customer lie to my manager about the amount of time she spent at the store and how I had been speaking to her. I had a conversation with my manager about the situation a day later- she watched the tape and saw that the customer spent less time at the store than she said she did. Literally 2 days later the very same customer was coming back to receive a $10 gift card from the company as a ""We're sorry that happened"" kind of thing so it doesn't look bad on management & the company. I quit after I saw how disloyal management had been, I gave this company a year of my valuable time, filling in for other employees and I was offered a management position. Yea, no thanks. I'd rather not be apart of a company who smiles in your face to turn around & hand out gift cards to liars. This job was very stressful with understaffing and I really don't see how I lasted a year there."
bad,bad company to work for they do not care about you. the hours are long and the the pay is blow par. they expect you to do everything yourself and unless its back to school. the help is zero
bad,"Worst plAsces to work , I Absolutky haTed everything About it . MAnaGEMENT WAs horrible , barely got decent hours , manager aT the Time shooed pure favoritism ."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job if you are going there to get tech experience. When I worked there as a Tech Specialist I was working in furniture and sold more furniture that anyone else.
bad,"I am a part time cashier. I work my butt off doing my job and some other employees jobs. I've been there a little over a year applied for internal key carrier manager gave it to someone that's been there just over 2 months. I'm the only one that cleans the bathrooms, yes as a cashier your job includes cleaning the bathrooms, even the men's. I've had a homeless drug addict pop out at me after we've closed from in the women's bathroom, in the handicap stall wearing.... only his underwear and he was only walked out by a manager. I had to leave the state because my mom's twin died unexpectedly, yup got two unexcused absences and due to my other marks...these might be last ones. I don't see why I should get unexcused absences for this when it wasn't planned and it's part of life and my manager should be all hey I get it it's life I'll be nice and give you a break give you personal time or something..but nope. This is working at Office Depot."
bad,"Its a nice place to work but only because my specific store is full of good people. Most of the managers are compitent and the coworkers are fun to be around. If not for those two aspects, it would be a horrible job. The executives have no idea what the employees need to be efficient and frequently interfere and over complicate things. They are fsr more interested in money than anyones happiness."
bad,They don’t care to much about people and it’s all about the dollar but it is a business so what do you expect. When it’s not yours you do what you’re told weather you like it or not.
bad,"You get what you expect, a low pay  for doing a lot of work. Customer interactions can be fun depending on the area you work, but you never get paid enough for the amount of work you do (which is typical for any minimum wage job)."
bad,"Despite the low pay, the main reason why I left this company was because of the store manager.  She was condescending, rude, and didn't value her employees."
bad,"Some managers are good to work with it depends on the store manager that you end up getting. "
bad,"Typical workday is on the phone or internet emailing prospects, scheduling appointments, managing accounts, and prospecting for new business/customers"
bad,"I was the sales consultant in technology. I was also ordered to follow likely thieves and try to prevent them from shoplifting. One incident, 3 likely thieves entered the store, assaulted 2 co-workers with a weapon as they made their way to the door and they left. I have a medical condition and was intimidated by this incident. I asked the manager if security would be provided to protect employees & customers, the response was ""No"" I resigned at that point, I wasn't assured of any security or safety for myself or co-workers."
bad,"With merger was a stressful environment. "
bad,"I worked in the Copy and Print department of Office Depot, and there was never a slow day."
bad,great for young students that like to keep themselves busy. The job made me work more than it paid me and I wasn't able to grow as much as I wanted. I didn't have many opportunities to grow.
bad,"Poor management, real unprofessional. It seemed to me like the would just hire anyone to run there company. Wouldn’t recommend no one to work there at all."
bad,"Only two shifts available, 1st and 2nd. Turnover rate is slightly high and there is a lack of staffing. Also very difficult to find people for second shift."
bad,"If you are wanting to work in a relaxed customer service atmosphere, and want to get paid minimum wage, then this is the job you want. There is room for advancement."
bad,easy job but if your looking for advancement or low of hours you want get them there.to may bosses telling you what to do.you start with a lot of hours then they start taking them away.
bad,"Every person who works for this company is undervalued. Associates AND management are held to unrealistic numbers and goals, and going the extra mile is something that is hardly recognized and never rewarded. They will take advantage of you if you allow them to."
bad,"Office Depot cares less about it's people than any place that I have worked. Management is awful. Any input or concern of an employee is completely dismissed. In addition, after an injury requiring surgery, I was treated extremely poor. Individual employees are singled out based on the mood of their supervisor.  It really is a shame. It could be a really good place to work. The vast majority of the employees are great, friendly and hard working people. Far better than management deserves. The benefits and the pay is good, but it comes at a cost."
bad,work is ok some work more than others if you are fast you move to another section to pick up the slack if you slack some one will come and do your job
bad,"First thing I noticed about the store I worked in was how filthy it was. Doors, floors, shelves, carpet, bathrooms, breakroom is very dirty. Also, the place is very understaffed which makes it difficult to learn new areas of the store such as sales floor, printing or anything else. Manager is cool but relaxed. Customers are always confused about the rewards program and I don't blame them. Considering the demographic that shops there and how many accounts are messed up - it makes it difficult to want to sign up new customers."
bad,My time here was well worth it. I learned necessary skills to assist me in future experiences. The atmosphere was a comfortable one from co-workers to upper management.
bad,"I didn't stay at this company very long. After getting hired for a forklift operator position, they put me in a different department and didn't certify me on any machinery and refused to every time I brought it up. I was very unsatisfied with management. Other associates I worked with told me that they had been waiting to get certified on the warehouse equipment for over 6 months."
bad,the pay for the position I had was not up to par. Too much work for too little pay. The benefits weren't all that great either. These companies don't pay enough to do the jobs they ask of you.
bad,"Following the established sorting and stocking guidelines. Answering customer phone calls regarding questions and giving accurate answers or solving solutions. Receive, open, unpack and issue sales floor merchandise. Ensure the freight sorting area is organized and matches the approved ""blue print”. Processes inventory, and proactively investigates and corrects any issues or discrepancies."
bad,I use to patrol the store to make sure no merchandise was stolen and monitor front door and exits check receipt and log in log book and monitor security cameras
bad,"It's a call center not a sales organization. The ONLY KPI's are dials and talk time. Sales Managers could care less about actual sales, sales attainment, or what you have in the pipeline."
bad,"Lots of change, typical day is plugging away at hitting margins and sales. Co-workers make the environment happy and helpful. Salesforce and social skills is highly important."
bad,There wasn't enough to do. I like to stay busy and there will be times where we wouldn't have any customers at all. There would be nothing at all to do and I really didn't like to stand around and wait for there to be something to do.
bad,I didn't really like the hot work environment it made it difficult to work. Also we had beginner management which made things unorganized. if these things were fixed I would definitely go back to work at the office depot warehouse.
bad,"Working here was overall pretty difficult. The hours were very limited. I worked between 8-14 hours a week here. Although the job was good, it wasn't worth it for minimum wage."
bad,"Retail, restocking shelves + go backs worked alone but was very productive and moved at a good pace even when business is slow"
bad,Very demanding job physically and mentally. Hard to find employees that will stay long term. Overall not a bad place to work.
bad,"At the E. State location the print center sees 400% of the work volume of other stores, with 20% more funding. The work is stressful, the supervision is under qualified, and knowledge about printing or computer programs isn't as required as it should be. "
bad,Its an easy job but you never know when your getting off. If something should happen to break down you can possibly be at work longer hours because everything must get done in that day.
bad,Office Depot has been going through a series of mergers and a culture change that lacks direction and any form of formal guidelines to cascade information down the pipeline. Several new policies were first heard from the DM and above on store visits which gave no time to properly prepare for monthly visits.
bad,"The managers often ridicule over the smallest tasks. This is a job where you are hired and paid as a cashier, but are required to do all jobs from stocking and receiving to cleaning the toilets!"
bad,"The company just announced another upcoming merger, so there is a lot of uncertainty over the future. I greatly enjoy all of the people I work with and the company is doing a great job hitting synergy targets."
bad,"I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers there. Management was not very appreciative of their employees, however."
bad,"Pro:"
bad,"The other employees are enjoyable to be around, however, the management is not so great. Upon being hired, I received no training or orientation, so it was quite hard to adjust to the job. Also, the environment can be very stressful. It is hectic and customers demand a lot from the employees.Often times if we cannot do something a customer immediately wants to speak to a manager. This makes you look bad in the manager's eyes, but there is no avoiding it. There are also several regular customers that come in, but they are not all that friendly. The scheduling is also wacky. There have been times where I have been scheduled for two hours in the morning and then have to come back six hours later (the same day) to work a three hour shift."
bad,Company doesn't take of care of the employees like other retail companies.
bad,Office Depot has provided me with a great growth opportunity.
bad,"Assist customers with checkouts and returns of merchandise. Having great customer service behind the counter and on the floor, such as phone calls and stocking inventory."
bad,The pay and benefit is great but the employees that you work with including the manager are very disrespectful and you have to be on their #1 list!
bad,"Give great customer service to every customer."
bad,You never knew what kind of day or what kind of new people you were going to meet that day.  Working with people everyday definitely taught me that people can be very unpredictable.  Management was good and were there when you needed them.  Co-workers were nice as well but there were many times we all just kept to ourselves.  Hardest part of the job was being on you feet for long periods of time as well as not being able to have water at the cash register.  Most enjoyable part was meeting all the different people.
bad,"I find that the management is below par.  They dont do their jobs correctly and thus everyone suffers.  The scheduling is not fair.  They tend to play favorites.  I enjoy most of the people I work with, except the managers."
bad,Enough said. People should give the company an opportunity. What works for them might now have worked for me.
bad,Enjoed associates and customers.Learned alot about customer service.
bad,"Typical retail store, nothing to great, nothing to bad. Customers come in, you help them, you recommend products."
bad,Working for Office Depot I am able to meet and help different people all day. I've gained knowledge on many of the different electronics and their functions. I assist on the new hires training and make sure they know and understand the procedures of the store.
bad,Al principio es bueno pero después te piden apoyo nocturno y no hay ayuda con los pasajes.
bad,N/A The brick and mortar will probably close in a year. They can't compete with Amazon. The company is so nervous about the competition they drive the sales team crazy with new ideas every quarter. The worst part is the team that does want to stay keeps getting their hours cut.
bad,Management is all over the place and hours kind of suck. The building is falling apart it literally leaks from the ceiling onto customers. The employees are pretty cool though and the environment is relaxed.
bad,Job served its purpose in paying bills while I was attending college classes. Very flexible with class schedule as well. Not much room for advancement and generally too much was asked of employees to keep up with production standards.
bad,"Very understaffed. Company does not provide enough payroll for the required amount of staff to run the building comfortably. Due to this, any call-outs or breaks/lunches are an inconvenience to the team and a hindrance to work. Sales goals are set for failure, thus an immense amount of pressure is put on the associates, even cashiers. Many positions require you to step outside of the boundaries of your title and assist where necessary, also eating into the time you need to complete your own tasks. Now, all of this would be fine if the compensation was on par with the amount of work and stress associated with this job. However, throughout the whole time I've been employed I've barely been paid over minimum wage for my work, even as a key-holder. Very not worth the time and energy."
bad,"If you're looking to make a little money on the side, this is a good place to work but if you're looking to bank bigger this is not the job. This is more of a job for high school students looking to make some money for college and etc."
bad,"My Time at Office Depot was great at first then became mundane over time. It was a great first job but now that I'm in college and I need to pay for things my self I can't work there. It also doesn't help that the store still has old registers, computers and an old way of doing thinks."
bad,I liked working there for 2 years. We had a good group of employees who got along and it was fun. Best manager to work for ever. It was great for 2 years.
bad,"The workplace culture was less than ideal, and I did not really acquire any new skills in order to perform tasks. Goals and tasks would be unreasonable at times."
bad,Working from home is great! Compensation is not what it use to be. That is mostly driven from industry not as strong as once was. My manager is great.
bad,"Not a fast paced environment, but yet was very stressful. Didn’t have a very good experience felt like fvey were prejudiced. A lot of the duties such as cleaning would only get done when I was there. They would not ask the other employees to do stuff."
bad,Wasn't that bad of a job. They're going to go out of businesses soon tho... Easy to tell lol. My job position was eliminated with no warning left a sour taste in my mouth.
bad,"Managers were good, Benefits OK, Upper managers were less than needed.My Co-workers are great people. Hour spent could get long "
bad,"Went out of business never had chance to advance with company. Other then that perfect place to work, very good environment and the training you where given was spot on"
bad,I had some good days an bad days. Wasn't really understanding when my cousin passed the week of his funeral I came to work but they wanted me to come in on the day of his funeral. The pay was $8.50 an hour an even with putting out a lot of hours my check was almost $300.00 every two weeks.
bad,Management is nice and coworkers are all respectful but expectations and goals are not reasonably set considering the pay wage. Raises/ advancement opportunity is low. Short three to six hour days.
bad,My experience at office depot was a bumpy. Management was not the best and continuously got upset for having other prioriteis besides work itself. Not the best job i have had.
bad,"In outside sales we had territories that we managed.  So you will have a lot of windshield time.  You are expected to daily use "
bad,"A typical day at work is how to make more sales in our store,I learned a lot of things with my superior,regarding the management is excellent,workplace  culture  is regarding the new  product in advance.the hardest  part of job-how to make  a balanced the sales items and sales income.the most  enjoyable part of the comnpany to recieved the salary and bunos."
bad,"The turn around for employment is very quick. I learned how to emplace management skills. hardest part of the job was lack of training for management role,"
bad,"I was well overworked, lots of physical labor, and the manager is a jerk. They mircromanage and don’t have a very positive environment. I’d still go back, but I just didn’t enjoy my job enough to stay."
bad,"Great job to start with, if the right people are there. Pay could be a ton better, forsure.. Customers are very kind, and are something to look forward too. Great first experience with sales, or cashier. After working for a little over a year, I would have to say the first 11 months was very rewarding. Learned so much about technology, products, and experience with customer interaction. After 11 months, it soon became the worse job I've worked at. Rather burn my hand in fry oil then walk into the store. Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers."
bad,"I worked in the national call center. Top Rep for over a year. Let go because I didn't make 50 calls a day. My performance didn't matter, calls is all that mattered."
bad,Es una empresa que ayuda a emprender nuevos retos y mejora la calidad laboral.
bad,"The overall management was very difficult to work with, although the employees and shift management were very friendly. I enjoyed working in a fast-paced environment, but when things got a little too hot to handle I was left alone and had to deal with a line of upset customers myself."
bad,"While the money was good at this job, I literally was required to sell my soul piece by piece every day just to get a paycheck. I was working part time on paper while in reality my manger had me pulling full time hours and only getting paid as a part timer."
bad,Office Depot is a great place to work at but the management is a no they treat you unfair and very careless of others. I've learned that working here is a good environment and the most enjoyable thing about this job was the pay.
bad,"Arturo Martinez Mercadotecnia es pésimo, nada innovador"
good,"I think its a great place to find office supplies however my experience working there was not very pleasent. "
good,North Las Vegas Craig Road location was a nightmare. Management submitted negative paperwork without council or approval. CHanged hours/schedule last minute
good,The manager at my particular store is extremely lazy and spends most of his day in the office. I've been working there for 3.5 years and I'm currently a technology supervisor. I am trained to do almost everything in the store yet I'm only making less than a dollar more than high school new hires.
good,"I started as the tech and was promoted level by level to the position of ASM.  I learned a lot about myself and the character of a number of different people and made valuable connections and friendships."
good,office depot is a perfect job for students. Part time positions only.
good,"When i first started (July 2018) the job was fun and great. Couple months in, most of my coworkers, including myself are miserable."
good,"not enough staffing for any department  in the warehouse, stressful environment,  start time changes each day and you never know what time you will be getting off, too many hours invested each day with little advancement or recognition"
good,"This job was crazy. I went through so many changes working however many hours, whether I was getting paid or not. Some managers didn't want you to work overtime but wanted you to stay and help out. You only had one manager that would actually fix your time sheets and do what you ask while the others ""forget"". I worked so many more hours then I should have without pay. I loved my one supervisor there! We went through a good few before finding one who will actually stay. Most people who would work in the center left because it was too hard and the customers were just down right dirty and crazy rude. You need a hard skin to work back there. The people I would crazy hours with were great. management is awful, CEO isn't any better, they try to micromanage. If you're like me it didn't work because you never met them and will never meet them. It was a very heavy work load for a small staff of three that actually knew what to do back there. If you like crazy rush deadline work loads, rude customers who talk dirty to you and poor leadership from the big guys on top then this is the place for you."
good,"Started there, the focus of the company was to take care of the customer.  The focus became more about the stock holders wealth.  Drastic cut in hours at the store level.  Some nights it would be myself and 1 other person closing (in a bad part of town) due to the cut in hours.  When I started there, I enjoyed working there.  I was seeing a path to promotion, and the store had 5-10 people closing every night.  By the end of my tenure there, I was salary working 70+ hours a week.  I worked between 70 and 95 hours a week for at least a year before finding another job.   I begin having health issues because of the stress.   The hardest part of the job was living to work."
good,"I grew in my office knowledge while I was employed. I enjoyed my customers, I enjoyed helping my customers. I was also excited to practice my very little sign language. "
good,"Usual retail experience not much else to say about it. Management micro manage and not try to be leaders, Customers tend to get stressful, Not paid enough for all your hard work and no recognition"
good,"While I enjoyed working at Office Depot, the management was not the best. The management needs to be worked reviewed and taken into consideration on the changes that need to be made."
good,"My boss had me working shifts that were not mine, all the time, and he was always really rude and disrespectful. He never really cared about anyone but himself. Ask any of my former co-workers. "
good,Find something else that helps balance life and work. Very busy and very degrading as a associate and manager. Need to get a more consistent schedule.
good,Office Depot was more of a slow pace. The hours would vary from about 6-8 hours a day. Customers were only coming in during the highest peaks of the day and once closing time arrived it was relaxed and easy to close down the store. During busy days it was a problem keeping an eye on customers because it would only be 1-2 cashiers up at the check out counter and an associate in the copy/print center.
good,I am not saying that all officemax locations are bad but the one that was located in Tacoma Washington was not well kept at all. I was threated to be fired over the flu. And we're talking about the bad flu where you are in no shape to work.
good,If you go in as a “sales consultant” than life should be a lot easier. Once you go into management it’s horrible. Pay is horrible. Communication is bad between management. Culture is old school. If you’re looking for a job at Office Depot Office Max I wouldn’t recommend it. At least not in LA County.
good,"Even though being a part time employee, the amount of hours given to every employee, per week are based upon the amount of loyalty signups from customers."
good,"This particular store changed immediately as soon as they brought in a new regional management team! They made the staff go above and beyond for Peanuts, about 60% left one by one including me. If I can't enjoy treating the customers correctly then I'm out! treat others as you wanna be treated! One of the managers told me I was spending to much time helping people. I need to get back to the register!"
good,I was a back to school casual only. Work was easy but very uncomfortable in a non air conditioned environment. Management as ery haphazard and communication not satisfactory.
good,"typical day would take most people to their limits."
good,"Workplace was ok.  Typical retail management position.  District manager was very team oriented, but the higher ups were not and were very demanding, but had never stepped foot in the store before."
good,"I currently am expected to do far more than my job discription dictates with no help. The current store manager has forced all but one of my print employees to quit (two of which left with no notice). I spend zero time with my children, as I wake up in the morning, run out the door to work, and don’t get home until just before dinner then they go to bed. I am constantly stressed and can’t even take sick time because I have no one to cover my department. I don’t get my lunch break until about two hours before I am scheduled to go home. Then am asked to stay longer."
good,"I worked here when it was just OfficeMax for 5 years. I really liked the team that I started out with. But, it quickly changed after everyone left and I transferred to another location. It was good there until management changed. Worked for 5 years and never was offered fulltime"
good,"new manager was horrible, she had no idea how to run the store and took a number 1 store to the worst store in a few months. i would not want to work for her"
good,"Management is not the best "
good,I worked part time when I was in High school. The management was frequently changing and dicey on quality. They would have blackout dates on time off. There wasn't any sick time unless you were the chosen few who were full time. The hours were NEVER regular and you would be lucky to get a weekend off.
good,"Working at Office Depot as a sales associate can be very stressful, in part because the location I worked at often felt understaffed. The manager's did the best they could with what they had."
good,"They are under new management and may be a better work environment now, But in the past was not enjoyable. I worked there for a short time before realizing that it was not a company I was wanting to work for."
good,"En copymax Acapulco "
good,"I learned a lot on this job even though the management was horrible. I learned to do better on my multi tasking skills, I learned to make all kinds of books."
good,"Horrible pay, only managers are full time, and you do a lot of work for the same as someone else that makes minimum wage for basic job. Also, the discount is a joke."
good,"Not the best job typical retail sales job, I would not say it's a horrible place to work but they suck up your like with scheduling and really just don't care that you have other things to do in your life."
good,working there was a job with in it's own the management was a revolving door and so was the associate I tried to advance at this job but constantly got denied even a full time position
good,Didn't like working here. Was a job until I was able to find something better. Not a bad place to work though. Good work environment if you like retail.
good,"i am sad to say i was disappointed by my first job, not because of the work but the lack of communication between management, and my schedule had more holes than Swiss cheese"
good,"Management was awful, they did not care if you were sick they expected you to show up the same day and show how sick you were. they will tell you 5 min before clock out that you need to stay and additional 5 hours on top of your 8 hours."
good,there is no advancement or fair treatment of the workers. the management is poor and very unprofessional. The workers are treated poorly and unappreciated.
good,Standard retail store work focus is customer oriented and hours are spent mostly helping customers.Benefits for full time and pay is biweekly.
good,"This company will lie through its teeth to get people to work for them. It's a great place to be until you find out the truth of how they run things.  Don't let them fool you into thinking it's not a call center, because that's exactly what it is.  The insurance is through the roof and your lucky if you take any money home to pay your bills.  With all the skewed benefits you ultimately are only making less than 15 an hour.   They are very unstable and you don't know if your job is secure day to day.  Run, Don't walk away from that place."
good,"At first, a pleasant place to work until the truth came out  about who you are really working for.  If you ever work for this place don't apply to the small business side.  This is where a salesperson goes to die pretty much.  Yes, you get a great hourly but the insurance will make sure you struggle with monthly paychecks.  The best place to work in the place is a segment called PUBLIC.  There is no commission, There is only a Bonus which never shows up on time.  Your co-workers make it worth you time to be there but they always leave if something better comes along."
good,"el trabajo en equipo fue fundamental para la facilidad de la realización de las actividades diarias, le faltaba a gerencias mas atención en sus colaboradores lo mas difícil fue los turnos."
good,"I would not recommend working in an Office Depot call center.  There is no such thing as work/life balance and it is terribly difficult to advance past a certain point.  There is no interest in developing associates into leaders and favoritism is heavy.  The hardest part of the job is the high-school like atmosphere.  There are good people working there and they make the days a little lighter."
good,this is a wonderful place to work if your looking for an easy part time job. they never really hire full time employees why I don't know. they have flexible hours and schedules to were if your in school it helps for the most part they allow you to get both done.
good,For a job it was very stressful. I had to constantly cover for people and they only gave me breaks if I had worked at least 6 hours. The managers were disrespectful. Especially the store managers. He always made innappropiate remarks.
good,"Busy for the most part, worse part is most customers are really rude, and management encourages behavior by giving discounts most of the time. I've dealt with a lot of racism as I'm sure that's with any job, however, I do not feel that the management team worries about how associates feel, just customers. I will say the store manager is family oriented and is flexible with schedules when you need a day off. Everyone gets along for the most part."
good,"Management was often all over the place, they didn't treat me with respect with what i have to do in my life such as school and being a dad. I got my hours cut after i wasn't able to work weekends."
good,It was a job in retail. I got hired due to an expected rush of work to come through. I did many tasks at the job that were not in the description yet did not get paid as if it mattered. I left when I got a better job.
good,I want to give the most essential report when dealing with the communication of the management and staffing team.  The manager didn't understand what it means to lead by example.  This is what made the job that much harder in my opinion.
good,"Typical day at work normally would consist of helping customers out in the technology area. I would help them with purchases for laptops, desktops, printers, scanners, phones, ink, cables and any thing that they needed help with. Since I changed companies and was brought on to train other employees, I didn't really learn as much as I taught. My managers were hit and miss. There were three managers that I worked with that I really liked, they were happy and high energy and had a plan worked out for the day and they let me do my job. The other three were very hard to work with. They would micromanage everyone and would give one person a two person job or they would give so much work to do that it was hard to help our customers and make sales cause they would always get angry if we left but would then turn around and get mad cause we aren't helping customers. It was very hard to balance. most of my coworkers were nice to talk to but didn't really do the things that we were supposed to do. It made it hard to train them or do my job when they would walk away and not help any customers. The hardest part of the job was lack of discipline and organization. The thing that I enjoyed the most was being able to help my customers with what they needed."
good,i have worked for this company of some time and they had recently made changes where they are constantly asking you about every interaction you have with every customer you come in contact with.
good,this is a title i earned for working hard and helping people within my chruch .i kept this title for five years
good,Not a career. it is a retail job and management is out of balance.
good,Randall has a very long work week. and the pay if your not selling is not good
good,"nearly 17hr work days"
good,Management very rarely cares about what is going on in your life. Breaks are very easily kept from employees. Work full-time hours at part-time pay and benefits.
good,Enjoyed worked at Office Depot until warehouse closed. Unloaded trucks and disturb work to about 30 associate on a daily basis.
good,As a whole the company is okay. The main reason for my seeking out another position is primarily due to me being very over qualified for the position I hold. Secondary reasons include my belief that this is not a career for me and pay.
good,"It is a good entry level job, typical watch video's for training, help customers during the day along with other tasks assigned like stock shelves and detail"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with. There was never enough people to help. I learned a lot about copy and print. Working in the copy and print is the part that I loved. I enjoyed it. Even though it took a while to learn, Overall, I think I did a good job."
good,Office Depot is very understanding of worklife balance in the last few years has struggled to promote healthy work culture and identity in an evolving market
good,"Always lacking people on the floor. Not enough training and moreover, unrealistic deadlines. Print center can be fun however, you are usually by yourself and rarely will have people to help effficiently. Not to mention, they are letting go of the wrong people as well."
good,With the company for a year went through a store closure transferred about 3 times because the district manager didn’t care enough to find me a store to stay planted at. Demoted me after 11months because of not having payroll and does not cash out PTO or give you your days off even if you put them in a month in advance.
good,My job at office depot was like anywhere else at a big chain store management breathing down you and all the employees trying to see how much they could get away with. Office depot felt like high school all over again with cliques and people seeing how far they could bend the rules before they broke.
good,"No cuentan con horarios flexibles, si tienen horario fijo y riguroso para los empleados; oportunidad de aprendizaje para becarios."
good,"I advanced in a year, from a job I was over-qualified for to Customer Service Manager.  I was placed in a new store, with sub-par management around me, as well as undertrained staff.  The company wants you to sell 8 things to every customer.  Subscriptions, rewards, biz box, square trade on electronics, and so on.  Add in the print department's ""pitches"" for upgrades and 3rd party businesses to do work that can be done in store is ridiculous.  There are at least 3 third-party companies that they want you to utilize in the print department.  These are skills, that if trained with good hires, can easily accomplish.  It is a waste of company money and time.  This is their business model though.  After all, they bought a failing multi-million dollar company, while the company itself is failing.  The only profit they have posted is when they closed over 200 stores in the last 5 years.  Upper management is disconnected and has no idea how to do anything in the store, let alone what it's actually like to do try and attain the expectations that they put on employees.  All while underpaying quality employees, and treating them like garbage.  Their practices are almost a perfect mold of another ""great"" company.  Sears.  I'm glad I got out when I did, there is no future for this company."
good,The management was ridiculous kinda hard to work.was a full time employee but only received 25 hours each week had to look for second job but told me I couldn’t get another one cause I was a full time employee there.disorganized and messy
good,"As a route driver, making sure the merchandise is all in order and an place can be a pain. Usually the job would be done around 3-5pm, while starting the route around 7am after loading the truck by hand. Be prepared to carry have boxes every once in a while (over 100 lbs). Management was mediocre at best and would question your reason for not delivering merchandise on time if some of it were kept for the next day"
good,"The main focus was all about selling warranties, protection plans, and credit cards. The goal was mostly to get people to buy something that left enough money on the table to get them to purchase a warranty of some sort and failure to due so was met with threats of a poor performance review."
good,"•	Partnered with the Store Manager to drive the overall customer, and sales and service culture within the location. "
good,"Typical days at work usually are slow and exhausting since you have to remain on your feet for the majority of the day, once you get used to it, it isnt so bad but you have to get over the fact that you might sound overbearing to the customer with all the policies you must follow. Work is usually light hearted and interesting enough as long as your co workers are fun. The job is not hard and that is the most enjoyable part."
good,Long hours and low pay.  Store management not supported by Upper management.  Company policy not followed at all stores.  Local Managers sometimes hostile to employees and threatening.
good,I worked there for many year and the last manager was just horrible. I had to leave that place because she was rude to her employee and customers. Lack of management.
good,My manager was to concerned with keeping his friends and  not running the store properly. As management you have to be able to separate personal life from business to handle and run a store.
good,"The culture is the hardest part of the job.  It's one of fake excitement and high compliance.  The commission is hard to attain, and is relatively low.  The benefits were good.  The hardest part of the job is showing up for it."
good,"The specific store I worked for kept bringing in students and part timers while the current employees were stuck where they were."
good,"My typical day was busy. I was expected to do a lot of things even if my job title didn't require it. Management showed a lot of favoritism there. Management was never motivating or inspirational, but overall I was my own motivator and I motivated others. Although I had issues there, I still think that Office Depot is one of the best jobs I have had because of the type of work I accomplished."
good,If you are a associate or a manager you are not trained well and there is no training program other than programs on the computer.  It is a thankless job and management is always on you.   The pay is low and the stress high and managers play favorites.  If your store manager doesn't like you then you are up the creek and corporate does nothing even if you complain.   And if you complain expect retaliation from the manager or associate since they tell them who complained and why and don't follow up nor do they do anything about it.
good,Was my first job after high school was a decent first job and a good learning experience.  Helped me learn what I like and what I don't like.  If you like retail would be good for you.
good,"boring, never had any music playing. Never got trained properly, almost as if they don't want you to move up (in position).  02303 (wilshire, Los Angeles) location has the worst management team. never made the employees feel enthusiastic to make/up sell. Training for his is such a drag that it made me feel ""Why should i even try."" Nothing is wrong with this location or job. It's smack in the middle of businesses in west Hollywood. It should be doing better and have better numbers, but the just needs a fresh team!"
good,Management absolutely sucked. My supervisor timed me when I went to the bathroom.  At one point I was told I was going to be laid off with severance pay the next minute I was tol that I would be offered s job that could be out of my range but I had to take it because they were no longer offering severance packages. Fast forward to when Office Max merged with Office Depot. Crazy overtime!!!!! Management kept quitting. Very understaffed. My hard work and looongg hours went unnoticed. Me and most of my crew quit.
good,"I'm sure the company overall is great. The GM at the store I worked at was great, but my day-to-day managers were pretty bad. The overall atmosphere of the company was pretty cut-throat when it came to getting protection plans. If you didn't meet a certain criteria, there were write-ups involved and it was difficult to sell the plans as there are not many good selling points - they're expensive and don't cover a lot."
good,"I ran the print department as the Print Supervisor.  It is a fun place to work if you get into the right store.  Its fast paced and you are always learning.  If management were to come together instead of going after each other, it would be a wonderful place to stay."
good,This is a great job for someone recently graduating from High School.  If you like being micromanaged this is the position for you.  The benefits of working in a place like this will greatly establish a good work ethic in terms of common courtesies while working.
good,A typical day once you walk in and get your uniform together with your name tag and walkie on. You must announce the stores daily goal and announce your personal goal. Then walk out to the floor and use the computer at the tech bench to clock in. Mean while customers try to stop you to ask questions. Customers constantly ask questions about where things are because their are not too many helpful signs around.
good,"Working in the print center, is very easy once you get the hang of things. However, processes and company rules are constantly changing. There are no typical days at work, it is really is a ""take it a day at a time"" kind of atmosphere. I learned so many useful tools; Photoshop, Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Office in depth. I also learned how to make stamps and do bindings. Many useful office type skills were learned. The hardest part of the job is that managing customer expectations, usually things can be done quickly and are easily taken care of but sometimes things are needed too quickly and we sometimes did not have people to get things done on time. The enjoyable part of the job was learning how to all the things in the print center."
good,"You work long hours without really ever getting help because it's incredible short staffed. No one really wants to help you in the Print Center because they're scared and don't want to learn how to work over there. No human makes the schedule so you're at the mercy of a computer when it comes to your schedule. Work odd hours (4hr then 8.5 hrs, then 8.5 hours, then 4, then work all weekend)."
good,Working in the copy center I was surprised by the volume of customers. I learned a great deal of putting together presentations. I also learned new computer publication software.
good,I help me to not be shy by being able to greet each and every guest that enters the store.Assist each guest that enter the store with products that they need. And helping to resolve customer issues.
good,"Under staffed, corporate expectations always changing with payroll dollars always shrinking. Forcing you to work thru breaks and often go without lunch. Store managers, not held to same expectations as other management,  and store manager usually doesn't back you when confronted by corporate. No overtime allowed, but they keep putting more work on your plate and no payroll hours to be fully staffed yet they keep hiring more people."
good,"Overall Office depot/ Office Max is a great place to work but there can be some challenges that the management don't know how to communicate with staff members. The staff or management will on train you when you ask them to train you not when you as an employee don't know anything, they think that your first day you should get all your training done. Hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers and not being able to express my self because Ive run into some discrimination. The best part of going to work would be certain people I work with that I feel comfortable with not everyone I work with."
good,"I used to enjoy the work atmosphere and the people that I was working with. Also, I used to love the medical healthcare plan.  However, since the merger there have been a lot changes that I was not impressed by."
good,"The company is always changing due to the take overs that has happen in the last two years. Which is not a bad thing just not a great thing , with little or no guidance and lack there of training ."
good,"We lacked the proper equipment, which is one of the reasons why I quit. We only had one computer when OfficeDepot had 3, we had 1-2 works in the print center, OfficeDepot had 3-5. I learned how to really multitask, how to use certain computer programs that I didn't even know existed. I wouldn't recommend this job to just anyone, someone who can really multitask, and someone who really likes designing on computers should work here. Someone who can deal with up to 12 customers all at once."
good,"I learned the basics of doing graphics for the general public, finishing machines and several types of printers. I liked the coworkers as they were all ages."
good,This job is not bad for a beginner. at first there all nice then is when the real deal begins. they start taking advantage of you. the pay really sucks. the only good think would be that thy are flexible with hours. THEY EXPECT TOO MUCH OUT OF YOU.
good,"Unless you are driven to be a manager in the retail sector, you will only work part time"
good,"Working at Office Depot is not an exciting story to tell.  I am a current student so the reason I have stayed with them for as long as I have (1.5 years) is solely due to their flexibility with my schedule.  Other than than, this company is one you should steer clear from, in my opinion. The pay is terrible mismanaged.  While cashiers and copy/print dept. associates get to stand around and relax behind counters, the freight associates are stuck doing all of the manual labor throughout the entire store.  Can you guess who is paid substantially less?  Unfortunately, it is the freight crews.  That being said, if you want to work for a company that will probably work with a busy schedule with no opportunities for advancement whatsoever, then go ahead and make sure you procure a cashier or CPD position.  On top of all that, they expect you to remain on-call (they won't call it this, they just want to make sure you have your phone on you at all times and that you will be ready and willing to drop whatever it is that you are doing to come to the store).  If you fail to please them by not arriving within 30 minutes of their call to come in or, even worse, if you fail to come in at all because you have a life, you can absolutely expect to have your hours cut for a few weeks.  This is not an unbearable place to work, you just have to be ready to deal with outrageous unfairness within the workplace coupled with lazy and irresponsible management."
good,"I accepted this position in December 2011. This was a brand new sales division they created. Long story short, Office Depot decided this new sales division was not going to meet their set expectations. As a result they let go several hundred employees nationwide, before really giving the new division a chance. I was very disapointed, because I really enjoyed my work & was becoming very sucessful at achieving my goals. I don't like to be negative, but they never gave the new sales division a fighting chance."
good,The managers horsed around with the co workers late night shifts. The benefits were excellent when Office Depot had compensation. Office Depot is not understanding for a person with a mental or physical illness.
good,was i good company when i started now workers are talked down too. scheduling problems. the only part of the job i do enjoy is when i fix a computer for someone whom has lost all hope.
good,"The several years I was with Office Depot was enlightening and confusing. Local leadership was bitter and harsh, district management was nurturing and interseted in developing future leaders and the company direction was focused on customer retention one quarter and the next was all about super aggressive sales pressure. Odd conflict of directions. Generally a good ENTRY level job for a high school or college student, not a career choice for most..."
good,"You can tell the company tries to make the job one that a person would keep. There are supposed to be good benefits. Flexible schedules, 4 days bereavement,  3 weeks of vacation on the day of hire but the pay is not much for what you are doing. In this economy the business is really struggling they told us weekly that we may lose our jobs or even shut down the store at any moment. That does not make for a very positive environment. Everyone is defeated and mad from the top down the environment is toxic!"
good,"Low pay, company failing at many levels. Don’t look for a career here. Good for collage kids or someone needing extra cash."
good,"Management was very rude , no training manager has a disrespect for women .A lot of management there a backstabbing always try to get over some kind away it’s just very stressful in the work environment"
good,"We were just informed today that we must hit a 60 percent penetration in getting sign ups, if we do not we have 30 hours to turn it around, and then if we do not meet that goal, we will be terminated."
good,"Employees were great and we helped each other out. Customers are the worst and expect to pay as little as possible making the most extreme excuses for everything. Complaints are handled well, and I enjoyed working as a logistics team member."
good,"Mucha trabajo y presión en el área de servicentro, los clientes literal te pueden insultar y tus jefes no te apoyan al contrario, abusos de poder por parte de los supervisores y gerentes, recursos humanos no te ayuda para nada si no todo lo contrario terminarás muy estresado afectando tu salud"
good,"This job is great as a starter job but not for long term. Patience is a must  and customer service is top priority.  I manage to stay this long because of these factors. Pay is  low and in my honest opinion,  it should have a rise especially  for the copy and print department. This job will teach you how to find solutions  to problems you never thought of before."
good,"Can be very hot in summer (no AC), not very clean (super dusty and dirty)PTO given 1-2x a year?! Poor management, lack of teamwork, work hours vary day by day (there's no set start time - usually between 10:30 and 1 until done. Somethings always breaking down which slows work flow. People absent alot, or don't stay at job because of environment."
good,"It all depends on the managing staff. If a manager is proficient, the staff will pull through no matter, but a selfish or lackluster leader will quickly loose the trust of the crew. Worked with all types, but recent events landed a not so desirable environment. Must be able to deal with high stress customers, including scammers and fraud cases as they can be quite frequent. Managers will often ask employees to fill in for a position they may not have any training, and you are still expected to perform as a fully trained staff."
good,"Our manager can be overbearing at times. If the job is not done the way she wants it don, then to her it is not done correctly. If the job is not done in the order in which she feels it should be done then your not doing your job."
good,"It is a good place to start out with either your first job or getting back in to the work force. OfficeMax has several different duties to do. The Managers are all great and work with you, or at least the one's I worked with did. I loved it there, had a manager who would buy us Pizza every other Friday, cakes or cupcakes for someone's birthday. and bought a coffee maker an put it in the break room for the employees who had to come in early to help with opening the store."
good,I worked in the call center here.  It was very disorganized and the manager was hardly there.  I advanced to become the lead customer care rep.  There is no chance for advancement and upper management really doesnt care.
good,"Office Depot/ Office Max is in a constant state of flux.  Store, District, and Regions have realigned 3 time in the last 4 years offering a very unstable work environment.  The Leadership team is in the process of re-inventing the company's approach to the brick and mortar business, which is very much so needed, but doing it in a very unorganized and reckless fashion."
good,"There is little to no opportunity for advancement, and the pay is too low for the work required (my store was really busy). Management was also a mess."
good,Office depot has a high expectation to sell unseen services to clients.  Their goal is to sell services that most people can Google to get the answers they are looking for.  They expect managers to not only be the LOD but to also to exceed their service goals without the staff to support.  They have a high turnover due to the fact that upper management does not hold people accountable for their actions.  The training with Office depot in nonexistent.
good,"Working in Office Depot can only be described as challenging. This business has undergone several changes in the last 4 years, with lots of streamlining and the implementation of creating a leaner business."
good,MANEGMENT HAS BEEN REPLACED SINCE I HAVE WORKED THER! The manager was very sexist and very mean. I was never trained on the job they expected me to know how to run everything in the coppy and print area with no previous experiance.
good,"The training for my position is BEYOND LACKING, but aside from that and all the extremely rude customers, the work is alright, and the staff is decent"
good,You get a raise and if your schedule was full time and change to part time there cut your pay without notifying you from 11.00 to 10.00 and you see it on your paycheck
good,I most enjoyed my fellow employees. What i most disliked was the lack of direction from management. Constant change with the unrealistic expectations.
good,"I worked for OfficeMax/ Office Depot for just over 3 years and tried to promote. It was extremely difficult moving around within the company as the Store's management had changed three times in my three years. I was overworked in the printing department and was kept just under the Part-Time hour specifics so I couldn't get benefits, as i was not 'qualified' for them."
good,"It's not a bad place to work at as long as everyone there pulls their own weight. The pay and hours aren't the best unless your in management or full time due to benefits, higher hourly wages. Everyone builds vacation time over the year and PTO. Yearly Reviews determine if you get a raise if you work for it but they generally don't give much of a raise. It's a tedious stressful job depending on what position you're hired for."
good,long days learned my way around Baltimore and Washington one superviser was easy and good to work with the hardest part of the job was when we were supposed to be delivery drivers but a lot of times we had to sort and load our own trucks without being compensated
good,the management wasn't that great they would schedule me for ours that I couldn't do and I had people relying on me all the time to get the basics done
good,If you like a company that doesn't work with your schedule and also doesn't give you any benefits but 10 percent off then this is the job for you. Management is not the greatest with this company. Many things were being ignored and it eventually made people quit their job at office depot. Also breaks were given at the last hour or so of your sift.
good,"I worked with the company for two years in their busy print department with little to no AC. 99 percent of the time I was left to clean and close the entire front end on my own while running the busiest department in the store. The job worsened my anxiety disorder to the point of having seizures, and I suffered many heat strokes while on the job. Customers have seen me so overwhelmed, busy, and exhausted to the point of collapsing to the ground with no other associates able to take control of the department due to me being one of the three people they have trained in the print department. I wrestled with the printing and finishing equipment, I've ruined my mental health, and I've done everyone else's job for two years and I only make 9.75 an hour, whereas full-time Chick Fil A employees start out at 12. I've stayed with the company this long due to their lenience on letting me take days off for school, and I've made great connections through there, but I would rather drink a gallon of bleach than to continue working with this company any longer."
good,"I would come in and work in the Impress department. I would take orders for printing and would complete the orders in a timely manner.  But I was con'd by management into violating company policy, and was fired as a results."
good,"I have been with this company for almost a year and a half now and I have to say it has disappointed me more and more each day. The managers seem to barely know what they're doing and will avoid helping customers and leave it to the rest of the associates. Management just has a bad attitude. I'm surprisingly thankful for seeing such poor management as a young adult so that when I hold a management position myself, I will know the appropriate way to conduct myself."
good,"The transition to Staples was great at the time. Better management, better work environment, better pay, but at the end of the day it’s retail, so that work isn’t great. There are way to many highs and lows. Good thing this store closed down."
good,"If you are hoping to make advancements don't do it here. The culture of the company seems to be moving forward and a lot is changing which is great, but a lot of management is stuck in the past, plays favorites, or is hired externally and has been given very little training. The training in the company is terrible since they provide little to no training tools. (That has been changing but its barely cohesive still). Office Depot is all about the numbers. "
good,"From Management to entry-level, employee attitudes reflect that they sense, with good reason, that the store's future is uncertain. Teamwork was not this store's forte and training was basically nonexistent."
good,"If you don't mind having a different schedule every week, and that you'll barely make above minimum wage, Office Depot is great for you."
good,Due to lack of advancement opportunities we lose many good productive talented people. The folks left behind are managed by shortsighted panic mongerers that mistake daily happenings as trends and over-manage instead of casting vision and delegating to able managers.
good,The company has gone down hill quite a lot in the last few years and its just not what it used to be. They don't take care of their good employees like they should.
good,"This was my first job and it got me alot of experience. But the amount of hours I was forced to work due to poor management and me not knowing that a part time wasn't allowed to have ot was very disappointing. Imy first 3 weeks were 12 hour shifts 8-8 every single day, the check wasn't bad but I would have got more if OT was offered. I wasn't overworked I just did alike bit of everything and was hired as a computer tech bit ended up a cashier taking all the person making nearly double my wages tech calls."
good,I wouldn't go there again there was alot of pressure to sell people things they do not want.  Also i was told my hours would work around college than manage refused
good,"Satisfy customer needs and frustrations."
good,"Attend customers with their retail needs, ensure that the ink is cleaned and put out. Look over candy and chips to ensure that they have not expired. Made sure to get a minimum of 5 reward card sign ups a day."
good,Depending on where you work in the store depends on what you do in a day. Most of the day I spent cashiering which meant it was slow-paced at times and then fast-paced at times. Your coworkers do not always help you right away so you need to do things by yourself. The management is not always great but the can be considerate at times and help you out when your in a bind.
good,"This company offers a lot in beneficial training at the store level how to shop smarter, not necessarily cheaper, when it comes to supplies, furniture, and technology. YOU WILL know the types of pens and printer papers out there available, YOU WILL be able to answer a customer's need on an office chair with specific options in 5 minutes or less. YOU WILL know the difference between inkjet and laser, as well as the pros and cons to both. YOU WILL feel confident selling a pc and alerting customers to services that can make the purchase easier, However, constant hiccups with company policies and their Point Of Sales systems both on their website and their registers frequently leave customers frustrated and employees having to learn fast how to resolve complaints when they know that their ""help desk"" is just a name. Management tries to boost morale to the employees that everything will someday be fixed. And with a solid new CEO in place, it just might. Just not anytime this year, it seems."
good,"No tienen orden "
good,The work environment is nice for the most part but some of the managers are not the best and unfortunately I have know a lot of people that get stuck in one position. You don't really move up in the company. But if your looking for a job somewhere for just a summer or two its a nice place to be.
good,"Corporate reduced the number of employees in stores yet expected the same levels of production and service throughout my five years with the company."
good,I enjoy working at Office Depot but the Store mánager was very rude and disrespectful. I wouldnt recommend that place to anyone unless you enjoy to be laugh in your face!
good,The job itself is not worth the 8.00 dollars an hour you get paid. You work your butt off for absolutely no incentive. The employees are all selfish and are not willing to teach and are very defiant. I want to work somewhere where there is room to grow. I feel as if the company just doesn't want to take care of its hard working employees.
good,"My schedule was getting changed everyday. Every time I would come in to work they were either saying ""your late, too early or not scheduled today."" On top of being thrown out in the fire as soon as I started, I was never trained properly. But overall it's a pretty simple job to catch on too, I wouldn't recommend long term career aspirations. Even with my bad experience with the job, I still appreciate the opportunity."
good,"As an Impress Associate you work in the printing department. Basic Job responsibilities are taking/printing customer orders and maintaining a clean working environment while maintaining the printers and other equipment you will use within the department. It's busy work as often times you'll have an influx of customers that need something printed ASAP during the afternoon and evening hours, but it can be manageable."
good,You are by yourself slaving over the property dong everything including heavy hvac work which we are not qualified for. Managerment above store level is a joke
good,"Very fun and diverse workplace, however management pressures and pushes the company philosophy of ""sell, sell, sell!"" Very strict attendance policy with no regard to the employee's personal life."
good,Hay hora de entrada pero nunca de salida. y no hay pucha posibilidad de ascender
good,"Se trabaja bajo presión , vigilados todo el tiempo por CCTV , la requisa para ingresar y salir es muy  arbitraria."
good,"Office Depot and Office Max were very chaotic. You don't have time nor the chance to recommend the correct products to your customers. Both places have the products in mind that they want you to sell them, which are often more than what they need and end up costing them a heck more."
good,"Don't work here. Ever. The equipment is largely outdated. There is little-to-no training available for new employees (they're left pretty much on their own). The management was less than competent, to put it mildly. The pay is dismal. I could go on and on... in short, avoid this company like the plague."
good,"trabjo en officemax culiacan, mi experiencia como asociada de ahi es buena pero podría ser mejor. no existen muchas posibilidades de asender. la relacion de los gerentes asia los asociados es buena."
good,coworkers are friendly. I do not get along with the store manager. typical day at work is fast and enjoyable most days. other management is enjoyable to work with. coworkers are friendly and fantastic to work with.
good,"Nice people to work with, poor management skills. Great for a second part time job. Meet a lot of different people on a regular basis."
good,"The company as a whole has been going through many changes over the last couple years. Huge changes in upper management all the way down to in-store culture has been shifted around on a quarterly basis. There is a little hope of career advancement, and there is no clear progression planning in place in a district level."
good,"A typical day at work I stand at the entrance greeting customers and asking what their needs are to help them find what they need. I cashier, answer phones, and stock items. I have learned to help sell furniture, how to work on the sales floor, and how to use what is called the mobly where we look for item in stock and stock put away and delete. "
good,Outbound sales/on the telephone from clock in time to clock out time.  Job is not based on the employees attendance and dependability but HOW much money the employee can make for the company.  The company is no longer in business.
good,"Great place to work as an entry level manager. Good place to learn the basics of business, customer service, payroll, merchandising and more."
good,company would prefer employees to task rather than help employees. I prefer to be more customer oriented not task based. customers pay the bills
good,"I worked in the copy and print center of a office depot centered in a huge commercial area. Always had multiple online print jobs and current jobs, constant flow of walk-in customers. I worked in the second biggest and heaviest office depot in the San Diego county. The good part was that there was always something to do. The bad thing was we hardly got enough time to help the cashiers when they were loaded and the staff were always stressed out trying to complete all the jobs on time."
good,"The Salary doesnt nearly compensate for the stress and the workload they expect,"" on July 4th the was an alarm set of in my location and the store manager didnt answer the phone, so i was next on the list to call and got stuck there until 2 am instead of sending time with my family. She however didnt even call to check or even mention it the next day"""
good,"Great team/co workers, awesome workplace, friendly customer service, very smart co workers, just poor management, does not include themselves in a team effort"
good,Very slow store.  Management didn't give good direction.  We spent most our day walking around with nothing to do and no costumers to attend to.
good,its a job for students. I was the computer specialist. worked on computers. I was also a retailer. I learn customer service and how to deal with people who are not interested or people who were not satisfy with offie depot computer services. As a Specialist I had to control the situation and calm the customer and make them satisfy.
good,"I open the store perform all opening tasks which include audit reports, cash drawers, logistics, running CPD and handling all customers in the building. Once the store opens its all about the customer and what I need to do to be able to put what the customer needs I their hands. When not assisting customers other job duties are recovery, planograms, audit labels, training. "
good,my company was good at first but all my managers left and got replaced with new ones and they didn't do a very good job so thats why i left.
good,"over time is given then taking away u never no what time you will be getting off not a good place to work if you children or other personal daily needs management to employee communication is not affective or taking serious in the work place very hot in the summer due to lack of fans in the warehouse was once asked if I was ""stupid ""by a manager while working"
good,Beautiful office with what used to be passionate people but once the acquisition was announced most stopped caring. Management is okay but they over work you.
good,The manager is not willing to talk to you if he has an issue with you.  He is great at making you look like you have no idea what you are doing even though you know for a fact that you are right!
good,"office depot can work if you are a college student nothing else, any hopes you have of making it a career throw away unless you personally know someone. constant pressure of payroll goes over quality of work so do expect to get yelled for staying over and finishing your work."
good,"It was fun working here because of my friends, but the pressure put on to hard sale every costumer didn't work for me. I felt rude, and when I didn't push a sale enough I was yelled at by management."
good,No communication between managers and associates. No structure on what responsibilities need to be done. No one looks after associates and ignores the problems when brought up by associates.
good,"Challanging place to work , Many merger activities currently underway"
good,The job started off well but every associate started to notice the decrease in work volume which slowed up our hours and it never changed. Feels like the business or building is closing soon but no one wants to tell us the truth
good,The work day went by fast and was over all not too bad. The lunch breaks were only thirty minutes and usually had to be taken an hour after arrival. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers but that is any job and when handled the right way can be resolved. I worked well with my coworkers and enjoyed working there most days.
good,"Once you are hired with Office Depot you will not have any opportunities to advance. I have been there for a while and I have ""advanced"" but my pay is still the bare minimum. They know how to make you feel unappreciated"
good,I learned customer service working at Office Depot. We strived to make the customer happy. I did everything from run the cash register to stocking shelves. Helping customers find what they are looking for was satisfying.
good,"Helping customers find what they need and basic sales. Stocking, customer service, and technology sales. Helping customers was great, the pay was not."
good,my first job at office depot as a stocker was ok for a teenager my typical work day would just be to stock shelve help customers and do the displays which was my favorite thing to do because i had creative freedom to do so. i was work so well that i was ask to help open several stores in Georgia the one i enjoyed the most was in Atlanta.
good,"Typical day was slow, Ive learned the differences between several models of computers and printers. Management was ok. Some co workers were cool. Nothing hard about the job,"
good,"First off, you start with a sign in and a list of goals which you announce to your coworkers every day. The way you have to approach customers is pretty creepy, language is weird. "
good,Office Depot was a place where values and integrity was required we worked hard everyday to insure that we lived up to our standards. A day at the job was high pace you had to be able to work at a speedy pace but still be accurate
good,The upper management of this company our horrible! You have no idea what is going on and very unpredictable. The company is very week and is merging with another failing company!
good,"typical work day is 5 or 6 hrs of work no break on feet all day till off I've learned a lot about ink and toner when it comes to computers and printers, in copy and print area i learned laminations, shipping, scanning, of course I knew how to copy and print, take orders and just a lot of things. hardest part short hrs not enough pay and no breaks, ok with the co-workers management don't like so much I don't feel like they are considerate of others sometimes but I tolerate because I work there for now. most enjoyable interacting with the customers."
good,"It started as a job with room to move up within the company, but after an extended amount of time the ability to continue to grow was gone. I took a cut in pay coming from one job market to another. By the time all was said and done I was making 1 cent more then when I started with the company."
good,"Great place to make a little extra money, specially college students."
good,All I did was interact with customers so I can meet my sales goal for the day. The more products I offered to customers the more money I made for the company. I learnt a lot of sales and interpersonal skills. My co-workers were fun and caring. The hardest park of the job I would say is making the sales to meet the goal of the day. The most enjoyable part of the Job was meeting the sales goal and making the overtime. Management was okay I always got great feedback from them due to loyal customers comments of my service to them. 
good,"Experience at Office Depot depends on department and managment. Like all companies, there are good and bad aspects working at Office Depot. At times it feels that the management is not employee supportive, but there are many opportunities within the company if you are willing to venture out."
good,"I started to work for this company, and it had great core values and service minded for both associates and customers alike. Now the company seems to be failing across the board. In the past year several long term associates, and managers, have quite the company for poor corporate leadership. Along with many questionable corporate directive that seems to be short sighted and fail to deliver customer needs."
good,"The retail environment can sometimes be a  tough one, the working environment can also be tough, those two variables make for a difficult balance of work and life."
good,"No chance for advancement, and managers are never available for help.  At the end of the end of the day working at Office Depot Distribution Center is just about going in doing your jobs, and not caring about anything else."
good,"Great place for an in-between job, met nice people along the way most costumers are arrogant and ignorant due to them having a better pay but its what you’ll expect in a place where you provide items for people who work in offices or own businesses"
good,"Enjoyed customers.  Liked who I worked with.  The wage was not great and manager aid men more money with way less exierience"
good,They will throw you to the wolves and expect you to automatically know what you're doing without training properly . You never know when you're going to get off work and they are never staffed according.
good,Hope for a good GM and coworkers. Customers were generally very thankful for assistance. If you like a fast paced high stress environment then this business is for you.
good,me encargaba de auxiliar el centro de copiado mis compañeros super buena onda apendi a trabajar en equipo
good,"The store was relaxed but, the manager can be a debby-downer and bring the atmosphere down. I would just check people out when their done shopping then restock the store at the end of the day."
good,"I run the copy and print center, so the day to day is fairly standard. You're stuck behind the copy and print counter, wherever it may be, for the entirety of your shift. You are responsible for printing out any jobs, small or large that customers bring in, as well as any store required printing(I.E. Advertisements, Marketing Materials, Coupons Sale tags, Banners, etc). In theory this is simple enough. But it is one of the most stressful positions in the store. On a slow day, you'll be fine. But on a busy day, you'll be running the print center on your own managing four to five angry customers at once. That, alongside machinery that frequently breaks down and stops working at the drop of a hat. And it goes from 0 to 100 extremely quick. Despite all this, I did learn a lot in this position. I'm now proficient with Publisher, Excel, Photoshop and more, as well as Large format poster printers, and high production xerox machines. Management is a mixed bag. The manager who hired me was good at his job but an absolute tool. any job he didn't feel like doing would get dumped on me or associates of a similar skill set, regardless of our qualifications or training. But he was fired, and our replacement GM is a much better person, and he is even better at running the store. All the lower level management was okay at best. The workplace culture had changed dramatically from the original GM to the new. Originally it was incredibly toxic, managers talked trash on other managers and associates behind each others backs, there was a ridiculously high turn over rate, and the only reward for"
good,Can't really say anything bad about this company. I was there for eleven years but I could never get solid schedule. Changing your schedule like that affects your household.
good,"Management was clueless when it came to the most simplest questions, such as uniform shirt orders, or when employees receive PTO.  I had only 1 shirt for the whole period I worked there, and could never get another one.  I worked there for over 6 months and still never received any PTO like other workers, and could never get a straight answer as to when I would. The job also required signing customers up for certain lengthy subscriptions and the employee would get no compensation."
good,"In a typical day at Office Depot, there isn't much to do. The store tends to not be very busy at all. The break room is almost pointless, with no coffee machine. Unassigned lockers. Most employees have a good spirit and make working there enjoyable. Others not so much. Overall, easy job, easy money."
good,Executive management is continually changing the direction of this company. Recent IT Services company acquisition has been a disaster. B2B sales team has been restructured multiple times over the past 5 years.
good,"They sent in a new manager a month or two before I left, who caused approx. 50% or more of the employees to straight up leave. That manager was horrible, kept cutting my hours down more and more every couple weeks until I gave up. I started with 35-40 hours a week, and once that manager arrived, after a couple months it was down to 20 average."
good,"I was working for over 4 months and I was not getting paid with the rest of the overnight crew. With pay and distance I had to travel, I was forced to get a second job."
good,"When  I worked there we went through 4 store managers in 3 years. after merging with Omax corporate started cutting our stores payroll to give to the Omax down the street, even though we made almost 3x in sales. Most the times during Depot Time (sales) there were more managers at the store than employees, for part time you would see about 20-30 hours weekly, full time employees got right at 35 hours a week. Managers got 40-50 hours. They did give commission pay that was added to you paycheck for selling computer services, protection plans, and their ink reordering service. In the evenings there were days where we would go from 7p.m. - 10 p.m. without seeing customers (2nd store manager was able to convince corporate to let us close at 9) Even after applying never did become a computer technician but I did personally trained 3 of them. They also have a scheduling system that automatically assigned days (even days you put down as unavailable or requested off). At nights I ended up being the sales floor rep. computer tech, and the cashier. While still having to clean and maintain the store."
good,"I work in the print center of a retail store. Its very fast paced and constantly busy. While i do not mind that kind of work, the pay does not equal the work and stress you get from the job. If it weren't for having some cool co-workers and managers I would have quit already."
good,"équipe sympathique responsable compréhensive ."
good,"Position was a very busy position. Not enough help in the area. Managment was poor. Although there is new managment now. Things do look better as a whole there, just not when I was an employee"
good,I loved my job at Office Depot because I was able to engage customers and direct them to products they needed. I became a little frustrated with supervisors who kept getting fired or replaced. Other supervisors were people who would not be the people to go to for assistance.
good,"Not the most fun place to work, but a decent part-time job. The management was not that great, but other colleagues were nice and work willing to work together to get tasks done."
good,It's an ok place to work would be much better with new management. The employees are nice. Store could be organized better. Needs better benefits and pay.
good,not bad. I left after the Office Max/Depot merger. That pretty much destroyed whatever good the company had. The merger caused managers that had been working for the company 13+ years to lose healthcare. That was when I knew Depot didn't care and it was time to move on.
good,"This isn't every location, just in my location, in my opinion the job itself was okay but management was poor and by poor I mean rude and Superior. Some felt overworked, some felt underworked, and there was no in between. I didn't like to be spoken to act like a child by manager that's only 2 years older than me. You give respect and I respect you back I don't care who you are."
good,I like meeting new and ongoing customers I like being able to call a customer by name. When I finish a clients work and see a smile on there face makes it all worth while.
good,They're very numbers driven almost to a point of their own detriment. They like to focus on selling a product to a customer instead of hearing a customers needs and/or wants.
good,it was extremely slow and one of the worse places i every worked at. The management was horrid and seemed to not care about the customers or workers. The pay was terrible and they hardly would schedule you any hours. It was a good place for me when i first started but everything went downhill when the manager left.
good,The company is fast paced and always changing with the times. There are many opportunities to grow and learn with the company with the help of management.
good,"Your typical day will start with at least 100 emails and up to 250 emails per day from internal and external customers. The average work day is approximately 12 hours, leaving a very imbalanced work/life balance. "
good,"Office Max was very competitive in meeting daily sales goals."
good,"This corporation awards and celebrates inefficacy and wasting resources.  Company policy is short sighted and impractical for the market the store I worked in was located.  They pit stores against each other in an effort to increase sales but never take in the people living in the community into account and expect unrealistic results and sanction employees for looking out for the customers and not worrying about their ""goals""."
good,"Fun at times, good place to start if you are looking for a place while in college.  Management changes often.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the staff."
good,"I greatly appreciate the opportunities that Office Depot the company gave me in terms of experience. However, the store that I worked in particular had some of the worst management I have ever worked with. They wouldn't allow us to try selling merchandise in ways that we found the most effective, but by the way they forced us to. Also any opportunities that there were for promotions were immediately handed over to individuals that they knew instead of co-workers that had been in the company for a great deal of time."
good,Demasiado trabajo y no tienes tiempo para tu familia ambiente laboral un poco desagradable ya que contratan ala primera persona que deja solicitud con tal de llenar ese espacio disponible
good,Its a good first job but it is very repetitive and pretty boring. The low pay and short breaks hurt morale and make it tough to like working there. More often than not the employees are cool people and help the time go by. Wouldnt recommend for long term employment but its a good place to start.
good,they dont pay the employees well. If you are cashier you just stand there and do nothing. Management doesnt allow us to do anything else if you are cashier
good,"I did not have a good experience as an employee at this location. I took initiative to lean and grow, but was discouraged from doing so. I look for opportunities to build skills and this was not one of them."
good,Set tasks on daily basis. Medium paced work environment. opportunity to advance if patient. Experienced favoritism by manager. Enjoyed learning about new technologies in tech dept
good,"I worked here for two years and the entire store is just falling apart. This location has very poor training. The only reason this store is still in business is because of their copy & print center. Yet the managers don't take the print center seriously, they constantly put new, untrained people behind the counter and they have lost so much business because of it. At the end of my two years I was at $9.27 and the new cashier that they hired was at $9.75.... doesn't make any sense."
good,In the area I am at they seem to overpass long time employee's with experience to hire outside the company giving poor advancement opportunities.  The employee's at the store level are great it is the upper management that seem to overlook in company personnel to hire outside the company to fill the higher positions.
good,Do not really want to and feel this is something that is asked by a future employer then I will address this reason.  This is something that is very personal
good,Okay place to work. Low pay and no benefits for part time employees. Store also very understaffed. Constantly rude customers. No attendance policy so call outs all the time.
good,"The management at the store i worked at was awful, the store manager himself had little to no communication skills and didnt tell anyone anything or try to help unless otherwise instructed by the DM or if asked enough times by the associates."
good,"The job wasn't too bad.. The pay could be better for the amount of work needed. I worked in almost every position there, but since I applied part-time they kinda took advantage of the situation and I missed out on alot of potential money but also benefits."
good,"The environment is high-stress: low reward. Aside from dealing with management's rather high expectations, the customers are rather unruly and tend to miss basic signs throughout the store."
good,"New management in the last (3) months of my work life there. Under new management, I was able to learn new processes, different aspects of various positions."
good,"not an efficient place to work, low level workers expendable, not many perks, managers very focused on their own careers, no chance for advancement, favored men"
good,Always seen different things everyday but Management sucked. They screamed way too much were very disrespectful. They never gave credit to the people that deserved it and I will never ever work there again unless new management is established.
good,Last of hours mangers are complete idiots they cut your hours and just not a place to stay long term more of a temporary place of work in my honest opinion
good,"Officemax has many different rules and regulations designed to help the company, not the employee. Like hiring full time employees and then telling them after they have worked there, that there is no more full time and they are demoted to part time, however the managers and assistant mangers are still full time. Some of the managers pick on senior employees, and nothing is done to correct or challenge this behavior."
good,"Very stressful, go in at 5 am and never know what time you will get off. Very hard to get time off for vacation and doctor appt. Wish they could be more family orientated."
good,Lots of responsibilities and high expectations regarding entry level positions. Was expected to be able to flex over or help other parts of the store while also managing the one that I was assigned too.
good,Its very hard to care about your job when management doesn't care.  There is a reason why Corporate decided to close our warehouse.  Everyone knew what kind of place it was.
good,It is hard working here if you have a family and you have to work. I enjoyed my employees they made working enjoyable. It was easy to get promoted because everything is easy to learn in the fields.
good,At my location we were required to try to sell at least five extended warranties a day. This could be on something as large as furniture or as small as a calculator.
good,Working there I was happy. My manager was nice and was lenient with hours. it wasn't until after the store started closing that I Realized the manager and everyone I worked with was crooked.
good,"I like the company, I enjoy working for this Company , it was relax atmosphere with good coworkers made friends and we made sure to leave the work area clean and organized for next day. It was nice I really enjoy working there."
good,I moved up quickly there. Could do things people who had been there twice as long as me but my willingness to do more felt unappreciated. When a new position opened I wasn't even considered and a guy who had been there 6 months got it and I had been there 4 years. That's why I left.
good,"Office Depot is mainly another retail chain. While it's better than places, like Gamestop, or Wal-mart, where it's not overly scrutinized, it still is another retail corporation chain, where it's nothing honestly any more special than any other retail. Depending on where you're located, the customers are generally toxic and 85% ready to be angry at employees, for whatever reason. Copy and Print is always hectic, Technology is generally hectic year-round, overall it's an average work place for a retail store."
good,"I learned quite a lot working at Office Depot, though I felt like my duties there was constrictive. There had been a major shakeup with the company while I was working there so in retrospect that might explain why there was so many changes and restrictions there. I loved working with the customers and helping them find the right item for their needs."
good,"Its basic retail job. you help out customers, process payments, put products on the shelf. People I worked with weren't pretty good i guess. As a sales associate you just punch in punch out. As a part time i got to pick the shifts, i worked when I wanted and carried on with my life and school."
good,"El personal administrativo pesimo, los gerentes solo se enfocaban en vender y no les importaba el trabajador. "
good,"CPD Supervisor, who was also made to cashier because of corporate cutting payroll hours.  Corporate was always implementing more procedures and rules, to where it made it nearly impossible to just do our jobs and retain customers.  We lost a lot of customers with each change made.  The pay was very low for what was expected of the employees. If you got your break or lunch time, it was the exception rather than the rule."
good,It was a productive workplace that focused on customers and safety. But the productivity didn't match with the compensation. The hardest part of the job to reach your productivity rate along with your accountability of errors.
good,"This was a temporary job. From the start of this 3 month job, the manger said that they weren't planning on hiring anyone else. However, the needed another cashier. I was hired, but the week after I found out the store was closing soon. I was let go after 3 months and so we're a lot of other people."
good,"sometimes fast paced , sometimes slow. Learned a little about retail and what is necessary to work in retail. Management was ok, sometimes not too freindly. Breaks/lunches are not given regularly or on a timely basis..they are given only when there's time. Did enjoy the co workers under management."
good,The company culture was toxic when I left.  Constant fear of layoffs.  due to outsourcing.  Management was not forthcoming about upcoming changes.  Turnover high.
good,"Was always up front doing Manager on duty tasks. Manager never scheduled enough help for me to consistently ever get the operations work done. Was still held accountable for the work getting done. I did acquire a lot of customer service skills, conflict resolution and  problem solving skills. I improved my managerial skills tremendously over the last two years. Was always pressured and stressed out to reach deadlines. Always a stressed environment never happy."
good,"To corporate an environment."
good,"I was hired by the GM, knowing i was going to school, as the print manager. Then he left and I was then demoted due to my school schedule by the new GM."
good,"No me gustó trabajar allí porque el manager me robaba mis horas,Así que tuve que ir a La Oficina de trabajo y ponerle una demanda para que me pagará."
good,The company follows the trend most retail companies use now. They want workday flexibility. Associates are expected to learn several departments and their requirements. Associates must be ready to do almost anything that isn't management specific.
good,"En este trabajo muchos juzgan a la gente sin conocerla y empiezan a crear comentarios nada agradables sobre otras personas para perjudicar a compañeros, por todos lados donde voltees ves caras de desagrado, te encuentras con personas que se entrometen en tu trabajo sin poner atención a sus labores diarias, encuentras personas que solo buscan perjudicarte en faltan tes para tus labores, también hay personas que no saben trabajar en equipo y solo ven por su propio bienestar queriéndose brincar a jefes."
good,"Due to major merges and possible Staples merger, management was not able to provide the best work environment to full time employees and or contractors."
good,"Office Depot is undergoing many changes due to the failed attempt by Staples to acquire the company by the FTC.   Once the merger attempt was declined by the government, many people began their departures from the company. Those who stayed suffered from severe low morale and it became nearly impossible to get anything done.  It's a shame, this company will soon go the way of Radio Shack or Sports Authority."
good,was a good company to work for but now its not very nice to its employees. Office depot does not wish to pay comptitive pay to its employees. Managment has become combative towards it workers.
good,"I normally have 3 other associates, 1 at the cash register, 1 to help with customers, and 1 at copy and print."
good,Great People but industry dwindling that will not lead to further opportunities in the future. Management is pretty good and understanding of where the industry is trending.
good,"Office Depot is a challenging place to work.  They have strong core values.  Turnover, among exempt and no exempt employees makes is very tough to build a strong team."
good,"Their benefits were nice, but the pay was not equating to the job, due to lack of staffing. I was expected to do two persons jobs; they phrased it as ""super tech"" to make not it seem positive, but still paid same wage."
good,During the buyout it has been a very unfriendly company to work for. The DSM has been nothing but harsh and unfair in the transition process.
good,"slow and steady paced job, with constant interaction required with customers. Management is unorganized, and compensation is average, but some of the customers are great and make the job worthwhile, overall you know what you're getting when working at a officemax"
good,The company use to be awesome but in the department I am in things have gone downhill pretty quickly. The upper management (corporate level) doesn't support direct management.
good,Great place to work if you need flexible work hours for school or another job. Hard part of the job is getting notice for advancing in the company and getting management to take responsibility for their wrong doings.
good,The ones who were training me hardly did and I had to learn on my own and would get in trouble for not knowing something cause I was never taught
good,i worked for office depot for 2 years. i wasnt allowed over time. the only person who got 40 hours a week was an old man who had been ther for lie 10 years and a few managers.  they understaff. they under pay.  you probably dont wanna work here unless your looking for a toss job
good,"I did not like working here. Though the staff (seemed) to be sweet, they were very cutthroat with the exception of a few. Hours were always being cut due to lack of customers, and there wasn't too much room for advancement. Favoritism was a major issue. I was highly favored among my management, however, I don't agree how they treated everyone else."
good,"I worked hard everyday on my job for a year. This was my recent warehouse job. Management was very poor. I was on equipment like forklifts, reach trucks & pallet jacks. i worked super hard, it got to a point where everyday they would give me more & more work to complete in a small amount of time. I was on a 4 man job in the beginning & they dragged it down to just me. The job was ''paper'' we would grab the pallet of paper, label\scan it & deliver it to the truck it was assigned to."
good,"They tell you over and over that you are going to be promoted, but you never are.  You never even get your reviews and raises most times.  You fell overworked without enough pay very quickly.  You are always told to do things that were not in your original job description, and you do not get any additional compensation for it.  If you work on a position that you are able to get commissions, you will not get the commissions properly, either they are less that you were told, or you just don't get them."
good,Like any retail job the work is tedious and the management lacking but made some friends and had some cool customers. Just can't in good spirit recommend the job to anyone else. There are far better jobs out there.
good,I loved Depot until 2 years ago when the office max merger happen my whole building was taken apart and put back together with office max managers who do not know how to manage people or processes. Especially the General Manager.
good,"I worked at office depot in Pleasant Hill, CA for about eight calendar months and it got to the point where I became unhappy.  Worked consistent back to back closing and opening shifts for minimum wage.  What really made it frustrating was that the management hardly showed any appreciation for their employees.  The management was beginner to say at best.  Store manager refused help from other stores and with an unsuccessful store life, it closed down."
good,"Cannot recommend this company. Worked hard but, was unable to advance or grow in position due to poor management. Poorly run company, would not take risks needed to out-perform competition."
good,OfficeMax was bought by OfficeDepot. The transition has been stressful for long time employees in adapting to the OfficeDepot models.
good,"They never helped me if I didn't understand something"
good,Good place to work.  Opportunity for advancement if able to relocate.    The company has a very family oriented way of doing things.
good,"It has become a numbers company and not a people company."
good,"enjoyable, laid back environment. location closed. friendly co-workers. decent hours. management was flexible and very relaxed."
good,I am not too impressed with this company.  The benefit is not that good and the pay is not that great.  Its hard to get promoted and hard to get notice.
good,Management talks a good line but does not deliver to employees who are the front line for customer satisfaction.  Pay is minimum wage and hours are spotty and below 28 hrs/week.
good,"full-time, Human Resource work and supervise cashiers, responsible for the store, sale the items and insurance."
good,Very few opportunities to advance within the company.  Not the best place I could see myself having a career with.  I also did not like how the company was changing every second.  There were rules that were in place and would not stand for more than a couple of months.
good,Not here long enough. I don't feel they valued all associates. We make up a strong sales force. Did not have proper interview.
good,"due to all sorts of payroll cuts, i have to stock the shelves, fill ""outs"" reports and work on price changes (freight/logistics job). i also have to take care of non-tech customers in other areas of the store (like helping them find a specific pen). typical work force is 1 cashier, 1 copy center, 1 tech, 1 manager, and sometimes we dont even have a cashier half the day."
good,"A typical day used to begin with making sure the store was ready to open, any stock put away, and testing security systems. After opening, my job was to provide customer service, helping customers find products and assisting with choosing technology products, furniture, and office needs. I learned how to provide the best solutions for different needs in the office and at home."
good,A typical day at work will be calm until we close customers come rushing in. I have learned to appreciate the customer and to be patient and to handle any matter with ease. As for management they would need more work and have to gain more respect for and from the associates. My co-workers are team players sometimes but think they have more power then managers at other times. The hardest part of my job is when I ask for help and the manager expects me to to handle it by myself with no help. The most enjoyable part of my job would be interacting with the customers.
good,"Fast paced environment. Fast paced business. Fast paced life. If you are single, or hate your wife, this is an awesome job. You won't ever have to spend time with your wife cause you will always be working. This place is the queen of unrealistic expectation..  You will be backstabbed in a minute."
good,I was working for Crown Collections.Checked and packed coins for collectors.I met there many fantastic peopel.Job was easy but sallary not satisfaction.I had contract but sometimes when was not busy menagers send me and my friends home without pay.
good,Help the sort of folk that need help shopping at an office store
good,"I went to work at Office Depot in the copy and print center with 4+ years experience in printing/lithography and an extensive background in graphic design.  They started me off at 10.20 an hour, which was low but acceptable as I was only working part time and going back to school with my GI Bill."
good,I really don't have much to say other than office depot is a typical retailer who expects its employees to do a ton of work for little pay. Being a customer service specialist for OD is very exhausting considering the fact that they push you so hard to get to every guest that enters the building.
good,As a result of the merger between Office Depot and Office Max there is a reduction in work force.  The Illinois office of Office Max is being closed and as a result there are mass reductions in work force.
good,"I have been with the company 6 years, and I have learned a lot. A typical day at my job would be lots of multi tasking which I like doing. Keeps me busy, I work in Copy and Print most days because right now I am a little short staffed. I enjoy making business cards, banners, faxing, copying, scanning, creating invitations, labels, and making self inking stamps. I have learned quite a bit with photo shop, and use Microsoft word and publisher daily."
good,Worked here for multiple years while in college. Definitely a dead end job no matter what they tell you. They will feed you promises to keep you there. Turn over is high.
good,"A typical day at work involved me positively interacting with customers and providing quality customer service while promoting the current sales. My favorite part of the job was meeting the different people that I would encounter. The hardest part of the job was opportunities to advance; it seemed like once you were in a position you were stuck, you couldn't change. On numerous occasions at this job the upcoming week's schedule wouldn't be posted until the day right before the week started so it was hard to plan my social and family life outside of work which was a poor reflection on management's part."
good,Company with no direction! Numerous CEO's over a short period of time. Always changing their business model to keep up with the Jones's! Trying to compete with EVERYONE who sells office supplies instead of finding their nitch and sticking to it? Ask their managers to do everything and surround them with minimum wage associates who get/have no training/skills and ask them to be sucessfull?
good,"	Responsible for filling customers orders with completeness and correctness of all orders filled using a pick to voice device"
good,"Working here was a bit of a challenge at first; I was trying to balance working two jobs and raising a family but over all it was a good experience."
good,"A typical work day started with you clocking in and stating the prospects for that day then heading to your zone or register to begin working. Of course there would be rude cutomers and the occasionally nice ones. Management as far as the store manager was pretty cool. Store manager tried to meet everyone's needs as much as possible without showing any favoritism. I like that the store manager I had worked with customers just as much as the employees, but department mangers were rude, annoying and lacking the knowledge they needed to get the job done. If I needed help with something they wouldn't know how to do it and would walk away leaving you there with the employee fuming at you. Most things were beyond my control. Department managers were lazy and mostly stood around while you did everything. My co-workers were cool and fun. (best part of job) hardest part would be the that there was little to no communication between employees and management."
good,"I was part of the freight/logostics team.  We broke dowm pallets of product, put product out on the floor and overstock.  Also assisted customers, worked the register and helped out in the copy center.  I learned more than I ever wanted to know about office products.  Management was in general good, it was the exceptiont that stood out.  Co-workers were mostly great, slackers and thiefs didn't last long.  Coporate office is completely disconnected from what actually happens in stores."
good,Day to day activities where analyze baseline documents to build a business requirements document. Design an approach based on current legacy application. Code and test COBOL CICS DB2 VSAM MQ programs. Deploy to field locations in release fashion.
good,Fue una experiencia corta pero con un ambiente laboral muy comodo y sociable.
good,"Having worked for several retailers in the past, Office Depot is just about on par with all of them.  They constantly bang the drum of ""Customer Service"" without making it worth the employees time to provide customer service.  "
good,Okay to work as a part-time job. Was a great learning experience.
good,"I feel that the manager was not really easy to work with. He did not understand that people have lives outside of work. He was too serious all the time, and when he decided to joke it was highly inappropriate. The assistant managers were a lot better than the main manager was."
good,Nice work environment. Always a clean store. Friendly coworkers.
good,this was a good inbetween job. it asked crazy hours of me but I didnt really mind since it helped pay the bills while i was in school
good,Poor leadership with the good 'ol boy system of advancement which is very limited to begin with. Lacks proper sales training with defensive trainers.
good,"In my experience, The management was good and gave you the hours you needed. Then once new policies set and as well as new management, things went down hill from there. If you looking for a quick buck., this is your job....everyone else just keep searching"
good,"Steady schedule, but some issues with ethics in some regards, and management has little to no loyalty to under-staff."
good,The only benefit besides getting paid regular salary at this facility is the warehouse experience. Health benefits provided but not the best out there.
good,Company is constantly changing employee titles. I have been there for 4 years and the management model have shifted 3 times. Office Depot/ Office Max is a dying company.
good,"For the most part this job is a good job. It just has very poor managerment. It makes it uneasy to work for a company that is so one tracked. I have grown so much over the 3.5 years I have been here. I have come from a stocker to a machine operator with no experience. They took their time and trained me on the machines, so now I am great at operating any machines now."
good,"No saben que es cultura laboral, no respetan sus propias reglas y hay demasiado favoritismo"
good,It's a cool place to work at just there's many things that need to be fixed especially with management and hiring other associates. Many stores are struggling and have no help - they have to bring other employees from different stores to help out.
good,"Most positions here do not give adequate training, a lot of hiring up positions aren't filled from within. Raises are far and few between. I was even offered a promotion from supervisor to operations manager (2 tiers) in my store after five years with a $.25 raise. They actually put me in the position before I accepted without the training they promised or the minimum raise I asked for."
good,the hardest part of the job is not getting enough hours. and feeling like I did something wrong to get my hours cut. The manager is a good manager but I need more work
good,I can truly say I have learned a lot from this job many skills gained just from different interactions with customers but when you are good at your job everyone within the store feels they can slack and refuse to learn or train new hires management at my store is all men and I swear they are the laziest when it comes to having to step into my department when I am off or simply on break granted that is merely my store but I go above and beyond for my customers granted I shouldn't look for a handout or reward for my efforts but literally there is none the company offers a mere 20% on select items for employees and I won't even begin to explain how hard it is to accumulate paid time off
good,The company is failing. Corporate only cares about getting people out of the stores so they can do online business only. Management wont schedule properly so your always short staffed.
good,Not enough breaks. To much work for individuals who actually work rather then have everyone work as a team. The job environment is not great but some of the people there are nice
good,This job started as a great one. Then the work environment became extremely toxic because management and corporate don't care about anything other than meeting the (almost impossible to reach) goals set for the store.
good,"Learned many different skills that set me apart from others. Really liked working there, loved my job. Enjoyed the people and friendliness of those I had direct contact with. Made a lot of good friends. Hardest part of the job was dealing with Managers/Directors who didn't listen or care but acted like they did. Not all departments were like that."
good,"The particular location I worked at had terrible management at the time. The manager tried to tell you how to do your job when he had no clue how to do anything. The pay was minimum wage, which was ok for just getting out of high school but with little to no raise opportunities, I quickly left. I also applied to be in the print Center and it took them almost 6 months to finally train me in that section."
good,"I was able to learn a lot from Office Depot. I learned how to use the register, scan gun, printers and computers from copy & print. Gained knowledge of the varieties of inks for printers as well as other products. Learned how to process shipping orders, make barcodes and scan items. The difficult part of the job was having rude customers come in although I have met really nice customers. Overall it was good while it lasted."
good,Office Depot is a fast-paced goal driven environment. The expectation for performance is high. The Camaraderie between associates is great giving opportunity to work with other hard-working people.
good,Due to the yearly down sizing there are few people let in the compliance group.  The best part is we can work from home several times a week.  Office Deport is trying to move with the trends in it's market place and it is yet to be determined if an can be done.
good,Lack of communication with certain co-workers. Their always asking or keeping an eye on me when I’m always the one working. I’ve been here for awhile and I haven’t gotten any promotions.
good,le travail est  agréable nous sommes bien accueilli
good,"Mixture of types of coworkers. Many work pretty hard, however a few slack quite a bit and are constantly on their phones, yet they get paid more than me and my coworkers who started before. The management is quite bad and very unorganized. They can be quite condescending and rude at times as well as completely unappreciative of the hard work that the employees put in. No matter how much work you do, there's a good chance you'll still be lectured for not doing more. The whole store is overall quite unorganized. Customers tend to be quite nice, however there are always the rude ones, just like at any store. As a female, I am also sexually harassed and objectified quite often by customers. I have brought it up to management and not much has been done to prevent it."
good,I worked here for almost a year it started off as a well job but of course every job does just cut the slack its a very bad place ot work for i liked it because of my coworkers but the company overall in general was terrible I wouldn't recommend anyone work here honestly!
good,driving around the DC Area everyday was a bit of a strain. I learned how to work with my clients to help them get what they needed. Management was stressful because without understanding what was going on made decisions that made no sense.
good,"No mas de 3 puntos como calificación general, office depot no es lo que parece."
good,"I hated this job. It was very boring, the manager was a jerk, and I wouldn't recommend working here...ever. I was referred to as ""just a cashier"", no interaction with clients unless I was ringing them out. Didn't get to learn the layout of the store because I was expected to stay close to the register. The employees I worked with were amazing people, and I loved working with them. The manager needs to be replaced. He spends most of his time in the office, has poor customer skills, rude and demeaning to his employees."
good,"Good environment to learn if you are a newly promoted manager, not so good if you already have manager experience. Require a lot without helping you get the tools you need to succeed"
good,Just an average part time job. Nothing special. Wages were horrible with an increase not very viable. People were usually rude and corporate did not care about the retail side.
good,Worked in CPD. Not very organized. Management is very biased. Not much room to move up. Management gets what they want. Not very diverse. Push wrong products for numbers.
good,"The company has begun to realize that the normal retail model is no longer viable, so it has burdened it's workforce with the task of creating a market from the existing client base with minimal training on the new direction. As a team in a local retail store this change can seem a bit daunting. My tenure here has provided a plethora of knowledge on what pitfalls to avoid, and how not to be reactive to the market, rather set trend."
good,worked the customer service desk. Learned the was to help with loss prevention. Management has a high turn over. Workplace culture was  diverse and workers worked together to complete task. hardest part was no being able to please a customer. enjoyable things were the problem solving with a positive outcome.
good,"En el área donde me desempeñaba el trabajo era bueno y la convivencia también, lo único malo es que se retrasaban con el tiempo extra y salario."
good,"Poor workflow, management and teamwork with poorly enforced ""workconomy"". With the lack of proper upfront training makes for poor employees, suffer from "" do as i say not as I do!"" Syndrome which is detrimental to a qork environment like office depot office max, I told not all are the same as the one i worked but can only go from my work environment"
good,"On a positive note, I've learned so many thing here on both management and associate levels and for that I'm grateful. "
good,"If you have worked one retail job you have worked them all. Daily activities included trying to sell product protection plans for a small commission, dusting products, and stocking shelves."
good,"not able to work a full 40 hr week due to rate of pay, schedule is usually 33-38 hrs per week, no paid holidays, store is only closed 2 days per year, Thanksgiving & Christmas unpaid . expectations are very high for all associates,."
good,"Being here for five years and being in a specialty department has taught me a few things: the workload is ridiculous for only one person to work on, expectations are too high when it comes to hitting metrics instead of the happiness of the workers, and I will never get a day to myself where I am not bothered or take my paid time off at my own leisure. Due to being in the print department, I have a very small team that dwindles to nothing if there is less than three people. It requires us to bend out of place so far that we do not have our own personal time to relax and recuperate. I have watched everyone from my senior sales personnel to my assistant managers leave over the course of five years, and they have all stemmed back to the job having unrealistic expectations and making us work like robots."
good,the managers were kind and caring and always made sure their employees were taken care of and awarded employees for their hard work with either buying breakfast or lunch for all employees.
good,"M-F Distribution job that pays bi-weekly. The annual pay raises could be considerably better(roughly 25 cents a year), and the benefits could improve as well(very expensive insurance). The job itself is good. Multiple areas within the warehouse to work. Just need to bug your supervisor regularly until they finally provide you with an opportunity to train in other areas. If you never say anything, they will never offer it."
good,"shifting work to 11am to 12pm."
good,"If you are a student or a person working for a supplemet, job is okay. Not good if you need a good salary based job. Corporate insists on your progress depending on how many customers signed up for extra income for them such as Membership to Rewards program, selling extra coverage on their equipment, etc. They are not consistent on break times and lunch hours. Was not busy enough to keep you interested during slow seasons. More or less push employees in learning about different departments on your own. Generally not an interesting job for me.  The one thing I did enjoy was that I had good communications and understanding with the Office Manager. I was trained in retail and customer service differently than the way its done today. Today the policy is GET'EM IN AND OUT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE !!!!"
good,"I worked as a Cashier,Sales Consultant, and Stocker. Getting up early to get in at 6am to immediately unload boxes until 11am. Sometimes they would just not let me be cashier and always do the heavy work. When I would ask or tell management I was going to go to lunch, managers  would give me an attitude since I wouldn't be around to help them with the heavy work. When they call me on my day off to come in and politely say I can't, they would immediately hang up or also give me attitude over the phone. "
good,"Management is horrible at office depot, they over work you , have no compassion and lack common sense.  Bulk/putaway manager macus & henski sexually harass the women and blame their behavior on performance"
good,"El empleo estaba bien, el problema es que de supervisor para arriba tienes que ""vivir"" en la tienda desde 7 am hasta 8 o 9 pm  todos los dias, sin poder descansar en algunas ocasiones"
good,The job is good for students. You don't get home late and its fairly easy to do. not many people work there at the same time as well. Communication is key at the store so its easy to ask for help if needed.
good,"When i first worked there, I had an amazing store manager. He listened to what his employees needed. If you needed more hours he would try to push and pull things around for you. He ended up moving on and we got a new store manager. Complete opposite and put his favorites/friends over the other associates. The work pace could be slow or fast depending on the time of year i.e back to school is really fast paced but around the spring its really slow and you would get maybe the few constantly returning customers back for the print center or tech department. There is advancement available but you have to check and go for it yourself. They never tell you when there is an opportunity for advancement."
good,Its a job. Nothing too exciting. I had to do copying and creating jobs. Handling online orders. Dealing with customers and helping them create a nice document.
good,"-Busy environment"
good,"A typical day consisted of being drowned by more asinine corporate plans designed to attempt to save a failing company, always saying yes to customers no matter what, and a cold silence from corporate about problems causing company monetary failures. Other than immediate coworkers being great, the rest of the job was awful."
good,"Loved the steady pace of work, only concern was the lack of consistency from management. Workplace culture can be improved, suggestion to senior management, don't let one bad manager spoil the bunch."
good,"This was my first job and it definitely was not what I thought it to be. I didn’t have many good coworkers, they would mostly stick to their selves and not really help me."
good,The thing about Office Depot (Now with Office Max) is that you are often asked to do things not in your area of expertise. When hired I quickly became a jack of all trades. It didn't help that only 15 people worked for my store and I made peanuts compared to people hired after me.
good,"Lamentablemente las dueñas del negocio hacen que este tipo de trabajo sean aburridos y muy desanimadores, por que al ser empresa extranjera quien que trabaje uno enfriega y no se le reconoce el esfuerzo al trabajador nomas lo pisotean."
good,It's not the ideal job. Lots of stagnation and upward mobility is near impossible. Hard work and advancement do not go hand in hand it seems. Philosophy seem to be trying to get blood from a stone.
good,"While learning the ins and outs of retail is a worthwhile experience, and my coworkers were generally nice and respectable people... The rest of the systems in place are inefficient, outdated, disorganized, and/or hypocritical."
good,"It use to be a good  company  40 hours But now they let the  scheduler take over,I  get 30 to 32 hours a week . OD under pays it employees for what then can do.  With OD base out of Fl, maybe the should take a look at how Publix Supermarket take care of there employees"
good,"Very easy job, where customers often know what they need. Customer service can vary day-by-day, but most of the tasks are easy now since items are kept in an electronic mobile device."
good,"The Independence store is around 1/3 the size of the regular stores.  The only full time employees are managers or the print supervisor.  "
good,Working in the printing department was fun if you have the passion for it. It was great learning about different type of printing and editing on different programs like photoshop. We had a ton of orders that would come through in our department. Most times it was only 1-2 people working in the department so when it got busy it can get stressful. Especially when there was big orders to fulfill while trying to help walk in customers at the same time. The store manager was not the nicest manager but working in the printing department allowed me to not really have to deal with it.
good,The hardest part of working at Office Depot was the manager by far. He would assign meaningless tasks while you're actually doing something important.
good,I worked there a long time ago. We were budgeted over 1000 hours when I started with 3 managers. By the time I quit we were budgeted about 500 hours and 2 managers even though we had same business. It became frustrating because it was very hard to provide adequate customer service.
good,"Not bad, but could be a little better with management. Pay did not meet expectations with job responsibilities. Part time can work crazy hours. Unexpected days off are hard to come by"
good,The store that I worked at got shut down so I wasn't able to stay there very long. Store Manager could have been better. Honestly think he is the reason that the store got shut down. You have to push a lot to customers so I wasn't a fan of that.
good,"As a supervisor I learned the Inside and Outside of the print center, which is very fast paced, time sensitive work. There is a constant influx of jobs to do and people to help"
good,"I am usually a cashier so typically I stay on the front end of the store.  I am good friends with a lot of my coworkers so that makes a workday a lot less stressful because I am surrounded by familiar faces.  The management could be better.  Sometimes they are awesome and sometimes there are attitudes that are unleashed upon the employees.  The hardest part of the job is handling difficult customers because as nice as I am, it's hard to deal with people who are blatantly rude.  The most enjoyable part is the overall environment."
good,"It is a good company to work for, but I prefer to work for a small to mid size company it is more my pace.   I want to be happy and I am not happy working here."
good,"The section where I work is chronically understaffed for the workload, with no end in sight under the current manager.  There also has been favoritism shown for certain personnel. On the plus side, there is consideration given to schedule availability, which is why I have stayed this long."
good,It is a good place to work but I am looking to grow and hopefully move out of state. I have made great connections throughout the years in that place and thankful for what I have learned.
good,"Like all other retail companies, bad district manager, every store is treated different depending on how close they are with the district manager. Many managers we able to fail up the chain. Run your store into the ground ""here let me give you a bigger store"" no accountability between stores and managers."
good,"Definitely do not get paid the right amount for the job you do. Do not get many hours.  Employees were horrible and disrespectful. All employees talk about each other and keep you from doing your best. The managers are great but will not give you an opportunity to advance in the company. The jobs you want and work for,  they give to random people off the street."
good,"I was hired as a part time cashier. "
good,"Its a great company in a whole to work for.  Management opportunities are there for the person of choice.  Not based on experience or knowledge.  Great place to build customer relationships wit,"
good,"I enjoyed working for Office Depot. I learned the copy center, the receiving department and I cashiered. I made many friends there that I am still friends with today."
good,My manager was great .he taught me everything I needed to know.they all was very friendly.I always enjoyed comeing to work .and the pay was pre5y OK .
good,Not a steady job to support oneself as the pay is low and the hours fluctuate constantly. Working with customers does develop one's people skills as well as drain.
good,"Great if you need experience in the field of technology"
good,"Basic retail job, very stressful, copy and print area is a lot of project management and getting it all done on your own. Gives you good experience with photoshop and editing photos and documents. Didn't really care for the management or my coworkers so I kept to myself."
good,"Many unnecessary changes coming from corporate since the Office Depot merger. "
good,"This company really is a good place to learn sales, however once you've learned, everyone is obsessed with one-upping you. You go into a sales war zone and the benefits are so little it's hard to want to fight as hard as the rest of the associates."
good,"I've been working here two years.  The employee turnover rate is ridiculous, they underpay for everything that they expect you to do.  I've had multiple managers that have quit within the last 2 managers and out of all of them, one has actually made this place bearable to work in. There is no advancement within the store. A lot of talk about it, but no actions to pursue the advancement. Overall, it's good sometimes but most of the time you end up hating your life and wanting to walk out everyday."
good,"I worked at 2 different Office Depot stores. The first one had a very abusive environment. Management was unprofessional. They had me on register or floor restocking and cleaning but never cared to keep my mind fresh and train me in new tasks. The Store Manager verbally abused me and possibly other employees. When I went to HR, they didn't do anything about it. I switched to another store and this one was very friendly and had a good environment. They kept me busy and always took time out to train me in new areas. The CEO and company itself doesn't seem to care about it's employees."
good,In the beginning I really enjoyed working there until in 2014 office depot announced that they were going to buy office max in with the new and out with the old
good,"The job is fine, but hours get really spotty when it's not the holiday season or back-to-school. I averaged around eight hours a week last winter there."
good,"It's an alright place to work for a first job, but there are a lot of internal struggles that make themselves known. No one tells you much about what the benefits of getting the rewards programs are, and you're not told too much information to give to customers. Coming from a cashier, the system is weird and sales don't ring up until I total out their order and I'd like for that to be changed. Co-workers are pretty easy-going, and the interview was the most ""chill"" interview I've ever been to. You definitely get a lot of freedom, but if you're hoping to be a cashier: Don't. Cashiers get the short end of the stick by not having anything to do half the time, yet we have to look busy with something."
good,Promotions in management only come to people who are buddy-buddy with the district manager. Managers positions are heavily skewed to men. Workload is unevenly distributed and relies on who your direct report is.
good,"I would have like this job a lot but the organization was not very good. There were several items in the store that were price marked incorrectly and no one seemed to be in a hurry to fix it. Since I was a cashier, that problem always fell upon me and many customers got upset with me because of the unorganized merchandise. Also, a typical day at work consisted of me just standing at the register waiting for a customer to come and check out. I like to be busy and preoccupied at my job so this did not go well with me. Overall, I did not enjoy this job because of their lack of organization and the lack of customers we had."
good,"Management wast great, they didn't efficiently use the employees time and skills properly. Everyday i felt like I was wasting my time and i wasn't helping as much as i could."
good,"I'm cashier, print associate , store associate and technology. So I do a lot at work on a regular day. all they expect is you to sell warranty's and get sign ups."
good,Office Depot was a fun place to work. It had terrible management systems. Unfair treatments. Not many hours provided. A good part time or high school job.
good,"With my time at OfficeMax, I find that customer service is a great skill to have as it helps deal with situations either good or  bad. The short staff does lead to short breaks and more tedious tasks for the current employees."
good,"I've worked at Depot for many years, and the biggest problem I've had is dealing with management at the corporate level. They really don't seem to care about keeping people in their company. The way they make the advancement structure makes it so difficult to get a decent pay increase with a promotion. The best way to get into the company seems to be to leave and come back asking for a higher pay. "
good,Corporate adds more work/paper work and or processes that seem like good ideas but have not been tried and tested. Staff wants to do what best to help company yet seems to look for ways to squeeze more from staff without giving anything back. Corporate needs to look at stores with different demographics and markets adjust. The area I work the job market is fairly healthy and so to hire reasonably good team members a higher hourly wage is needed or you get revolving door as better higher paid jobs are available elsewhere. Same goes for managers salaries they are barely above entry level and under valued based responsibilities.
good,I started as a cashier moved up to the cash office then Customer Service mgr. At the time it was OfficeMax /Copymax it was a fun work environment then because there wasn't much competition.
good,"As an entry level manager, great place to start out! There is flexibility to develop your leadership skills and management style. Workload is manageable if the store is well staffed."
good,"helped customers with print jobs.learned a lot about computers and how to make designs for print jobs such as banners, blue prints, business cards and large print jobs.management lacked a lot.different managers not on the same page.hardest part of the job was pressure on sales such as protection plans and management.enjoyable part was learning more about computer work."
good,There isn't much room for advancement here. It's a great starter job for while you attend school. It's very difficult to be fired which can be a good but bad thing as well. For the most part the majority of staff is very friendly. Often times though there isn't much communication which makes working sometimes frustrating when not everyone is on the same page. Training lacks substance. You don't always get your break or lunch.
good,"Nice coworkers "
good,"Great people to work with, but company does not seem to value their employees. Never enough people scheduled so when it does get busy (usually pretty slow at nights), there is not enough coverage."
good,"Company underwent several potential mergers and buyouts creating disruption in the workplace. Turned over 3 GMS in 3 years trying to compete with other DC's. "
good,"Day to day job, no excitement or variety and no room for advancement. No perks and concern of the operations manager was to slave drive as much as he could make everyone."
good,its a good place to work to get experience in customer service and also good educate you about electronics.... also is good to get the knowledge from the printing departament. You will also get to meet great people.
good,"Office Depot  has a culture do to who you know rather than what you know. Dailey reports to be completed on time and completed 100%. "
good,"Scheduling could be a bit better (i.e. lunch/break/work), managers are very lenient (depending on how much effort you put in your work)."
good,"The general manager had favorites and made it known, thus eliminating my position all together. I enjoyed most of the staff they made it better to work but the constant pressure the manager puts on his employees so he could take off early is not acceptable in my book and he never closed the store he always worked day times and never nights or weekends."
good,"This was my first job right out of highschool. The pay and hours are good for the college student who can still live with their parents. However, it does not accommodate for a higher pay in order to have a sustainable living."
good,The trouble with a niche store like this is the internet and online purchases are causing sales to decrease in stores for the convenience of internet sales.
good,"Great place to gain plenty of experience, better understanding customer service and how to be a team player. The hardest part of the job was that there were no associates that had departments, everyone had to know them all. This was also the best part because you were cross trained on all the areas of the store and were a expert in all fields."
good,"Hay mucho trabajo por hacer, y no se tiene el apoyo del jede directo para poder hacer las ventas."
good,"Management played favorites and never appreciated any of the work I did with the few months I worked there. I myself had put in very strenuous hours of hard work under the pretense that it would pay off every morning and my manager would be happy, yet every single day she was rude to employees such as myself, and customers. This made for a very below satisfactory workplace that I would never work at again."
good,"The company is in a numb state where there is more uncertainty that a nice work environment."
good,"The team is great. Everyone sticks together. Management is varying within the store, so my attitude toward management varies. Customers have entitlement issues. The store is ALWAYS busy. There is no break."
good,"I am basically a crossed-train employee that does mostly everything at OfficeMax ranging from being a cashier, sales associate, stocking, logistic, set planograms, do print services, and do tech services. I do all these things very well it is my first job and I do not even get paid well like I am basically doing 4 peoples job all at once. A typical day for me is if I open with a manger, I print price changes and some reports. After price changes are done I do the Fill Report and days where the store has a scan I have to do those reports too but while im doing those reports I have to help customers and maybe sometimes truck and cashier at the same time. My management team is pretty simple but sometimes are dumb to be management like no one is on the same boat or on the same stories. If I work with one manager that manager can do something very different than another manager would have done. Everyone does everything different which causes some pile ups and no one can keep there stories straight. Co-workers are the people that makes you want to come to work and the customers with the dramas also make you want to come to work to deal with them and make there day shittier. The best thing about my position is that I could do anything and I do not have to be in one spot and I can do whatever I feel like saying that it benefit for the store. The hardest part of  the job is dealing with so many dramatic customers who think they are always right and bring there sad day into other people. Why is the price so high? Well I don't know because I don't set the price and if i did I would have"
good,"Some days I love it, others I hate it. I'm a people blesser so customer are great. Working for a big company is hard.I really do love what I do just not who I work for,"
good,The management of this particular store give no training to new employees and when questions are asked they act as though you are incompetent. The pay is so low that you have take a second job due to the fact you can't get enough hours to make it even worth staying there. The store manager was not willing to work with scheduling to allow to have a second job. Also the district manager was Napoleonic person who belittled the staff whenever he/she came in.
good,This is an okay place to work. If you have friendly managers then its bearable. The biggest problem with working here is dealing with the unorganized and unhelpful higher ups.
good,"It is a great workplace, but the management has some things to work on. The store manager does not know how to apply work hours across the associates. You are able to tell that the managers do not communicate, meaning that they were a lot of things unorganized and I was to blame even when the schedule proved me to be absent."
good,"Heavy customer foot traffic. I learned how to utilize photoshop, Microsoft publisher, adobe illustrator and other computer skills. Management is unorganized, does not care about there employees and managers seem to be inadequate to their work load. Hardest part of the job is the management."
good,Estar mas unidos como equipos para lograr mayor ingresos y atender alos clientes de manera paciente y amable
good,"Fun and easy going, but understaffed and overwhelming. Need more help, but over all a decent place to work for. My co workers are great, their all hard working, funny and loving people i consider family."
good,i would come in from 4p.m to closing. i learned how to deal with customers and how to make they day better. the management was fine i just think i wast getting paid enough. my co worker was reliable and dependable. hardest part was when the store was empty and i had to just stand there. i love seeing the smile on a satisfied customer face
good,The business has changed dramatically over the past 3 years due to the decline in revenue in the USA and Europe. The current merger has impacted the business massively and OD have put in place some questionable changes and restructures which have left the future uncertain for all employees.
good,"Fast work environment, learned some warehouse computes skills such as QA and printing labels, the management was really poor,, and the hardest part of my job was not having an exact end shift time."
good,"Me gusta mucho que es aun trabajo rotativo y e aprendido de distintas áreas, de esta manera comparto mis conocimientos con los demás y eyos lo hacen conmigo."
good,merger activities frustrating but a great learning experience.  Good people in the field.  Corporate leadership is a mess with competing objectives.
good,"Generally, I work on a crew that works at a fast pace. We stay on task to maintain the truck orders and stock for each shift. My job consists of three different crews, however I have built a great relationship with the people I work with. The people I work with are the best part of my job and the most enjoyable. I work swing shifts and sometimes seven shifts straight. The shifts can be very hard on spending time with my family."
good,"Working at Office Depot when they were constantly downsizing and cutting costs was not the best experience. The store manager generally did their best and cared, however it was not an enjoyable place to work."
good,"It is okay if you have no warehouse experience to for this company but if you have experience already, it is not the best option. There is no set time of you getting out of work. The benefits are not great and there is not a guarantee of a good incentive."
good,"The company went from being a fun place to work to a stressful place in the last year through the merger with Office Depot.  The migration of systems was done with little to no training, and the expectations were set too high given the problems with the system migrations.  "
good,A company that takes more from employees than it gives. Typical fortune 500 mentality of bottom line strategies to appease wall street rather than investing in its own future.
good,"I enjoyed the staff. Training was all over the place. Not planned out. I was suddenly put into the Store manager role through the holidays. Without proper training of systems, work flow and staffing. The district manager was not available. No network set up to ask questions"
good,"Really busy business, short staff leads to long hours and little or no breaks. Learned a lot of computer skills and improved on my customer service skills."
good,"Internet shopping and recent merger with Officemax make for some schedule and payroll discrepancies that are sub par what I expected. The hours are average yet monotonous and the only good part is dealing with people. The compensation and ""commissions"" are a joke."
good,"Descent pay, not much room for advancement. No guaranteed commission payouts. Flexible and easy going management. Not very busy store site."
good,"I love my job and many of those i work with, we have a fantastic team. Honestly, though I make $8.50 and hour and I work my butt of for my department. I know the basics of all departments because we are usually understaffed, yet my store manager refuses to give me more hours or even a full-time position. I'm, in the copy and print department, well trained on every machine as well as all the tips and tricks, yet i make as much as a cashier. I don't understand why."
good,"Like any retail business, you will have your good days and your bad days. But there will always be that one customer that makes it worth it. You will meet all sorts of people. Retail is not for the weak. You need to know many things and be able to juggle tasks. Print center provides an outlet for the creative.  While it is a high stress area, you will never be bored or do the same things repeatedly.  Every day is a new adventure."
good,Management is flity one day your ok and the next your being accused of something that's far from truth. Always under staffed. Which is a stressor for all employees.... Customer service is lacking as the expectations of multiple job functions deter you from the customer or from the projects given. Either way no matter what you choose to do your under the gun cause of the unrealistic time frames they give you to complete them.... Since Depot bought out Office max it's gotten worse.... The pay is substandard for what the job entails.... And the training is almost non exsistent... Kinda show you and then throw you in the fire to watch you burn then get your butt chewed for not completing tasks within their unrealistic time frames.....
good,"Check department sales and overall store sales from the previous day.  Have daily meeting with staff before store opening, talked about daily sales goals with staff.  Hardest part of the job was selling the company insurance with the furniture and electronics that we sold.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting our customers to see the importance of have our company insurance when buying our furniture and electronics."
good,"With OfficeMax I worked in the impress department they are friendly and they give you the hours. "
good,"Por lo regular los dias mas pesados eran lunes, miercoles y viernes ya que en esos dias llegaban muchos cambios de prcio y promociones y para esto tenias un limite de hasta las 11hrs de la mañana. Habia unas veces que nunca se acaba todo a esa hora sino mas tarde."
good,"Just I job I had when I was a teenager. They gave you hours depending on how hard you can work. Work hard, get paid....that simple. Disappointed they never gave me a shot to become a computer salesmen"
good,once again lousy management ! I worked 3 depts. front end as lead cashier. lead stocker. also receiving from truck completing all paper work. also I sold over 850 thousand in furniture sales. then I was pulled from that dept. then was fired ! Durning my unemployment hearing they lied 3 different times about why I was fired ! I did win the hearing.
good,"The Sr. Sales Consultant, CPD is responsible for completing all print orders correctly and within the quoted timeline, and assesses whether the Regional Print Facility should be utilized. The associate in this position will assist with the training of CPD Sales Consultants and also provide cross functional training for other associates within the store. Additionally, the Sr. Sales Consultant, CPD, will perform daily and weekly maintenance of the CPD area."
good,"Typical day consists of disgruntled coworkers and customers. I like the structure the company has and their aim to provide quality service to all their customers. Approach the customer and Welcome them to the store following your offer to help or ask questions to help the find exactly what they need. "
good,merger with office depot and office max has not bee smooth. may changes. lots of lost missing info. no communication. very stressful for myself and peers
good,"The center was a great place to have a good balance of work and home life, and a lot of opportunities for increasing income through increasing sales."
good,"Management and co-workers were really nice and knowledgeable. fun place to work. Not very busy, unfortunately. Lots of cool gadgets and learn to sell products and yourself."
good,unload  truck  to be loaded on to truck. I  learned if I came in early I would be the only one unload. Management was ok. Co workers  where ok.  Hardest part trying to work by your self unloading a truck when evering  has falling of the pallet. most enjoyable driveing
good,Work day was always slow and boring. Never got enough hours. co-workers were fun and easy to work with. management was very nice. hardest part of the job was the down time
good,Great co-workers.  Lack of leadership evident at all levels.  No training program to speak of. A good deal of physical labor involved. An employee here needs to be self-motivated.
good,i was a cashier at office depot. my duties were to help check out each and every customer. working at office depot was really not for me. we werent getting as much business as i thought we would get. when i work i like to stay busy.
good,"most days we just down stocked isles"
good,It started out as a great place to work for but management has ruined it. I love what I do and the steady customer flow.
good,"Office Depot requires employees to learn how to perform many tasks, and this would be one of the aspects that I enjoy about working for Office Depot, however the starting pay is not competitive. The job requirements prepare employees for advancement within the organization, which is beneficial for the employees. High performers get recognition at store meetings. An aspect, I would change about the organization is that I would provide employees with more training. Because of the limited training, employees are required to take the initiative in order to learn about the products and services by observing, reading product information, and asking for assistance which his not always available. As a results, there are times in which customers are not served within a reasonable amount of time. There are also many days in which the store is understaffed. This also leads to customer dissatisfaction because of the long wait."
good,Its an ok place to work. Since the merger things have really fallen off.
good,"there were to many games being played, the use of headsets was more of a hinderance due to the chatter that the mangment required in order to boost morale. Thier was also a sepration of the staff not by the normal lines but by the store manger picking his favorites and not being fair with anyone eles."
good,se trata de gestionar el punta de venta sabiendo lo que necesita el cliente y ofertandole posibles productos rentables para su negocio
good,"Plenty of chances for advancement. Great support form Managers."
good,"Everyday is different, this can range from picking up the phone and organising a same day delivery which could take 30 minutes to process, or 2-3 hours of ringing around and research for your dedicated Accounts."
good,"Management is Very lackluster"
good,The payroll is so small that employees are limited and cannot callout without risking the store being short all day. No real room for moving up in management. Tries to work with limited hours but horrible at scheduling. Great staff. Good company.
good,most enjoyable part was working with my co-workers and learning new things from others.
good,"I learned many things working for Office Depot, one being the value of teamwork. When working as a selector the team couldn't go home unless the work was finished. This motivated employees to work together to get the job done faster so everyone would get home at a reasonable time."
good,"My biggest issue with Office Depot is that, being a large corporation, there is little room for innovation. Be prepared to be told you can't implement good ideas because ""corporate"" doesn't allow it."
good,"When I first started working here, it was a fun and energetic workplace. Lately management has become lazy, trying to put their duties and responsibilities on to their employees. Management also tends to show heavy favoritism, none more so when I, an employee for almost 3 years, was not even informed that there was a full time position opening. Instead it was given to an employee, who is a great worker, who had been there for barley over a year. The store manager showed no remorse and started trying to make excuse as to why I was not informed of the opening. I had been bringing up becoming a full-time employee since I started working at the store, but apparently if they like someone more than you, even if you work your butt off every day, your not going to move up."
good,"Office Depot is a very corporate driven workplace. I have been able to work with some amazing Managers, and I observed some less that acceptable behaviors.During the years with Office Depot I ran my department. I organized, filed, designed, and ordered supplies for my department. I was also in charge of directing 3 employees and training. I maintained great customer relationships and attracted business for my company. By the time I left the company, moral among employees was at an extreme low and many good employees had been offered other jobs."
good,"a typical day at work depends on the shift that you are working. if you are working a logistics shift, you will unload pallets of freight, sort it and put it on the shelf and then clean up. the hardest part is the time allowed to do the things required. co-workers depend on the job."
good,management would tell all of the customers your personal business. They didn't like anyone going to school because they wanted you to work all the time.
good,"It is a non related job but enjoyable."
good,"Learned alot in my 14 years there. Management listened and trained fairly well. Advancement was slim and could have done a better job at cross training employees. My last 6 years I traveled for the company as a Special Projects Manager opening new stores, remodeling old stores to new company standards and formats.Being away from family was one of the most difficult parts of the job however, going into a new store and reshaping it and turning back over to the Store Manager bigger and better was the best feeling ever."
good,office depo had great health care benifits ..thing i didnt like was mangers ..one didnt know what the other one was telling you to do...
good,"A typical day of work would include me getting there at 7am, and throughout the day I would perform the necessary duties of a cashier, and handle the occasional upset customer, returned items, phone calls, etc.. I learned a few valuable sales techniques, and also some information about office supplies. The management was sub-par. They didn't know how to treat employees in a respectful, polite manner, and they didn't have much integrity (excluding one manager). My coworkers were fantastic, I got along with everyone and they were always nice to me. Hardest part of the job was standing in the front with nothing to do. "
good,"It was a typical retail job, worked cash register when needed, helped customers on the sales floor, stocked the entire store, and provided tech support for computers and laptops."
good,Typically I would be scheduled in the print department where I would perform copy and print duties. 
good,I had a basic routine that was fairly clear cut. I had problems with management because the store managment was inconsistant. I also had to notify corporate office to report an assistant manager who was sexually harrassing me. The investigation was concluded after the assistant manager denied his inappropriate behavior.
good,"Very little advancement opportunity, a lot of favoritism from management toward certain employees. Lack of time management for breaks and lunches. Stores do not run the same as required. Accusations from management when things are not going well in specific areas of the store. Hours cut so far back a responsible adult can not makes end meet."
good,"I would enter building and read emails of everything that needed to be completed for the night. Priortized my tasks and moved on inspecting the 8 miles of conveyor, noting any additional findings. I learned something new everyday working with priorities and the mechanics of a production atmoshere. I communicated effectively with numerous management personnel and had a strict but fair manager that was my direct supervisor. We formed a team that no matter when someone called anyone would come in to help and if there was someone out sick there was never an issue to cover the shift. Understanding why there was no accountability and employees were allowed to do what they want. Job satisfaction came from completing projects and eliminating the chance of a possible down time. Plus training of lower subordinates and even teaching some new things to my higher echelon."
good,A typical day at work is very fast passed. I learned different routines and methods on stocking and inventory.
good,meeting new customers daily and helping customer daily questions.
good,At office depot is a complicate part time job. They do not offer promotions in my department and the compensation is low.
good,"OK for a first job. Co-workers were great and fun to work with. I didn't get enough hours and management was passive-aggressive. I felt that there wasn't enough training, and there was only 1 performance review per year. I did not click with the company's values whatsoever (worklife). The store was in desperate need of remodeling, which happened just before I left."
good,"When I started there I loved my Job, I still like it but 90% or MORE of all employees will say there is a major communication problem with management and HR. I am not afraid of any job I perform and always do my best."
good,Can be extremely stressful if the wrong personality type in put in the department. Current Copy and Print Deparment manager is wonderful to work with.
good,Check to ensure that appropriate changes were made to resolve customers' problems. Compare disputed merchandise with original requisitions and information from invoices. Refer unresolved customer grievances to designated departments for further investigation.
good,The problem with this company is that they don't have a training program.
good,Slow paced in the store i was placed at. Great customer service and pay was great. I learned new things in the copy and print center which will help me in the future. Hard to complete projects when there is no time alloted just for that.
good,Great place to work for a college student or high school student. Very hard to advance your career or make enough money on the salary to be able to support yourself or your family.
good,"Its a base level  job if you are looking to start out in retail ."
good,Company was great to work for in the beginning over past 2 years it has been miserable. To many changes in leadership had much to do with this. I needed a change.
good,Company has changed.  Used to be a great place to work but the culture has changed.  The way the culture and sales are trending might not be the best place long term.
good,"I enjoyed some managers at Office Depot, however, they seemed to care too much about performance over the fact of you as an individual working for them. Some cared, but the higher ups did not. I hope I made a lasting impression, but to corporate I was a pawn."
good,Office Depot has taught me a lot about myself and what I can handle. I loved my job and I loved my customers. Its the corporate part that was wonky. It was more of just being a number instead of an employee that matters. The job gave me more stress and that out weighed the good unfortunately. Some people thrive in a high stress environment and some need a little bit more freedom.
good,"hours was not to suit a family life. The hours and change that was asked of us was always with out rewards or any perks, and staff members would dislike management because of there lack of regard towards employees."
good,"Depending on management, a typical work day can go from fun to stressful very quickly. however, if initiative is shown, growing in the company is fairly easy. the hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with a faced paced environment tailored to customers needs. Copy and Print is the busiest and most stressful department. to work in that department, you must be a fast learner and be able to work quickly yet efficiently."
good,Working at Office Max was a different experience I was not use to. The upper management are really strict with the employees that work for them. The employees in the print area have a lot of stress coming from management and customers
good,"If you dont mind working long hard hours for little pay, then this is for you."
good,"I had many happy years working at OD  starting in Andover and then in Leicester after relocating with my family in 2008."
good,Ok place to work. Company needs better communication and a better structure. Employees are ok to work with. But company needs more growth and faster speed to market plan
good,"Office Depot had little training and no real guidlines so you were pretty much on your own... There was not a lot of management involved in training or mentors to help, you had to figure it out on your own. the upside was that you had a lot of autonomy."
good,"Company has a lot of employee events."
good,It was a great place to work at the start and then it went downhill from there. Management was rough and lost most of the time but the staff kept their heads up and helped where we could.
good,Not much hours allowed and pay sucks. They ask way too much of you in copy and print for just $8 an hour. No coverage help when sick or when child is sick without them fussing at you.
good,needs a better management team none of the managers are qualified to be managers. learned many different types of forklifts and how to use an rf scanner
good,"If you are looking for a laid back job and you don't mind standing around and talking with friendly associates or playing on your phone during work, then this is the job for you."
good,"A typical day is 9-12 hrs, here lies their first management problem. Never have a set end of day, 8-12 hrs what ever it turns out to be. I have learned that this management have no really control on inbound flow of trucks, 1 day heavy- next day average-next heavy-next light-etc. Management doesn't plan well, they react to work load by saying everyone stays to work is done. they have a bad rep for this so many people come and go. It turns out to be somewhat of a slave factory, short staffed and must stay to work done.The pay is not horrible but near by warehouses are paying higher, our problem is our schedules are not normal such as receiving midnight to noon normally, 1st shift bulk 2 am -11am or so. Long hours and no end time for shifts are drawbacks. I cant say anything is enjoyable."
good,The store closed with in months of me being hired.  I did not have enough time to properly assess the company and its pro and cons of the company. That is all.
good,"Nice place to work but mostly immature people, managers expect to get respect because of seniority. Always doing more and not getting paid more for doing outside of the job description."
good,"Workplace is easy and flexible, are able to get most tasks done if there are no customer rushes. Everything is run smoothly. I was able to keep the front (my section of store) in order weekly."
good,"Office Depot OfficeMax can be really hit or miss. While management generally has no qualms with stretching its workers as thin as they possibly can, they do seem to be somewhat aware of their employees needs. If you put in work, show up on time (and when they ask you to at nearly any given moment outside of work), and SELL, you can move up rather quickly. But I don't think I can recommend them for much long term employment."
good,"At this time I really can't say anything. I hope to find an employer that really appreciates hard working, dedicated people that provides a good benefits package and compensation."
good,"I'd only work at office depot if you are looking to make money off of ""spiffs"" as they call it (commission) because pay is low and commission is low as well. It started off good but they kept adding things onto my job description that I didn't interview for and I was disciplined when unable to complete what was assigned to me and not foretold in the interview."
good,My manager was a cheapskate and never put the right amount of people on the schedule. I would have to balance being a cashier and assisting at the copy and print center EVERYDAY. Not to mention I would clean the bathrooms every other night and perform Logistics tasks early on Saturdays and sometimes on Sunday. I couldn't stay after asking my manager for a promotion to the copy and print center permanently for the ONE DOLLAR raise compared to the cashier's 8.25 salary and being denied after covering time slots for that area countless times over the course of a year.
good,"OD has some truly talented people working there, but the company has had to restructure multiple times over the past several years. Management does not communicate effectively, and with recent massive layoffs, morale has been pretty low. Compensation is competitive for the Boca Raton area, but career growth is limited, due to the struggles the company is experiencing."
good,"If you find yourself noticing others not working, than you're the worker that gets dinged for inconsistencies. It's a place that puts a lot of work on those doing anything and letting those that prefer to do very little to continue to do very little. At times management will attempt to refute these tendencies but often fail. Maybe this was simply my location but management seems to be lacking and unable to enforce fair work loads. Over the years one just gets used to doing more and if you're hit with a negative comment, you brush it off because given a couple days everyone has forgotten. "
good,"This company was at the top of the office supply business when I was working for them, unfortunately consistently poor decisions by upper management has made it a shadow of its former self. This started with the decision to end the Business Services Division which gave customers a first hand employee to deal with on any issues and the slide continued from there."
good,Worked part-time and got fewer and fewer hours.  It was ok as a part-time job.  Management was good and the managers were helpful.  You had to work on the floor and work the registers at the same time.
good,"The staffing is so sparse at these retail locations.  It makes it difficult to get the required tasks done.  I enjoyed helping customers, and working with a number of the staff.  The district management was difficult."
good,"Office Depot could be a lot better. There is no training, you are just thrown to the wolves. You are expected to be a top seller even on your first day. The pay is horrible, considering everything that they expect you to do. Do not apply at Office Depot. They will lie to you during the interview just to get you to accept the job."
good,"My store location has a great and fun team to work with, but depending on management, it is hard to have a personal life.  I was always expected to be 100% available and rarely had Paid Time Off approved, even though the company gave me a few weeks a year as a perk of my position.  I love the clientele, they become like a little family when you see faces on a weekly or daily basis.  I thoroughly enjoyed my job helping customers and finding the right solution for their needs.  "
good,"No tienes vida personal, ni prestaciones superiores, trabajas todo el año y si ellos quieren te quitan los descansos y nunca los reponen, casi casi tienes que rogar vacaciones,  mucho favoritismo y malas prácticas desde los gerentes hasta supervisores, la mayoría de los altos mandos (gerencias) ni siquiera tienen la prepa, han tenido crecimiento por ser buenos amigos de los regionales. 80% de ellos no tienen la licenciatura y muy pocos terminaron el bachillerato"
good,"A typical day at work was very exhausting but yet very rewarding. As a team member at Office Depot Office Max, I was able to expand on my customer service skills and was also able to pick up very basic office supply knowledge. The managers seemed like decent people, and my fellow coworkers were easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet people and help them with their consumer needs. Another enjoyable aspect of the job was being able to create lasting relationships with the people that you see weekly, if not daily."
good,The job was ok a bit short staffed at the time of my employment thus requiring me to perform duties not listed in the job description The manager was unreliable and short sighted but the other supervisors made up for it
good,During my time at Office Depot I often had to perform duties of multiple positions due to the lack of management and attendance. If the management had been more attentive it would have been a better place to work.
good,A day at work can be slow and busy. Sometimes you had call other workers to make the cashier line flow smoothly. I feel like they didn't train their employees on certain information.
good,Understaffed underpaid great Assistant Store Manager shift managers easy to wok with. Print shop pay very low for amount of talent required to do the job Cashier responsibilities as well as design all print documents and professional stamps business mcards
good,"Office Depot has its perks, but it's truly not a place for an artist.  There are far too many hurdles to jump and qualifiers to pitch for a minimal salary."
good,"Worked here 7 years, once was able to advance and learn, great people. Things change though, high turn over rate, lack of accountability, company values no longer being followed."
good,"I love the work I do at office depot, but the pay sucks and so does the hours. They hire so many people that each person gets like 2 days a week. they should give the hours to the main employees and maybe they could keep people. They also cut you down to one day a week when they are mad at you or want you to quit. The work I do is great besides the customers, but the pay, hours, and some of the managers suck."
good,"My days at office depot where great. I learned a lot of things. Up until the new assistant manager arrived things where great. But he was very rude and was always on his phone. "
good,"Love my manager! Open and clear communication, but otherwise struggled with consistency across district and regional management practices. Not given tools needed to successful per companies standards and expectation of sales and leads. Limited in my ability of community reach and always having to be at cash register or on sales floor prevented proper communication with customers that could be developed into reliable leads."
good,They are losing focus on the customers needs that walk in. Focusing on services to business customers over selling to the people that come in to the store.
good,"I worked there for barely over a year. I started as a cashier and was quickly promoted to a stocker. After over a year of working there and begging for my promised pay raise I was given a 25 cent raise. The job is decent, but the hours are very low and you are lucky to work more than a day a week."
good,I worked in the printing department and it was always super stressful. Customers treat you badly and have unrealistic expectations and you are not paid enough to deal with it on a daily basis. Management is very male-oriented and they act like its part of the job description to network with other managers and suck up to the district manager. I was in management with this company for 5 years and was NEVER paid enough. I learned after leaving that I was paid $2 less an hour than someone in the same position as me that literally did nothing but suck up to bosses.
good,"Perfect to gain experience in retail, not great for long term advancement.  Great for college age or as a second job.  Unless you plan on going into management, not a long term idea"
good,"There is very little work/life balance, people are often working multiple jobs and it has become very political with voluntary turnover in the past year and a half."
good,"Prior to this newest manager our team worked very well together and we could always depend on our store manager and assistant managers to step up and help where ever they were needed, not just sitting in the office.  With new manager you had to beg her to step out of her office to help if we got super busy.  She wouldn't even help if the phone was ringing.  Has caused a huge turn over for this store which is sad for our customers."
good,"The pay was good and with overtime it pays the bills. The job was ok, too cold in winter too hot in summer. But they had dodge Sprinters for you to deliver in and they all have AC. its heavy grunt type work on the road. Its best for a younger man."
good,I liked working the fast pace environment. I liked that my shift went fast. It was my first experience working without the public. I do miss the human interactions. Management always made you fee; pressured about keeping your job. They brought in a lot of temps and steadily threatened your job as an Office Depot employee. I guess I should have noticed by the time I left the company there were very few of the same employees I started with.
good,"Great place to work, oppurtunity to change departments or cross train in other departments. Pay should be considerably more to cover the tasks required."
good,Physical and heavy lifting not paid enough.  Make furniture delivers with no help.  Very hard on your back. Excepted to use personal phone to call customers
good,"Go into work and separate the incoming shipment, then take the merchandise to the floor and stock shelves. Sometimes work the register or help copy and print department."
good,Office Depot was always hiring with Monday to Friday and no weekends is the only perk.Depending on the department there is OT if you want it to offset the mediocre pay.
good,"The day start off slow and picks up gradually until its a steady pace. Great fist job, teach you the basics of team work , time management and most importantly customer service."
good,"It is OfficeMax, they live and breathe sales because that is their business, you are expected to push the customer into buying something whether they want it or not."
good,"The merger change the overall work experience and culture."
good,it’s okay if your not trying to make much money or just want to pass the time. they dont move you up if your a female your stuck as a cashier. they want you to hassle customers about signing up for things they don’t want its a hassle with rewards and scheduling. if i knew how rough it was before i was hired i wouldn’t have taken the job
good,"They only offer advancement to good employees who where about to leave.  The compensation sucked, the commission was a joke at less then 5% of ""qualified items"" so that is things like PPP's and Services on computers.  Not a great place to make money but it is good for sales experience."
good,Learned more from the type of customers that visited our store. It was hard to be promoted within the company.Promoted to team lead but never felt trusted to do my position. Micro management was bad at our location.
good,Technology teams are talented and great to work with. Employees are dedicated to successful initiatives. Lots of changes in leadership. Many good long term plans.
good,Buen sitio para trabajar bajo presión rolar turnos
good,"office depot is a good company,its just has little room for advancement.Its also alittle too small of a work environment for me.I am used to managing over 100 employees.I am ready to advance and this company doesnt have the opportunities"
good,I worked in printing department at an Office Max. The work load was fine. The customers were fine. I was passed over several times for alterations of hours and job promotions. Several people that I trained were promoted past me. I spent a large deal of my time correcting errors made by the Day shift at the time.
good,"Very easy to get promoted. "
good,"Not a horrible place to work, but it could be improved. The choices when it comes to management could be a lot better as well as advancement for loyal employees, instead of favoritism."
good,"Fun environment, entertaining customers. If your looking to get your feet wet in customer service, this is a great place to start a first job. Especially if you are in high school."
good,"Nothing special. The company doesn't seem very bright and actually does many things to drive customers away, I have been here and seen many changes and none have made the company better"
good,"Office Depot Office Max is still undergoing the merger from 2016 and it creates a lack of drive for some associates and customers often can become angry. Given a good tea, it can be a great place to work, but associates and management alike are very poorly under paid for the work they do compared to other similar jobs."
good,"The experiences, skills, and relationships that I developed working at Office Depot/Office Max are most definitely valuable, and I am grateful to possess them. I was fortunate with my pay personally, but overall the company does not properly compensate any of its employees and the benefits continue to shrink every year. There is an obvious non-interest from the upper echelon of the company for any of their associates' actual concerns. On top of that, the quality of management is extremely varying. Some managers will put a customer's requests and desires above all other concerns. This results in constant contradictions with managers and associates as managers are consistently disregarding policies that are in place, thus undermining associates' positions with customers. Lots of personnel policies are not enjoyable. PTO is stingy, lunches are short, breaks are not enforced, dress code is unnecessarily important to some managers and seemingly nonexistent with other managers, etc."
good,"Possibly the slowest retail environment I've ever worked in. A regular day involves checking out about 50 customers on a good day, then stocking and zoning soon there after. You get the opportunity to cross train due to low staffing and an absurd amount of down time."
good,"Managed a team of 24 associates in four departments: Cashiers, Print shop, Receiving, Sales"
good,This is a good starting position for someone just starting out. The hours are flexible and the staff is friendly. It is a great opportunity if you are a college student. Office Depot works with your hours. It is easy to move up at Office Depot. And they offer discounts to the employees.
good,"Company have good salaries for managers, but collectors are not part of the annual bonus, because collectors have a biweekly commission which is impossible to achieve, as portfolios change on a weekly basis. Company have a high level of turn around jobs, as it prefers to hire contractors and to keep them as such for ever, on a very rarely occasions employees become permanent."
good,"Todos los jefes tratan a sus empleados de buena manera, el ambiente con los compañeros de piso y almacen no es bueno"
good,Some regions at Office Depot Corporate/Office Max seemed great to work for. Depending on the personality of the candidate and the territory I would possibly recommend OD as a good place to work.
good,"Good Managers, and nice employees. Quick paced, and steady. Customers are the hardest and easiest part. One learns quick and keeps learning while on the job."
good,"Given the amount of free time you have on the job,the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to restock the shelves and the occasional customer that comes up to you and asks for help."
good,"managers have since been fired for things like yelling and prejudice against people who are different. making fun of lgbt customers over radio. I had the skills to advance into the tech dept but was looked over, perhaps being female, idk"
good,"Too much stress and unreasonable goals to be met for not enough pay and opportunity for advancement. Management tends to push their weight onto everyone else; not in the sense of delegation, but moreso laziness."
good,"its a decent place to get some job experience but other than, you will not learn a whole lot there, and some of the Corporate policies dont make sense. I.E.  using last years sales to establish this years hours. that often left us short handed when we needed help."
good,"Its a reasonable place for a first job, but progressing further into management is rough. Also dealing with customers in print is always a nightmare. Seems like every customer needs their job completed immediately and won't take no as an answer."
good,"Slow place to work good for kids in school, few hours, weird managers. not good enough pay but its fun to learn a bit about technology and help others."
good,": love to work in retail as long as job give you tools to succeed, with this company they dont give you tools to succeed like ordering your own product"
good,"Puro envidioso, falta de capacidad de algunos compañeros, los que llevan años ya ni conocen las nuevas tendencias en tecnología. Algunos solo tienen puestos altos no por sus capacidades, si no por que llevan años. La encargada de el office a donde fui no tenia capacidad de liderazgo, intentaba lavar el cerebro a algunos compañeros con menos educación, es en serio. Tu jefe directo(los de camisa blanca) te dicen que hagas algo y después llega el gerente y te dice que ya no lo hagas ¿a quién le haces caso? y lo peor es que el gerente te regaña como si tu hubieras elegido la labor designada."
good,"May be different at other locations, but the store I worked at had terrible management. I worked in the print center and others that worked there almost never did any projects, except for what people brought in to be done on the spot. Things that were left to be done the next day were never worked on and then the person working during the day would get screamed at by customers for things not getting done. Workers would no call, no show multiple times and still get to keep their jobs."
good,No real room for advancement. I had to leave in order to better myself and career. Would recommend for high schoolers and anyone else just looking for a part time gig.
good,"Stocking was enjoyable, helping customers through the aisles was enjoyable. Weekends were stressful as we had to renew all the sales signs and often the stickers were not printed properly or on the correct paper. Management was weak so we had to be self motivated which I excelled at,"
good,It was an okay place to work. We just had some really rough patches that caused me to have a big work load only having one other manager with me. Working 6 days a week or 7 got the best of me.
good,"Supervisors make or break this job.  Some will be on you 24/7 even when they don't know what you do.  I worked here nearly ten years and there were supervisors who would actually come to the department and try to micromanage not really understanding what's done there and not WANT to understand when you offer to show them around, break things or mess up customers' orders and/or be rude to customers and we'd have to fix everything (usually ending up giving stuff away), and I've had supervisors who say ""Hey, we know you know what you're doing.  You make your numbers, you're good at your job, just keep it up!"".  Fortunately the supervisor turnover rate is so high that if you get a bad one, you know they probably won't last long.  Unfortunately the supervisor turnover rate is so high that if you get a good one, they probably won't last long.  Doubly unfortunately, I had to leave (relocate) right at the time the supervisors/managers were at the all-time best; if I hadn't had to relocate, I would probably work at this location for the rest of my life.  Actual overall score is 4 when there are good supervisors and 1 (or 0) when there are bad ones - would be five stars except due to all the corporate changes and a REALLY shady manager a few years in (who was later let go) I ended up making $3 less when I left than I initially started out at!"
good,"Never enough coworkers to get the job done or make an impact. In a huge building, there were only about 4-5 people in there at one time. Unable to address the needs of clients due to this."
good,"basic retail life. It is what you make of it but I did learn a lot with my supervisory position. overall a good company, I just couldn't take the management for much longer."
good,"The focus of the company constantly changes. The main goals are, more times than not, membership sign-ups, technology services and protection plan sales, and customer surveys. Any of those can make or break your career with the company."
good,"Excelentes prestaciones y buen lugar para aprender nuevas competencias de desempeño  lamentablemente la manera en como se promociona un puesto de acenso (jefe de area) provoca hostilidad en el ambiente laboral esto aunado a que usualmente el empleo y su permanencia dependen directamente de la evaluación del gerente, esto provoca que estos condicionen directamente tu permanencia de manera de que  inclusive por no caerles bien y la poca transparencia en como te evalúan puedan despedirte si así lo quieren sin darte pauta de ver tus áreas de oportunidad o alguna critica constructiva."
good,"I would cashier stock at little and order furniture for customers. I enjoyed the different things to do. There was always something to do."
good,Working in the Copy and Print department was changeling since it was the busiest department in the store... Very high pace department and stressful... was promised a raised and more hours since I was a part time; 6 months later nothing happened.
good,I would say that working at Office Depot was good in the beginning because there were managers that actually cared about what they had to do to get the job done.
good,"Had this job as a full-time student. Some of the employees there were great but depending on management, they are flexible with your work schedule. They should hire you as full-time if you will be working full-time hours and not keep you at part-time."
good,"No career advancement potential. Low pay. It would be wise to continue your job search while working here. Management is laid back, but can be pretty non-helpful."
good,"Building your team is the most enjoyable part of the job. The job itself is not hard, however some managers have the gift of complicating boiling water. Overall its just too politicize."
good,"Way too many changes. The industry is changing and there are uncertainty of the future direction of the organization. People mean well but are sometimes driven in so many different, conflicting directions."
good,Theres a lot of things that needed to change at my store and that progress is slow to happen. When we got a new print supervisor came in and was creating chaos it took about two and a half weeks for management to notice and take action. Also I have 3 years worth of copy center experience  and I only make $10 an hour and I feel personally due to the stuff I deal with I should be making $11+ (also due to cost of living)
good,"Typical day was greeting customers and working on assigned projects for that day."
good,"Difficult to work efficiently relying on several layers of support with poor response reputations.  The environment was very flexible and the capabilities existed in order to be successful but with constant flux and change within the organization it was difficult, at times, to perform efficiently to clients."
good,"It's bee an alright time at Office Depot, the people are great but Management and Pay leave a lot to be desired. It's more of a starting out job if you ask me. They always complain about payroll being tight and hardly ever have anyone scheduled anyways which is stupid."
good,"Poor management, the turn over ratio for employees was so low people were getting fired left and right. It was nice every once in a while to get free lunches and support from fellow coworkers."
good,The company as a whole was okay to work for. The pay could've been better for the types of people we dealt with. The best part of Office Depot is the crew.
good,It puts some change in my pocket aside from that i'm still looking or this would be a great part time gig. I work in the busiest part of the store they should at the minimum pay the copy and print department 10.00 to start at least.  Was put in that department with little to no training
good,"Office Depot is a decent company to work for. The company is very customer service driven, however, I believe  that there  should also be a focus on improving the quality of employees work life. There should be a focus on employees training as well as well as better compensation"
good,"Good place to get your foot in the door as a delivery driver. Will learn route management, load securement, building a relationship with customers, and meeting deadlines. Advancement is not an option however. Only one supervisor and manager position, and routes do not change."
good,"Working at Office Depot it's a easy job to learn what needs to be done and how the daily routine goes, there is nothing to hard about the job and the things I have learn from this job is working together as a team to leaning how to do things on my own and display what the mangers have taught me from selling protection planes to customers and get people to sign up for the reward program."
good,great atmosphere to work in nice relaxing job. Lot of small details needed but very manageable. Only negative thing i have to say is management at store 2740 is joke store manager was never appreciative of the work her employees were doing only put them in the spot light or notice something when the employees would do something wrong.
good,ODP has gone through some difficult times as retailers do. They are doing their best to rebuild themselves - strive for new ways to sell office supplies.
good,Training was not a true focus.  Many people felt like they were just expected to learn by doing the job.  Customers and staff felt when there were not enough employees in the store.
good,"This place left a bitter taste in my mouth. I worked for a year and a half and the management was poor. The main manager at the time was Keith West when things did not go his way or simple questions were asked over employee radio he would blantly belittle the employee asking a question for a customer. The benefits were poor, they do not take care of their employees."
good,Typical retail store. Management is ever changing. Work/life balance isn't bad. Not much opportunity to move up in the company. Everyone is expected to work 8 hours shifts.
good,Typical warehouse distribution center. Management was half clueless as to what was going on. Very stressful place to work with only decent pay. If you work hard and have good numbers you can move up. Supervisors don't last long because of the disconnect with upper management to the daily functions of the actual job.
good,"At first, it was great. Nice staff, safe conditions, etc. But when we got new management, it all went downhill. We were always understaffed, the store was dirty and the closing staff did nothing to straighten up. I was fired for being sick even though I had called in."
good,"Office Depot and Office Max need an A Grade furniture manufacturer line to represent in order to be taken seriously by the A&D community.  If you are happy selling Open Line furniture then this might be a good place for you.  Also, the BDM or Interiors Sales people are not compensated for the Catalog or Online furniture purchases, even if it purchased by a customer you have been working with doing space planning or selling anything."
good,"The store I was in was a disaster.  the manger and district manager had no clue how to run a store.  All stores are controlled by corporate, so it is hard to change a how one store can provide profit for the local area."
good,The jobs was a fantastic position with a nice mix of physical work and computer work. Management was hard to work w/ and environment was dull. No benefits and low pay w/ no chance of advancement.
good,"We always start the day with a quick department meeting and stretching to keep the associates informed on what's going on with the company. It is a very fast paced and busy facility. The hardest part of the job to get used to is having to work until there are no more orders for the day, sometimes done in 6 hours, sometimes done in 12 hours. Start times also can change due to the amount of orders anticipated."
good,The customer service manager was not a nice person to their employees. They would get mad at you if you were not at the register but then get mad if you were not recovering or fixing up the store.
good,I am looking for a new job now because of low compensation and the company keeps cutting back.  We now have no holiday pay and poor health care benefits.  I can't even afford to use them.  I have a great manager and district manager and we have a great team at my store but it's not enough money for the work expected.
good,"Most days were good and productive"
good,Declining business with challenging environment but some good people requiring direction and stronger management.  There's room for improvement but declining revenue leaves little room to invest and strengthen the right channels for longevity and success.
good,"It a good place to work but unfortunately with all the distractions from the Staples takeover the environment is very stressful due to layoffs. "
good,"I did enjoy working for office depot over all but there were some issues. First of all the training was not great. had to learn most everything from bad outdated videos that gave bad unrealistic sails pitches and scenarios. Being a sails associate in the tech department was allot of fun but they didn't do any teachings on hardware or how anything works. I had to learn on my own so that I could better my sails and make sure that the people left happy with what they needed. Also the tech services were not explained very well and my store in particular had bed in house communications for when a service needed to be completed."
good,"This store is completely limited by the regulations handed down by corporate. Can't work full time unless you're a manager. Overworked and underpaid employees. Little chance of job advancement unless an existing manager quits or is forced to leave by constant cutting of hours by corporate. Love the people here, love the job, hate being overworked with minimum legal wages."
good,"This job is good for a part time position if you are taking classes, or have no prior work experience. The people I work with try to make it a fun experience and the customers are generally nice."
good,With the decission by FTC to not allow the Staples / Office Depot merger the company is now faced with the challenge of doing business in a very competitive business enviroment.
good,"This job is great if you're just trying to get into the world of working. Don't expect decent raises on a regular basis or the greatest of schedules. You can learn a lot from this job. Dealing with customers, learning how to use the register. Doing inventory and working as a team. It surprised me that there's a lot more to the job when I first got hired. However, the company expects a lot out of you for such little pay. The management of all angles is a giant mess, so keep that in mind if you're considering to work here."
good,"when started at company it was great. A few years later the company started to change. we had core values, and sop, the company stopped living the values."
good,"If you want to learn how to handle any retail environment, work here. This was my first paying job and I learned a heck of a lot, which was beneficial at first, until I realized I was getting paid the same as cashiers, the only difference being that I got about 4-5 hours more of work a week than they did. Don't expect a raise, in fact, count yourself lucky if they don't have to cut hours. Almost no benefits, non-flexible work schedule, cross training pretty much mandatory, super fast paced. Thankfully, the management at specific store was great for a long time. However, due to the whole PC Tune Up debacle and changes in commission, this company has been steadily going downhill."
good,"Was a decent gig to have for short term. I got to make sales to customers and also stayed fairly busy stocking when not helping somebody."
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers and managers. At the time of my employment, we were severely under staffed which put a strain on all the employees."
good,Typical day was opening or closing of store.  Maintaining stock levels on the sales floor.  Unloading truck and putting merchandise on sales floor or in warehouse. Store manager was interested only in sales.  Some days not enough cashiers scheduled for work and I would have to fill in along with my normal job.
good,High based store with a lot of work involved. Many things to do. Managers are very cooperative and very overall involved in teamwork. You also get to learn a lot of new skills while working there.
good,"Working is easy, most customers are very courteous, but some are rude. The hardest part is working in the printing department just because you have to be very careful in not messing up an order."
good,A very fast pace environment. Lack of management. Did not have that many employees so a lot was expected and given to you. Co-workers were friendly. I learned how to have a fast pace attitude and get things done fast and neat.
good,This company was once very profitable and has since gone pretty downhill. All decisions that have been made that were supposed to better the company have pretty much panned out the way we thought which was not very well.
good,"Copy and Print department gets extremely busy."
good,"Ok to work for, But requires a lot of you as manager. At times you don't have a life. And your constantly having to address issues. Also the culture is not what they claim it is."
good,"Print Center is busy, great customers. There is never a dull day. Close to a lot of good stores. Gaining lots of new skills and experience."
good,"I would clock in and go straight to the line to begin my day scanning mail, and lifting boxes from the line to the trucks. While working at Office Depot Office Max I learned the process of warehouse life and developed some skills while working there. The management was okay considering how fast, but efficiently we had to work but there were days I thought it was quite poor and dysfunctional. I enjoyed my co-workers the people were great too work with and helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the line, because the line would have multiple boxes on it and that made it difficult to deal with, especially when we were short handed. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we had cookouts or deserts and also the short work days that would come whenever a holiday was near."
good,"A typical day at Office Depot is known to be busy and hectic. "
good,They Expect a lot out of you but under pay for what you do. I dont like talking bad about companies.Learned a lot of new stuff but overall got upset with to many changes
good,Great place to work but the only bad thing is that they are very inconsistent with hours. One week you will have 20 and the next there will be 8.
good,i enjoyed my time at this company. The culture changed when they started to hire from the good old boy network. It turned sour when i needed to transfer back to Colorado for personal reasons. They were not willing to assistant me so i ended up resigning
good,"It was part time work. It was not an excellent job but I didn't totally hate it. The people there were kind for the most part. One major problem that I did notice is that it was kind of a ""boys club"". Women did twice the work and got half the recognition. Especially when it came to the management side. I think it led to some bitter feelings among the sexes but I tried my best to stay above it and tried to empathize as much as I could. Expectations were unnecessarily high but not as much as other corporations. I would say if people being upset doesn't really bother you and you just need part time work and a nice round of cardio (a lot of walking) go for it. If that seems stressful and you need something more substantial look elsewhere."
good,"Job is alright, rarely promote from within.  Pay is not at all competitive considering all that we are responsible for. Lunch breaks are always interrupted"
good,I feel the business could do better with the policy they have. The way they always have a new person every month is not ok at all.
good,"Typical Day, Not learning enough, management always changing. learning one thing from another then they leave and new management doesn't know where i'm at? co-workers good, hardest part of job is not being equip ed with knowledge, most enjoyable part of job is communicating with customer's, finding what they need!"
good,What I learned at Office depot is to have patience. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up the mess that the customers did and putting everything back where they belong.
good,"I would work hard to be able to sell product for them such as insurance for the printers, but got lower than pocket change for it. unfair treatment of workers as well."
good,"The job is slow paced, and now seems to be struggling with finances"
good,"My team mates are very professional, with extensive sales and technical knowledge. We challenge each other to learn and grow in our current roles and expand our knowledge for future opportunities."
good,A typical work day was creating a memorable experience for our customers. Working closely with my fellow employees to ensure they are able to easily locate an purchase there items. My most enjoyable part of my job was definitely communicating with our customers an increasing there return. The hardest part of the job was the merger an the uncertainty of having the reliability of a consisstant  hours.
good,Office depot is a good job if you are looking for something short term. The jobs do not offer much advancement and the job security is not good at all.
good,"Typical days at OfficeMax included assisting customers find items in the aisles, getting items from back lock-up and checking customers out on the cash register. The hardest part of the job is probably the rotating schedule, never the same every week."
good,All non-manager positions are part time and even then it's a low part time (15-25 hours) and if they cut payroll you can count on getting less than 15 hours per week
good,"Liaising with the business and customers as part of a busy Helpdesk roll. "
good,"Perform one or more distribution-related functions that allow, as the business requires, assignment across various functions such as checking, picking, packing, replenishment, bin/bulk order fill, bin/bulk stocking, shipping, receiving/returns, sorting, or loading "
good,"Would be a greatly beneficial work environment with potential to learn alot of work place skills, given management and training was better. Poor training and delegation leads to a poorly ran store. Work load of the store falls on the shoulders of the dedicated associates. Company changes and procedures are not effectively passed down to employees. A few good workers and 1 great shift lead cant carry a store."
good,"My time at officemax was very stressful. A lot of pressure from management to sell things the customer didn't need and our job security depended on if the customers filled out an online survey about us. The management was not very experienced and made many scheduling errors, or scheduled employees on days that they had requested off long before. Pay increase was almost impossible and working minimum wage for the long hours I had to was not worth it."
good,"Answering customer inquiries"
good,"It was a great place to get myself introduced to working and learning how to multitask. Unfortunately there was no room to advance and the management that I had at the time was not the best. Granted the management has changed since I left, so i'm unsure of how it is in the last 3 years."
good,"The print and design center was easily the most profitable part of the  company, yet the continually maligned it and constrained how well it could work. "
good,When i first got the job at office i was pretty happy with it and enjoyed everything about it. Most Co-Workers were very nice and friendly and even helped me in getting in tune with the pace of the store. I learned alot of customer service skills here and sales training which helped me in the long run in other jobs i worked at. My managers were great at listening and addressing issues without making it a chore or big deal except for 1 manager that made work harder by picking on me mainly because he didn't like me for personal reasons. Hardest part of the job was probably restocking everything simply because it was mostly tedious and time consuming. The most enjoyable part was helping a customer find exactly what they need and helping them leave with a great experience in shopping with us.
good,"Moved up very quickly with the company, Work with associates to trying them in the best customer service practices.  Opened and closed the store when GM or Assistant were not there."
good,"It was a normal and okay first job. Nothing special, except many of the customers where very rude. Management was sometimes sub par. I did learn how to reorganize product."
good,Typical day was putting merchandise away because the lack of employees to hire. Management was good. Coworkers needed motivation daily. Not customer friendly and on conference calls daily.
good,I worked as a department manager for several years and found the job to be a great place to start but left for better opportunities.
good,"Typical day at work is assisting customers or cleaning up aisles. Worked minimum wage at the time of employment-- $7.50. They asked you to work a lot of hours, but were able to be flexible, especially with school schedules. "
good,Overall the store environment but upper management and middle management generally do not have any idea on how to properly manage stores.
good,"Enjoyed my time with this company.  Loved my customers, and was on a first name basis with most of them. Most days are busy and productive."
good,"I worked for OfficeMax (Now Office Depot) for over 9 1/2 years. During many of those years I really enjoyed my job. I managed the Print Center Hub. We had a wide range of customers, both large and small to simple walk-ins and I enjoyed working with them all. There were ups and downs, like almost any retail work, but for the most part I liked going into work with a smile on my face."
good,This job was a great place to work until they laid everyone off. the benefits were great as well as the YTO. I was there or 15 years and i worked my way up to lead.
good,"Management was typically unsure what they wanted done. They would often have the staff constantly start new tasks before they had completed their old tasks, and then would complain that some tasks were left unfinished. The store often had very few people in it, which made for a very boring work environment."
good,"Good staff, but hours and cutbacks in payroll make it tough.  Had fun, made some memories.  Best part, definitely the people I worked with."
good,"Only one person worked my department at a time, which was the copy and print department. When I went into work, there was always much to be done by myself as well as assisting other customers as they walked in. It was a high stress environment which I am able to handle without a problem. It was the poor management and lack of teamwork that caused me to leave. Though some people worked well as a team, just most of them did not. The hard work that employees do for Office Depot is greatly overlooked and taken advantage of. "
good,"A typical day is 4-8 hours, but schedules are highly sporadic."
good,"Office depot barely gets business. I am looking for a new job because my manager hired a lot of new people and took me off the schedule for a whole week because ""he doesn't have time for me to work"", but has everyone else including the new people on the schedule."
good,"just looking for a change, i dont feel challenged enough as a computer tech."
good,"slow til the evening rush comes in after 5"
good,"Los compañeros son buenos, lo mas duro es que cuando hay una vacante te cargan el trabajo de esa área y te exigen lo doble por muy poco sueldo."
good,"Though the team is great, the chaotic scheduling makes it almost impossible to do any tasks in personal life. Lack of training leaves you standing by yourself. Promotion into leadership becomes worse. At entry level, you are given flexibility in scheduling. Training is consistent though drawn out and performed by other associates. Becoming a manager, I would close and open on back to back days almost every week. I would work 6-10 days without getting a day off or get one day off after 3 days of work. No structure. The people are worth a great deal more than they are challenged with and perform with positive attitudes inspite of the chaos. With focus on company goals of protection plans, customer surveys and sales."
good,"I've enjoyed my work experience, there is very limited room for growth and the company is not focused in developing internal employees."
good,"Novitas Solutions, Diversified Service Options and First Coast all under Florida Blue! Difficult to work with corp office in Jacksonville with any payroll or benefit questions. Often just ignored!  The Mechanicsburg, PA Office has some very good managers who do extend a sense of caring and appreciation. I have seen many good employees leave due to very poor level of benefits. If you enjoy a larger organization with inconsistency in its subsidiaries, then you will have no issues."
good,"Office Depot can go far beyond its expectations, but it has to listen to the people that perform the task daily. Respect the people on the lower spectrum of the chart and they will get you, where you are trying to go. Be consistent in your policies and procedures."
good,"A great role with lots of earning potential however job satisfaction, security, earnings and promotion all depend on your territory which is decided on the roll of a dice."
good,Overall it was a stable position for me while I am attending classes.
good,A typical day would include taking care of customers' needs and ensuring product availability.
good,"If you're living with your parents and want a good starter job like walmart, then office depot is for you, however if you end up in copy and print or tech services, you'll actually learn valuable information that will look good on your resume.  This is not a career job.  Only supervisors/management get full time and hours are random from 10 a week to 37 a week.  also, your schedule is constantly changing during your scheduled week."
good,I enjoyed working for Office Depot and providing the customers with excellent customer service.
good,No comments other than I enjoyed learning a new job.  It had strict deadlines with little or no time to do voluminous
good,"Customers ranged from rude and privileged, to appreciative and pleasant. At times, repeat customers would come in with computer issues blaming staff for problems, when their own negligence or hardware were to blame."
good,"Most of my working life I have worked in the legal field.  So, when competition got tough and I could not find a job working in my field I went into Office Depot.  There I work with customers; not clients. There is a difference and that can be explained later. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I make the customer happy.  I have a creative mind and when we don't have exactly what a customer needs, I come up with an alternative.  They walk out thanking me and wishing I could go home with them to finish their projects!  I understand that not everyone is technology savvy and they may need a little more patience from me than others.  A recent event comes to mind which made my job so enjoyable.  An elderly couple came in wanting to know how to change their ink cartridges in their printer.  We didn't have that model so, I took them over to one of our computers, Googled Hewlett Packard.com and typed in ""how to change an ink cartridge in an HP OfficeJet 4500 video""....They watched the video before leaving the store 3 times!  When it was all said and done the gentleman and his wife offered to take me to lunch the next day, saying that without that video they would have been lost! Now that, along with many other happy customer stories, is what makes my job enjoyable."
good,I am only 1 of 2 tech's so my day is full until they hire some new people.
good,"Great Company,Communication is a MUST!!! Drivers and Dispathers need to communicate better."
good,A typical day at Office Depot consisted of being assigned to a work area and picking orders for shipment. I learned how to deal with many different types of people. Management was helpful when issues occured. My coworkers were a variety of different cultures and backrounds.The hardest part of the job was not knowing ahat time you aere going home for the night. The most enjoyable part of the job was the uncertainty of what may occur
good,"The job is very demanding from a customer standpoint. There could be nice people to walk in and there could be some who could cuss up a storm right in front of you. Management was decent, there were some who did not do as much work as they could. The co workers worked hard just like I did. We worked as a team to get our task done. Not losing my temper was a hard part of the job. Helping out customers with challenging tasks was the best thing about working there."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers with what ever they need."
good,"The management was very good with working with a changing school schedule.  Each day was about sales and keeping up with the latest consumer technologies.  The co-workers were great to work with and for the most part, worked hard each day."
good,"At first working for Office Depot was fun, now it is not. So many changes have effected my decision on working here."
good,Enjoyed working w/ the people and talking to the customers.
good,Can be very slow paced but overall a fun place to work. Employees are friendly
good,"When I joined Office Max, it was a company in transition in a shrinking business segment. My co-workers were very guarded regarding the sharing of information and made it difficult to acclimate to this new culture. Management offered very little in the way of direction and afforded excessive amounts of autonomy to associates that did not warrant such freedom from management. I did enjoy learning an entirely new industry and the challenges of growing categories in a declining business."
good,"Counting and adjusting the warehouse inventory. Finding and adjusting counts in different locations. I also pulled product for orders. Multitasking played a big role in my job and keeping my priorities in check had to be one of the hardest thing. There was practically no supervision so I had to find my own method of researching counts and making adjustments, which also happened to be the most enjoyable part of my job"
good,Its Ok if your just looking a job to help with your bills I learn whatever I can and when I can. the managers are rude at times but that's ok I don't mind because I smile at rude people. My hardest part of my job is the multi tasking I have to do I have to be a cashier and still maintain customers in my area its so difficult especially in the CPD department I got it to work out im real good at it now if you ask me. I enjoy interacting with customers I learn so much about them everyday and the more I learn the better I become at taking care of their needs.
good,"cashier"
good,"I liked it for the most part, but the management wasnt very nice and they didnt treat me very well"
good,"Was very disappointed with my experience there."
good,The company is currently undergoing a significant change in leadership and culture at every level.
good,Customer service life as a copy & print associate was horrible. When I joined the team it seemed as if there was a high turn around rate with the employees. There was only one person working this area at a time. Since most of the customer would come to this department you would think more employees would run this station at one time. Management would hide in her office whenever I needed assistance figuring something out. A guest even snapped on her for not coming to show me how something worked. It was like they threw you behind the desk and said you can try and figure it out yourself. When I told them I was uncomfortable in that department they didn't move me to sales floor so I just quit. Ironically a couple weeks later another Office depot store location called me for an interview. WHAT A JOKE!
good,"A typical day at work involves picking orders and packing them. Also, cleaning your area. I have learned to maintain a steady pace while pulling orders, keeping an eye out for damaged goods and communicating with my team. Management could be better. They try something new everyday to try and make things run more smoothly and in the end, it doesn't work. Management could be more fair amongst all employees. My co-workers, I get along with most of them. There is a lot of drama amongst most them and it makes the moral of the team horrible. The hardest part of the job is when it is extremely hot outside. There is no air conditioning and the fans we have barely work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the end of the day, when we are walking out the door."
good,no one gets 40 hours except the managers. Co workers are cool. But make sure you specify availability and/or request off on time because no one is ever willing to cover shifts (esp night shift) and then if you call out they may shorten hours for following week 
good,Office Depot use to take care of its employees and customers and do the right thing but now it is just about the bottom line.
good,"Office Depot was one of the most interesting companies that i've ever worked at. The most important thing I learned that they're all types of people in the world, and you have to tread carefully of how they're treated by you, especially in the work place. The hardest thing that i had a rough time dealing with at office depot were the improperly trained and unprofessional employees. One of the most rewarding things about working with the company was meeting new bright intelligent people like myself."
good,Cash handling. Speak to customers & offer expert advice regarding desired purchases. Stock shelves w/ co workers. Managers were ok with a few being exceptional. The hardest part & the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the public.
good,A day at OfficeMax is a busy adjusting to different situations a day. I've to be diverse with different customers that walk through the door everyday for the most part I learned from the customer. My co-workers are some of the best but every job has good ones and not so many good that's just work. The most enjoyable part about my job is when customers say that I've done a great job and that I should be considered for a manager position.
good,"I have only worked for this company for a few months and I already want another job, the pay is not enough and the Management does not know how to treat their employees always trying to mirco manage on everything that is done in the store and how we treat every customer that walks in"
good,In today's world customer service has been lacking due to technology advancements. Office Depot lack customer service tremendously.
good,"a typical day at work would be counting the monety everymornig balancing the cash registers and entering the previous day sales into the system. When the store opens i would interact with customers all day making copies, scanning and faxing, making business cards stamps, books and etc. Ive learned how to cross sell and have a lot of patience with people. My mangaers and co workers are really nice and funny people since its a small store we are all like a little family. The hardest part of the job is our new ISCE program. The best part about working here is socializing with new customers everday and learning new things from each of them"
good,Many great people working in a company that has been hit hard by a changing business cycle
good,Requires ability to multitask while staying customer focused.
good,"I found that Office Depot was not a well organized company. At the time that I worked there the policies for the receiving areas, cash office, etc. were not very secure."
good,"Its a good company, gave me more management experience to lead others."
good,Its a nice place to work at and they do work around your school or life but not that many hours.
good,"People and leadership were really nice and while the work day was fast paced, the atmosphere was very relaxing"
good,The overall company has a great customer oriented and service driven environment. The customer is priority and providing great customer service is a strong focus. The work environment is very aggressive and sales driven.
good,Overworks emplyees but most employees would not mind the work load if they were paid better. For example I loaded heavy products and had to stack them by hand by myself a majority of the time. These products were heavy enough that every one of them should have been team lifted. When I would ask for help they told me there was no one to send then would send people home early and I would get in trouble because my trucks weren't being loaded fast enough. The most enjoyable part of of the job was clocking out on friday.
good,"The employees are helpful, and the staff train all employees to the best of their knowledge."
good,My co workers and management at the store level is great.  The corporation is not good at all.  They expect you to do the job of 3 people and there is no wage increase for the added work. They are currently laying off full timers and trying to replace them with part time staff.  It seems to be another situation of the people at the top who never have worked in retail thinking retail theory works in actuality.
good,Awesome place to work. Learned a lot as far as for growth. They treated me well there and now I am looking to take what I've learned and apply and grow even more in work places in the future.
good,"A stable place to work. Not to demanding, not to easy just stable. The place just never changes its the same thing day out and day in. But at least its constant."
good,"At first, I loved working here at OD, and it was a nice change from the jobs I had recently had. The customers were kind, they appreciated my help, and my coworkers and I got along perfectly. As with any retail job, however, things change, people come and go, and the attitude of the store changes as a result. Management has changed around, some of my better coworkers went back to school to pursuit better careers, and others came to take their place, and they are not the most encouraging at times when it comes to the environment that OD had when I first started working there. I have been with the company for nearly a year now, but at the beginning of this year, quite a few changes were announced, and it is speeding up the decline of OD from a gentle slide to a downhill race to the bottom of a roller coaster that I am no longer a willing rider of. I am getting off this ride as soon as I am able to, before the business that is OD comes plummeting down to the ground with me in it."
good,I think the summary says it all. I have worked in every area of the store but there are too few people doing too much of the work and things easily fall behind.
good,They will work with your schedule and you can learn alot. Customers are very entitled though and most times rude. But its not that bad even though the pay isnt too good.
good,I did not gain anything from working here. Sucked all the life out of me. Put in most of my time and effort and received nothing back in return. Gave me the worst amount of hours possible
good,solo gestionar mayor salario ya que se da mas de lo que se recibe
good,I worked as a print specialist but felt underpaid for the two bachelor degrees I had in art. One being graphic design. I really enjoyed the work but didn't feel challenged as an artist. I enjoyed meeting other artists through my work and skills. Management and coworkers had my back with unruly or rude customers and were quick to help if the print department became extra busy. I enjoyed my time as a print specialist with Office Depot/Office Max but was commuting an hour to work for little pay and couldn't meet my bills. Part time employment was all they could offer so no benefits.
good,The management is just poor other than that it’s an ok job it was good while it lasted just be sure the don’t under pay you for the work you do I was underpaid for two year I’d been there
good,The job was good for the first few months but went downhill fast. The job was not very hard but made more difficult by short handed shifts. I did learn a lot about management and developed skills to help me in the future. Best part about the job was help people with technology and being about to work on computers. At the end it was hard to feel appreciation from members of management above me
good,"It is a great first job if you are about facing a challenge. The amount of times I could come up with a solution for someone was so rewarding. Over the years, many of the 'clients' were like family and just a pleasure to deal with. Down side is there is an EXTREMELY high turnover for the department, thus causing stress on the veteran associates."
good,Was a good first job with a lot of learning opportunity. Management was not consistent always someone new but always were helpful friendly and cared about quality of work and improved the store.
good,Like working at Office Depot but the pay could be better.  Hours are flexible which is good though.  I do a lot of office and copy things for customers.
good,"Corporate expects part time HS and college students to meet the countless expectations initially designed for multiple positions to handle, all while making $9/hr in a hot store all day."
good,You were often expected to produce result in a very challenging enviroment. Subscription services were always a challenge and that is the direction that the company is going. Store traffic was a challenge as a result of selling subscription service. The company often create a difficult situation to work in.
good,When i started with the company i truly enjoyed the job over the eight years i felt less compassion for the associates from management.I did gain experience on the forklift and reach truck.
good,"The best part about working there was getting to know your coworkers, learning new things about the job and getting closer to the managers. Overall its a good first job for anyone."
good,Long work hours no home life good over time though but it takes a toll on you if you have small children at home but the benefits are good and they give lots of hours if you work over night
good,Office Depot was good I transferred to office max it was close to my home the managers were unfair at office max they don’t listen and it’s unfair judgement
good,"Office Depot allows for self management since outside reps work from their homes for the most part, this is a huge perk. The mid level management in my case was wonderful, DSMs are committed, ethical, hard working individuals that care about the company mission. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting great clients and developing great relationships with them."
good,"My responsibilities are meeting and greeting customers, providing excellent customer care, ringing up purchases, stocking shelves, and assisting in sales."
good,"NO STRUCTURE !!!!!!There's no transparency ,management don't listen to employees that have the best interest for all,to make the operation operate smoothly.I have never worked for an organization that if you have PTO days if you call in because you're sick,you get a point and they will take a PTO day and claim you have an attendance problem even when you have PTO days remaining.The Company needs to be able to operate every DC within itself and not from the corporate office that's located in Boca Raton ,Fl.,Oh ,the salary should be at least $5000.00 more for the requirements..."
good,Office max was much better to work for until it was bought by office depot. Depot micromanages way too much. Constant feedback needed daily on employees.
good,"My job as an Account Manager was very flexible but had many internal struggles...over the years the internal support has grown more slim and made it difficult to do our jobs.  The industry is getting tougher and tougher to compete...with stock availability,competitive pricing and delivery...Amazon is a big threat."
good,"Clock in, wait for company meeting while accessing all new office items.  After meeting head to (Back of house) to help warehouse unload and (Point of sale) supplies..throw boxes of computers and office furniture over your shoulder and climb the laders and stack stock the merch..casher and customer attention ."
good,"Working there was really boring was always on my phone and management didn't care at all, really slow very bad ay keeping employees gone through 3 store managers while I was there."
good,"It is a great starter job. However it was just time to move on. Nice place to start out. I worked mostly morning shifts and would like to keep it that way as well. I would get to work at 7 in the morning, do my morning reports and get ready to open up. I would begin the day at the registers. someone would take over for me later and I would begin to help customers what they needed. Anything from printers, chairs, laptops, ect."
good,Management is ok and fine but some associates don’t know what they are doing because they haven’t been trained really well. It’s hard to work together when some team members don’t care and put all the work off on one person. Hours are inconsistent and scheduling is a joke.
good,Cashier and stocking.  Taking orders for copying materials for customers. This was not a fast pace position.  The job retail position does not have much more that was required
good,The job overall was good with previous management. The new manager over the department lacked the managerial skills needed to accommodate each associates role. Constant responsibility of having to fix issues as they arose daily on your own and having to overstep your management roles. There was definitely a lot of favoritism shown and when you stood your ground on something that was not fair you best watch your back.
good,Working at Office Depot office max was a very fun and relaxed environment. I was never rushed to do anything. The management at Office Depot was very good and worked well on many different levels
good,"It was a nice job as a teenager to get job experience, I would normally have to keep the front end looking nice while checking out customers and trying to maintain my numbers with their rewards."
good,"Office Depot does not pay a lot, but if you need a job most of the time you will get it. Other than back to school time, the store is not that busy. Being a cashier or sales associate is not that bad for 8 dollars."
good,"This job is a good job as a first job or if you're trying to get some experience, but I wouldn't consider it a place to try and have a career. There isn't much room for advancement within the company"
good,"Office Depot is trying to re-invent themselves and that is ok, just not the environment I wanted to work in . If you like selling things that are good for the company but not necessary what the customer needs at the time of purchase, this is the company for you."
good,Closed 90 percent of there stores went mostly online not many are still open. Was a great experience and helped me learn sales building and constructing displays
good,"Pay is low. workplace is otherwise acceptable and lack luster with no reason to think about work after clocking out and not alot going on while there. Boring, but tolerable."
good,I was the customer service manager for a few months. What happened to me I would not wish on any one. I am going to remain professional. Never felt rewarded. I'm not talking financially. Never told that I was doing a good job. I don't expect to be told that on a daily basis. But something is better than nothing.
good,The goals that are required for sales are unrealistic for the area of this particular store. An example is membership sign ups most people are already members and the people that arent dont want to sign up.
good,"Employees make the work environment worthy of working at, same can't be said about customers given it's a retail store. Big company  small salary, aisles are changed way too often and way too many tasks assigned to employees. Can't work on tasks without having customers asking for help. Not enough help on the sales floor. Company is transforming into a services company and employees are required to make sales by promoting services. Comission earned for some items sold is very little (5% & sometimes less)."
good,"It's a good job for a someone new to the workforce. Helpful in regards to obtaining new skills, however not great at career advancement within the company in my experience."
good,"I enjoy working here due to having a good environment to work in, and plenty of opportunities for customer interaction. It is a very rewarding job to have."
good,"-The work culture is pretty good"
good,"Being a copy/print associate is a stressful job where customers care way too much about their orders and will nag you about them constantly. For the amount of hours and pay you receive, it's basically not worth to do it part time and I get an anxiety attack just thinking about doing it full time."
good,Nothing to really say about office depot/OfficeMax as this was a satellite location and was still apart of corporate but did not have any type of corporate feel.
good,"Very poor management. Poor HR service delivery model from Florida"
good,"My experience was better than average as I was an Ops Manager. I did like my hours and working in customer service. I loved working with my team. I was unfortunately transferred to another store and that was where it went downhill. I had very little support from the rest of the management team I had in the new store. It was the main reason for leaving. So, it can be a great place to work, but it really depends on the management."
good,multiple leadership changes throughout short time frames. Focuses and bonus structures changed almost on a monthly basis. While evolution is realative to growth of a business...the inventory management system was unable to keep up with the demand.
good,"Not enough hours where available for some to live off."
good,Good first job for a high school student. Pay is a little better than minimum wage. Flexible hours. Have to be able to multi task and sometimes handle customer complaints independently.
good,The morning and afternoon are always super busy and stressful. But the evening is pretty slow and boring.  But I did learn a bit about the retail industry.
good,"Those who work hard have more expected from them until they are worked into the ground. The only redeeming quality of this position is the amount of overtime you receive puts you in another tax bracket if that is considered ""redeeming"", Last year I received 400+ hours of overtime and I am expecting more this year."
good,Low paying job with little room to grow.  You have to wear a headset and sometimes you have to share them with other people.  There's many times where I had to wash them before use.
good,10 jaar werk ik bij office depot. ze gaan dicht omdat ze verhuizen naar Duitsland.
good,"The work is long repetitive but rewarding if you like helping customers. Generally more customers are grateful for your assistance than rude or disinterested customers."
good,Basic retail job stocking shelves helping the occasional customer. Lot of idle time because of lack of foot traffic. Good job for someone starting out in the work force.
good,"Office Depot is a nice place to work but the hours are terrible , I barely get working days and then on top of that they are only 3 hour shifts. It’s not enough to survive off of because you have to wait two whole weeks just to get paid again."
good,Follow up with prospective business leads while generating new prospects to close sales. Management in BizBox is awesome and work closely with all Solutions Advisors to provide consistency in training and solutions.
good,When I worked there they were okay to work for and my co-worker were fun people to be around while working. Most of the managers were easy to work with.
good,The work was not hard however there is no standard training.  The people got along with each other great.  The management was available at all time.  The customers were customers
good,"Wanted more hours, which only time was when I was helping with remodeling, overnight.  Other than that, 16 hours a week, and once in a while, 24 hours.  Needed better pay and definitely more hours, other than that, was good place if you just need a part time job.  They did know I was needing a full time, which I was promised by the Asst. Manager, but was given another the next day instead by a supervisor, but I still needed a job, so cannot argue with that."
good,"I did not work for this company long but if you are looking for a part-time job that is not extremely fast paced, this would be a great place to work for."
good,My co-workers were plenty of fun (although there was the odd character now and again.) Dealing with customers and doing the same thing everyday was boring.
good,"I learned a lot of office max, things that I will take with me for the rest of my life. It's a great comoany  to work for, I just don't t  think it's my place in the world right now"
good,This job was fairly a boring one with little to no supervision from Management Team. The family and work balancing was not all that good because we were always traveling to get new business. Cold calling and walking into businesses was a nightmare and making about 100 calls a day without really any lead generating system was tough.
good,Working at Office Max was very interesting. Learned a few new things. Liked working and organizing office supplies. Challenging part would maybe be getting use to how things were done at certain times.
good,No tienes vida personal pero adquieres mucha experiencia en servicio a clientes y manejo de personal.
good,I was able to interact with people needing a service and that permitted me to work independently along with them to create a great office space. The environment was relaxed and fun
good,I worked at OfficeMax when I first moved away from my hometown. OfficeMax is a great place to work if you plan on being there long term. I was starting school and it was tough to keep a work/life balance.
good,"This place is going through some changes right now and I'm not sure how it's going to turn out. Right now retail is tough across the board so everyone working in the industry who is not working at the place in Seattle should know that and have eyes wide open to that fact.  OD is trying to make changes to adapt and survive and it could work.  It also has new leadership and is trying to make some culture changes which could be a great thing as well, we'll see.  I call myself a realist while others call me a pessimist so take my review for whatever you want."
good,"- Worked during my highschool years"
good,"Management would change hours of schedule that would not fit my school schedule when I was working there. They told us to bring our schedules in so they could work around it, but ended up scheduling me right when I was having a class."
good,Expectation of work vs pay not great.  Not enough payroll to accomplish what they want from associates.  Too many things to ask customers from the time the enter the store to when they leave.
good,"●	Repair and service of clients’ defective computers and laptops "
good,"A typical day at work consists of morning duties, along with helping customer and assessing their needs. Recommending and closing sales with customers. Provide excellent customer service."
good,"Management has 0 control over scheduling. Always short staffed. Cost of living increases is pitiful. Corporate office controls all scheduling."
good,"Very busy, too many silos for departments to understand process in full and work together.  "
good,"my experience at office max is not one you would expect. the job on its own was a good job. but, the management at the time made it hard to enjoy working there. always pushing for numbers over customer experience, almost telling you to ignore customers in order to get a certain job done on time, all while management did very little to help on sales floor or at registers during busy times in the day. however those members of the staff have since been removed from the work place completely. so while my experience was bad due to a select few people, i feel the company has made right those wrongs and improved their workplace considerably by doing so."
good,"Can be very stressful and hectic at times. There's often not enough people scheduled during shifts.  Schedules are very flexible, although you will often have to work weekends, nights and holidays."
good,"When I started working at office depot I was just out of high school and I had plenty of technology experience so I quickly became a technology specialist who worked on computers and installing software/debugging/etc. The issue here was that there was no commission on work that office depot couldn't do without our skills, and often was expensive work to be done. I could install software, backup computers, or transfer data for customers for a fair rate and it didn't make sense to get paid by the job for this work... BUT when it comes to diagnosing a computer full of viruses that often took up to a few hours to fix and cost the customer a couple hundred bucks the employee doing all of that work often saw not a penny for their efforts and many of the existing employees hadn't seen a raise in their pay in years."
good,Would help customers on what they came in to look for. Show them the best options they have. Would break down the truck and separate everything and go stock everything to the shelves.
good,"Travail très diversifié, responsable de son portefeuille."
good,Okay for student looking for part time job that does not demand too much. If you're looking for a job with advancement then do not go for this job. No promotions or raises.
good,Company bas a whole was gong through tremendous changes and store closings
good,This was a good job to start off at but as time went on it came a different store when management changed. There was a lack of control and professionalism. I would not trade it for anything.
good,It was interesting to work in Office Max Warehouse where we pick up the orders and put it in the boxes then ship it off. I loved it there. Great hours and paying.
good,"In total the job taught skills used in the workplace, towards management and leadership and working in a fast paced environment, but lacked support in the way management was acted upon."
good,"At first, my days were nice and fun but as time went on one of my managers changed and did not treat me like an employee and more like a nuisance. I know I am only 17 but that does not mean you can treat me like i am a problem you can't get rid of. Tell me how and what I am doing wrong please. That would be the hardest part of the job, getting talked down to by my boss and getting yelled at for talking to customers. But the most enjoyable part was how friendly my co-workers are and it will be sad to leave them.. Once I am for sure going to have another job I am putting in a two-week notice and getting out of there"
good,Training was through for supervisors and management. Wide range of tools to learn and implement in various areas of work and life. Great customer interaction model that is easy to use and reapply.
good,Office Depot All positions are full. Not sure If I would recommend this job to anyone. You work all night and not any chance to mover departments for better hours.
good,"It was a great place to work, co-workers were nice and very helpful with any job I had to do, but management was very bad when writing up schedules.  I would only know what days I worked seven days in advance and could not plan a life around that."
good,This company has changed work policies numerous times only to change them back. Never know what to expect when showing up for work. Immediate management is awesome! But stuck in a very difficult position just like everyone else. Corporate has a very serious dis-connect with the actual work force and has no idea what the staff has to put up with from the public after making changes to policy that the customers have been use to. It was not like this when it was only OfficeMax.
good,"It was a work environment with not good management at all. Very slow pace, & would not be able to work as much if you were only a part time employee. Would not recommend"
good,"You may work 9 or 10 hours on a light day and then do a 14 or 15 hour day depending on the volume. There is absolutely no work/life balance and no regard for it. There turnover is over 90%, again never worked at a company that was able to stay in business very long with those type of numbers. I was a salaried supervisor so it really sucked for me. Especially when these hours were not explained to me when I started. Training is minimal obviously because of the high turnover, which feeds more turnover."
good,"If you have a good manager and fun coworkers, it's an ok job.  If the manager or coworkers are greedy and corrupt, they'll get promoted and your hours will get cut to make up for it.  Basically, unless you're desperate, if you can't stand your coworkers, leave.  The pay isn't worth the drama and 4 hour shifts right in the middle of your day and getting a full time position with better hours is next to impossible outside of management and Tech department."
good,falta de insentivos y mejor paga mayor capapcitacion
good,"Every day I came in around five in the morning and began unpacking and resupplying shelves. Though this was a nice job by itself, the job significantly worsened when an unrealistic time constraint was placed on the backroom employees to unload the truck for that day. Needless to say, it was stressful and high intensity work."
good,"This place is OK. They push you to sign people up for rewards and give you a daily sign-up goal that's unrealistic."
good,If you can't get a lot done with less or at least less than ideal this probably isn't your cup of tea.  Having enough payroll o manage store day to day is never ending battle.
good,"Will start my work at 8:30  and ends at 5:30, most of the employers will be in only at after 9:30, its taking the day effort waste to manage any kind of meetings and because of that extend their work end time at 6:30 pm"
good,"Office Depot was a good company to work for."
good,I love the family work environment. However the high expectations can be hard to meet daily. If not mat then termination can become an option. Because of this we always had a high turnover rate.
good,Working here was an unforgettable experience. Learned a lot while Iwas there. There was no room for growth.  Had great co-workers that made the job easy.
good,My immediate manager did not like me. He was an equal prior to getting the Senor manager position. He managed the night crew and I managed day crew. My group had to always clean up after his group.
good,"Positions at Office Depot are best suited for high school or college students. Office Depot is concerned about the numbers and percentages and that environment that filters down from the upper management and feels as if the customer always comes second, if not third, behind sales, reward card sign ups and up selling the item of the week.  "
good,"Es un trabajo muy pesado por el sueldo que es muy poco, no les gusta pagar horas extras y eso que el trabajo es muy raro que lo termines en el horario establecido"
good,"my day is getting my scanner and my cherry picker and logging in and printing  off tickets of orders to pick.dealing with the 2 companies merging, you have to adapt to changes. the culture of the workplace is good whereas everyone gets along whereas the hardest part is we dont leave until it gets done so you dont know when you are gonna leave. the best part of the job is you get a workout and its a great feeling when you are able to do your part in satisfying the customers to keep business going."
good,"Simple job with room to move, tasks are easy to understand and do well. Management seems to strive for a relaxed atmosphere including  low pressure on sales for most team members. Pay is low but similar to related jobs."
good,Cashier/ Copy Print- Having the responsibility to work with others on a team environment to serve every customer needs with maintaining and balancing a cash drawer.
good,"In dem ständigen Versuch Arbeitsabläufe und Prozesse zu optimieren kommt es nie dazu dass sich die Firma auf eine Struktur einlässt. Somit wird, was sonst aufregend und kreativ sein könnte bloss anstrengend, chaotisch und nicht zielführend."
good,"I enjoy my manager and admire him for doing the best with a bad situation. We have a revolving door of employees. The work is very fast paced and very very physical. It is not something anyone would say they enjoy coming to work. This is a warehouse environment that is very dirty. The management has never done the warehouse job but want to dictate how he thinks it should run, making employees constantly leave, or walk out."
good,Not a bad option for a second job. There is really no advancement within the company and dealing with moody customers frequently is not worth it for $10 or less an hour. Only get 5 days PTO within the year.
good,"I want to advance, make more money, and it just doesn't happen there. Company always changing, a lot of people come and go.  Management changes are hurting company."
good,Working in retail is something that cannot be taken lightly. People are different and that's what makes the world we live in a unique place. What I do there is something that I am passionate about. Being a people person and being able to sale items is what I do and what I can do. Office Depot if managed correctly can become something great ! The policy is customer service and if that's the number one goal then you cannot go wrong.
good,"Most of my days working at Office Max, we dealt with many shoplifters on a day to day business due to the location the store was in. I would be front door cashier and also keep an eye out for any suspicious individuals who we might be shoplifting. The hardest part of this job is to ask shoplifters to leave the store or return what they have stolen and escort them out of the store. I enjoy when our sales team meets our goals for the months so we celebrate with either pizza or BBQ for the employees. I felt that management at the store was poor due to the lack of help from managers when the store gets busy and all of the associates are helping customers."
good,"On the whole productivity suffered from individual not understanding their jobs or being incompetent. Managers who prioritize menial tasks ahead of what is actually covered by their job description. "
good,Long hours and feels good to help the customers. Help when it is a group of team members meets and greats the people at the store. I learned time management is very important with helping out customers
good,"As far as physically being in the store itself, it's more demanding than it seems from a customer's point of view. The store itself sits at an uncomfortable warm temperature, which could often make you light headed if you were doing heavy work. There seems to be an odd miscommunication between all of the associates over the headsets, granted they have been working there for a while. However, the employees are nice and try to provide the best customer service possible, which is a nice feeling that makes you feel more like you can fit in. A typical day at work was usually helping customers and possible unloading freight or moving products around. I learned more about other products that I hadn't known about before such as electronics and furniture. Management wasn't terrible, however there were some communications issues there as well. Hardest part of the job was a constant being on your feet for say 6-8+ hours, and only getting a 15-30 minute break over all. The most enjoyable part was getting to actually help people and learn from our customers."
good,"not enough hrs, one break of 12min, no air condition and the list go  on...."
good,It was very nice and relaxed job but new management was hard to deal with while I had school and constantly changing schedule it was fun while it lasted.
good,"Used to offer insurance and other benefits, even to part time employees.  Gave small merit based raises every year, even to part time employees.  "
good,"Regardless of how productive or essential you are to the smoothness of work, advancement is rare and often political. You are adequately compensated via paid vacation."
good,"The managers I worked with on a day to day basis were cool to work with, they helped their employees when needed and trained everyone to an acceptable skill level."
good,Over all not a bad place to work.  Watching the copier can get a bit tedious with a big job.  Creating things from scratch in Word and Photoshop was fun.
good,"Not easy to advanced, managers expect you to do work of three people- need to be able to carry desks and chairs or printers down large ladders. Managers are not the best at making sure you get days requested off. Company does not have benefits unless you are full time."
good,"Office Depot is an okay workplace, it's just not fit for me. It was okay when I started working there in my freshman year of college, but now that I've graduated, It's just not enough. The pay isn't good enough (only $10) an hour. With a college degree and the skills that I possess I have to work somewhere that starts a $15 an hour. The cash register is the most tedious thing. It's the same scanning motion over and over again. I've learned a lot about technology, furniture and customer service. The best part of the job is the coworkers, They're pretty cool for the most part. The most difficult part of the job is difficult customers. I've learned a lot but I've outgrown this job."
good,"The hours can get long, there are some busy day and slow days, be ready for fast past work flow environment. The job is still in a retail store so the customer base can be difficult to work with at times. "
good,"People in management harassed me, but most managers were okay. I was constantly sexually harassed by a co-worker. Corporate was stupid and screwed us over a lot."
good,"Office Depot:  The quick Review"
good,Management wasn't willing to listen to the truth. Members of management will do everything they can to get rid of people they feel could take their job.
good,"Co Workers Were great people. Loved them all. My manager Was difficult to work with. never satisfied, no trust. questioning all my work in a very demeaning fashion"
good,Overall culture is very unresponsive.  Hard to work when people take days to take care of something or answer and e-mail or call back.  Management does not hold anyone responsible.
good,"I was a Department Manager here for just over a year. Starting pay was decent but that remained my pay up until I left the company. With the failed merger and unrealistic goals put in place by the District Manager it was almost impossible for me to get any type of pay increase or promotion. The best thing about working here was having the Store Manager I did, he was the most down to earth manager that I have ever had and was really the reason I even stayed as long as I did."
good,Some days were bad some were good it was some days when you never got help from the team when you needed them the most. It got to point to where it seem like I would never advance with the company so I ended up leaving
good,"OfficeMax was a great company to work for - at first - but after the merger of OfficeMax and office depot it went down hill quickly, many of the policies OfficeMax adapted to from office depot cause a lot of hiccups and a lot of the workers to leave and seek better employment"
good,Change managers at least 3 times while working there for less then a year. Management did give me a chance to advance up to management however a new job opportunity arrived overall not a bad place to work except the commission from sales was very low
good,"I worked here for a long time, and I enjoyed it for the most part.  It was kind of disappointing to have to leave after working there for so long although,  I will not miss the long commute in Houston traffic."
good,Its not hard to get accepted or to stay on just be slightly more competant than a door. The job is exactly as you expect it to be a entry level job that you have in highschool. Pay isnt great and neither are the hours. All that being said i honestly had a great time working for them. but im honestly pretty sure that was just the group of people i worked with and not the actual store.
good,"Taking away associate commissions that they count on as part of their salary, and instead giving the higher up (District Managers) incentives, like a new cars, exotic vacations, etc."
good,"A great place to work while in high school or just out of college. Very flexible. Pay is minimum, however, yet you are required to go above and beyond regardless of your position. You will be helping out in various parts of store regardless of your title. Lunch breaks are only 30 minutes for every 8 hours and monitored very closely. Some days are busy and some drag on. Expect lots of busy work."
good,"We were without management for about four months.Management always quitting and rotating, rules always changing. Hours being cut due to budget. My experience has been unimpressive."
good,Shifting between duties ... Fast paced work... Stocking and Cashiering... Mixture of hours... Not really solid organized schedule... Boring job if not busy
good,It was mostly slow at Office Max everyday. I spent most of my time either cleaning up and fixing products that customers had moved around but other than that it was pretty easy going. When I did help people I had trouble at first because I didn't know where most products were but I learned pretty quickly.
good,"I work in the Copy and Print Department. My typical day at work is helping customers with their graphic designing for items, such as invitations or business cards. I also do a lot of printing, shipping, binding of books, and shredding."
good,I wasn't very impressed with their customer satisfaction for a company that is all about there customers. They are normally understaffed and that puts a lot of stress on the associates.
good,"It's exactly what you would expect from a customer service job. "
good,The place is very low self esteem they don't make you feel like you have stability they don't compensate you in pay for the work you do and the management are not concerned with employee welfare very low rated company.
good,when i worked at office max did stocking filled out order. Did customer service on the sales floor. later on i learned the front end part of the business.
good,Primer contacto semi-profesional con softwares de Adobe (Photoshop e Illustrator).
good,"Working at office depot I enjoyed interacting with customers. Management was extremely strict, but all in all I miss working there. My coworkers weren't very honest, but they were pretty fun to be around."
good,Es una excelente empresa pero el ambiente de trabajo no es el adecuado ya que se trabajo con muchos favoritismos hacia ciertos empleados
good,It was a job I got because I could not find anything else in my area.  At least working in the Technology department helped me land my first IT Support job.
good,"Office depot had good management, and a good work environment. The typical day is overall slow. I learned how to deal with difficult customers, I've worked as the cashier before, and I learned more about how to help the customers find what they need or a close second."
good,This is a Ok company to work with. My experience with this company taught me to always be prepared. Create a work pattern to make your day go a little easier.
good,"Typical Day: Show up on time in uniform. Greet customers and fulfill my duties as a Copy and Print Associate."
good,I was only part time so I didn't qualify for benefits. But I loved my job and the consistent hours I received. I loved my co workers and the job culture. Office Depot takes care of their emplyees
good,Needs some work with communication and expectations for realistic goals and attainability.  Upper Management needs more store to store contact and a understanding of each locations workflow on a daily basis. Needs are not met with collective process of all stores are the same.
good,"Store Managers don't seem to stay very long at my store (7 in two years)."
good,"I've been with Office Depot for about 9 months. I like it, however the work load does not match the pay. I'm practically working in every department and only getting paid a dollar or so over minimum wage. Need a raise or a supervisor position to accommodate the work I do here."
good,"I worked for OM for a little over a year. It started out as something to do while my children were in school. I advanced quickly, however, it wasn't a career."
good,"Each day we have great workers who are committed to being successful in their position and lending a helping hand in any way possible. A great environment is provided for all who enter our doors each day but we are restricted under some questionable guidelines and policies. Overall it is a pleasure working with my team, however, changes could be made to make it less stressful."
good,"The work environment is very positive, but the bias is there. If you're there to just get your check then you're okay. There are some management that favor their friends and talk down on their employees behind their backs, just to fit in with others. But that's only with one of the managers, the others are okay."
good,The company is dying as sales are continuously declining YOY. Stay away. Great people to work with but management has flawed strategies. There is no innovative thinking.
good,"Great and easy job for those who are unexperienced, however the compensation and benefits aren't the best which ultimately decreases the desire to be employed there for a long period of time. Other than that, it is a fair and positive environment with great management."
good,Organization was well versed in providing solution to small business customers and consumers.  They offer a wide variety of services and products to meet their customers needs.
good,often worked 12 hours a day 6 days a week.  Little communication between branches and main hub.  Upper management often left us in the dark.
good,"Typical day would be to continue working on computers, if there were no computers to work on then it was my job to get some in there!  I would approach and help almost everybody in the Technology department; this was the best part of the job.  I met a lot of nice and local people who became repeat customers of mine.  Most of my coworkers were friendly people to be around, and I have some lifelong friends from the store.  I'd say the hardest part of the job was having to deal with an understaffed store.  I would constantly be flexing over to do different tasks that I wouldn't normally have to do while trying to maintain my department (Tech) as well.  Management was typical of most retail companies, although this particular store did have a high number of managers coming and going.  I enjoyed my time there overall and was sad when our store closed!"
good,"The executives did not seem to understand what the people out on the street actually doing the work. They had all these idealisms, lots of things that looked good on paper but when it was put to a real-life test it failed. Hence the ""merger of equals"" with Office Depot. Sure seems like Office Depot has taken over Officemax. Very disappointing!"
good,I wasn't completely trained but the job wasn't hard. The pay was low at the time but I loved the people I worked with. I felt that I was apart of a family.
good,"Office Depot offered good sales training upfront, but a lack of support from management and accountability of departments."
good,There was no clear way towards advancing in the company. Schedule  was never consistant and hours were scarcely divided between to many employees. only 13 hours a week
good,"It is an experience, great place to start but not to stay. Don't take your title for granted you will be doing more than what was agreed upon. Overall, a good beginning."
good,"Although pay rate is low their employees , this company is driven by exceeding expectations in customer service and their customers experiences and expectations. "
good,It was a decent job. Did not really like the pay rate. you really learn a lot new things which I am truly grateful. Would recommend to anyone who is just getting out of High School.
good,"This was my first job. Taught me customer service and handling inventory. Being responsible for not only my actions, but our staff as a whole. Helped me communicate efficiently."
good,"Needs better trained Store Managers that arean't just looking out for themselves. Hours are always being cut, even for lower level managers. ""Trained"" for four weeks at a diferent store, did not fully understand what my job entailed until months later. Huge lack of communication. No one is held accountable for their actions."
good,"I worked in two stores, and each of them was almost completely different. There is a lot of inconsistency in how the stores are run. I loved one store and hated the other. It's worth applying, cuz they will probably start you at minimum wage and you can just keep looking and go somewhere else if you get a bad crew."
good,A typical day at work would be punching in and go help a different department to pull orders and then move on to put away to get my job done.
good,"Our store was a very stressful place to word due to management. I enjoyed the other people that i worked with, and the job was fulfilling, but I don't think I would like to ever go back if given the chance."
good,The hardest part was trying to sell insurances. Making sure we would get our quota for the month. I learned much about the sales industry and gained sufficient customer service experience. My co-workers made it an open and easy atmosphere to work in. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I would be helping customers and figure out what they needed.
good,Shortly after our training started we learned that Office Max and Office Depot were merging.  This created a lot of job anxiety  among employees with more seniority. Much of our training was changed and most employees were distressed by what changes the merger was going to create.
good,Office Depot OfficeMax in my experience will pay you as little as possible regardless of store performance or your contribution to meeting sales or reward program goals.
good,I worked at this company for 18 years.  They were in the process of merging with another company.  I was downsized but was ok with the decision.  I wanted to expand my work experience and education.
good,"Devo sicuramente ringraziare l'azienda che mi ha insegnato molto, molti processi di lavoro utili che potrò un giorno riutilizzare in nuove realtà."
good,I enjoyed my team and the customers. I didn't like the lack of appreciation given to us by the district manager. I will continue shopping there only when it's convenient.
good,"movement of a lot of merchandise on a daily basis"
good,"Management doesn't turn to the genius workers to get insight, they just go on their gut feeling (even though they don't fully understand the technologies available to use), which in turn makes development time anywhere for 2x-10x longer."
good,"it was a good starting job that taught me many valuable things such as my knowledge of tech, and how to repair computers and cell phones. Also how to work with and help customers solve problems and just get what they're looking for."
good,"I work in the Print Center of the OfficeMax in York, PA. Their management is sub-par at the store level, often times changing the schedule without notifying any of the workers. They're under-staffed, but according to them, cannot afford the payroll to allow more than 14 hours per week for a part-time worker. They constantly have a ""Now Hiring!"" sign, with all positions open and available. I personally take this as a slap in the face, seeing as when I asked for more hours, the response given was ""There isn't enough payroll."" If there isn't enough payroll, than why are you hiring?"
good,"Office Depot / OfficeMax is a new company as the result of a merger in late November of 2013. The culture of this company is something needs to be looked at. In a merger, facilities close and good people lose jobs."
good,"during my day i would make schedules, stock the lockup, answer customer questions and problem solving. cover a shift if someone doesnt show up. Write ups, stock shelves."
good,"atypical day consisted of stocking inventory,i learned about the different types of newer computers and printers, management was nice, co-workers were fun, the hardest part of the job was convincing customers to buy the insurance for the things they purchased, the most enjoyable part was helping people"
good,"validar que todos los pedidos locales estuvieran listos para su envio asi como los documentos"
good,Working at this places was ok. Depending on which area youre working is more or less work to do. Over all its not very well payed and your hours are very variated. The worth opportunity isnt to much.
good,Not bad alright pay compared to minimum wage average $8.00 just kinda depends what locations you go to cause they are all different.
good,"This was a good job until the merger with Office Depot.  Answering back to back calls at the center. That did make the day go by a lot faster, you were always busy!"
good,it was ok working there. management was bad n customer service was on the ok side. would like to work there again just a different location.
good,On a daily basis tasks and store layout were being changed and altered by a higher up. Every manager in the store has a different idea of what should be done to Improve the store. communication and cooperation were at an absolute minimum
good,"They are going through a tough transition. NO communication from the Dm or company, NO real training. I liked my staff. Just wish there was more training"
good,"There are times in one only one person would work on the floor and would not receive help from others. There are times in which customers would ask employees if they could call a manager over, yet managers would have the employee handle the situation (sometimes because we would be understaffed). Usually, after 6 pm there would only be one manager on shift. The pay is very low (starting pay is $8.40/hr). The training is very minimal."
good,"A lot is to be mastered in the Copy & Print Department. It is a GREAT resume builder. It forces you to multi-talk between jobs that are due an multiple customers walking up to the counter wanting to scan & e-mail, fax, create 2 feet by 3 feet posters as well as a diverse range of other jobs."
good,"Good work Environment. Sometimes management gets pushy about selling the insurance on things and getting people to signup for rewards cards. Other than that it's an ok place to work."
good,One of the top providers of office sales and printing services in the country and was very profitable in a very competitive marketplace
good,Good fun place to work. But terrible pay. Work consists of helping customers find office supplies and technology items like computers tablets and printers/
good,"Filled all job requests for agents on a daily basis. Completed payroll, new orientation and performance reviews. Completed all safety violations and incidents. Leaned new procedures and programs. Co-workers were very helpful. Manager was great and very knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was releasing good workers due to the point systems infractions.  Most enjoyable part was offering jobs to the unemployed."
good,"Overall, Poor upper management and difficult industry. Good benefits and good pay but at a cost of work/life balance. Good opportunities for growth and learning; work with a lot of smart people but expectations are very high in relation to resources available."
good,This was a part time position until I found full time.  I stayed on for a while after beginning my full time position.  I enjoyed working with the customers.
good,The job was very slow and boring. Everything was customer centered but we had no customers. It made for long days of playing on the internet.
good,Once the merger with Office Depot was finished the job became more unbearable.
good,The manager that hired me left the field and they haven't found a suitable manager for the position in two months. The employees there seem work hard and are professional on the job. The lunch break is 30 minutes. The assistant manager is in charge of everything since the manager left. Full review the place seems a little unorganized but everyone works hard to try to make it a more established district. I would just loved to get paid more but then again i would love a more challenging duty in order to show who i am and what i can represent.
good,I worked here for a very short period of time. I moved in with my now husband and needed to find a job quickly. I took this job for a couple months until I got the call from Chase Bank to start work with them.
good,Our Manager for logistics is the person that made the job fun and decent to work at.  She would buy us dinner for our hard work out on the floor during late night stocking hours.
good,"If you're a high school student and you don't want to flip burgers, this is the place for you. Beware of the back to school rush!"
good,"I guess I shouldn't complain much since it is a retail job, but it was exhausting and very stressful. The salary itself isn't much especially living in New York, they want you to do all sort of thing but nothing goes back to you, and because co-workers saw they way we been treated they do a lack job and all responsibilities fell on me. They didn't care about your life, if you couldn't work you just got fired. Unless your in a desperate situation I would not recommend you work there."
good,they are very nice and helpful. it was a blast every day at work
good,Was a good place to learn and get some real hands on training when dealing with customers and meeting their needs face to face.
good,I loved the people that I worked with... but the DM that was over the management staff made it hard to get hours and nave any chance to promote with in the company.
good,"Animer, former et développer les compétences pour 250 collaborateurs dont 13 personnes d'encadrement."
good,"In the time I worked at Office Depot, I worked all sections of the store.  I worked in technology, office supplies and printing, furniture, and school supplies.  I also worked in the copy center and on the logistics team.  On the logistics team is where the true colors of the company showed.  The goals were impossible to reach in the first place, not to mention I was working by myself part of the time.  Then they shortened the goals and the management was not happy that they were not met even when I worked by myself.  The hardest part of the job was having so much expected out of you.  It made it even harder because Office Depot is an incredibly cheap company and doesn't really do much for it's employees. However I did gain a good amount of knowledge in every department that I worked in."
good,"Working as a cashier was boring, but working as a CPD associate was a rush of the day. it wasnt that many people that worked there so everything was cool."
good,"As a corporate company I am surprised at the amount team building and incentive programs. If you do your job right you can earn certificates, money, etc. Co-workers are come as they go; some are great, some are not so great. The hardest part of the day is being pleasant with grumpy costumers"
good,Company will achieve synergy number by cutting positions nationally. Risky place to work.
good,The day is ever changing so there is no boredom. Loved the store staff I worked with.  There is a big feel of team spirit.
good,A typical day would start with clocking in and checking with manager on duty for tasks of the day. As cashier it was my duty to greet and ring up customers. Also maintain the area surrounding the cash register and make sure items were stocked well. My co-workers were pleasurable to work with as well as helpful. Management was always fair and ready to solve an issue that arose.
good,"Company provided little is the way of career opportunities and advancement.  Though support and training was in place, lack of leadership provide limited direction."
good,"Managing China team and Vietnam team to work on the assigned projects. Daily manager communication process with target suppliers to develop each projects successfully. "
good,"Since merger they have cut overall hours for the store.  Got rid of management positions, full time positions and associates hours.  This has killed moral at all levels.  Low pay and hours makes it difficult to hire any quality people.  The best people are jumping ship. I expect store closures before the end of the year."
good,"a good company to work for, management are fair, co-workers are trustworthy"
good,"horrible expectaions from associates"
good,"A good, steady job, but management was poor.  Too much socializing and not enough working."
good,"Get to the store at 6am and leave maybe before 9pm.  Office Depot gave the experience of ""big box retail"".  I learned to create work schedules meeting payroll.  The opportunity also taught me the operational and inventory control of a multi-million dollar facility.  And how to work with corporate to change refill levels of product to fill needs the customer.  Also, allowing my vocalize the need to scale back in other areas of abundance.  Hardest part of the job was the glass ceiling that stared me in the face.  However I did enjoy the sales and merchandising the store to corporate desire."
good,"Store managers have long ours, but are compensated."
good,I enjoyed the job. It could be challenging at times but the core positions were good.
good,"This is a Fortune 300 retail company which have their own set of rules and regulations of course. I learned a nice amount of basics in copying, electronics, and even part of the inventory systems. The management was usually slacking, having understaffed nearly everyday although employees are available. The co-workers here were all paid minimum and only a few were reliable enough to count on in the Copy Center area of Office Depot. Hardest part of this job was make up for lost time that other co-workers did not care to assist with at all on any time sensitive projects. However, I did enjoy interacting with customers and fulfilling their needs and wants for their projects."
good,"While working for Office Depot, I enjoyed learning the different sales techniques the taught me. The staff was friendly but strict and also a little shallow."
good,Office Depot is becoming an increasingly stressful place to work which may be due to an upcoming merger with Office Max.
good,"We had to know the locations of the products so we could correctly bring the customers to them when they asked. We had all the products to fit into an office. We had to greet customers, bring them to products, give them any information if they needed it, if it applied get the customer to get a warranty on the product and then use the register to complete their experience at the store."
good,"just a regular job wouldn't settle to work here. its just boring, rude customers, but I made the best of it and made friends :)"
good,"Started working with them right after college. Stayed dedicated for 6 yrs. When you came to Office Depot copy center, you came to MY copy center, a business within a business."
good,"The company had won the most ethical company for the past two years.  Although they won this award at the same time corporate had asked us to stretch truths in order to obtain warranty plans.  Although I have sold them I feel that they are not always needed on every item."
good,"When myself and other coworkers that are not there were there we had alot of fun until we got a store manager that was racist,and then the store just lacked the energy, associates just didn't care no more really.and when you go in there now they are just rude and do not know there stuff."
good,"Their basis is stated that customer service is the number one thing in the business.  It is unfortunately not, they base everything on sales, even if it loses customers."
good,Ok company to work for have plenty of resources available for learning and training associates.Traveling 75% of time spent away home. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching  the new store site go from a building empty and under construction to a finished product that the customers are excited about shopping at.
good,"Review work orders, walk line looking for possible future failures and noting all deficiencies. Programming of Data-logic 5800 scanners and preventive maintenance. Worked for a great compassionate manager. Worked with a close net team that strives on teamwork.Challenged with data input with new system. Staying busy and productive without any conveyor downtime."
good,All aspects of customer service
good,"Logistics crews broke down, sorted, and distributed daily merchandise shipments, assembled and dismantled displays accordingly. Also, handling personalized customer service while readying of the store for daily business as well as the filling of retail outs was handled by this crew. After the completion of daily tasks, logistics employees transitioned to dedicated customer service representatives."
good,"The job itself is fun because I help customers make good decisions, I work with computers which is what I love. My coworkers are great friends. I learned how to have good customer service by making customers happy with the job I did. Sometimes the timing for when I receive my schedule is bad, for example, they won't tell me that I work on Sunday until Friday, that's only two days of notice."
good,"Under the right manager\management you can excel, With my first store manager the sky was the limit while my second wasn't as as helpful."
good,"Coordinate all activities in the Copy Center; oversee all aspects of production and customer service; maintain high volume xerographic equipment; serve as lead worker to other classified staff in the area, work as a cashier; and perform other related work as required."
good,"A typical day at work involved greeting customers as they enter the store and asks if they need help finding products. I explained products' features, value, and capabilities to customers. I also handled money transactions and operates the cash register. Transactions typically include payments such as check, cash or credit cards. Handle customer inquiries and complaints over the telephone and in person. I really enjoyed this workplace because I learned a lot about the products throughout the store and I meet many great people."
good,"Very unproductive place to work. Inventory management team are not totally connected to the warehouse, which makes it hard to keep a balanced inventory."
good,"A typical day at work would be the answering of phone calls dealing with customer queries, mailing and recieving claim forms. capturing and depositing customer cheques"
good,"Having been in retail for over 20 years, I was hoping this would be a job that I could retire from. It started off well. I wore many hats, most of which I enjoyed. We had a good group of associates, and we all worked well together. I gained some experience selling technology and office products, as well as services and warranties. I liked doing re-sets and merchandising new products. There was only one major problem with the position. It was the store manager. Absolutely the most negative, self-righteous individual I ever had the dis-pleasure of working under. It really is a shame, because the store I was at lost several good employees because of it, myself included."
good,Due to locations closing I was not there for long and enjoyed the time I worked at a tech store. I learned many things about computers and the economy.
good,"It can be a fun place to work but it can be really stressful as well. I definitely can say I have learned a lot from this job and have acquired some new skills, particular in the design area by being taught by a co-worker of mine who was a graphic design major in college. The most difficult part of the job is the customers. A lot of the customers we receive are rather irrational when it comes to deadlines. For example, someone will place an order that will be due tomorrow and come back in a few hours yelling at me and asking why it isn't done..... enough said."
good,Fast retail environment. Worked closely with management on balancing cash registers. Worked closely with customers in copy center and check out.
good,"Great place to work if it's your first retail job or if you are trying to work there to dapple to see if you might want to go into technology retail. Restocking, doing go backs, being a cashier. Back to school is the busiest time of the year, but your day goes by fast."
good,Office Depot was a good company to work for.
good,"I have worked at three different retail locations for Office Depot. Two in South Florida, one in Alabama. I have had very different experiences at them all; some more humbling then others. I have learned great customer service techniques as well as problem solving techniques. The turn-over rate is really high, so I often did not work with the same group of people. I was promoted within one year of employment then saw no chance at promotion after that. Hardest part was listening and preforming tasks from someone who was doing something the wrong way; (usually from external hiring of management positions). I enjoyed the job because I got to work mainly in the technology department where I am knowledgeable and was able to make commission from my performance. Also I feel good and when able to assist others when they need help."
good,It is to much like high school. TO much drama and back stabbing and stupid stuff. I would rather be rewarded by merit and being a good employee that sucking up to my bosses
good,Data Entry 10 Key Punch. This Was a Very Easy Job. It Was Temp.
good,Most people were great to work with. Most of the decisions were fair by most of the supervisors.
good,It was a boring job that I was really great at but did not get anything out of it
good,Overall good place to work. Needs improvement for advancement in the company. Sometimes overwhelming work when managers don't contribute very much.
good,I learned computer repair skills. I also learned about various technologies. The compensation for the work is very low and my schedule changed weekly.
good,"No room for growth, horrible scheduling, store manager was no help."
good,Office Max allowed me the opportunity to grow and develop my customer communication skills. It is a good place to work for full time college students who are seeking part-time employment.
good,"OD/OM gave me 15 years worth of employment so I was able to support my family. My typical day of work varied. I would travel for account maintenance, new business development, and account development. "
good,"Office Depot is a great place to work for anyone looking for seasonal/part time work. With the right team, it can be a really enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, I would not recommend it as a viable career path option. I have worked for Office Depot for 5 years and have seen very few opportunities for advancement store wide. Most positions pay minimum wage and pay raises are almost non existent."
good,"I personally can't stand bad management, and this company i work for has it, as they don't have flexibility scheduling and you are forced to work a certain time of the day that you can't...and they don't have faith in you as a co-worker, it's ridiculous. You hardly can get a good lunch because nobody is there or know anything to help back you up."
good,"Buen compañerismo, las se solían solucionar hablando"
good,The assistant managers and supervisors I had were pretty great people and so were the employees.  We had one particular store manager before he transferred out who did not care one bit for us.  The heating system was broken during the coldest time of the year and he never submitted a ticket within the company to get it fixed.  We had to attend to the customers in a freezing store.  Wearing our coats and gloves while using space heaters.  I recall one time my hands froze while trying to ring up customers that my supervisor stopped me from working so I can warm up my hands next to the space heaters.  It was so bad that a customer reported it to the Department of Labor.  If it wasn't for that we would have caught hypothermia. We struggled a lot until one of the assistant managers was promoted as our store manager.
good,3x8 fatiguant mais charge de travail relax ! toutefois autonomie obligatoire
good,The job was fine for a first time thing. The longer I was there the more work they wanted me to do. They did not compensate for knowing the entire stores positions.
good,"Depending what department you're in the day is pretty quick paced "
good,This was an okay place to work. Management was unreasonably assertive and took the job too serious considering the amount of money we were being paid.
good,"Honestly its an ok company, the benefits can differ and depending on the schedule you may end up doing 3-6 hours at a time. The pay could've been a little better but it helped take care of bills. If you are going to work here try not to make it a career, you'll be burnt out before you can even be offered a position in management, etc"
good,They really think that the print specialist don't pay enough money . Legit will do the most please have you doing the most . Treating you like a personal slave and people don't even pay you 10 an hour after years of work .
good,You get the joy of working with great coworkers. The job is not difficult and you will get to experience something new every day. Copy and Print center keeps you busy throughout the day.
good,"Fun place to work at. Good learning curve, trying to get in close to advance per cutting-edge technology out there in the market, always looking for opportunity in the business, strong competition with eCommerce/retail market leaders."
good,"I was hired by a great manager. He had flaws but was overall really understanding and did well working with college students (most of the employees were at least part-time college students). However, he moved stores and corporate brought in a new manager from outside the company and things got difficult. She was not a very good manager in general but was also super disrespectful to most of the employees which didn't fly with us. I left because it was a temporary job and I won't be disrespected especially when it is just because I ""work under you."""
good,"Es buena compañía muy bien salario y beneficios y era mejor como Office Max que ahora con la unión de OfficeDepot. Pero cómo está las compañías esta es de las mejores pagadas , si conlleva mucho trabajo y esfuerzo pero se puede."
good,The work days last about 3-6 hours and the pay is from $9-$9.75. Not much to live off of which is why i quit. The coworkers were very nice and understanding.
good,Working at Office depot you just have to take it one day at a time. It may get better but it may not. Office depot will definitely push you out of comfort zone.
good,I am honestly not sure how the company is still in business. I was working three to four other jobs in a day and being paid next to nothing to do those jobs. Management accused me of some false things and asked me to leave which was outlandish and left me searching for a job.
good,"Employees were required to do too many tasks for the pay we got.  Job titles did not mean anything at Office Depot, everyone did everything regardless of pay grade."
good,"Office Depot was the most boring place I've ever worked at. Not that many customers but, every customer was usually angry for some reason. I was screamed at a couple times by customers for no apparent reason. I was trying to be helpful to them. The atmosphere felt very tense all the time. Overall not too bad if you like to just move shelves around and do every single job in the place including your own."
good,"Great, but you have to have to have  a great team to maintain a work life balance. You make your own  schedule. I can’t stress enuff you have to have a great team to be successful."
good,I learned a lot from working here at a copy and print specialist. However it is very stressful and underpaid. A lot of Micromanaging and high expectations for even starting cashiers.
good,"Officemax in Parma was a great place for me to dip my toes into the corporate world, it allowed me to get a feel for what it was like to be a salesman and how to think on my toes for what the most effective option to help someone may be.  There were times I honestly even surprised myself with some of the innovative solutions you can come up with to solve someones problem, and the team here is a great support system to show you how to do that."
good,"The job is fine, but can be very taxing at times. Be ready to do work that may seem repetitive each day. Coworkers are generally very supportive of one another. The people are welcoming, the job itself  can range from being easy to difficult at times."
good,"Mala organizacion "
good,Buen pago buena empresa malos distritales no saben seleccionar a la gerencia mucha rotación de gerentes y subgerentes  eso habla de la mala dirección zonas regionales y directivos.
good,"The company use to care for its employees now its just about attempting to make some cash before it goes out of business . It's really sad, I use to like working for this company"
good,25 years of varied responsibilities in store operations was able to fulfill career goals.I was on board at the inception of the company and I was a valued employee throughout my career.
good,It is a good job but it does make you feel bored and sitting at a regular half of your time then walking around the store leads to boredom. Job is alright.
good,"They give a good tour and explanation of the warehouse when you do your orientation. Unless, they throw you out there first day and don’t exactly explain the job nor want to answer questions without having a disrespectful attitude. The managers at Office Depot do not have much respect for their workers and do not put in the time to train properly. Most of the work is done by the associates themselves who are not even getting paid for it."
good,"A typical day starts at 7:30. Start doing research on a particular company - target. Cold Call potential prospects. "
good,same basic stuff that usually goes along with typical retail job. repetition and tasks that aren't complicated. i usually worked the morning shift so i know what there is to be done.
good,"The company is going through some changes and the leadership team at the corporate office seems to move quickly which is good.  However, poor communication really affects productivity and overall team morale."
good,"I learned a lot working at Office Depot. Being a tech specialist I heavily advanced my skill set with computers. I learned how to truly take care of customers. The hardest part about the job is them being on our backs about unrealistic goals. I strive for my best but even then the goals are unrealistic. The most enjoyable part of the job would be being able to make conversation with our regular customers that would come in, working on computers which I love to do, and working the truck."
good,"helps customers with getting their office supplies. they are helpful in being flexible with hours, however they pay less than other similar jobs in the area"
good,"Each day was busy working directly with customers. Assisting the customer on the floor and at the register. Offering rewards and warranty options for purchases including applying coupons. Answering questions on the telephone and in the store.  Working in the print center and assisting with computer services.  "
good,"Decent communication amongst Managers and some staff. Other staff is lacking in proper training, and think there could be more hands on training rather than computer training to ensure all employees are cross-trained properly."
good,"Daily, weekly and monthly planning of work events and workloads. Daily price changes and markdown reports. Daily cleaning and re filling of merchandise"
good,This place was very slow to work at there really wasn't much to do when it was slow. If you worked at the cash register for your shift that's all you could do. Just was a not fun environment.
good,Very easy going and chill workplace but also very demanding at times. Depending on the position there are certain numbers that you'll have to meet to match company/store standards.
good,"This might be more store specific than company wide but some days my store seems more like a circus than an office supply store. I received a partial week of training, which was basically me figuring things out on my own. Now the supervisor takes jobs that she is not capable of doing and leaves them for me to do or tell the customer we cannot complete them.One Sunday morning an associate called in leaving the store manager and myself as the only two in the building. No-one was made to come in early to assist so projects fell behind in my assigned area due to me covering the front end. Schedule for the following week is often not done until Wednesday or Thursday, making it very hard for people who have multiple jobs to be successful at both.It seems at my store there is a whole lot of ""not my job"" going on. There is no sense of pride in people's work or drive to make customers feel welcomed and taken care of. I'm passionate about great customer service so that is one of the main reasons that I'm seeking employment elsewhere.The disorganization is intolerable in my opinion. The most enjoyable part of my day is fulfilling the needs of my customers and seeing them leave happy."
good,It was a fast pace work enviroment with a lot of daily challenges and also fun was had by the associates. Make sure you have the desire to give your all everyday and you will be rewarded.
good,"I work in the print department. Overall, not a bad experience but certainly has it's inefficientcies at times. Good for learning the ropes of customer service."
good,During my time with this company I felt as though their marketing and sales straggles were aggressive yet genius. The sales results spoke for themselves and if good rapport was established then loyal customer were sure to come back. My only complaint was the management. The store manager felt as though the store belonged to her and not the company.
good,"Overall work environment and team members were positive and fun to work around; however, if you made it clear that you couldn't work on a particular shift when hired, that was later ignored by management..... and if you didn't like your shift change (with little notice), well then you can just go find another job. "
good,I learned how to work with people and customers and I learned how to work with money since I was a cashier. The hardest part about working for this company was the consistent push to try and get people to sign up for the rewards card they had and getting in trouble when you did not get enough. I enjoyed the people there and the fact that there was something to learn every day whether it was from the actual job or something from a customer.
good,"Management needs a lot of improvement"
good,"During my time there, the Regional Production Facility suffered from a flawed business plan that resulted in overtime requirements that could demand as much as 70 to 80 hours a week during the busiest times of the year. It was perpetually under manned and under-machined because assessments were always a year behind. I built the business quickly, but since acquisitions of staff and machinery were based on the previous year's sales and activity and were never based on projected continued growth based on sales growth trends of the past several years, we were always struggling to get the work done on time. Despite these demands, morale was good and productivity was high."
good,I loved my job and the people I worked with but when my child got sick and put in the hospital they would not accommodate to my necessary time off. My old manager is no longer with the company.
good,"This is a decent place to work since you can wear jeans and the shirt is comfortable. You also get 20% off everything except technology items so you can get great deals on stuff you need."
good,"Let's just  say I love my coworkers and benefits; however they expect quite a bit of extra effort for employees, which would be fine if the pay scale reflected that."
good,typical day busy I learned good customer service management was good hardest part off my job was really nothing except hard to work hard to bring home no money
good,Good place to work if you need part time employment. Management was very flexible with hours needed. Extra work was available if needed. Training was above board.
good,"A great place to start out when you are entering the workforce, however, saw no future in long term advancements. The Co-workers are plreasurable to work with, but the low hours make it hard to dedicate to the job fully."
good,It's a great place to work if you need an easy entry level job. If you've worked retail before the customers are pretty much the same (if not nastier and incompetent)
good,"A typical day involved coming and reviewing what the previous coworker got accomplished and what needed to be finished.There was always plenty to do between creating customer ideas, (greeting cards, wedding invitations, and flyers.) actually printing the orders, stocking the print area, cleaning, and helping the customers picking up and dropping off orders."
good,"Office Depot made sure that the daily goal was clear and communicated to everyone at the time of clock-in. The team communication was great and made sure anyone in need of assistance, got it, customers and co-workers alike!"
good,"Good to work for, and a comfortable work life balance.  Salaries are decent compared to other companies in the area.  Can be stressful at times, but they try to hire enough support people in each department."
good,"It was a great company when I joined that gave work opportunities and a path to promotion. It wasn't until a major chang in management and leadership that it became an increasingly difficult place to work. where you began to see discrimination, and favoritism."
good,My experience at OfficeMax has been overall the good one. I feel the company is doing its best to stay relevant. At my particular store the management was amazing for the year-and-a-half that I was there. They were very understanding of many different situations that arose throughout that year.
good,"Coworkers are a plus, good benefits, great pay. Cons- Bad management, long hours mandatory overtime and weekends. There is a great lack of communication."
good,Office Depot is a very fast paste work environment. There is no a/c so it can get very hot but they offer beverages to keep you cool. Over all Office Depot was a pleasure to work for.
good,"It it fun and exciting work not hard to accomplish any productivity goals, easy to sell merchandise and  you are rewarded for easy up sales of merchandise. My hiring store closed and I transferred there was alot of drama and tenting between my new management team."
good,The company was a nice place to work overall. The only con was the manager that had anger issues and was very inappropriate. After i left i believe that manager was removed from management.
good,"Hard working , great place to work. Working carousels , loading trucks & running equipment . I like making sure my job is neat and it’s complete so that who ever comes in after me isn’t coming into a big mess , I want to leave with success."
good,"does not pay a lot cannot live on a salary like this, good first time job and flexible with schedules other than that bad place to work you are expected to do way more then your paid for."
good,was a little more difficult to hire for the company no full time positions available other than management roles and didn't offer part-timers any health benefits
good,It’s not a bad gig if you have a school or can work weekends. Management could be better it’s all about them and not about the workers. Will hire to many people and then they don’t have the $ to schedule you which is bizarre.
good,"There are ways to get ahead, but they're not worth your time, unless you plan on managing retail stores for your entire life. If you do, though, you can easily get to management positions within as little as a year. Once you've got a position, though, there are far better options for retail that actually have real benefits and a reasonable hourly rate, so get out ASAP."
good,The work life was a decent start as a first time worker. A typical day wasn't as hectic as most jobs. Management and associates were helpful. The hardest part was having to deal with an influx of customers during back to school sales.
good,"They don't pay you enough for the amount of BS that you go through in the day. I work in two areas and I'm only at $8/hr.. The only good thing about this place is the discounts you get as an associate. Don't get me wrong, some of the people you work with are chill, but as far as the job itself, it doesn't pay enough. Fair, I'm part-time, but even then, I'm never breaking $250 a paycheck..."
good,"All the people i worked with really cool there, nice laid back environment most the managers were nice, low advancement opportunity , only reason i stayed so long was because i liked my co-workers and we would get drunk on the weekends together and grill out"
good,"We had great associates that I got to work with over the years, but we had issues with staffing as well as employee satisfaction. We were constantly understaffed which led to all the work being done by very few people, which caused a lot of stress to myself and other associates for a very long time. Overall I am glad for the experience and the work that I was able to do with the company."
good,Office Depot was better before it merged with Office Max. Work was fun but still challenging. The hardest part was the pay. The pay could have been better for the positions. The hours were great.
good,"A typical day at Office Depot consists of waiting for someone to walk in so you can ask them if they need any help only for them to say no. Some days you work on the register but in doing so, time moves slower than working the floor."
good,"After so many years of dedicated effort to this company, all it takes is one bad manager looking for a scapegoat to end it. There is always someone above you in peril looking for a body to throw under the bus so it is not them. That is pretty much the scenario after two decades of service."
good,its a great job but the pay isn't always there what I mean is that there is a lot of opportunities to get raises and to get great benefits In reality office depot doesn't really pay their managers that well
good,Store manager at this store did not seem to care to much about the employment so it fell on me as the asm to take care of the employees. Store manager hardly ever left the office to take care of any issue other than to bury the short handed staff into projects unable to be completed in a timely manner.
good,"Simple retail job, not very many opportunities to advance. Workplace was friendly and relaxed though. Also they hire from outside the workplace which makes your time there feel unappreciated"
good,"The General Manager brought his personal life into the work place and made business decisions based on them. He tended to be casual with employees, and after several complaints were filed against him, corporate sent one of his former colleagues to do the review, a friend of his. Nothing was done about the decline in the work place environment for months until most of the employees had already left and been replaced, including all of the other management positions."
good,"Empresa dinámica,con alto sistema de aprendizaje e donde se trabaja el día a día con programas preestablecidos que ayudan al trabajador a adaptarse y realizar su día laboral cómodamente."
good,It was a good job for people that are currently in school. They are flexible with hours and its a good place to work at. If you enjoy working with customers this is a good place to work at.
good,"I enjoyed working here as it was a second job for me. A few of my managers were good. Work there is quite repetitive. Schedule is inconsistent. Some weeks I worked 3-18 hours and some weeks I worked 20+ hours. If I was called in, it was very immediate (2-8 hours before I was supposed to come in) . Regardless, it was a learning experience."
good,"Pay raises are next to nothing."
good,Make it fun youll enjoy it. They require pressure sales and don't offer A1 service product. Made number 1 rank in company for 2 years no rewards no increases.
good,"This is a good place to work if you like a slow pace environment. It is not at all busy if you work as a cashier, however it is tedious if you work in the copy and print section."
good,"I worked for the office depot tech desk. we sold Pcs , Computers, wireless networking tech. We also did some servicing & repairs of laptops and desktop computers. Software & printer sales also part of the job ."
good,The average work day was close to 12 hours. There was very limited amount of help in the store and managers were typically completing a lot of employee tasks
good,hace un buen tiempo que lavore en esta empresa pero a lo recuerdo tiene buen ambiene de trabajo .
good,"Fun place of relative experience, however new management wasnt as familiar with the work culture which caused issues with employees whom had worked there 6+ years; they left."
good,It was a day full off work hardcore get the job done. I was one of the people counted on to get the job done because i am a go getter. Everyday seem to be tougher than the day before
good,Busy work environment with long hours sometimes during the busy seasons 10-12+ shifts and quite a few Saturday and or Sunday shifts. Can be a fun place to work but can also be a very depressing place.
good,"Working at Office Depot was a fun environment to work in at times, but there was no room for growth. The pay was more like overworked and underpayed. Good for a highschool job!"
good,"Absolutely love working for the Store Manager that I have, great person, very helpful and very willing to do anything to make you better. Corporate decisions all serve their bottom line and will eventually eat away at any benefits that the job may have. Great temporary job, but don't plan on a career here unless you can get into their corporate offices."
good,"Basically, Office depot is a chill place to be inn. you will be nice customers, little tick-off customers, and other stuff. What I learned was to operate a cash register and how to approach to customers with good manner. Hardest part of the job was that you have to meet goals in order to get high wage. Enjoyable part about it is that I get along with my coworkers. I'm currently in high school and it was stressful. trying to bring my grades up and study for tests, it was difficult for me. And then I had transportation problems and family issues."
good,"OfficeMax was a good and easy first job. If selling isn't something you want to do, this won't be the job for you. Mostly did stocking and cleaning of the store until promoted to tech. Enjoyed doing the tech part of the job."
good,"Overall, working with OD was the best customer service learning experience I've had so far. I've learned quite a bit under my time with them. I went from only being able to be a register jockey to doing anything a retail environment could throw at me. Management used to say I was ""all facets"", and to this day, I believe I could still be ""all facets"" and wouldn't be able to say that if it wasn't for them."
good,"Postion is very demanding, Work culture is still changing. still very far behind other distribution companies. Company is making changes but production needs to be updated. Revolving door for entry level associates"
good,"Love the job but compensation for what I do is too low. I repair computers, sell technology computers and related products. make sure you know your products. I do merchandising, keeping records or the computers in repair and making sure customer problems or issues were resolved. I set store shelving plans as requried by corporate. Train associates I am the deparment manager"
good,"If I worked in the AM, usually would downstock for an hour or two and then roam around, helping customers or work on special projects such as setup new display or endcap."
good,Easy work but asked of a lot more than original position. Certain supervisors let power get to their head. Employees should be compensated for their hard work with more than gift cards
good,"Job is great, managers are iffy. working hours are not very accomidating, you tell the manager your hours and they dont listen to you.managers can be very confrontational."
good,Office Depot was a fun work place to develop a good foundation for customer service skills. It was possible to experience all types of customers. It also was a fast pace working environment which helped develop time management skills.
good,"The work environment is okay but can sometimes be stressful, overall I'd say its a good first job but definitely not somewhere to stay for very long.."
good,it just wasn't a good experience. the people were good to work with but the management was iffy at times and the pay raises were dirt. you aren't paid for what you are worth at all. its cool for a side job but DON'T make it your career. you're better than that.
good,Overall work environment is okay. Like any other job its stressful and there are good times too. Its a job and its not meant to be an exciting place to be at.
good,"Office Depot/Max is the kind of job you get as a college student looking for better work. They do NOT pay enough for the amount of work required for the positions of Copy and Print and Technology Services. Upper management constantly hounds stores for more productivity, all the while cutting payroll, benefits, etc. Corporate makes questionable decisions constantly; like forcing employees to work during hurricanes or shortly after them. (In Florida and Puerto Rico during/after Irma 2017.) This company isn't going to last for much longer, I give it another 5-10 years. Getting promoted for this company doesn't give you any incentives, unless you become store manager or co store manager, which is as far as you can go. The type of customer base for this company is just as toxic as the corporation itself, however there are the occasional good ones in there. The hardest time of the year for OD/OM is the end of summer for Back to School sales, which is when they get the most customers."
good,a typical day was really boring. it gradually got fast paced but at the end of the night it was nothing to do. they gave good hours and was sometimes lenient. oteer times they were strict and extra
good,"It's a decent place to work. There are flaws with any job. It's retail, what do you expect? I am full-time management and am lucky to get 36 hours per week. This company is struggling to keep it's head above water and it shows up in the daily activities. We get scrutinized if a customer review is only satisfied verses HIGHLY satisfied. There are things that can't be helped such as not enough associates to assist customers due to payroll. pricing, outs, not associates fault."
good,"Company is focused soley on turning a bigger profit than that did last year and will do anything to make that happen, including lower comp and laying off a division of field sales."
good,"The distribution center promises a lot of opportunities to advance in the company, but in reality, there is not really much to work towards. The compensation is decent, but I would like to see people getting promoted more often."
good,"Pretty friendly, trained by multiple people at the same time, not very organized, but you get to learn skills like working with others and how the cash registers work"
good,"Overall the company has options for advancement. By the end of my 2 years I was trained to do everything except Technology sales. For a company that strives for 110% customer service, there were a LOT of angry customers. Management at my particular branch wasn't great.  The environment was fast paced, which I loved. It was also very organized (thanks to 2 of the assistant managers and a couple of employees going above and beyond to make it bearable.) The hardest part of the job was picking up the slack for employees who were a no-call-no-show and trying to fix problems for customers that were created by improper training of the employees. The most enjoyable part of working there was working in the CPC (copy and print) department and taking on and completing customer jobs."
good,"While I was working at Office Depot, I learned a lot on how retail stores work - I learned how to deal with vendors and I realized how much work is done before a merchandise can reach a store - I learned the back-end of creating flyers used for week-sales. I learned how the rebates work, Office Depot is a great place to work but then then the Canadian Market is not great that it needs to shut down it's Canadian Operations."
good,awsom place to work at all the overtime you like i learned how to operate a fort lift and pallet jack and pick very fast i got along with everybody the mangers a very good people.
good,Overall a solid operation however with numerous recent changes the culture of winning has become more of saying than a way of life. Better times should be on the horizon if a new business model is seen all the way through.
good,Was good to work for till made redundant this year  but before this I found it an ok place to work for above average pay and holidays and private  health and pension
good,"Office Depot was a way to pay the bills. Nothing more, nothing less. "
good,The work there is not challenging.  Middle management is more concerned with politics and CYA than driving business and customer satisfaction.  Limited growth potential.
good,You can improve your printing and laminating skills by working in the print center. You can also learn about the printers themselves and cameras a little or just be a sales associate.
good,"Aprendes mucho en esta empresa, ya que anteriormente solo usar las maquinas de copiado y ahora se trabajar en cualquiera de las areas de la misma (Copiado, Piso de ventas, Especialista Tecnologia y cajero)"
good,I only worked for office depot for a little while it was my second job until I got full time at my main job. the job was fun and interesting. the people were nice.
good,Very challenging company to work for.  Job description seemed to change constantly.  Direct supervisor was a micro-manager.  It was his way or no way.  There was a lot of pressure.  Not enjoyable to work there.
good,"Office Depot and Office Max as brand is very competitive, but there honestly is not enough job security for associates to feel like they are appreciated. They do place incentives for associates to be successful."
good,I liked working at Office Depot. I did not always enjoy the managers. I liked helping customers with their problems and figuring out what they needed.
good,"The work tempo is like a rollercoaster, when its busy, its busy and when its slow, then its appreciated. You deal with a wide variety of customers and clients. Everyday isn't the same and can be rewarding based on what you put into it. I worked in the Copy and Print department, and I loved the idea of being able to be creative and produce an amazing product beyond the customers believe, is the best feeling I had there."
good,"if you are not a computer genius or tech savvy this job can be stressing. Upon hours of job training modules, logistics is the worst job and no time given to adjust before management is getting on you about poor performance, had to quit because i felt i would never lean how to do the scan and putaway, coworkers were nice and some managers, store manager was nice at first but will say you are underperforming, little to no help learning the job beyond training modules, was too stressed to continue so i quit"
good,"Very consistent work flow, busy for 8 hours each day. Able to cross train in lots of departments. Nice co workers and great employee sales. Good supervisors"
good,"This work environment was fun at times with lots of individual independence and many tasks allowed people to problem solve and get a little creative.  This is beneficial for people seeking a challenge and wanting more independence in the workplace but this also caused problems.  This job is very dependent on the efficiency of all associates, and when one ignores their responsibilities it can majorly set back the work of others.  Those who cannot handle the challenges and responsibility burden those who can."
good,"Working with Office Depot for a year as part of Freight crew isn't very difficult. Thought at first glance it seems to be, but if you know what you're doing and communicate with your team, manager on duty it will make things a lot easier and simple. That's why I believe this job is good for entry level applicants who need a part time. w"
good,I learned a lot about retail how a place should be organized and managed properly. I learned a lot about the needs of employees and working together towards work common goal.
good,Pretty much the movie Office Space but without cubicles. Why should I have to write any more than that? I got my point across did I not? How much more
good,"Depending on which department you work in your day will vary from fast paced to an average lull. Management is always on top of any issues that may arise and there to support the team. I would have to say that my biggest takeaway would be my ability to coach and train others as I was often in charge of training new employees in various departments. Which I would have to say are largely focused on providing excellent customer service, all the way from the stock room to the cashier and even out to the parking lot to load up their cars if needed. If I had to say what was most difficult it would be the multi-tasking (if this is not something you're familiar with or just not particularly good at that is). But by far the most enjoyable would be the payoff of completely exceeding a guest's expectations, which can lead to recognition of management and in those oh so special moments even a letter of thanks to the CEO."
good,"This was a great position for those that need a part-time position that works well with a school schedule. The training provided was never very helpful, and no one really wanted to help if you had questions."
good,"My typical day at work is coming in and having to clean all the restrooms and taking out the trash that the cashier before me ""forgot"". Then, I stand around and try to clean in between customers. When customers come in, I politely greet them and try to help them. The management there is decent. They try to help as much as they can with schedule issues. The hardest part of the job is standing around and finding things to do after 5 p.m., because then only a few customers come in after that. The easiest part and most enjoyable part of the day is tidying up the shelves."
good,good starting out company of if you are willing to stay for 20yr to make more then 15hr. has some decent perks like gift cards or good work but horrible management
good,"El apoyo a la empresa lo entiendo pero casi todos los días pones de tu tiempo y no hay incentivo por el tiempo extra, la principal razón de decercion de empleados"
good,"A typical day at Office depot consists of assisting different customers and helping out throughout the store. I learned a lot about how to handle the cash register and how to handle difficult customers. The management did need some improvement. The workplace culture was diverse and everyone knew each other. The hardest part of the job was learning how to adjust to the fast-paced, busy hours because it was a little difficult being able to get things done in a timely manner. It was difficult in terms of trying to satisfy the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers when they needed help and offering help to make sure they got what they wanted."
good,"Management, and the workers were severely overworked. Staffing hours allot were never enough, and that lead to many complaints. Sadly, the head office did not care. It was not unusual to spent 10-14 hours a day at the store. Mainly to pick up the slack due to being short staffed."
good,"Basically, it's a job.  Not too hard, pay is a tad above minimum wage and don't expect to advance to anything besides a manager.  It's a job to work at until you can find something better."
good,"My immediate team at Officemax was mostly great people but, at the corporate level, numbers were all that mattered. Having toured the district, going to different stores for training and such, I was quickly struck by how each location had much different clientele. Such differing demographics, logically, should be taken into account but they were ignored."
good,"a typical day at work consists of printing out all kinds of projects, reports for school work for both students and teachers. some other things would be things like laminating papers and projects, binding papers together in different ways, making up invitations ,blue prints, and posters."
good,"Was a chishier , kept counters clean . Ilearned anout timing there as well, its full of  happy people that are willing to work, which was the most enjoyable part as well having a team of people that help you whe you need it and can work ln their own s well (if they had to.)"
good,This is a great place for a first job. The work load is relatively easy and the coworkers are very helpful. Coming from a fast food job to retail was an easy transition and my manager was flexible with my school schedule.
good,Platt security is a good security company to work for. The management team is always available to help with any problems that arise during any work shift. The dispatch office is very friendly and will call and ask if anyone wants to pick up extra hours for the week.
good,"Management can get micromanegey and pay isn't fantastic but it is what it is. I have nothing else to say. "
good,"a typical day for me will be come in at 6 am. and count the inventory, when that is finished continue with receiving product or picking product for the put away team. If the volume is low and all that is accomplished i will do either special project work, or continue with the put away of the product, either bulk or bin. "
good,I felt very secure in my job here. I was comfortable in my work environment as well. My days where very routine but that was expected. All in all nothing in this job came as a negative except for the management. The store manager didn't often promote positive behavior by portraying it.
good,"I like the store that I work in. I respect and appreciate the management staff, but the decision that the corporate office makes  leads me to believe that this company is really struggling"
good,"Always a busy hustling environment, every day is different with various constraint effecting supply chain. "
good,"Depending on the position, this job does get monotonous.  The management at this particular location is relaxed. Relaxed to the point that you, as the associate, may feel exploited. Overall the job is chill but boring. Policies are very lax."
good,The management at Office Depot is reasonably easygoing and works with college students to accommodate their schedules.  The work is fairly routine; waiting on customers and assisting them in finding their items for purchase.  My co-workers are generally college-age students.  The hardest part of the job is getting enough work hours every week.
good,"I enjoyed working with customers, but found limited opportunities to apply the full range of my skills.  Management was often unable to address employee issues or reward exceptional performance.  Limited opportunities for advancement during the time of my employment."
good,We were taught every department in the store. I was taught how to push sales on the electronics and was made more knowledgeable on computers and printers. When I first started there I had great management but most of them left when OfficeMax converted with Office Depot. The hardest part of the job had to have been seeing my management leave and watching the change that affected a lot of the associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was before the switch we had a lot of fun. There was a lot of laughter in the store. It was also nice when customers came in for specific associates because we all brought something different to the table to help in certain parts of the store.
good,"I very much enjoyed working at the office depot. the management was excellent, my co-workers were great. They were flexible to work with, other than being handed down ridiculous corporate policies."
good,The people are good but there is no room for advancement. The schedule were constantly changed so we couldn't get certain days off even when requested.
good,"It was a cool place to work at. I had a lot of cool and fun people to work with that made the job easier on the spirit. The management, albeit they were all cool and laid back, were too lax from time to time."
good,"Working in the copy and print section of office depot is very challenging. Learning to work all the machines and how to make numerous things like checks, poster, stamps, books, englargements."
good,Generally you will work with wonderful people and be brought down by corporate micro-managing. Horrible insurance. Refusal to promote. Cut payroll when short staffed. Look elsewhere
good,"- une journée de travail typique est éprouvantes mais chaque jour est nouveau et chaque client reste encore à conquérir malgré tout il y a toujours un challenge à relever."
good,The company is good to work for the only thing is; you have to do the same amount of task or more with less people and payroll. No consistency at times but I love the people I work with and the environment
good,"Working here requires a serious work ethic, the days are long and often hot given the seasonal nature of work (december holidays). "
good,"It was fun joking about with colleagues as the work was done. It was long days and sometimes it got quite boring. I didn't really learn much on the job as it was fairly repetitive, unless learning how the system works counts."
good,Great company to work for before Office Depot merger! they consistently cut hour but demand you do the same amount of work!
good,It's nice to have job security this job does not offer that closing and not offering everybody position who's been there a long time
good,"the work is good and its easy work but the hours and the ""team"" togetherness is non existant. i enjoyed my job. but i didnt like how it was ran, how there was favorites. and if you wherent one of the favorites good luck getting hours or getting any sign of respect."
good,el trabajo esta muy bien solo que falta que den mas prestaciones ya que solo daban el imss
good,Working at Office Depot has been a good experience. I enjoy the people I work with and I have built strong customer relations with my customers. Office Depot has seen many changes and although it's been fairly easy navigating the changes I think it's time to try experience new change with a new employer. Office Depot will continue to grow and I am very fortunate to have been a part of a great group.
good,"When I started working for Office Depot back in 2011 management was good and pay was slightly above average, but annual raises and even raises for good annual reviews were a joke (literally a few cents, 10 cents max). The only way to receive a decent raise is by having a good relationship with the store manager and asking for a raise after going up and beyond your work duties, etc. "
good,They don't give credit when credit is due. I'm currently a technician been reaching my goals triple as much as than my Senior Tech Consultant for the past 3 months yet he still gets paid 12/hr and I get paid as much as the cashier. Lots of favoritism.
good,"•	Opening and closing procedures with store key"
good,I was more of a cashier and depending on who was there we would rotate to the sales floor which you needed to be knowledgeable about the merchandise the customer was interested.
good,"Awful job, wonderful people. Company gives no hours to complete crazy amount of work. No benefits. The End The End The End"
good,"here we still had to work hard but we were helped by the store manager a lot, this is before they transferred him"
good,Employees focus on customers and do their best to satisfy their needs. You cannot please everyone and management needs to be strong leaders for their employees so they can do well. Management needs to motivate employees. Working in a team and good communication with each other is important for things to run smoothly. The hardest part is when customers get really upset about certain things. I enjoy working with my fellow coworkers.
good,I only worked there for 4 months. There's no enough training especially working as a Customer Care Specialist (from the location I worked). Disorganized and mismanagement.
good,"I love how much emphasis the company puts on going above and beyond for customers. Whenever an employee does something exceptional, we receive recognition cards, which always makes you feel nice."
good,"Delivering world class customer service all while growing one customer at a  time.  A day at Office Max was always a challenge in a good way. Leading my team to ensure that all customers were taken care of and treated with the customer service that they deserve. Maintaining highly satisfied customer service surveys. Exceeding daily sales goals."
good,I began as cashier and advanced to the copy and print department within two years.I also learned the stock portion of the job which allowed me to be very a versatile employee available in all departments. My managers were very helpful in allowing me to do more for the customers making for better service for each customer.
good,This job is pretty flexible with your schedule and provides the minimum salary and benefits. There are a variety of job titles/positions that you could learn or be hired into.
good,"As a cashier, everything was scripted... It wasn't a fun place to work. Most jobs encourage you to have a good time to make the customer feel comfortable and want to come back, but that was hard to do with such an everyday-routine job."
good,"Most co-workers worked on edge as management policed the floor making you feel as if you were not an adult. The work was enjoyable, but no one should go to work every day fearing it may be their last day there. The pay does not compete with others in the industry."
good,On m'a confié en 2006 pour tâche de faire mes preuves en 1 semaine au seing de la société et j'y suis restée prêt de 10 ans .. évolution de carrière très difficile très peu d'opportunités et le salaire n'est pas à la hauteur du travail fournit
good,Great for an entry level job into retail and customer service.  Great for advancing in the company quickly.  Coworkers were awesome and great to get along with.
good,"A typical day at work involved taking customers orders and printing production. I learned very little other than customer service skills. Some managers took their job seriously and were excellent while others were lacking severely in their skills. My co-workers were the best part of the job, but that is because we all talk about how much it sucked to work there."
good,"Good company to work for a lot of expectations on achieving  metrics on all aspects of the business. Not to much payroll when it comes to stores,overall good place to work waiting on merger information with Staples which can change everything."
good,"Office Depot has taught me a lot about working hard and working smart. How the company itself works is a little strange and inefficient, but i've learned how to sell proficiently and really learned how to connect with customers. Most of this i've had to learn on my own; training is not a  big focal point. I love my coworkers, really nice and down to earth people. I have two managers i can go to for anything and have passed on their wisdom of, not just work, but life in general. the job itself is particularly easy if you can sell and build relationships with customers. i would say the most enjoyable part of my job is the growth that i have personally seen in  myself and the growth that i am continuously trying to provide to others. My coworkers and even some management look up to me because of my charisma and passion to help people and better myself in any way, shape, or form."
good,"Unless you intend to move into management I cannot recommend this company as a long term proposition. And if you do move into management your position will be somewhat tenuous until you move into upper (regional) management."
good,Work at Office Depot for seven months while i attended Tulsa Welding School. My overall job was to stock the store and set planograms for new merchandise.
good,"On a typical day one would usually attend to customers, uncovering their needs pertaining anywhere from technology to your everyday office essentials. Some stocking as well as various cleaning duties. Somewhat active on a daily basis."
good,Very customer service oriented. Mostly fun place to work and many skills can be learned. It has helped me to grow my skills in computer repair as well as customer service. There are certain areas that the company could do a better job focusing and rebuilding on.
good,it was very inateresting place to learned about office supplies and technologies like computers and its programs. It had a very cooperitive co-werkers and good managers.
good,"Needs less management, or at least one tht is talking to the other. "
good,"You always get something new everyday, the orders that come in are somewhat surprising. you learn a lot with the computer programs. and its great to see that you can make someone's day by completing their order"
good,"I did have great co-workers. The management had a really hard time scheduling me during my available times. I was only able to work so late due to the fact that I have kids and a husband that works out of the country. I was told many times that it would be fixed, but it never was."
good,"Overall great experience"
good,"With OfficeMax, a typical day includes stocking, checking out, cleaning, selling & customer service.  Unlike most retail, OfficeMax tries to put customer focus and personal selling more to the forefront, using mobie technology to assist with faster information lookup & managers are given better training to help employees be customer centered.  Downside is depends on store location/culture and manager as some are far better than others.  Management amongst co-workers depends, usually there's tension that there doesn't need to be due to communication."
good,"Customer service is their highest focus. Dedicated to providing excellent customer service at all times. Company policies and standards are taken very seriously, from obtaining surveys to enrolling customers in our rewards program."
good,"This is a good job if you are willing to learn about printers,chairs, desks and any other office supplies to sell them to customers correctly, but there is almost no room for advancement, and at the location I worked at the management was poor. and the business was slow. As a business is going through change in ownership the employees kind of fell to the side."
good,Same here I was terminated do to medical complications I could have went back but I feel they would do it all over again it was a good place to work but they didn't care for their employees
good,Location of store is decent. This store had a high theft rate. Its a good start getting into customer services and to learn basic computer skills while testing you patients with customers.
good,"The pay is okay, the staff is friendly, the hours are 20-25 a week, must be on time, must be able to work flexible shifts. Good hob for a student because they work around your schedule."
good,Job is not bad tring  to transition from max to depot was frustrating but overall I rate my experience a 70 out of 100. As I did not stay with the company long enough to make a better assessment
good,Great people to work for.  Merger has created some hard times and the future with Staples is uncertain.  They are not willing to ask the people who do the work what the best way to approach it.
good,"Enjoyable place to work but if your looking for advancement then office depot wouldn't be the place for you to apply. If your looking for a second job or a job for while your in school, then you'll find no better place to work."
good,"One of the most unsatisfying jobs in my life. To much red tape and politics. Long hours of travel for short district meetings. Parts of the job were great, my staff, the money, the customers."
good,There is a huge turnover at this company and it seems to be the disorganization at the distribution center.  My fellow co-workers are a great bunch to work with but the moral is low due to the dysfunction.  We are working long hours and for the most part it is unnecessary.  Management seems unaware as to what is going on and is repeatedly ignoring when we try to explain the problems and possible solutions.
good,"As an Office Depot associate I had a lot of fun with the job. It was fun to converse with customers and teach them about technology, often times it seemed like the customers had a fun time too. All the other associates were wonderful, fun, energetic people that would gladly lend you a hand when you needed it."
good,"I spent most of the day working with returns, pulled/shipped orders, inventory control, and some clerical work.  The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy weighted furniture. I enjoyed classifying returns by if it was a reusable product or if it had to be destroyed. People tended to work as a team together."
good,"Se maneja mucha presión y se tiene que tener tolerancia, aprendí tecnicas de venta y negociación. Buen ambiente de trabajo entre los compañeros."
good,"This job was horrible because of the management. They were switched around too often and couldn't get peoples schedules correct. From this job I learned the importance of team work, also how to use several machines in the copy center such as the printers, binding machines, laminating machines and more. The hardest part of this job was being able to help all the customers, and working with a changing management crew. The most enjoyable part of this job was working in the Copy Center."
good,"NSW base team extremely dedicated and are business driven, high performers, work as a team and supportive at all times."
good,Solid place to work...Initially worked at ODP from 06-11' with little room for advancement as a department manager. Took on a role at OMX in 11' as ASM at the training store and was promoted  to SM within a year and half.
good,Great place to work if your into customer service. Plenty of chances to sell and to meet new people. I work with a great team who strive daily to improve the sales numbers while having fun in the process. The hardest part of the job is not being able to be there for every single customer all of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see returning happy customers who know you by name.
good,"Because of the possible merger with Staples the company seems to have stalled.  It has great potential but the forward progress has stopped.  The director of sales was fired for stealing company property that was sold on ebay under several aliases.  I've never seen a more enemic sales force.  I'm waiting for the new, more qualified, director to just walk the floor and fire people on the spot.  No way of knowing your number, or how you're doing against your goal.  It's pretty bizarre."
good,"I enjoy the early morning shift and get the day started with filling in the daily goals for our department (copy and print).  "
good,"I have worked for this company since 2012 and I love working there, mostly because I knew what I was doing. The chemistry between everyone was firm and excellent."
good,"The associates that work in the Boca office are all very nice and friendly, and so is middle management. However, as a result of the merger between Office Depot and Office Max, things are very hectic and people have very large work loads. Additionally, with the pending acquisition by Staples, people are feeling uneasy and looking for other jobs. Upper management does not do a good job of communicating updates to associates. "
good,This was a great first experience in the real world for work. Before working here I had very little experience and hardly any real references to help pursue more advanced careers. I was able to gain basic knowledge about working with customers on a daily basis as well as performing my assigned duties in a timely manner.
good,I was able to learn basic selling techniques to be able to use with customers. I also would give demos on how to use certain products.
good,"A typical day at work involved helping customers to locate items on their list and answering questions about various products. I worked mostly with office furniture, so I learned quite a bit about the various manufacturers and materials. The only hard part of the job was the heavy lifting."
good,"Working at Office Depot as a Sales associate has taught me a lot about customer service. Customers are always right even if they are blatantly wrong. If you ever have an issue with anything in the store such as coupons or out of stock products, just raise your voice a few notches and Office Depot/Office Max (welp, they're all STAPLES now I guess) will bend over backwards for you. There is no Policy. If the employee is going by the books trying to enforce a ""return policy""   and the customer gets upset, a manager will swoop right in to save the customer's day, making the employee the bad guy when they were just trying to do their job. - At least that's what happened at my store in pines."
good,"Restock shelves, unload the truck, help customers when the required help, basically your standard restocking job. Back to school time was the hardest part of the job because of how much stuff was needing to be placed."
good,"Work a four to five hour shift four to five days a week. Learned to use large copy machines. Management is good, co-workers are easy to get along with. Making sure all the customers are greeted in a timely fashion.  The reacting to customers is the best."
good,"Good place to work, but no room for growth, and there is no challenge out of what is you daily duty. Everybody is specialize in what they know how to do. Nobody don't to learn new skills"
good,"Office Depot is okay for a ""I need the money now"" type of job, but if you want to advance in the company you will have a tough time doing so. Its perfect for high school or college kids. The money is easy and as long as you come into work and actually do work, you won't have any problems."
good,Office Depot is an ok place to work.  Decent benefits and vacation pay. I was laid off in january after 19 years.  My direct management was excellent.  Co-workers were great.  I worked for OfficeMax and we were bought out by Depot.  I haven't had much interaction with the Depot corporate culture.  I
good,"run the floor while the manager sits in the office."
good,"a typical day at this job is helping customers find products they are looking for, setting up online access for customers to order online, issue return requests and placing orders.  hardest part of this job is trying to help make a bad situation good or working with not all the tools you need to be able to help customers during the first time they call."
good,"Abrir tienda ,realizar programas ,realizar inventarios atencion a clientes,resolver problemas supervicion de personal ,revicion de reportes"
good,Delivered office supplies to businesses. Enjoyed working with the public.
good,Was a job while i was going to school.  hours were alright do to my school schedule but the advancement was not there
good,"Day consisted of meeting and unloading truck with inventory for the day. Scanning and Labeling each item to be placed on the floor. Stocking each item in its respective place and insuring product was neatly organized and easily accessible. "
good,"Customer service is a must in a place like this.  I started off as a cashier and then was placed in customer service before I was moved to cash office attendant.  There I learned how to do all the reports for the store such as: Coupon Reports, Register Reports, Return Reports and Furniture Reports ect. I was in charge of the safe and ordering change for the store and making the bank deposits.  I also had to keep the petty cash in order for when they needed to purchase something for the store.  Keeping tract of the employees activity with their register to ensure no theft was a vital part of my job.  There are many different departments in Office Depot and I learned how to work in most of them so that I could help to fill in if needed.  The most enjoyable part of the job would have been the reports and keeping track of all the monies coming in and out of the store."
good,"The work is good and easy, and the company tries hard for profits, and has came up with a great new strategies to sell, but can hurt a experienced sells person, because you have to do it there way, step by step. I went from being one of the top sales people to one of the lowest because i was forced to change my selling tactics."
good,I enjoyed interacting with the Customers that I would deliver product to and supply them with the customer service that they deserved!  It is physical work in all kinds of weather but I loved it till the Management at Corporate office decided to lay off their delivery drivers thinking that it would be beneficial to sub-contract out the deliveries to other delivery services ... I think they have figured out that the customer service hurt them and they lost business!
good,I learned how to work with others in achieving and going beyond what was needed.
good,"Slow paced, easy place to work, needs new management."
good,"Help customers and drive sales for the day."
good,I used and learned the knowledge of the computer programs available there.
good,"-easy going and sometimes busy"
good,great experience and great people.coworkers are friendly
good,only mangers can be full time and low pay but its a good Job for Someone in or right out of HighSchool.
good,"A typical day at work will be to checkout customers items, give outstanding customer service any chance we would have. I learned how to use copy machines more effectively. Management was ok until it changed over. The hardest part about the job was the impatient customers."
good,"A good place to work,but not satisfied with the salary and perks"
good,office depot is pretty good at understanding you do have a life outside of work and will work with you on your schedule.
good,"customer service, assisted sales force with product research and quotes"
good,"1.Mannage relative work so it can rely by the other Person."
good,"Overall not a bad company, could be less complicated with policies and focus points. Management is good and bad, easy to get along with but not very constructive. Compensation and Advancement is terrible at best. They hire everyone in a part-time and minimum wage regardless of previous experience. Never offer to move you to full-time and raises are very hard to come by, yet expect you to be fully crossed trained for every dept in the store and perform at a very high level. Always hired managers in from outside the company many times with no office supply experience or management experience instead of promoting from within the company."
good,"Started as a sales associate all the way up to a manager with open/close ability. learned to stock shelves all the way to creating a schedule and manage employees, goals and money."
good,"Average nationwide chain company. Plenty of opportunity, however the pay is limited."
good,"The co workers are great to be around, listens well and are willing to complete task, Management stinks half of the manager know how to run operations out of 10 managers 3 knows the operation. They always make changes in the wrong direction. The management take breaks for hours and days off when wanted. HR is corrupted. The job is great other than some upper Management and the clueless managers that run the building."
good,Days are focused on acquiring new large accounts.  Always learning to sell the values and systems of our organization.  Great experience selling because the competition is very similar so strategic selling and developing relationships is key.
good,"Office Depot is not neccessarily a bad company to work for, in fact it's pretty decent. The pay, not so much  but for students and those with a low living cost it may be suitable. Personally I found the pay verses the job duties did not balance. I would do Management work and take on Management stress for minimum dollar and eventually that was not where i wanted to be. "
good,"In Office Depot, you rarely have time to get your tasks done, as they rush you around the store giving you precious little time to get your tasks done."
good,Working in a warehouse was hot at times and tough hauling material. I learned how to be a hard worker. The management was pretty good. Co-workers were really good and always was nice. Hardest part of the job is working in hot warehouse all day.
good,"The day starts off at around 6a.m. My coworkers and i break down freight in the back room, then we put all the supplies from the freight away on the sales floor. That takes about 2 hours. Hrdest part of the day is moving the furniture to its right section because of the weight."
good,"A typical day at work would start off at 7 am. I would come in and print out neccesary price changes and ads needed for that day. I would then look into Microsoft Outlook for any pending print jobs that needed to be completed for the day. I would open the front doors at 8 am and greet the customers with a smiling face and ask them if they needed any assistance and then return to my post. Which was the Copy and Print Dept., where I rang up sales, answered phones, made copies for customers and or Management. I would do this until my shift ended."
good,"A typical day starts at 6 and ends at 12, I learned Logistics and office supplies, Management was frinendly but I had a problem with job seceiuty my co-workers were friendly n helpful, the hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours...."
good,"I like working at Office Depot, but i don't like the fact that no one ever advances and people from out side the company are given the promotions. It took me 3 years to get my first review and first raise. I have trained over 2 dozen other employes, I am always surprised at the turnover."
good,"Office Depot provides supplies and services to its customers through 1,641 worldwide retail stores, a dedicated sales force, top-rated catalogs and global e-commerce operations."
good,Not sure it's moving in the right direction. They have went all in on a strategy that still doesn't address customer service
good,"daya to day work volume, but usually steady work thriugh the day. Co workers make the day go by fast even on long days.The hardest part of the day is after lunch when we would get alot of orders. But the best part of the day is lunch time when everyone gets together and just laughs."
good,"Work was always fun everyone in a good mood ready to work,I always had something to keep me busy if it wasn't keeping up with the customers every need I was cleaning,organizing recycled ink or typing in work life rewards,my co-workers were all very helpful with everything i needed.I came into this job not knowing too much about the copy and print center but the six months that I was there I learned alot from a simple copy to coil binding and formats,but it wasn't always easy I would personally say that at Office Depot the copy and print service center was the hardest there for me but it was a challenge and that is what made it fun. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers I loved providing the fast paste everyone wants when they go to check out at the register I understood how important everyones time is to get what they need and go and the customers always notice. I loved so much about Office Depot I just had one little problem the manager I didn't enjoy too much when he was around me because he would use faul language with me and all my complaints on him went unnoticed and that is what caused me to resign he took it too far one day and I had enough If it wasn't for that I would still be there loving my job!"
good,grow my accounts and go after new business. i have learned retain accounts new and old. as well there are different types of managers. toughest part about working here is being confined to one place. closing business is the most enjoyable part.
good,"Working at office depot is a great experience, my managers are incredibly welcoming and fun while keeping their management position seriously. Although the opportunity for advancement is very slim. unless you sell thousands a day, or know people higher up chances for advancement are slim."
good,I have enjoyed my time working there through the years. I have met so many people and enjoyed great learning experiences
good,Greeting customers and giving information about product knowledge. I learned how to be a better customer service representative. Management is great never had a problem with my supervisor or co-workers. The job is really easy once get to know about all the products in the store and I enjoyed working there.
good,"This is a great place to work for people who are friendly and sales driven. The management is empathetic towards individual's personal lives and they generally would like you to succeed. Unfortunately, in the New England area Office Depot is smothered by Staples so there is little to no chance for advancement."
good,i started out as stocker i worked my way to furniture sales.team work was great
good,*Cashier
good,Management is poor. Employees have all been there for awhile and they are starting to clean house. The best part of the job is its flexability and pay. The hardest part of the job is it is all about making your quota. You are treated as a number and not a person.
good,I started as a stock person after a couple of years I move up to computer sale if you work hard and show up on time you can move up pretty fast
good,"not so good benefits, management or benefits. Managers would not consider your opinion and would not go the estra mile to satisfied custumers."
good,"Major changes every 6 to 12 months.  Commission very difficult to obtain."
good,Light work not back breaking at all. Too many chiefs. There are many supervisors and managers but they are not all on the same page. Some co-workers are lazy which causes your workload to be more than it should but I think that's with all jobs.
good,Great place to work. Good work environment. Employees and staff members are respectful. Trying to follow Agile methodology. Learned lots of new technology over the year.
good,"I was fortunate enough to gain experience in the management field, and advance myself in the aspects of operations management and able to properly assist customers."
good,I enjoyed the challenge of creating a new brand (Vital Communications) within Office Depot. I had both support from the group and the freedom to grow a start-up.
good,"es buena, me enseño lo necesario para superarme. ingrese como auxiliar, y por mi desempeño me supere y logre ascender a supervisor."
good,"I personally enjoyed working there, management are very nice people, very knowledgeable. I left because they couldnt offer a full time position, but all in all a fun place to work and the people are good"
good,I wanted to enjoy my job and hours. The management and training was horrible and made it hard to like.  I didn't work enough hours to remember what I was trained on the register or printers.
good,"This company is probably not going to last much long. I doubt they'll last through the new decade. I do not recommend working for this company, unless you want to be on the ride for thew sinking ship."
good,"The managers press really weird ""sales quotas"" that need to be met, rewards signups, selling products, but simply most people already have a rewards account (Probably around 90% of shoppers) and people dont want to add on extra, overpriced additives to their technology. Both of these make it quite annoying to work, especially when its slow and theres nothing to do."
good,"There were peak times and slow times. There were times when there'd be pressure to rush, but to do things right meant to take time. When steps and procedures weren't followed, it bothered me, and on the other hand, I felt there were steps and procedures that weren't necessary and slowed productivity and hurt the company. It was the first job where I worked with a computerized inventory device and prepared orders for delivery and in-store pick up. The hourly wage, working around my course schedule, and chance to pick up extra hours were indeed a plus."
good,"El trabajo no es tan estresante, ai la ases de todo no nada mas estás en tu área lo malo es veces la gente que labora ai."
good,This job was very professional. Management was great they were very down to earth. They helped with problems most of us couldn’t figure out. The most enjoyable part of the job was the early morning store meetings.
good,It was a good job just wasn't interesting enough for me. I really wanted a job where im busy always doing something. I like a job where its busy and fast pace.
good,"picking and packing, health and safety, following instructions, entering data, waste disposal, managing own time, operating production line machinery and equipment."
good,Office depot was an ok experience. I worked with stocking the store and some customer interactions but I would be gone by the time most customers showed up.
good,"very stressful place, long hours and not enough rewarding, bt in the same time it is a good place to start as it gives you some experience to start you carrier"
good,"The hardest part working at Office Depot is dealing with angry customers, but if you know how to relate to people it makes it easier. Having a good manager helps alot. Overall Office Depot is a good place to work."
good,"We always had to stock product that got shipped, routine clean up before we close. We always had business meetings every once 2 months talking about what we can improve on. We pushed insurance on technology as a form of commission to get paid more for our time there."
good,Moving up is basiclly impossible. A good place to work coming out of college or a stop on your way to a real career. Stuck in bad processes that are out dated.
good,My only issue was my paycheck was a week and half late but I loved working there the manager were great and the environment was a mix between laid back and hectic which I loved
good,Customer service is top priority. I enjoy helping people and I  meet different people each day that's what I like the most. Learning there needs and wants. What business around area are doing and hosting as I do a job for them in print shop.
good,"Unfortunately due to leadership, I have been in the same position for years with no promotion and that applies to most people on my team. "
good,Good entry level job for someone in high school to make some extra cash and learn a little bit about   Customer service and office and home organization and copy and print industry
good,Pues es recomendable para personas con mucha disponibilidad de tiempo y sin vida social
good,"Great place to start of your young life with if your coming out of school, a good place to work and very fast pace during peak season and more money but other then that Office Depot a good place to work."
good,It's a fine job if you need to make some cash or if you're crazy passionate about paper. It's your standard retail job with your standard retail job duties and tasks. Nothing too overwhelming or underwhelming. Just a job.
good,its a good place to get your foot in the workforce without all the fuss. small store low employees mostly Part-timers and only Full-timers are mostly managers not ok when your in the holidays.
good,"The company is great to work for in the short-term, but there are almost no opportunities to advance to a larger role. They always promote from outside the company rather than from within. They also take advantage of hard working employees by giving them added responsibilities without an increase in pay."
good,"Normal work place. Very exigent with the customer service. Very relaivable back up  service by dispatchers. "
good,Muy buena empresa pero hay veces que el personal que la administra no es etica
good,Typical warehouse job where products are being received and shipped out and we as associate have to deliver the products to its destination in a timely manner.
good,It was a job. My store manager was a great person but the company itself was flailing to stay afloat. The pay was subpar. I rarely had to travel. There was constant updates to how the job should be done with little time to learn before completely changing again.
good,"Office Depot | Office Max was once a great company to work for before online retailers such as Amazon strangled this market.  To survive Office Depot bought Office Max and then tried to merge with Staples, which was blocked by FTC.  With lower revenue came big cuts to wages, bonuses, benefits, and hours.  General Managers are expected to work and cover a number of shifts to make payroll to the extent more hours are spent working as an associate than manager."
good,Office depot is a demanding job with its wide inventory to the many tech machines and there functions such as microsoft word exel and powerpoint. I also learned 10 point at the time i was working at office depot
good,"I didn't mind working at Office Depot in the beginning, but as time went on I started to lose interest more and more!!! A typical day at work was slow and it was boring when we had no customers for a period of time. The hardest part of the job was making sure we offered everything we were suppose to. Overall I would give my experience working there a 3 out of 5."
good,I was very excited to get my position with Office Depot and have always gave a 110%.  I enjoyed my twenty three years with the company.  And had a chance to work with allot of good people.
good,Office is based in my home and averaged 10 hour days including leaving my office for meetings.  Traveled throughout the US for customer meetings and events.  The Leadership team is focused on changing the culture.
good,"For part-time work this place is great to start at however, there aren't that many opportunities for growth within the company on a store level. The main reason for being unhappy at work is the limited opportunity for growth, and well, I want to grow."
good,"Worked there for 8 years, typical work day was 10 to 12 hours a day. Continued my knowledge in running a day to day operations of the business being a general manager."
good,"At first, it was a good job and it was a lot fun with great fellow employees. Then our head manager got promoted and moved, and this wannabe hot shot manager came in from Miami. After that, the work culture changed so dramatically that I had to leave."
good,Busy and schedule adjustments. Employee turnover was high for my store but worked at another location and the employees seemed to have maintained stability and worked well together. Overtime was almost always needed due to short staff.
good,Could be a little more helpful with training. But other then that office Depot is a pretty cool place to work when your trynna go far in that type of work
good,"Worked 10 t0 12 hours a day, weekend off and holidays. Continuous change environment. Most be adaptable. Health Insurance, 401k options, and vacation time"
good,"the store was fine to work in, I wouldnt reccomend it to anyone unless they really needed a job. The people that I worked with were really fun most of the time but upper management was wildly out of the loop about how the store actually ran compared to their vision of how it should be done."
good,A typical day at work for me would depend on if I was working the morning shift or afternoon shift if I was working the morning shift it would be getting ready to open the store by doing price changes restocking shelves and clean the place up to make the store look better. What I learned there was how to talk to customers or people better and I was able to learn how to use a register use the printing Department just to print out the price changes. The management is good now they treat everybody nicely. The workplace environment will be nice and helpful but slightly competitive. The hardest part are the job for me would be trying to find where everything was in the store cuz I would always mislead a customer by accident. The most enjoyable part of working at Office Max would be getting to learn new stuff.
good,"You have to work overtime unless you are part time. There is a designated start time, but it is unclear when you will be done for the day. You are allowed two breaks within in an 8 hour day (3 breaks when you work more than 10 hours)."
good,Not willing to write a review of Office Depot even though you state it’s anonymous. Thank you for your curiosity. Sorry I can’t help you at this time.
good,"I worked in the Corporate office, Boca Raton, during their Accounts Receivable change over from one system to another.  It was a temp job assigned by a temporary agency."
good,"coming into Office Max was always catching up from the previous day. A lot of freight work, and overstock. helping customers in the print and making sure we do exactly what they ask for their business was the hardest part of the job. Working as a team to accomplish the same goals to make sure the store succeeds."
good,"If you get recruited to the education team at office Depot, just know that the managing director is awful. "
good,"Working here is alright I guess you can say, I was a cashier and I loved doing my job but I wish I could’ve got more recognition for my work since I knew more about the cash register functions more than people who have been there longer than me. For cashiers you do have to meet a goal for protection plans on equipment and signing customers up for the rewards program. If you don’t meet the company requirements then they .will let you go and give you less hours. Management wasn’t the best but we all got the work done. Honestly for me personally I did more work then I got paid to do"
good,"Office Max was a pretty good place to work. the pay wasn't great to start, but with annual reviews, there was plenty of room for raises. The environment in the store was very good, however some of the management left something to be desired."
good,First off I am a woman and I am against female only management meetings that would have nothing to do with the company put a bunch of well paid women spending/wasting company payroll money while thier stores lacked proper hours for employees to do their jobs.
good,The job was fairly easy. We woud unload the truck in the morning and stock the shelves. Also we scan al products to check the price two times a week. And helped customers with product knowledge.
good,"The managers I worked under and the associates I worked with were all great. We all enjoyed helping each other out and working as a team. That being said, corporate requirements and expectations continued to get harder and more unreasonable. The managers also were not allowed to pay associates based on merit due to corporate constraints so good associates could not really be rewarded. Overall the staff was great but the corporate offices made the job unbearable with an unacceptably low wage."
good,"Just like any other retail position, it's alright. You'll be trained in a specific area and may or not be trained properly. You'll also be expected to work in other departments but won't be cross trained unless it's the register. You'll basically be expected to learn a lot yourself. You'll also be made to push multiple services/subscription services to customers."
good,"Services have to be sold on a daily basis. You can have a clean store and make all your sales goals, that will not matter.  You have to sell their product protection plans."
good,Typical day at work I would be at cashier helping people find what they need and helping them checkout. I learned how to be fast paced in cashier. It was a must that we keep every single area of the workplace cleaned. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a few customers. The most enjoyable part was talking to my manager or having friendly conversations with a few of the customers
good,"Working for Office Depot OfficeMax was stressful in the Copy and Print department. I was new to the position and was pushed to open and close the department on weekends. A regular occurrence for that department was have a line of four to six customers and only me to assist them. Even when I asked management for backup they would prioritize other areas of the store. Didn't really get breaks all that often, since most associates weren't trained in the department. Thankfully I had two senior people in that department to help me while they were off duty but that wore on their work-life balance. There were a few good people that kept the store going but in the end it wasn't worth it for my own mental health."
good,"This job was perfect for me at the time - 20+ hours a week, lots of coworkers around my age, and a fun workplace environment. I couldn't see it being a career, but it's a great place to start your professional life!"
good,"A typical day for me was organizing, cleaning restocking and doing inventory. Working in Office Depot OfficeMax I learned to do mental math faster. More than 50% of our customers speak only Spanish so I’ve become much more fluent in Spanish. What I enjoy most at work is being able to help a customer leave with what they needed and with a smile on their faces."
good,Casual retail environment. Comparable to other retail stores in the same business like FedEx and Staples. Training and machines are pretty dated and new roll outs are not done well. Over all though it's been a pleasure to work here though.
good,The typical day at Office Depot meant making sure customers got the supplies they were looking for and completing customer orders. I've learned how to work in a competitive fast paced environment and deal with hard to please customers. The hardest part of the job would be when others leave more jobs for you to do because they do not understand how to do them. Management could use some work. Not enough communication going on.
good,"A typical day is ""system overload"" from start to finish.  There are an innumerable amount of tasks to complete daily and more are added throughout the day.  However, tasks must never be done when customers are present.  Yet, if the tasks are not complete you will be held accountable.  Pretty much a no-win situation most days.  Unless you are in a high volume store with lots of employees to complete the tasks, then it is pretty easy."
good,Easy job which requires little to no experience to start. Good for part time work with flexible hours. The work isn't demanding or stressful so it's doable at any skill level or experience. Commission sales on technology also apply to whoever sells them so it's a way any associate can get extra pay for their work.
good,"I enjoyed working with the associates when I worked there, love the customer service we could offer, the manager was great, but it on paid minimum wages and hard to pay Bill's, have get another part time job."
good,A great experience I learned a lot of new and interesting things about office supplies the different types of names for pens paper things like that. I got to meet some really cool people who also taught me a lot in dealing with merchandise I haven't dealt with before.
good,It was a good job and I gained tons of skills and experiences but the management could not understand my family and child cane first above all and did not accept the fact I was I’m the emergency for them.
good,"Family oriented"
good,I enjoyed working here. The pay wasn't incredibly low and my hours really stacked it up. Steady and even paced so the time goes by nicely and a variety of friendly to help train me along way.
good,"This company has changed significantly since I worked there. I was hired by Boise Paper, which was acquired by OMX. Now I believe OMX has been acquired by Office Depot. I was in Business to Business Sales. It was a good teaching tool, as there were many training opportunities within the organization and excellent mentors! I liked the ongoing learning opportunities it provided, and helped me sharpen my skills!"
good,"The management came and go, so you never knew who you worked for. They passed you over on promotion s and pay raises. Never gave recognized you on a job well done."
good,"Bad customer service is built in, good coworkers in my area, decent furniture department, should not try to fix computers with current setup, a customer got hung up on in our store because of language barriers."
good,Overall they hire to suit going back to school then you barely get hours. Then managers get you for minor infractions to satisfy budget then they start the process over next year
good,"Office Depot was my first job. It’s perfect for a high school student because of child labor laws you can’t work past 8 so I’d only work 4 hours a day which was perfect for that type of schedule. The overall job was extremely boring tho , I always had to find something to do. The busiest season is back to school , we’d go some days with maybe 80 customers that day. It’s really relaxed and if you have good/fun co-workers the job can be fun because of them and all the downtime you’ll have. You learn about customer service which is really big to this company and get some knowledge on technology and printing services. The pay is decent for someone with no responsibilities. Managers are the only ones that get full time hours as well."
good,working for office depot isnt terrible. its very manager based when it comes to quality of life for the average worker. The corperate office makes horrible decisions for pushing product and that is clearly reflected each quarter.
good,our customer service group was very successful in our district and all our customers were happy with our group we were making sure to give 100% customer care to our customers
good,"A typical day of work typically follows minor influxes of customers requesting print jobs or getting office supplies throughout the day, with a closing team of 4 to 5 taking care of the whole store. Back to school season is an afternoon swarming with parents, teachers, and students alike all requesting the same 6 items that have come and gone in the last few hours. At all other points of the year, Office Depot is an alright job with odd hours but back to school is when your hours start to get silly and you realize why they were hiring for the summer."
good,"Office Depot is pushing for a services more so than sales, which has conflicting agendas that confuse their employees and management.  Since no one seems to know what to focus on tasking seems haphazard and random because no one seems to know what is most important.  We either focus on sales or subscriptions, but the way it is structured, doing both becomes difficult.  With the lack of hours, pay, and overall trust in upper management people seem to be jumping ship while they still can."
good,"Nunca sales a Tun hora, es muy difícil ascender y el salió no es bueno"
good,"I just worked as a stocker who helped on the floor for sales.  Honestly, it's an entry level job perfect for high school students.  It seemed as though the management was always being pushed to be the best in the district, and they passed that stress on to us.  The store I worked at has since failed and gone under."
good,Officemax was a great part time job.  They gave me a flexable schedule so I could go to school.  The best part of the job was the flexable hours. The management was great.
good,The work life balance was very hard.  The best part was learning new ways different companies execute their procedures.  I can say the best part was learning many different programs in a very short time.
good,"Buenas prestaciones y buen trato al personal. "
good,"Great workplace for work/life balance if you have the right manager."
good,Greeting customers as they come in the store with a smile and a welcome.  Assisting customers with concerns and questions about products and merchandise.  Checking customers out when purchasing a product.
good,"Easy job, if you like helping people, good for high schoolers/ people who are very patient and want to move up with one company.  Overall an average experience."
good,I worked at OfficeMax before they merged with office depot.  I dont know anything about how this company operates.  and I have to get a few more characters.
good,"Work is steady to busy. Learned a lot about the printing,and office business and computer repair. Like the work environment and other employees. Have met very nice customers and made good friends."
good,"enjoyed working here, fun atmosphere, and nice colleges to work with on a daily basis to accomplish goals/tasks, would highly recommend, managment wasnt helfull but your colleges are very team bases and will assist with an issues or problems you face."
good,help customers with their purchases help solve computers issues sell computers run front end and run the register do opening and closing procedures.Culture is ok.
good,"Travail physique et pénible"
good,"The local company management is passable."
good,"While I've enjoyed working at this company and the people I get to interact with, the job expectations placed on me were beyond the job description. Also was not being paid a fair wage based on what was expected of me."
good,A business thats on the verge of collapse. Having to sell anti-virus to customers who were getting a pencil was the craziest part of it all. Its just like any other retail job though.
good,"My daily routine would be to stand at the cashier and wait for people (it was usually dead). I would also work in the copy and print department which consisted of faxing, copying, and emailing paperwork."
good,"The company has made smart strategic steps towards the position of being a tech, office supplies and print option. The offerings are useful and sort of a hybrid of concepts that if located in the correct place, can be super useful to small/medium businesses. "
good,centre de reclassement pas compétant à part pour faire les formations
good,"Overall, this was a good company to work for. It will definetly prepare you to achieve greater things in the future. Salary is not so competitive, but it can be."
good,"The job comes with all of the issues pertaining to retail sales and customer service. Although management tells you that you run your own department, the reality is that customers really run the show. Independence of job performance is suspect."
good,not a great place to grow limited hours not very active due to not having that much sales and kool dance with the wintering of the active love the free v
good,Easy place to work. Always changing policies so it was hard to keep up with requirements. Management would not reward or acknowledge good working behavior or great performance. Attitude was you lucky to have a job.
good,"You learn a lot of things every day which was interesting, but a lot of the job for me was also stocking which didn't really have any growth. I did become an assertive person by listening to my manager which is a great skill to have but still wasn't that enjoyable."
good,"For a retail job, it is what it is. My co-workers were friendly for the most part and the job wasn't too bad. The one thing I can never understand is why retail companies like this think that employees can actually make it on $9.00 an hour. That might have been big money back in 1992, but today that can't even pay for a room-to-rent."
good,"very fast paced, lifting semi-heavy products, handling shipments, picking right products. Relaxed environment, pretty fun place to work. Safety meetings and monthly company lunches."
good,"My experience at Office Depot was neither good nor bad. The tasks I was asked to perform were very basic. I would normally walk in and restock the items that were purchased the day before, when I finished I would take on the cashier role."
good,Average place to work to get the knowledge you need to know. Computer sales great way to make customers. All team members are friendly and not out to get you.
good,"If you enjoy customer service then this is a good job for you. You meet a lot of different people, answer a lot of different questions, and help find the correct products to make people's life easier. It can be a little rough standing up all day but there is work that is too strenuous."
good,The job was relaxed not to stressful u had daily task to perform every day as well to greet customers and assist them. Didn’t really have opportunity to get promoted u had to wait til someone leaves or get fired
good,I work constantly where it is hard to get a break and not even at a decent time. I usually don't get off when I am scheduled to get off unless I force it. Corporate are hypocrites and Managers don't do what they say they will
good,Medium level of management attitude. Average customer service. Employee promotions not common. . The customers are awesome and appreciate the help given in any department. Most managers appreciate the employees loyal and hard work
good,"I worked in the copy and print department. I learned how to design programs, bind documents, blow up images, print brochures and so much more. Management was ok. The hardest part of my job would be when we were short staffed."
good,When there is a lot of work people tend to run away from the work. The managers have favoritisms towards certain people and they don’t make them work.
good,Challenging with not enough payroll for amount of tasks. Good pay overall but lots of hours in and out of store to stay up with demands of the customers and company.
good,"My first job outside of working for my dad. Pay wasn't great and I didn't really care for the customer service, but it was a good starter job nonetheless."
good,"Constantly busy, either stocking the ink room, reposting pricing tags, helping someone in the print department- which was probably the busiest area of the store"
good,"Managed Accounts in public sector"
good,Work was very fast-paced and on occasion pretty hectic. Working in the print department was extremely challenging in a rewarding way and I learned quite a bit in my time working there.
good,"it stays constantly busy.  which is a good thing.  It gives job security but can also be a bd thing because some people can not handle that and quit.   You are constantly learning new things ( about the products, procedures, policies, etc"
good,"Decent pay.  Decent work/life balance.  Everyday is different to an extent, you don't get too stagnant.  Meeting new guests to help was cool.  Being on your feet a lot allows for decent exercise, rather than sitting at a desk."
good,I worked in the copy center and where I completed printing and drafts as well as helped customers with any printing needs. At the end my supervisor kept changing so direction was lost.
good,I had a contract that I was hoping would be renewed.  The job had a lot of pressures being a small Canadian office trying to keep up in the industry.  Everyone was nice though and we enjoyed working together.
good,"Structured floor space, ample room to shop with plenty of information from staff or displays to aid in the buying decision. Supplies from pencils to office furniture."
good,Worked with some great people and enjoyed the day to day. Company as a whole has seen better days. MErger of OfficeMax and Office Depot could have been smoother.
good,The work enviornment at office depot is fun and creative. Sales reps get great interaction with customer. There is always something to do or to add on to in this fun team enviornment.
good,"fun revolving staff. the requirement for up-selling got old, but it is molded into you daily activities well. you will stand all day, but the stores are busy enough to not really notice much."
good,This company has since merged and relocated and probably has a completely different work culture than what I experienced while I was an employee so I can't comment.
good,The work day was relaxed most of the time. You just have to keep yourself busy or preoccupied for the most part. I believe this would be a great job if you were looking for a second job or an early morning shift.
good,Took escalated calls from internal and external for items that did or did not deliver. contacted warehouse and carriers to locate and confirm deliveries.
good,"I would check deliveries. I made ,sure every knew what to do for the "
good,"A typical day at OfficeDepot was waiting for customers to come to the store. If you weren't part of the Copy and Print, you had to stand by the door being a greeter. It was expected that you wait for customers to come in and ask them if they needed help. Honestly, I always hoped they did. It made the day go by quicker."
good,They were OK but not my favorite environment to work in.  I was not fond of the retail store environment.  Weekends were busy but during the week it was very slow and boring and time just dragged.
good,I would recommend this as a first job. It's pay is low and not many hours are available to employees. You probably won't be able to live off this job for very long.
good,"nothing to write home about but, it was ok when I was there. Management was ok. It was a part time job nothing crazy ever happened other that some very strange customer interactions."
good,"I worked for the Business Services Division, helping our three different branches deliver Office Products to businesses. I enjoyed collaborating with team leaders to gather information to keep track of our drivers productivity."
good,I worked a variety of shifts and positions. Most of the time it was a fairly enjoyable job. I did not like the pressure to sell as selling was not my strength.
good,Great place to work and a great team of people to help support your activities and growth.  Work activities vary and provide challenges and opportunties for growth
good,Reviewed paperwork mailed from stores assigned. Calculate data tape to ensure end of day and week's end register tapes added correctly. Compared excel
good,Easy work place as long as you participate in your work. Managers are very understanding of situations. Very willing to work around your schedule. Atmosphere is based on you and others around you.
good,It's a decent place to work for. They also work by your schedule and benefits are there. They do not offer benefits to part time employers but they get paid time off and sick pay.
good,"Cómo trabajo está bien, aprendes a relacionarte y tratar bien a la gente tanto interno como externo, te dejan aprender de otras áreas, pero en mi caso el ambiente laboral era muy pesado en relación empreado-gerencia. El gerente tiene mucho favoritismo y un carácter muy pesado que incluso todos los empleados sin excepción de quejan. Mal uso del recurso humano pues en mis escasos 7 meses se contrataron a 11 personas nuevas, mismas que se fueron."
good,"A typical day of work as a manager consists of shepherding the lazy into a typical work day, Times are tough as management and the folks management answer to, want answers. We do our best."
good,Being a sales associate at Office Depot was very chill. This is a place to go if you're a student that needs to focus more on school because this job does not require too much effort and hours.
good,office depot was good place to work it just hot doing the summer and sometime cold doing the weather but i leave office depot 2012 but give bonus point to buy the out the store and and the bonus was good
good,Was a good company to work for and loved working there. When it came to realistic numbers and what regular people and businesses were buying was out of the realm of possibility.
good,"steady flow of customers, certain times heavy flow"
good,el trabajo es bueno pero falta capacitacion y mejoria en los sueldos
good,"Staying busy in the goal, there is always so much to do the time passes by fast. More than just customer service and selling so it could be fun at times."
good,"The focus is always the same. The customer is the base of everything we do, from stocking shelves to customer engagement.  As a team we played trivia games about the products to further our knowledge while making the work fun and enjoyable for the associates and the customers."
good,"Not enough working hours to meet financial needs. Even though I was hired as a full time position it was never the hours of a full time position.Also, interviewed for a specific position but was given a different job other than what I interviewed for."
good,Your job satisfaction has to do with your manager.  Period.  Get a good one and you will love going to work.  Get a jerk and you will hate every day you are scheduled.
good,A typical day at my workplace was energetic and fast paced. Stocking was my main responsibility. At this job I learned how to work well others. The manager was a great person and always was fair with everyone which made It easy to work with him.
good,The store that I worked in had very low customer turnout and that created an atmosphere that made the work hours seem long. I did like the job as a summer job between years in high school.
good,"Opening procedures and or closing. Take customer orders for the impress department in prints or copies sometimes binding or laminating work. I learned how to use office machines like copiers, laminators, large format printing equipment. Mostly a team oriented envirnment. The hardest part of the job was working with disagreable customers suring the busiest seasons."
good,"It was an okay first job, the environment was good but the hours they had you working weren't the best especially if you were supposed to be part-time."
good,It is a good place to start careers if you not want to flip burgers.Very useful if you are into tech and want to keep current with it. Good chance to try other areas of interest around the store.
good,"during my tenure, the FCC chose to say no to a merger between OD and Staples, being out the the business, and not needing anything from these companies on an ongoing basis, I can't really speak to the culture."
good,You get commission for selling their protective plans for the equipment.  Other than that is a job and you need to be able to lift a moderate amount in the event you are stocking product or carrying out product for customers.
good,There are always payroll cuts. 70% of the year you're only at 35 hours. They don't give enough working hours for the workload. You're left rushing and stressed.
good,"Maintained inventory by merchandise to determine inventory levels, anticipating customer demand.                                                                                        "
good,It is an easy job to pick up since it is retail it does sometimes very on what shift hours you work or for how long you work. It is a good experience for anyone  though to learn retail.
good,"They seem to not want to hire good management which makes everyone suffer. Very low pay and very little encouragement. I enjoyed the job, but it was not a great work atmosphere."
good,"The job at the store level was great, but there was a lack of direction and leadership from above.  Decisions were made without the knowledge of the people they would effect.  They would tell you to cover another store for a week, when they had already decided to make it permanent.  This happened to several ASM's while I was there."
good,"The job was fun and worked with me on hours as well as had nice benefits but the pay was terrible and the job advancement is "
good,"Perform an array of functions that may include receiving and processing incoming stock and materials, picking and filling orders from stock, packing and shipping orders, or managing, organizing and retrieving stock in the warehouse"
good,Office depot was ok.. Ultimately i left because i had to relocate. I mainly did logistics and helped customers if i had to. Laid back if you do your job.
good,"the people there were so amazing and kind, they loved making me feel comfortable and welcome! The only problem was it was to far from my home to travel to and from, the pay was not enough."
good,I was mostly at the register. organized my area and learned to work under pressure. did not really like the fact that I was the only cashier when it got busy. management was nice enough.
good,"Buena empresa pero mal ambiente de trabajo. Los compañeros ayudaban raramente, exceptuando a los auténticos profesionales que me encontré."
good,With the changing industry Office Depot did not react well and put themselves in a role of playing catch up to their competitors which led to a uncertain work environment.
good,I enjoyed my time working with my co workers. The management always wanted us to up sale even when customers didnt want the extended warranty. I dont like trying to make some one but something they dont want
good,"worked during college, enjoyed learning new areas like copy and print while also just being a cashier, management was easy to get a long with at the time."
good,"Gained good understanding of inventory upkeep, receiving and stocking procedures and performed monthly cycle-counts of goods. Was responsible for collecting special orders, vendor purchase orders and customer returns and generated replenishment tasks"
good,"i love office depot i love office depot, best place i could work at when i was in high school laid back, made sure the customers came out happy and satisfied"
good,this was a very challenging job during the holiday months but for the most part it was eventful and always buzzing with differnt people and i loved leraning about the new products and gainign more knowledge
good,"It was good, part time very flexible with hours. average 4-6 hours a day 20 hours/ week. really fun with the people I worked with, management was okay. I normally worked closing, closing managers were cool, morning ones were okay sometimes they can be very in your face at times."
good,"•	I was hired by Office Depot to work as a Retail Sales Consultant. I was responsible for engaging our customers and providing excellent customer service. As a Sales Consultant, I was expected to use our company’s sales strategy to not only sell our products to the best of my abilities but to help customers find the right products for them. Working at Office Depot I have learned the proper way to upsell products as well as suggest related products to interested customers. Getting to know the needs of the customers coming in and managing to find the perfect product for them was the most rewarding part of the job. Of course, selling products was not my only responsibility, I was expected to help in any department that needed extra manpower. Working the cash registers, working in the Printing section, cleaning, reorganizing, and welcoming each customer as they walked through the door. It was nice, slow pace, everybody helped everybody else."
good,"Great organisation to work for , they went through a lot of restructuring during my time at the company . They have a good reputation within the their field look after their staff"
good,"When i was hired my position as Logistics Associate was rather bland, and not defined. I was more or less doing every other positions task including my own. After the merger it felt like my already stressful spot was handed twice as much work for even less benefits"
good,"Very good environment, and a fun place to work, I have work with this company for the past 34 years...While they are not around anymore I had great peasure growing with this company."
good,"Okay, to be honest? I loved being in the department I was in. It was fun to help others, and help them create their vision of what their business should look like with graphic design. Most, if not all, of my clients were very pleased with my abilities and my assistance, leaving them very happy with Office Depot as a company."
good,"Ideal para emprender tus primeros pasos en el mundo laboral, siempre hay una oportunidad para los jóvenes de sobre salir."
good,Helaas gaat het  bedrijf verhuizen naar Duitsland en komt er een eind aan de leveringen via Nederland.
good,"it was fun, lots of friendships made, but very slow work days, hardly any customers. but very fun for first job because you get to know the basics of a actual job."
good,I don't really know about now as it has been years since I worked for this company. I know when I was there I really enjoyed my job and people I worked with.
good,started out with the company when they first opened. meet alot of good friends there and really enjoyed my time there. would work there again if they still existed.
good,Running the operations of the store gave me experience with hiring and interviewing process.  Working retail management meant long hours but also a chance to work along side great employees.
good,Good place to start a career.  Lots of new things to learn.  Opportunity to advance quickly but not beyond a certain level. Nice people. Fourteen more
good,"I've worked at two different locations in different states, both of which underwent management changes (poor management to good leaders). Good leadership makes a big difference. There are pros and cons to every job. A healthy dose of retail experience is good for anyone who ever goes shopping for anything! The one downside for this company, which is the reason I am looking for other work, is the inconsistency in scheduling. When I first started with the company the store manager set the schedule and mine was the same every week. Now there's a corporate level computer system that does the work for the store manager and, let's face it, computers are useful tools but they lack the human touch! Now my schedule is different every week, and since I thrive on structure and consistency, I am looking elsewhere for it."
good,"good company, good management, joseph bares was the best manager I have ever been involved with, cannot complain about this company, except maybe they should pay more"
good,"Office Depot changes their business model almost every six months. While this seems innovative, it's far from. This leads to roles and positions disappearing and store scoring never being a steady goal. In the last six months the company has pivoted to a services based company with the sales goals doubling every month without results detailing the need for the increase. Retaining employees for services selling is difficult when only paid slightly above minimum wage, when other services companies pay $5 more than minimum."
good,It is a very good company to workfor. Benefits better than at most other companies. Pay is well. Warehouse is fully equipped with all necessary equipment.
good,Deberian capacitar mas a su personal de gerrencia jefes de piso ya que estando en esos puestos queiren gobernar a los empleados
good,Just they need to learn to stick to there goals and just treat the customers the way they want to be treated I had a good time with working with a lot close friends along the way
good,"I did not work at Office Depot very long, and I did not work there with the intention of it becoming a career, so I do not remember much about it. I do remember tuition reimbursement was available if you wished to apply your knowledge to advance your career at Office Depot."
good,"My manager worked around my class schedule. I worked part time, but always had a decent amount of hours to work every week. I was able to learn how to do multiple different jobs in the store: stocking, cashier, and copy and print."
good,"Retail is just that, its an up and down job. Great company for a starter job and if you can climb the ladder than do it, if not seek something that is a better fit for you."
good,"Its a great intro to retail job. You can learn a lot, I recommend young adults to apply, Because it will give you a since of urgency. You will learn a lot from this place."
good,"The job I worked is alright, you will experience many angry customers. I learned to help satisfy unhappy customers and about sales. Management is okay but at my location they can be very two-faced. Many of the other employees are very nice and help new employees. The culture is are great. Hardest part of the job would be selling tech services. Only enjoyable part of the job is getting sign ups"
good,"The management is pretty good here and you can get decent hours too. But, like most retail jobs the pay just isn't good enough for it to be a livable wage."
good,"I can't say for certain how another's experience at office depot/ office max will go.  Mine which is ongoing (as of this posting), has been very positive.  This primarily will come from how your manager treats the staff.  My current manager is fantastic, but I've heard from others that their managers are not so good.  If you are part of the team you are NOT expected to sell the kitchen sink, but goals are set.  However, if you are consistently complained about, behind in numbers, and have been overall problematic you will be let go.  In other words: if you are an average joe/jane you'll fit in fine.  My only big complaint comes from ever-changing corporate ideology and pay.  Practices, goals, what to sell, etc. will constantly keep changing due to Office Depot/Office Max's current financial condition (not the best right now).  The pay isn't great I'm making sub $10 while across the street I could make more with further progression up the corporate ladder."
good,"this job got my foot into the door for retail and printing services which then got me a job with my current employer, has some openings for advancement but to me was more of who can i keep employed the longest"
good,"I have been working at Office Depot full-time (Less than a year)"
good,"I worked at Office Depot about 5 years ago and it was what you would expect from a job in the retail.  As a whole the workplace culture was relaxed, the managers were ok,"
good,Great Company to work for management was excellent. took very good care employees. raises were very good. hardest part is when the conveyer belt breaks down and it slows down the order and the days longer
good,"Honestly, I don't remember this job all that well cause it's been forever. I think it was fine though I don't recall it being an unpleasant experience. I really like office supplies so I found it interesting to work there."
good,Customers were rude in copy and print department. Employees were easy to work with. Hours weren't very flexible. I had to commute 45 minutes because I couldn't get transferred to the location in my town which was 3 miles away.
good,"Great experience working on contract for Nalco Chemical Company.  "
good,"I feel like it was only a temporary thing but when you get sick and are in then hospital, management wants you to quit. it was not fair. not enough hours"
good,The managers do not care about the employees.  The place is very gossipy and cliquey.  It is very hard to advance here and the pay is not good. It is hard to ask for days off.
good,"There is very poor management at office depot,  benefits are great health insurance is amazing but the hours are not very family friendly especially for single parents. It's an easy job but very stressful"
good,Was a great place to work don’t know how it really is now that it’s merged with Office Max but was a great way to learn the city of Charlotte and the in and outs of the city
good,"Office Depot was a great stepping stone. High paced, fun, delivery job.  Attention to detail, route planning, loading and delivering were all a part of a typical day."
good,"I was copy max manager for less than 2 years. The company was in a period of reorganization.  I managed 4 inside associates, an outside account representative, and a delivery driver"
good,"As a print specialist, it was hard everyday. Everything was very quick paced, and no one was helping your section, it was just you alone, but you were expected to go and help other sections. Felt very underappreciated for all the efforts I put in. The people were great to work with but in terms of working, they were not the best. Customers expect so much and I was compensated so little."
good,Store closed years ago. No valid review applicable. wasting characters because typign a review on a closed business is beyond pointless. Closed business.
good,"From my experience with this company, it seems to have gone from being a place where you can grow with the company to being nothing more than a stepping stone for those graduating high school and getting through college to advance in more prosperous careers. "
good,Office Depot itself was very cut dry but what made the job fun were the customers who came in with different projects they needed to have done. That was the best part.
good,A typical day at work in the copy and print center was fairly busy. Customers constantly came in and gave us projects and other jobs to do now or in the future. In my experience the people working with me were all very helpful and wanted me to succeed and better myself.  The hardest part of this job would be the occasionally heavy workload. At times there would be an excessive amount of jobs and customers at the same time but it was very easy to manage with practice. I believe this company was very good and informative for me.
good,Worked long hours in an Uncontrolled Air Conditioned environment. Required to stay past your shift as long as needed to complete work load. No set period for raises.
good,it can be really hot or it can be really cold in the building. The amount of work in the system is unpredictable so there might be really busy days and really slow days.
good,"This is now Office Depot/Office Max, was a typical retail job, don't work in print services you are not paid enough for the services you provide and the level of knowledge needed."
good,"Workplace is tense environment; so many layoffs, employees afraid of being next to let go!"
good,Large company that is struggling to grow sales and profits while changing from retail stores only to a greater emphasis on B2B sales of office products and the introduction of facility and Breakroom supplies.
good,"Good job. Helped customers with any electronic questions. Computers, TV's, Cameras. Kept the showroom clean and up to date with current products and advertisement"
good,"This is a pretty laid back place to work, and they worked with me as far as my schedule goes. I only had problems towards the end of me leaving when I became pregnant with my daughter. My manager wasn’t very understanding and became very rude , I became ill and was taken out of work by my doctor. Other than that, working there was fine up until that point."
good,Office Depot is a good retail company. Office Depot does have incentives for performance. It is a company that if you stick it out and have to be willing to move you can move up in the company.
good,"This was my first job, It was not too hard to do. Helped customers on the floor most of the time.  Learned about computers and digital cameras while working there. The hours of operation were not too bad unless i had school in the morning."
good,"Co-workers are nice and kind but the Boss's are close minded, they don't welcome new ideas so we fall into basic and not in a competitive way but still we do our best as Graphic Designers to create a good product."
good,"Not applicable, treated unfairly.  No breaks, forced to work on short notice is other employees didn't show up for work,  Favoritism for other employees"
good,I worked at office Depot between part time and full time. Office Depot is no longer in Canada. People were nice to work with. I learned alot at Office Depot.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, aprendi mucho de varias areas de la empresa, todavia pueden mejorar en el control de personal y organizacion"
good,I do like working at office depot. I just wish they had other areas where one could grow within the company and just be limited to the same title for years and years.
good,"Most all the employees were fun and helpful.  There was a nice big clean lunch room and if needed a quit dark room for breaks as well."
good,"It's fairly easy job. Customer service is always stressful, but the management was fine and the coworkers were always nice. It's just a regular retail job. Not a lot of expectations."
good,Rough to do your job when you have to do someone elses job. Need more training to complete tasks assigned or given freedom to use your personal knowledge.
good,"It's not a completely terrible job. I enjoy it for the most part, though there is definitely some foundational issues with the company itself. A lot of the way things are run is kind of odd and what they company may think is motivating for employees is really not. We are told to basically force people to sign up for our rewards program which I think its rude. The biggest thing I learned is how to deal with customers."
good,"They don't pay you enough here for the amount of work you have to do. Don't do it. It's a bad idea. This should be your last resort. Trust me, the only ones that might get away with working here are people who still live with their parents."
good,Was a great work place that didn't micromanage employees but was very disppointed when company decided to move my position over seas just so company could get a tax deduction & not care about the employees who had been their many years taking care of their customers.
good,J'ai choisi cette société qui me proposait un fonctionnement en home office et cela correspondait parfaitement bien à mon organisation.
good,Great job for college students. Just need more pay. The managers I had were very chill so it made work easy and frustrating at times. Overall though the job is fun and simple.
good,it was a nice job for people coming right out of school and wanting to start working. The help with scheduling certain hours. There are nice ppl. Overrall ok experience
good,"If Office Depot does not decide to advance you, you will get pushed out. The problem is, the responsibilities added when promoted are not well compensated. Therefore, it's best to stay put until they make you leave."
good,"For the most part, it was a decent job. Although, the main issue I experienced was the poor management. Things could have been much more organized, they also did not want to train you on electronics, but wanted you to sell them."
good,"If you are competitive and driven, there are many opportunities to earn extra cash on your paycheck. Dress is semi-flexible and it's mostly a relaxed environment, dependent on the manager on duty."
good,I think over all office max is good place to work and learn different types of jobs. But it can be a very stressful place as well. You need to learn how to coupe with a verity of situations.
good,"Office Depot is not the best place to work although not bad. I only took employment here because my family and I moved to another area of town. I love to meet new people and I'm friendly so customer service/working with the public is not a problem. The store manager is not the best because of improper priorities and does not know how to balance work/life with the employees. I like that one is challenged in sales and meeting goals. Retail is demanding, but you have to have your own priorities and not someone else for you. But Office Depot offers many multi services and is a good business to do business or convenient services/shop."
good,Overall it wasnt a bad place to work. The upper management was out of touch with the stores and the store's needs. They dont get the products to the stores in a timley manaer
good,"I worked at Office Depot while I was in college. I made enough money to cover the expenses I had while splitting rent with three roommates, but I did not have to pay all my bills. While the job is fine, it is not a good solution for supporting yourself when you have to pay everything yourself."
good,"Really enjoyed working at OfficeMax before they merged with Depot, really enjoyed my co workers, get the impression over the last few years that upper mgmt have a "" Manage by spreadsheet, motivate by fear"" mentality."
good,The pay was weak and management would constantly be on you about not selling enough protection plans. it just seemed that no matter how many services you sold it wasnt enough.
good,"I've been with Office Depot for going on 13yrs.  I've worked my way into a great shift.  However, I feel that, no matter how much I ""do"" it's never enough."
good,I worked here while I was in college and found it to be an ok place to work. I had good teammates that made the job easier and socializing was possible while working. The environment was comfortable and challenging enough to keep you busy.
good,Was a very nice place to work. They support getting education. Was a very nice place to work and good discounts. They were always willing to help and put the customers first.
good,"Fine retail job. Great for building skills, in technology. Technology companies provide lots of online courses to learn their products that are sold at Office Depot, and be able to earn prizes for it."
good,"i enjoyed working for this company the customer and staff were friendly. Just the managers need to be more responsible and friendly to there workers and be so favoritism to certain staff members, I've learned a lot from this company how to answer phones, to greet customers ,how to use a register how to handle cash and how to balance to tills."
good,"Good people, at times a good place to work."
good,The customers were a little bit stressful to deal with but the management team was always there to help us out if we had questions. The veteran staff was also very helpful.
good,Friendly environment to work at. Time flew by while working there. Met a lot of good co-workers. Loved the management there. Busy from start to finish. Learned a lot about technology.
good,"My position eliminated after re structure."
good,"I oversee sales on the training of associates I also take care of the date to date operations money, customer complaints, solving problems with the store or customers"
good,buena empresa algo pesado el trabajo pero bien. el personal de ahí son buenos
good,"OfficeMax was new to the area at the time I started working there . "
good,The Center Manager wasn't able to personal issue from the work place. Projecting his feelings on to the Customer. Also wasnt responsive to works time and how much they wanted to work.
good,when I was there I met a lot of great coworkers and learned a lot from the people I worked with but other than that its a good place while in school..
good,"This job is perfect for building your customer service skills. As long as you have some knowledge about certain products like computers, or printers; i.e. brand names and quality."
good,It was okay while working here. The pay was not great but it was doable. No benefits and they do work with you on your schedule. The environment was welcoming. The customer service could be annoying at times but you will get that at most jobs where you have to come in contact with customers.
good,"job mostly consists of stocking shelves and helping guests find what they need and to sell them more stuff, butbthe management team was fun and good at motivating the teem"
good,"typical day is ok"
good,Crazy amount of multitasking in the print center. The management would never help out. Never understanding of how much work it is to be behind the counter helping the customers.
good,"Great place to work, good benefits. Work/Life Balance is good, management understands that family is first. Company offer salary employees the option to work from home a couple of days."
good,"always busy the minute you clock in"
good,"Selling office products can become monotonous sometimes!  The training team was very equipped however and did allow us to find the best fit when we got out of ""boot camp"""
good,"One had the ability to set one's schedule, innovate and work on your own. Over time it became more and more restrictive to use individual idea's. Business model was slow to change."
good,While employed there one could hot be sure as to who the supervisor was. You know that a certain person was your supervisor but anyone that was a salaried employee took it upon themselves to be the supervisor and your supposed supervisor would not say a word or back you up on anything.
good,typical cashier/retail customer service job. Not much room for growth at the time I was employed. Management could’ve used some improvement but overall an ok place to work
good,The associates and management are very understanding good people But the customers make this retail job living heck. Although my experiences are likely because of store location the majority of the people who shop at OfficeMax are Grown Adults with professional jobs who act like children and with the recent closing of stores around the Houston area and lack of associates on the floor it’s only created a stressful environment full of god awful customers who are always trying to steal items or finesse the location out of money. Almost every customer who walks through the door is already angry and ready to call the manager over something very petty. Asides from the customers the jobs is usually very laid back including attendance for students. You learn a lot about retail and people in your community. I would recommend if you have never worked retail before.
good,everyday varied on how difficult it could be we worked really varied hours management was a joke and there was no balance between your life and work and most of the polices where a twisted in my opinion
good,Try to finish all the work you can possible and accurately for the day then ship it out on time so the customers can receive it on time. I learned how to use their system and print out any kind of posters.
good,Working at a office supply retail store is something very different you have customers  who can be very difficult or at time the management can be very difficult.
good,Solo le falta un poco de autoridad en ciertos casos pero tiene buen prospecto
good,"Difficult work life balance as you work a lot of nights, weekends, and holidays. Pay did not make up for this. There was room for advancement, but not often."
good,"Perform in warehouse as an associate to receive and begin scan a license ticket by carefully cut around each box package and place into it's area location. Responsible to drive a commercial vehicle truck to deliver packages on time expectation to customers: office companies, schools, medical hospitals, residential areas, and other companies."
good,"A typical day at work includes making sure that we take care of customers such as getting them what they need, making recommendations on what they would like. A typical day also includes getting products out on the sales floor and making sure that they are organized. Products that do not fit on the sales floor are to be scanned in properly."
good,"Open store.  Had money ready for registers.  Have morning huddles.  Make sure customers were taken care of.  Scheduling.  Profit and Loss.  Monthly meetings with staff. Inventory being done daily,"
good,"not enough training provided for tech associates, low pay, difficult company to relocate through, promises and contracts for tranfers filled out then disregarded at will at end location"
good,"job was relaxed and easy , not enough hours or pay for an adult ,great job for a collage student or high school kid , overall a good place for a first job"
good,I enjoyed my time and learned the process 0f sales as well as computer basics. Great work environment but not much room to move up and actually make a living.
good,Direct Energy was a good company to work for. That is the gist of my employment. Not much more need to be said. Pay was decent housr were fine. The job ended for all contract workers and moved inhouse.
good,"I worked at Office Depot, when it was just that Office Depot. It was actually a pretty fun working environment. The stock persons and sales were mostly male and the cashiers and copy/print were mostly female, not that we did not have female managers, we did, but the majority of the staff was male, so it was like a boys' club. There was very little trouble between employees and managers."
good,its a chill job not that many hours the staff is nice and cool to work with well some the rest are like whatevers but it is still a cool and fun workplace
good,"Great place to work, learned a lot. If our store wouldn't have closed i might still be working there. Made great friends at that location. Everyone was like a little family."
good,"El trabajo es un poco pesado, no hay horario fijo de salida, no hay equidad en la repartición de tareas, hay preferencias de personal."
good,"A typical day at work will consist of stocking, organizing, or displaying merchandise, or trying to convince people to buy computers and printers they probably don't need."
good,Good team culture. Worked on the Administering Tableau Server as well as created dashboards related to Tableau Admin views. Flexible work hours and good pay.
good,"I did the stocking of merchandise early in the morning. was fast paced. at least 4-5 crates of merchandise to be separated, organized, and shelved onto store floor. As well as lifting heavy(up to 50lb) chairs 3 stories high on a ladder since there forklift was broken. I left cause my manager refused to supply me with proper safety lifting belts for moving chairs."
good,"Fue un trabajo donde me enseño como utilizar y sacar copias, y todo lo relacionado con la papelería, y ser saber como cobrar en caja"
good,Worked as cashier when it got busy. Organized shelves and checked stock when new inventory arrived. Assisted customers with any problems or just help with any questions.
good,It was an early morning shift.  work is fast paced and timed. must use a lot of physical energy. You will be tired and lose weight. Must be able to understand computers
good,Used to be a good company to work in but everything changed. Now there is no opportunity for progress and not pay rice but more responsibilities. Not recommend
good,Estube en el aere de piso brindando atencion a clinete conteo de la mercancia inventarios acomodo y apoyo con la tiende departamental
good,Working at Office Depot was very fast paced. I stocked shelves while also helping customers on the floor and at the cash register. I was able to work up to 30 hours a week as a part-time employee.
good,"Some good people to work with...company treated like a personal bank for upper management. In other words they work for the dollar instead of growing a culture, or a force that is dedicated and ready to give what is needed for success"
good,"Not enough staff causing rude customers, rude assistant manager that makes fun of you and talks down on you and others, poor pay, all other staff are great though, stressful environment, great head manager."
good,This was  contract to hire position. I felt this was a production job more than one that required talent. I made signs for in store products. I left for a better opportunity.
good,"mijn dag begon met alle cijfers door te nemen, mits ik geen afspraak had staan. "
good,"Great to set own schedule and manage your own business, but in the last few years had a very large portfolio of customers. Direct supervisors were outstanding. Daily responsibilities included selling and opening new accounts, as well as providing great service to existing accounts."
good,"Can't give a review that would be fair, due to the length of time since I worked there.  I didn't have any problem with Office Depot, but it was a stepping stone job."
good,It was a relaxed environment but the pay was terrible and raises never seem to come. the best part was the staff making every shift worth while. It was decent for a college student.
good,"At first it was a really fun, cooperative job that was honestly enjoyable. The management at my location were fun and easy-going, while still showing great sales for our region. But the company started to be really money hungry, and started to force higher sales and store signups, all while taking away incentives. Its not the same anymore, and its really sad because they are very ""customer focus"" and have forgotten about their employees. But other than that, they have competitive pay to a certain degree, are very flexible with hours, and management can be really kind depending on your store. Would I recommend it? If its your first job, of course. Its a great job to work if your in school or college. But if you have prior work experience, I would recommend finding somewhere else that will pay you more for less responsibility."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers with their copy and print needs. Customers trusted you to make their printing experience fast and efficient.
good,I like the time working in this place.  I grew up and I learned a lot in this job. I met many people. do many jobs and leave good relationships between my coworkers.
good,While working here I was promised one pay rate then after seeing my first pay check and finding out I was getting paid less than what I was promised was a huge issue for me other than that everything was ok.
good,New CEO has things going in the right direction. Stores have stopped being remodeled to these stupid new formats that didn't benefit the customer at all.
good,Was your typical floor sales job. Nothing too exciting but definitely could have been worse. Co-workers were nice along with the management staff. To me it was kind of nice because i know a little about the electronic side of Office Max prior to working there.
good,Es una empresa con muchos problemas en cuento a jefes inmediatos
good,Typical day at work was to be at the cash register and attend to customers. I learned to move around the store quickly and helping customers find what they need
good,I have worked at OfficeMax for 2 years. The management that had come through was some of the worst management. They do have flexible hours. But there is two people there that have been fired in there 90 day probationary period but have gotten more than 2 chances.
good,"Customers weren't generally bad, but when they were they were unbearable. The employees and managers are all very friendly and understanding. Pay wasn't fantastic."
good,"A typical day of work consist of greeting customer,restocking,cash handling,cleaning break-room/bathroom and making sales. There was no hard task to do on the job. Restocking can be a little aggravating but beside that cool environment to work."
good,"A typical day involved starting the day getting the store open by doing all logistics filling the shelves and getting the store ready for business. I spent my time planning out the day and setting tasks for the team and reading all prior day sales reports and starting each day with a quick huddle with the team to get them fired up for the day."
good,il y a une culture entreprise forte - Les employés sont attachés à leur société
good,was a good place to work  love helping the customers with new computers an copiers and finding the best price for them and picking out the things they needed to go with it
good,"Worked a part time IT salesman position. Great way to polish your knowledge of CPUs, Printer and other Electronic peripherals. It also gave you skills on working with Diverse customers and their needs."
good,"This was a great place to learn about new technology and learning how it worked. We only had a few times of the year when things would go crazy at work i.e.:back to school,Christmas time and tax time. The only downfall is that cases of paper get heavy after awhile."
good,nice fun place to work at times but its a office supply store not alot of heavy traffic so the job could be boring at times as well pay was low no benefits unless you were fulltime
good,"Job was ok very stressed management team, you always kept spinning your wheels here. Turnover was very high do to lack of pay and that made it hard for others."
good,"again, a long time since I worked here so Im sure things have changed in the past 27 years.  For example, office depot was our competitor.   I worked here when it was just Office Max.  I liked my job, it just paid minimum wage so had a lot of turn over, because people were always finding better paying jobs."
good,"I'm not sure why im being forced into a review of my job. At times its toxic to your mental health, some days nothing goes right, the customers are dicks, and you can barely accomplish anything. other days its a mushy balance and more gets done."
good,"Assist customers with orders that they processed, make sure that the associates on the floor have work available to them at all times. Working with the management team to improve processes."
good,"Office depot es una empresa seria es sus procesos y responsable con sus clientes internos como externos."
good,"The workplace area was fasted-paced with all work areas of the workplace. I learned to do this in a faster manner since that's how the workplace was like. The hardest part about the job was finishing your work because instead of putting everything out on the floor was a lot, we also had to help customers out which affected the time we had to putting everything away from the back of work."
good,"My view on Office Depot is a great place to work for someone that is attending school if your trying to pursue a career this would not be an opportunity, but it is a excellent place to seek customer service experience for you future career."
good,"Buena presentación, desempeño en las labores,llegar a tiempo en tu turno"
good,"Lack of advancement and underpaid for skillset. Working hours change every week not much of a family life because of working weekends, can make ok money off commission if you want to work for it"
good,Its good for a first job if you are trying to get your feet wet in the warehouse business. Other than that its a stressful job with very long hours and low pay.
good,"basic warehouse work as in shipping &receiving orders. packing/unpacking ,loading and unloading of products. Supervisors are laid back as long as you are on the ball and productive."
good,Although most of the people I worked with were wonderful the store manager at Office Max was incompetent and often times rude. This created a strained work environment.
good,Life is a mess here you do not want to work here. The time I worked there it is a mess and it is unorganized. Working here was not the best place that I have worked at.
good,"You will often hear that you need to cite your work from your professors and instructors. This means that you should indicate where the information that you're using came from. For example, when you want to use some words or phrases from some websites or books, you should let the readers know what kind of sources you used, who created the source, and when the source was created. Basically, you are giving credit to the authors of the source that you used in your paper."
good,"Company in Naperville was a great place to work, but the merger with Office Depot destroyed that when they relocate the corporate office to Boca Ratone, FL."
good,"You get to do art in photo shop and such, print things and make customers happy. Customer's are happy most of the time and you get good break and lunches tv in the break room."
good,I like my interactions with the customers for the most part but people expect a lot from retail stores and they can be rude and talk down to you if you don't tell them what they want to hear or give them a discount. Management is mostly friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is when you have to tell someone you are out of an item that they need right away.  The best part of the job is when you help someone find something they have been looking for and they leave as a happy customer.
good,Back breaking goals you have to reach. If you like back breaking work then this is the job for you. Giving you unrealistic goals you have to reach and its just impossible but thats just my experience!
good,Retail schedule that included working most weekends and holidays. Customers were typically small business owners that required close attention when making purchases.
good,"The manager I worked with got caught up in a lot of issues with the store, making it a tough work environment. Cared little about those that worked for him and more for himself. It was a shame to see the store spiral the way it did."
good,"At the time I was there, I was able to make positive changes that resulted in increased sales and overall business. Generally the staff was willing and eager to learn."
good,"The work day was very busy, sometimes so busy that I would have to work both the registers up front and the copy and print area at the same time.  I learned how to use Photoshop there.  "
good,A typical work day would be running sales floor and keeping team accountable for service sales. Management could have improvements with structure. Workplace culture can be fun depending on team health. Most difficult part of the job was supporting the store when there is lack of employees to cover other departments.
good,"This job is for folks working through college. Flexible schedule, but not a lot of room for advancement unless you want to run your own store. Definitely a ceiling."
good,"Clean store, good managers, never had a complaint working for this store. Be friendly to customers, ask if everything is OK, be product knowledgeable and everything will be OK"
good,"Not a bad job, not something I would do for my whole life. It was something I did to pass time in the summer and it was pretty alright. The store was slow with few customers."
good,Fast paced yet very productive work atmosphere.  Management allows supervisors to actually run their own departments.  Supervisors are awesome.  They are also very patient.
good,En general fue una etapa de mucho crecimiento profesional para mí donde adquirí un gran cartera de contactos.
good,"From working at Office Max it is a decent company, at the time they were going through a merger so there were a few things going on."
good,"Working at OfficeMax, most of the employees are good to work with and the pace is often relaxed."
good,"i am an employee at office depot and its ok and horrible at the same time...... the air conditioner is never on in the day time which is ridiculous, we are always short staff for something or whatever zone, managers dont know how to do their own jobs or handle customers, coworkers are rude and dont know how to smile or even use a security tag remover its a very unprofessional place of work and i dont get paid enough for the disaster office depot truly is.!"
good,its a great starter company for any entry level that is looking to start getting job experience. It has good benefits and if you work full time has more benefits than part time. flexible hours since it's retail.
good,"Attendance is a plus ,management was poor , great career opportunities, busy season prepare to work overtime every day. Nice pay but barely have time to spend with family"
good,"I like working at Office Depot. I have been there for over two years, and have learned about selling tech products. I've also learned how to work with customers and my coworkers which is a skill that I can use throughout my career. The pay is minimum wage and doesn't go up."
good,fun place to work. could advance to higher career. good management. easy going. can change schedule easily based on school. people were friendly and helpful.
good,Helping customers with finding the right products. Facing products and making the store look good. Checking out customers and helping with problems with returns.
good,The environment around Office Depot was relaxed in most cases but when there was a rush trust and believe there was a rush and things were extremely hectic.
good,"It was ok for a first job. You learn basic work place skills and move on. Most of the co-workers are nice. Management was ok at best. You didn't get a fixed schedule. "
good,"Mergers, Acquisitions, Takeovers...."
good,A typical day at work consists of sales and stocking. Not many opportunities for promotions. Management expects a lot from you. Not much growth in company.
good,The overall way in which this business is run is not conducive to having a pleasant working experience. Especially if one works in the copy and print department.... Our customers come in second to in store customers which means our production suffers greatly... Horrible set up
good,"The managers were incredibly nice, though stressed from the added workload from corporate. Store manager was willing to schedule around classes.Customers were ok, mostly friendly."
good,"I had a great experience working as an Administrative Assistant at Office Max.  I worked to create employee schedules, and submitted management reports to the Regional office."
good,Good for people with no to limited inside sales experience. Compensation is very low.  Paid vacation is good and front loaded at beginning of the year.
good,"I wish corporate would really ask what I thought."
good,"Customer service which is fun but job job requires a lot of tasking which we are not aloud to do during certain times of the day nor do we really ever have enough staff on hand to get things done in a timely manner to begin with."
good,ok job did copying for customers. Made projects. management could have been a little better. also the work times could have beeen better. overall friendly people and a ok place to work.
good,I worked here at office depot for 7 years and worked hard to meet my job goals and did everything i could to get the job done right. I got along well with the employees here too.
good,"I was a contractor, no comments .I worked there for one year and tere was ambiguity if the comapny would be absorbed by the competitor...great building and offices"
good,A typical day at work is pretty easy. I did what my boss told me to do that day and accomplish it on time and correctly. What I learned from my job is to work under pressure in an efficient manner as well as becoming more sociable at work and interacting with everyone. The management was nice and I always got along with them. The workplace culture was a good atmosphere everyone was kind. The hardest part of my job was the speed that the job had to get done but by the end of it I became used to it and eventually became second nature and easy to accomplish. The most enjoyable part of my job was having my own space to work and concentrate.
good,Was one of my first jobs I had it was not bad. Had a some good  management and some real bad one to. For someone that is just starting to work it is great. Walked away with time management skill to help in different carriers.
good,"worked as a Technology manager. started as part time and moved up quickly. it was a dog eat dog workplace. no one had your back. ""customer always right"" always sometone trying to break you down"
good,Learned a lot trough out the years but is a HIGH STRESS and HIGH DEMANDS from the Assistant and Store Managers kind of work space. Fun Group to work with.
good,"It was my first retail job ever since I got out from military. The job is busy and holiday season is always super hectic. I was immature at the time and I felt that managers are always nagging about me not taking breaks. Thinking about it now, it was interesting experience."
good,Very organized business. Built strong relationships with small business owners. Delivered to businesses. Relaxed work environment. Reasonable management team.
good,There really isn't much to say I liked my job but management was poor and my hours became less and less until I was only working one day a week so I had to find another job.
good,As a sales rep you have a lot of flexibility; however your success depends on your manager and some of the management is very weak.  It is very competitive landscape right now with Amazon's expanded capabilities.
good,Una empresa buena pero le falta cumplir muchas cosas que dicen ser así como ellos lo plantean
good,"Like most jobs a typical day was making sure the store was clean, organized and stocked. Throughout that year we would need to change up certain areas for seasonal reasons like Back to School, the Holiday Season and Planogram changes. Customers were always top priority and we were expected to make sure everyone was greeted and ask if they needed help even if they had been asked several times already. Overall most of us were busy doing our tasks we were assigned but there were always a few that just didn't understand they needed to keep busy. I did enjoy working there if not for a few coworkers that felt entitled and thought they were better than the rest."
good,Mergers acquisitions transitions inconsistent goals restructuring multiple managers unclear direction multiple priorities leadership changes and direction changes
good,"Sales are very important"
good,"On an average day I would help many people with their computers as well as help them prevent further problems or get a good new computer,  sometimes I would help with the copy center as well"
good,"This was my first job and only a summer job. They trained me for only two hours and the rest I had to learn first hand, which was a little unnerving for someone who hadn't had a job before. I had to rely on others to answer questions for a while, which is fine, but I relied heavily on them because, I feel, the training was inadequate. Like any retail job, you get used to the customers and the processes."
good,it is good and productive to work at but it can be very repetitive if you are a picker but overall it had a very friendly environment and the staff can be very friendly.
good,"It was a nice relaxing job to work on weekends during school. Often times it got boring. I really couldn't see myself having a career here, even with a manager position."
good,this company is great depending on the store that you work for. some of the stores are amazing and really help you stay positive and happy with your work life balance. And then other stores are terrible and you will never want to work for the company again
good,"Love my job, Office Depot has treated me good and fair, but the past 4-5 years we have had lots of changes, cut in benefits, reduction in force, cuts in infrastructure has made my job harder and  more stressful ."
good,This was my first job during high school so I didn't know what to expect in a retail environment. The best thing about having this job was that it helped me to develop my sales and communication skills. The job itself was not anything particularly special but I cannot be thankful enough for the experience that it provided me.
good,"Compensation is acceptable"
good,"Must be able to stand and work at a fast pace for the majority of shift. Short breaks, and very demanding environment when it comes to sales and meeting sales quotas on technology and furniture."
good,Demande une énorme capacité d'adaptation en fonction des situations.
good,I worked the sales floor the majority of the time.  This position allowed me to build my customer service skills as well as my knowledge about products.
good,in deze branch is het hard knokken tegen de internet winkels. maar wel de kans om te groeien in bepaalde functie`s
good,"Average computer retail position, requiring some knowledge of computers."
good,"The job is easy, super easy. Since it's so easy it can get very boring. On the slow days, theres not much for you to do because rearrange things and clean. Manangers are actually pretty nice and appriciative here. They always have snacks or provide lunch for us. Its not a bad job if youre looking for something small or for extra money."
good,Tried to take care of each and every individual that came into the store with any and every question they had. Always helped with other workers from other departments
good,Nice place to work as a student. Management was good and they were flexible with hours. It was not the most exciting job but that is expected with a part time job
good,About the only thing I liked about Office Depot is that we were served catered lunches on occasion for employee appreciation. Also the job culture was very nice with a lot of cooperation between the different departments.
good,operate a forklift in a productive effeicent work place.pick orders  in a timely matter.keep up with production. putaway products load trucks and unload tractor trailers.
good,Es una buena empresa con una gran cultura dirigida hacia sus empleados
good,"Ok place to work, but low not enough hours for staff. to many part time employees. tough to meet goals when we are not allowed hours to schedule properly."
good,This job was rife with corruption.  Managers who overlooked rule breaking and promoted workers who did not produce and were not punctual.  Its a good entry level job.
good,I enjoy going to work in TRG because of friends and the job is very easy. We just have to take orders for a office supply. And support team is supportive. But the only thing that's hard for me are the tenured agents. They are not accommodating or willing to help the newbie.
good,"Must be able to stand for long hours"
good,Office Depot pays well but doesn't value their employees all the way like they should. Great workplace for young adults and college students or even a second job for someone.
good,"Did like the work for the company also the associate and diversity was fine place to work."
good,"Typical day includes performing ones title duties (merchadiser) as well as covering sales floor with customer service, cashiering, answering phones, resets, price changes/add, inventory maintenance.  Mine is a district training store, so training of incoming management team training occurs about monthly."
good,The job was a good place to work just not enough hours and the pay could be more based off of the job duties. During my time working here the enviroment was bad due to the temperature. The air condition was broken the whole summer
good,Bon travail au sein de l'entreprise mais quelques problèmes à revoir avec le management !
good,"had the same probs at every location i was at. payroll, schedule, unorganized, dirty store, lazy employees, lazy managers, overall a ad place to work."
good,wonderful job cooking for the kids and staff and the building stay clean all the time job was not hard at all just do what they ask you to do and leave and come back the next day and do it again
good,Its a pretty decent place to work at. i worked in the tech dept so i got to interact with customers that not many else in the store do. You get to know some people they become regulars that look for you specifically. You also learn the insides of different models of computers and printers.
good,"I go in and get things ready and the freight worked from the trucks. I also help customers with school and office supplies. Knowledge of new computers and laptops for selling. "
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job: assisting customers with picking out business card designs."
good,"My experience with my store was just the people. Too much drama. Not worth it for me. If you're a bubbly happy person all the time, go for it. If not, try somewhere else."
good,"I enjoyed and learnt plenty of skills during my 10 year period with Office Depot. "
good,The job is pretty easy but they company does not care time to time about what happens to their people. They will use certain tricks and things in order to get the workers to work and even go back days and then use that against the workers.
good,I most enjoyed working on my crew at Office Max.typical day pulling all the orders shipping all LTLs loading all the delivery trucks for distribution for the next day.Culture was ok until layoffs. The hardest part of the job coming to work everyday kowing that day may be the day you get laid off.
good,job was not incredibly difficult but it did require me to quickly grasp most of the adobe suite such as photoshop etc. as well as some new microsoft program features that i hadn't used previously
good,a typical day at work would be getting the freight done and when thats all finished theres a fill report and retail outs to do plus helping customers with whatever they may need.
good,"we sometimes worked for radion stations and spoke with random people to get them to listen to the station. it was fun, loved my bosses, just not enough money"
good,"it was very mediocre, there was only one of us working at a given time so it was very hard to get all the things done on time.  Would not recommend unless its for sure part time."
good,"lo que me gusto mas del empleo es atención al cliente."
good,It has been too many years to write a review about this company.  They have been sold since I have worked for them.  Your best bet is to find someone who has more recent experience with them.
good,Enjoyed working with customers and staff. Outdated systems and equipment. Corporate structure has too many layers. Pay not competitive for the position and skillset required.
good,"Management is typically stand off-ish; 2/3 managers don't do their jobs and leave it to the other managers. My supervisor is excellent though."
good,"Not the most difficult job, sometimes difficult to keep employees focused, due to down time. A good job to work if you're a self-motivated kind of person, and don't need a supervisor watching over you at all times."
good,"•	Developed new business, while maintaining existing and expanding current account base."
good,"I worked for OfficeMax over 5 years ago.  Since then the company has merged with Office Depot so it is hard for me to know what the culture is like specifically.  If you're looking for a fast-paced, customer service oriented job, I would recommend this company."
good,This company is now merged so it will be not valued any review anymore. It was average outside sales positions in western ny. Many layers of management watching you. Did not need that many.
good,"A typical day was I was the one having to clean up everyone else's mess. If they didn't clean the registers or put back there product before they left I had to do it. If copy and print was backed up I had to work over there and be cashier. I learned to not get stressed out. Management was sloppy. Workplace was somewhat okay. The hardest part was doing up to 3-4 task's at a time. Showing people where the pen's were, telling them on mic, putting up a put back and having people ask me questions. Apparently no on knew how to help people on the floor so they would come to me and i'd have to do there job. I guess I enjoyed being helpful and working my butt off."
good,"Unorganized but a very easy job to have. Everyone is typically very laid back, but sometimes there is no structure in how the store is ran. It gets very irritating when things that are not meant for you to solve are being foriced upon your own judgement."
good,Competitive work environment with opportunities for advancement. Hardest part of the job is maintaining client base with less than optimal operations group and resources.
good,"Quick-paced, productive, and sporadically stressful place to work. Great way to gain customer service experience and learn to deal with difficult customers."
good,"I took this job primarily as a way to make some money while in school. I ended up working here for a couple of years. It was a pretty good job, all things considered, but the general corporate attitude was very rigid and didn't seem in tune with the realities of the economy in my area or with the real-life needs of some of the employees."
good,"In distribution center; hours are terrible- very long hours with strange start times."
good,This job taught me so much about production and time management. Learned endurance and teamwork. Learned machine operation and working shifts. Company folded so found another type of work.
good,I was in the tech support part of the store. It was very easy and straight forward work since all you really do is connect customers computers to the office depot network.
good,"I work in the copy center 2 or 3 days a week, 4 hour shifts.  I am here only for a little extra money but do enjoy being in the copy center and helps me to be very good with people.  I overcome any obstacle I can in this department to appease every customer.  Keeps me creative and expands my knowledge with computers as well as helps my people skills.  For the days I am there I enjoy my coworkers.  It does tend to get quite busy in this actual department but has helped me to be a great multi-tasker."
good,"Dont just dont."
good,Needs more employees on the floor as well as more cashiers. Only one cashier sometimes causes frustration for customers and employees. Great loyalty program.
good,"This place is a very fast pace environment, there's always something to keep you busy. Great job for students or ones just entering the job world. This is a good company to start from the bottom and work your way up if you choose."
good,This job was incredibly temporary. Nothing I write in this review will be helpful as the management at OfficeMax has changed since I left over 7 years ago.
good,"Not enough training. High volume, fast passed. Low wages."
good,This job was ok. Sometimes boring when it was slow. Also during the time I was there multiple people quit for whatever reason. Sometimes I would show up for work and not be able to get in.
good,"Alright place to work at, the hours can sometimes be long, and you might be asked to do things you did not originally signed up for, but the pay is decent."
good,Love my job just not impressed with the company as a whole right now.  Trying to stay above water and not treating workers appropriately. The people are great
good,nothing special just a normal minimum wage job. store managers are good people. their computer repair at some locations is a bit fishy. corporate was very good at getting in everybody's way.
good,good place have not worked there in so long do not remember much but the management was not the greatest and sunday nights were required and had to wear a radio
good,I was putting engines in riding lawn mowers and repair ones that were damage. Help out in the warehouse stacking and loading with a clamp truck. We work in other departments when slow or got laidoff
good,"Great place to work at one time,,have been gone long before merger with office depot. Held merchandise assistant manager position enjoyed it very much."
good,This company does everything they can for there employees.they worked with me when it came to the hours I needed and days I couldn't work mangment was on point at all times.
good,"This is true for the person that wants to be a Trailblazer and strictly focus on work. If you feel that this is you, then thiscompany is certainly for you"
good,"we pride ourselves on our strong and rewarding culture and winning by working as a team to earn each other’s trust. We value the diversity, skills and backgrounds of all our employees, including those from outside the industry or with different life experiences."
good,"Pros:"
good,"I assist customers in finding office supplies. I would answer phones, setup accounts, bagged, boxed and wrapped merchandise that needed to be shipped out."
good,Would not work there again. Not interested in parttime work. Promise of advancement but when time to apply for advancement the other supervisors acted like you were wasting their time.
good,Its been a while since i've worked there.  It had a lot of different issues back then;  reduction in centers; rough times;  closed centers; Overall if you deal with a lot of changes it was good.  I have no ideas now that they merged with Office Max.  Redesigned the centers.  Several people i know work there and it seems good.
good,Have been to long since I have worked there so I do not remember my day to day duties. This job just helped with my sales experience and better myself as an overall salesman.
good,At the time the companies had just merged and things were changing. We did not know when things would change we would just be given a few days to make the changes. The general manager was nice enough but did not seem like she wanted to be there.
good,i would not recommend working at this place managers there was very rude and talked very nasty to some of the women and when going to the hire up there was nothing that was dont i would not go back there ever again even if my child was healthy
good,Such a pitty the job only for casual during the end of school. I was doing as Administration Assistant for book list but unfortunately the company hire for 3 three or four months.
good,"When I started with the company, it was an excellent environment full of a fun and friendly people, and advancement opportunities in abundance. Over the years though, the company has taken away more and more benefits and positions, and added more micromanaging and tracking of the numerous metrics."
good,"OfficeMax, is going through to many changes as a company. I no longer has an identity. In turn they have lost their focus on their on core principles."
good,"Good people in a challenging industry. Workplace culture was flexible but somewhat difficult for a balance of life. Overall, enjoyed the people I met."
good,"Great culture, great people to work with.  Learn all about office equipment.  Good hours and good pay.  Best retail experience I have had.  Easy place to adapt to."
good,Was a great place until Office Depot took over.  Then they stopped caring about the customer and associates and only about money.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of helping with customers purchases. Maintaining sales floor presentation. Faxing, copying, shredding. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time."
good,Quiet place to work. Multiple advancement opportunities. Management a bit pushy. A typical day involves explaining sales promotions to consumers. Long hours standing and unpacking boxes.
good,i was recruited from people from office depot. i was in good standing with everyone up to the district mgr. i like what did receiving mdse.and i liked doing customer service. but it seemed that the promise of being in higher mgr. positions kept being put out of my reach. so what i like soon faded.
good,They're a good company that just makes a lot of wrong decisions way too many times. They do not listen to their employees for how things work on the ground level everything just comes from up top and nothing can be done about it.
good,Office Depot main goal is customer satisfaction. Also Office Depot really cares about the development of their people and have well trained associates.
good,"Work environment comfortable, management reasonable, and job recommended to college students. Sales consultant is also an cashier and assist other positions as needed."
good,"Office depot was your average everyday job, nothing special, sometimes very poor management. The Pay did not really add up to the amount work you put in daily."
good,"learned a lot about digital imaging, as to it was a new technology at the time. During that time period flash media became popular and a big transformation from optical media."
good,"Retail stores in general are in a slump, and some companies respond by cutting staff. As is the case at Office Depot in many stores - I was one of the lucky few who managed to avoid the chopping block with the major reduction in workforce that occurred over the last few months, but it isn't easy being the only print specialist on staff for a particular shift. That said, it can be difficult to achieve a work-life balance unless you are persistent - I had to ask my management for months to obtain a more predictable schedule so I could schedule appointments, have time off, whatever. General associates' work is not particularly difficult - training for tech, furniture, or print is definitely more intensive. So, this job is fine if you are flexible with your hours and don't mind the retail pay."
good,Excelente ambiente laboral y facilidad de crecimiento a corto plazo
good,"Managed a book of business, growing established customers into adjacencies while continuing to grow business in core business. Added five to six new customers each month. Company liaison solving issues and customer problems. Maintained CRM database."
good,"Mis primeros días fueron de aprender en las maquinas de impresión, poco a poco fui enseñándome."
good,It was a fun place to work met a lot of good people. Learned alot of things . Definitely made good memories. But sad how it all ended alot of people got displaced but over all great place to work for.
good,They need more job security . 5there is not much too to grow. But experience can be great to lean for other jobs .its a very clean facility as well.
good,"I worked as a sales associate and did some cashiering as well. I learned a lot about different office supplies while working at Office Max. My managers were pretty tough. Especially the assistant manager. He was extremely thorough with everything. My co-workers were the best part of the job. Outside of the managers, everyone was around the same age. About 19-25. Had a lof of fun with basically each day. The hardest part of the job was getting certain attachments or add-ons with products. Like seeing if the customer wanted a warranty on a product. If you arent getting them, they had a list with everyones name on it. And your attachment rate would either be green, yellow or red. They were pretty serious about getting those warranties. I most enjoyed my coworkers while at OfficeMax"
good,Need to be able to do all tasks in the building.  need to work 41 hrs a week.  sales goals need to be met and training is a non stop process.  Need to be able to interact with the public
good,"unloaded the trucks and stocked the store before opening. helped customers around store and to their cars, set up chairs in the back as well has handling the register."
good,"People are decent, but that depends on where you work. Copy & Print can be busy, but I found it taught me a lot about computers and printing knowledge."
good,Really slow job with a lot of sitting around and doing nothing. It's probably about to go out of business. I really enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,Working in three different departments taught me different aspects of retail and how to work in a fast pace environment. Being a Copy and Print Specialist helped get my creativity out while at work by designing business cards for customers.
good,Nothing too special about working at this company. You are expected to do your work in a timely manner. Don't expect any special treatment if you go above and beyond.
good,Micromanaged and need to find and locate better job pool.  A company in flux.  Changing staffing and talent pool almost yearly.
good,"Avg work and personal life balance, OfficeMax did not have vision or funds to move from #3 in the industry to #1 in the industry to be ahead of Office Depot or Staples."
good,Enjoyed working with co workers. the benefits were good. I learned how to drive a forklift and operate other heavy equipment.
good,"It was a  great place to work for during my 16 years of employment.  They  then outsourced our jobs overseas to India, but while I worked there I enjoyed my job and the vendors I worked with."
good,"As the years went by the harder it was to please the upper management. The hardest part of the job was that you were micromanaged. In the  beginning we were able to run our stores the way we wanted to do to make a profit, at the end all they wanted us to do is push papers. It made our customer service level go down"
good,"It gets hectic over EAA when members are coming in to get their booth materials printed off.  Other than that and back to school, it is an easy place to work."
good,"Store management is reasonable with their demands, however, the demands expected from the corporate office were unreasonable at times. "
good,In general a good company but there is a lot of room for improvement in processes.  They could also make a better allocation of the resources. Benefits are not impressive considering the number of employees.
good,"It was a good first job and taught me, customer service skills and how to properly handle money. I was taught how to up-sale and help customers based on their needs."
good,"The company is struggling to find its identity as it has restructured numerous times.  It is still trying to find its niche in the market, trying to sell technology while still being an office supplier, losing ground in both."
good,I balanced the cash drawers daily and balanced petty cash.  I sometimes helped the cashier out when needed. I also help stock and assist at customer service counter.
good,"Had a great DM, very supportive and was a great coach. Went through all seasons and found I enjoyed selling office equipment. I left because I was getting married and moving out of town."
good,"Debido a que cuando ingrese comenzó haber demasiada rotación de personal, por lo cual los horarios de trabajo se extendieron pero con el mismo sueldo. En la gerencia se presento cambio por desear la mejora de esté. La agilidad de la atención de clientes era lenta debido a la falta de personal, especialmente en la gerencia y supervisores. Lo que mas me agrado fue a prender a cobrar y utilizar la caja, ver como se realizaban los arqueos y los cortes de caja."
good,"Great co-workers, work life balance. Internal processes make it very challenging to resolve issues and close opportunities."
good,Face paced environment. Great workplace to multitask and cultivate new talent to embrace observant talent. They offer amazing chances to grow yourself.
good,"Very simple, low stress job. Not a lot of depth, you get your position, you have your set duties, your annual raises are based on your performance. It was easy to move around to other departments if you were interested. Everyone got along, management team was all accessible and approachable. I would go back if they paid more."
good,"A typical day starts early, with a bit of a rush then calms down until the lunchtime and dinnertime followup rushes. Generally, business employees stop buy to grab items for their office."
good,A regular day at work is to come in and get started on the tasks assigned to you. I will suggest to come in to work and don't get involve with making friends or personal issues keep to yourself and complete the jobs assigned to you.
good,"Delivered various office supplies to businesses. A typical day would be to scan over load and truck, then proceed to your route of on average 30-40 stops per day. I met a lot of great people at my regular stops. Management was very thorough and analytical and were typically on the ball with dealing with most anything. The job was extremely physical (climbing in and out of truck, deadlifting cases of copy paper) but I enjoyed the fact that it kept me in good shape and provided me the opportunity to service some really wonderful companies and customers."
good,I worked at two different office depots one had great managers and was a great work place. the second one the manager was a jerk that bordered being a bully and that job was awful.
good,"Works days were very slow, hours and pay were both extremely low even after being promised a certain amount of hours per week. Coworkers were great, but training not so much."
good,"Good Work Environment, With overall welcome to the team. Free Breakfast, Lots of Hands on Work, Good Managemant. The pay wasn't bad for the job that was done."
good,"Good working environment with a lot of responsibility. I was able to run a 40 million dollar business. developed people and my team to succeed,given a lot of responsibility."
good,enjoyed working her just wasnt much room for advancement. while working i had to placed down good. incoming employees came to me  to learn about what was what more they would a manager.
good,"Great place to grow and learn.  But lack of solid corporate structure and sometimes questionable SOP put in place makes the job very frustrating.  Overall the CEO did an ok job, but didnt do much on supporting the front line of the company."
good,A typical day at work would usually be working in copy and print completing print jobs and taking care of incoming customers. Sometimes I was put on the floor or register.
good,not bad place for a part time job. The mangers were nice to me. I advanced fairly quick. the pay is not that well though even for management.
good,Great Environment and People. Working here was a big challenge because it was always business(like i love it). Sometimes it got too busy but I managed.
good,"Not a lot to say other than your typical part time job in sales. Run the registers, assist customers, have a general knowledge of products sold in stores."
good,Was a cashier so I had little interaction with most of my coworkers but did have some close friends. Were very understanding of my availability being a student athlete.
good,"A great place for someone who is willing to learn about retail in a fast paced work enviroment, with availability to learn more things throughout the store."
good,Positive working relationships. Store is neat and displayed well. Pay and benefits are a plus for this company. Customers are made to feel welcome.
good,"Office Depot is another typical micromanaged business.The upper management will only converse with the Store manager and unless the place is really burning down or you make a mistake, You will never be addressed."
good,"Office Depot was my first non voluntary job. I have nothing but positive things to say about it. From the management to the work environment , Office depot felt like home and they treated all their associates with compassion."
good,"Its very good company to work for. This is the place where both Personal and professional balance is maintained. "
good,It was a long time ago. I do not remember how things are. All i know is that i worked hard and tried my best. The managers were changed regularly so you there was no getting used to any boss styles.
good,Was a good first job when I was 17. Management at the time was decent to deal with. hours were okay.
good,"I would have to run reporting on contact rates and base my day based on this or any campaigns the company were running at that time. KPI's were 35 dials a day 2 hours talk time."
good,"A typical day at work involves me coming to work at 2pm and touching base with the other members of the management team to learn if there was pending work that needed finishing. "
good,"I don't like management. You have to sale a certain amount of products, that it sometimes takes away the fun of a work place."
good,"I worked here before it merged with OfficeDepot and working there is what you would expect from a high school or post high school job."
good,"okay job and low pay, learned some valuable skills, they could use better managers but other than that not a bad place to work, not much else to say really"
good,The job itself was nice.Management was not.Benefits were good but the pay could use some improvement.
good,"Must have time management, Plan accordingly. When under budget still manage to get all task done. Training and skill training can be fun, but work load can be demanding when quotes are not meet."
good,I  enjoyed this job. It was fast paced and I really liked fixing computers for them. My co-workers and I made the job fun and gave the place a good vibe.
good,"Fun and lots of areas to learn new skills."
good,"This job opportunity was an amazing experience, It kept the day going, and time went by fast every shift. Co workers were amazing and very helpful for introducing new workers."
good,"un lugar de trabajo estable con mis colegas"
good,"I had good management here, and there was a nice team atmosphere that I enjoyed. A typical day was pretty unremarkable: selling paper and electronics to customers or ringing them out at the cash register. Not very interesting, but not bad either. The hardest part was probably the monotony, or dealing with the occasional irrational customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers. I also enjoyed setting up some of the displays and organizing them, because I like organizing things for some reason."
good,"Working with mostly high school and college aged people the work environment can get immature and stressful at times. Some of the managers don't make it any less stressful by talking to the employees with condescending attitude. By working in this environment though I have learned how to focus on the customers and doing the job at hand instead of listening to my coworkers gossip. I would have to say the most difficult part of the job has been the transition from Office Max to Office Depot. When I was first  starting I didn't have to treat customers like children and wasn't worried about getting in trouble by my managers for not constantly bugging customers. The most enjoyable part of the job will always be making the customers happy and being able to tell on a personal level how grateful they truly are for me making their shopping experience easy, educational, and or enjoyable."
good,A company that needs fresh ideas. I typical have to find new ways of helping my business with out using any additional payroll to do so.
good,Was a decent summer gig for me. It was a good lesson in how the corporate world works. I was able to begin training in customer satisfaction there.
good,My experience at Office Depot was mostly positive. I enjoyed interacting with customers all the time. I enjoyed my duties as stocker and most as a salesperson.
good,"Worked with a good crew, loved the customers, but some of the jobs were tasking. I generally liked working at Office Depot."
good,It was a continuous nonstop working environment that was nice to be apart of. I learned to be on time early and to not slack. Again a diverse group of people to be apart of. The hardest thing was having to be on time with your work. But I enjoyed the good things i learned in being there.
good,If you are in management then you will go far however they do not look to give much full time work out to regular employees so obtaining benefits would be hard unless you are management.  Great place for your first job
good,"-scanned and stocked warehouse items"
good,"Heavy workload, highly competitive as well in regards to selling, Hardest part of the job is most likely working with others who aren't willing to grow as an associate. Most enjoyable part would Helping someone find exactly what they wanted or being able to hand them their PC after completing a service for them and having them leave with it working. The management in most cases is helpful in terms of enabling associates to move forward when its possible."
good,"Responsible for delivering superior customer service and all customer interaction"
good,"I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer leaves my store extremely satisfied. Knowing I helped them get what they need and put a smile on their face is the best feeling in the world."
good,I was in charge of the tech department and restocking all inventories.  The job was only temporary and was needed to pay minimum bills.
good,"Working at OfficeMax was a delightful and enjoyable experience with many learning opportunities. The staff was always so kind, fun, and extremely energetic. Management wanted the working environment to be fun and lively, and it definitely was. Customers were always eager for assistance in selecting products to purchase. The most challenging part of the job was learning all of the different printers and their functions as well as which ink cartridges matched with which printer. With so much information, it was easy to get lost, but I enjoyed helping customers find their match, which only drew me further in learning the skill. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers, especially the women who went a little overboard on office supplies, completely unapologetic. The customers ranged from young teens to seniors, offering a wide array of culture and experience from customers. The customers were always eager to tell a good story or socialize, which always made coming to work a new and exciting adventure."
good,A Typical day at work in OfficeMax was boring and slow. Not many people walked in though out the week. The hours were a joke.
good,"You work pretty normal shifts, with a few over-nights scattered here and there when freight gets out of control. Other employees were as nice as any part time high schooler can be. Many times I was unwillingly kept over when my shift had ended. Customers always seem to be grumpy and distraught, seeing as the entire crew is younger than the age of 25 and are not experts in computer science or mechanical engineering with no training in those things. Yet, they are expected to be experts on the subjects."
good,"I never minded the work at Office Max. The company merged with Office Depot right when I started so I really only knew how the Office Depot side of things worked. The management wasn't top class, but I have had much worse before. If you work hard and try to move up, you can succeed."
good,"Great workers, helpful being that my first time on a forklift was at Estes. Late night shifts. Learned how to properly operate a forklift. Managers expected a lot from me in the beginning and it was difficult because it was my first time. enjoyable part was pretty much being on your own and just making sure the job was done."
good,"Typical day at work is waiting for customers to come in."
good,"Office Depot was a decent job. I was responsible for setting appointments for customers in need of work on their computers or other technology.  I operated on computers inside and out, and placed follow-up calls to inform customers of statuses. Management and co-workers were team-oriented although there was only one tech consultant on the job at a time to work on multiple computers and meet deadlines which sometimes was the hardest part of the job. Overall I didn't feel as though I was paid enough for as much work I was responsible for. There were times when I also was reported to registers in the midst of work, and restocking, and even assembling purchases in need of assemble."
good,"The atmosphere at OfficeMax is really laid back, organized duties. The chance for advancement is slim to none, no pay raises seem likely as well"
good,"Days tend to be fairly slow, management is ok, sometimes fairly bad. Hardest part of the job is handling the furniture. The majority of the time you are straightening shelves."
good,A typical day of work consisted of managing the copy and print department job flow and associate productivity. I learned a great deal about customer service and timely scheduling jobs. Management was largely hands off and the coworkers were either over or under qualified. The hardest part of the job was having to correct mistakes that others made and the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that were satisfied with their finished print products.
good,"Company is now being purchased by Staples. I found my time there meaningful as it afforded me to grow as an individual and an employee, even through personal challenges after having breast surgery."
good,"deliver office supplies"
good,The company itself is decent to work for. I did not agree with the management styles in place at my location during my time there. They had good sales and training features in place. The staff worked hard. There were many opportunities for advancement from within.
good,"Life was better before the merger with OfficeMax.  It was actually fun to go to work, not any more.  You have to do so much with little to no payroll."
good,"- Méthode"
good,Great group of girls to work with.  Management could  be less political.  Expectations were never able to be met.  Enjoyed pot luck days and parties.
good,"It has been too many years since I have worked for this retailer. Recently they have merged with OfficeDepot, which was their biggest competitor. This particular store is among the smallest stores in the chain, offering office furniture, computer sales and repair along with Print services. FedEx shipping is also available. Office supplies of every kind can be found here along with computer software and school supplies."
good,"I spent most of the day answering customer questions about electronics since that was the department I was in and what I knew the most about. I would climb ladders to get the printer/pc/whatever from top stock down for the customer. If they weren't in stock we could special order. I stocked items from the warehouse and filled shelves on the floor. The people there were very laid back, which was nice. Pay was minimum wage so not so much."
good,"Come in and setup the CopyMax department. Take various jobs from  customers. These jobs would be various copying, document creation,photoshop work ect... Help out with other departments from carring out the furnature to selling Electronics."
good,"•	Communicating with customers to determine their technical needs from repairing their software to upgrading or replacing their technology."
good,Good job for the school year. At times stressful workplace. Learned a lot about retail management. Learned some computer repair skills.
good,i help customers out finding there products the need and help theam purchased there products. the hardest managers to deal with and not much team effort there either.
good,"I have learned how to use the computer in the last 17 years of employment. I had gone to class to learn about it but have done better with on hand experience over the years. There have been a great deal of turnovers both in immediate personnel but in the corporation itself over the years. This is a worldwide corporation that keeps the employee on its toes. There has been a merger that was finalized at the beginning of the year and it has affected how the stores do their jobs. There may be one down the road as well with another company. No one knows the outcome but I am sure that more changes will be added. There are more new people what seems to me is every day. It has changed from my early days when you were able to get to work alongside of people who became your friends. Now, you hardly work with the same people twice a week. Tasks are different each day and that keep you on your toes as well."
good,"Not run well, small out of the way location. Store closed down after 5 years. Had to do it all there, from making copies to selling computers."
good,There were almost never any customers in the stores during the times I was working. The workers weren't very welcoming nor as nice as I would have expected them to be.
good,The coworkers were very nice and most of the managers were polite and cordial. The company has been horribly disorganized since the merger with Office Depot though.
good,I enjoyed working this job. The managers and employees were very nice. I liked being able to learn about office supplies and software.
good,Working in impress gave me a chance to express my creative side which helped when creating customers orders and ideas for invitations and flyers.
good,"I have no opinion on this corporation, due to I only worked for them 2-3 months after the merger."
good,"On an average day, I fix computers, assist customers, and generally hep with the upkeep of the store. I've gained a bit of experience in sales from this job, although I had customer service experience from several of my past jobs. I feel as though my technical knowledge has grown and I'm more comfortable with installing computer hardware after this job."
good,"I enjoyed the job I was doing, I worked with vendors and customers to resolve issue with there accounts. Made sure customers billed. worked with other teams from Peru and Boca overall I enjoyed what I did, I learned a lot of different screens in SAP program of computer."
good,Nice people to work with. Managers weren't much as an example to go by. Most of the employees did not like working there. It did help me grow with customer experience.
good,"Typical work day consisted of completing work orders, associate requests, and daily maintenance schedules. Management was supportive and easy to work with. Learned many problem solving skills related to building issues such as HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and logistics. Co workers were joyful and easy to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job was the new challenges that I faced daily and overcoming them. The hardest part of my job was the last year having to watch my co workers being laid off as our jobs went off shore and our building was closed"
good,This job is for a college student or a high school senior who has no work experience. Pay is the most disappointing because if you have a family it will not help you pay to much of anything.
good,sales driven environment with a competitive atmosphere coaching associates finding the best person for the job and give them proper training
good,Already reviewed this.  was a good company to work for when it was Boise and then OfficeMax.  When OfficeDepot aquired the company everything changed and not for the better.
good,maintaining 2 location portfolios over a total of a millions dollars. Contacting  necessary departments to procure payment on past due invoices. Processing credit card payments.  Researching discrepancies on accounts to resolve customer issues.
good,"If you are interested in selling technology services, this is the place for you! Be prepared to figure things out on your own and work hard!"
good,hardest part of the job was learning and adjusting to fast past environment. especially with the lack of hours I was able to work
good,I enjoyed the sales aspect. I had a minimum requirement of tech sales to complete weekly so it was fun challenging my coworkers.
good,The environment is very productive and fast pace due to time effort and energy and a lot of study good place to learn if you apply yourself.For a career your future or next productive step in life great starter job for the real world.
good,This job was a great way to network with people and provide a different kind of customer service while learning new skills at the same time.
good,"Good working environment, companionship."
good,"I work in logistics and stock shelves and help customers find right products and ring out customers on the register, cover lunch breaks for print department and cashiers."
good,Some of the military personnel still think they are in the military and insist on treating everyone as such. Top management is more interested in micro-managing the dept. managers and favoritism is rampant.
good,The copy and print department at Office Depot usually has something new and exciting each day.  I found many opportunities to learn new software as well as techniques to meet customers requests.  The chain of command is very good and I have usually felt the management genuinely cared about my co-workers and myself.  The most disheartening experience I have is when a customer needs a service that we are not equipped to handle.
good,"The store itself was a fun place to work at, but the management is hard on the employees making for a less than appealing place to work."
good,This was a job learning experience in which I learned a lot in the work environment.  The managers and coworkers were kind and easy to work with.
good,Very productive work environment in the shipping area. I enjoyed the employees and management was very helpful with any issue.
good,My daily routine working a Office Depot would be working the sales floor helping and checking out customers at the register. I also helped stock the sales floor. Management and co-workers were cool to be around.
good,"had good time here, everyday had something different to do, got along well with management and co-workers. only problem in winter the store gets quite cold and summer gets quite hot...corporate don`t seem to care."
good,"Leadership and associates still with company post-merger still loyal and hard working. Good benefits program. Loyal customer base, but even they are questioning what's going on with Staples purchasing company. A big Pro would be that there a number of other more stable companies hiring - take advantage of them."
good,"Drove successful sales and profitability growth while minimizing losses through use of internal sales and inventory information in conjunction with other data sources such as: Nielsen research data, consumer product decision trees, geographic and demographic data, market-basket affinity and consumer purchasing behaviors."
good,Working for Office Max was a rewarding experience. The training programs available at Office Max not only started off a career but were developed to help the company succeed.
good,"It is a nice place to work. The managers are nice and accommodating when I need to schedule around school/life events. When I am working on computers my shifts can be enjoyable. The pay isn't much however, and I would prefer to do programming work over retail. I give it a 3/10 overall."
good,Seven weekly sales goals. Could blow six of the seven out of the water and miss the seventh goal by $10. Result get chewed out for not hitting your seventh goal. All about the numbers and nothing else matters.
good,"A great bunch of people. Very professional work environment. OfficeMax was a great place to work, the company cared about their employees."
good,Decent place to work. Pay is decent for retail. Uniforms look nice. Management is not good. Hard to move up. They work you real hard.
good,"En general es un ambiente relajado, el sueldo de los supervisores de departamento es mas o menos decente comparado con los sueldos de la zona aunque el sueldo del personal general podría ser un poco mas alto. A algunos gerentes parece no importarles el bien estar de sus empleados con tal de vender."
good,"Worked in the store. Assisted customers with purchases, worked the cashier, handled money, kept shelves stocked, kept store presentable, worked with a team."
good,"A typical day at work begins with intensive recovery of the day before, many of the freight workers have countless duties to attend to while the night crew has few. Management is very friendly and highly skilled."
good,The goal process and comp plan was always a moving target.  Comp plan would change every year so it was hard to know how to plan your sales for the next year.  Incentives were good and easy to exploit for good bonus.
good,"Starting with clocking in then immediately hit the sales floor towards my I.T. bench. On normal days you would have to manage the whole I.T. department on your own. When there is no customers around or down time we have to take care of and clean up our department. By far the hardest part of working in office depot is managing a whole department on your own especially when you have around 7 customers that all need your attention at the same time, this is when multitasking really kicks in. Moving from one costumer to the next you really have to understand and know what you are talking about. The best thing about this job were the employees and people you meet on a day to day basis."
good,Working for this location was often times hectic with management and staff not knowing what each other was doing. Dealing with the customers was always a positive experience though
good,Ottimo rapporto con colleghi anche se migliorabile con alcune persone
good,"a set schedule was available to workers to outline required tasks to be preformed. flexibility was a welcome experience, friendly atmosphere was always there."
good,Fun coworkers and managers. This job taught me time management because I was working a lot of eight hour shifts during the week while also going to school. The hardest part of the job was working so many back to back eight hour shifts while in school; it made study time scarce.
good,"A typical day would be running the operations for a retail store to include a copy center to include fielding customer complaints, freight merchandising and receipt."
good,"I was a department manager at Office Depot. I had worked for them not long before the executives had made the call to shut down the store I was working in. "
good,"It was a great company and through the buyout from Office Depot, it has become less of a desirable company to work for. It was a good learning experience, but future change from Staples buyout causes one to be concerned about the future."
good,"Currently work full time for Office Depot as a Sales Associate providing customer support on the floor, handling freight, and monitoring register system."
good,"I would never prefer to work at office depot as my own preference, But the experience did give me good experiences in a copy and print department that taught me a lot about printers, lamination, binding, printing certain ways and gave me some extra organizational skills."
good,"A typical day would be to work the merchandise that came in on the truck the day before. Stocked the floor for the first two hours before the store opened. When the store opened customers are always priority. In between customers we had to down stock product from the overheads. My co-workers were awesome to work with. Everyone doing their part causes growth not only with our store numbers, but as fellow employees. When everyone does their part, it makes everyone's job a lot easier as the day goes. I wouldn't say that there was a hard part of my job because it was work that I enjoyed to do. The most enjoyable part of my job besides having a laugh or two with my co-workers would be seeing the faces or hearing customers say how satisfied or happy that they came to shop at our store."
good,I liked working here. I gained a lot of customer service values. Those values I gained help me to learn to deal with all types of customers.
good,"Normally came in to work early morning shifts, that required the unload of product on pallets received the previous night. Once organized & separated, the product was to be placed in it's designated aisle prior to the store opening."
good,"typical customer service work duties, with easy going co-workers . no late nights or early mornings.simple duties and tasks with a great customer service"
good,"Great Organization to work for...Lots of skilled individuals...Great work environment and work/life balance.  Lots of room for advancement, strong management team."
good,"Early morning shift"
good,Manage the custom order programs provided by various vendors and ensure prepayment. Monitor sales associate compliance to ordering procedures and vendor compliance to timely and quality performance
good,"Daily operations, cash handling, receiving, merchandising, planning, hiring, training and development with a strong focus on customer satisfaction intended to help meet or exceed sales and profit expectations."
good,"A typical day at Office Depot is basically assisting the customers, listening and trying to determine what it is that we have that would best fit their needs. If for some reason I am unable to figure out what's best for them I could always count on a coworker or a member of management to come help me out. The hardest part of the job however may be having to lift heave desk that could easily weigh over 200lbs. However even though it may be hard work at times, it's always good to know that you've given the customer the best service you possibly could."
good,"A typical day at work included working face to face with customers, printing documents, cleaning and organizing work areas. I learned excellent customer service skills."
good,"Fast paced environment with the ability to cross-train in many areas.  This experience has provided me with opportunities in management and in training, where my outgoing personality works magic."
good,Every quarter and review period there were teammates that had to be let go due to not making goal. This was frustrating due to the goals where not attainable.
good,Great first working experience. Hands on work plus insight on manager duties. Worked in groups but also acted autonomously.
good,"Employes are expected to work long hours during peak season, and short hours otherwise. If you can budget yourself accordingly it will work fo you."
good,cool place to work if you still in school. the employees was pretty cool. the hours was good they work with you if you needed to move your schedule around
good,"Customers aren't always the nicest but the work environment and coworkers are fun to work with. It was very laid back when I worked there but once I left, a new manager and District Manager came in."
good,"Worked in a common sales position preforming floor sales, cashiering, and stoke management. co-workers are friendly but I feel like selling insurance on products is pushed too hard. ie: selling a $25 insurance policy on a $30 calculator."
good,"It was a relax place to work.Training and preparing the store and the employees to start the day is and was refreshing>Store hours were good store sales were better,training associates to see the sales goals that are right in front of them was a very good exoerience"
good,"It is an okay to work, It can be stressful at times, but it is a good place to work especially if you are in high school looking for your first job."
good,"Had good training, productive work environment team work,  A very demanding workplace was busy but not too much that couldn't be handled"
good,"I felt like corporate management didn't understand how it worked in the real world. Constantly trying to push us to sell services that people didn't need or couldn't do in our region. "
good,"What I can bring to your company is a creative ideas, flexible and knowledge to learn more or to share with others, always a team player with other, if that person is a client or a fellow worker."
good,Working for Office Depot in a Cross-Dock distribution center enabled me to work in a fast paced business environment and provided me a solid foundation of logistics. Working here as a manager enabled me to guide company profitability through the management teams direct interaction and control of the business and facility practices. We were able to develop company wide distribution SOP's.
good,"Calling on accounts that are currently delinquent, taking credit card payments, resolving billing issues and payment discrepancies. Retrieving invoice copies or billings per customer requests for payment to be issued. "
good,"Calling on accounts that are currently delinquent, taking credit card payments, resolving billing issues and payment discrepancies.  Retrieving invoice copies or billings per customer requests for payment to be issued.  "
good,"Office Depot is a decent place to work. In recent years, there have been massive upheavals due to the company merging which has caused some business destabilization, loss of good managers, and a decline in the work/life balance."
good,"Average started at 7 am with unloading freight and working it onto the sales floor followed by ""Depot Time"" which is a 100% customer service focused part of the day from 11-3. while working at office depot i learned the importance of up-selling and keeping customers satisfied. The hardest part about the job would have to be strict time constraints for working morning freight and the most enjoyable part would be helping a customer find exactly what they needed."
good,Good company but many flaws. We worked directly with production managers when jobs came in from clients. Managers had hard time keeping up with work that sales produced.
good,This is a good place to have for a part time job.  The day usually consists of assisting customers with their needs on finding the right products or ringing out their purchases.  When it is slow you put out any stock that is needed to be put out or straighten up the store to make it look presentable.  The down side is at times it can get very busy depending on the time of year and it is hard to be in two places at once on helping customers.
good,This place of business was my first real job. It was very fun and I got to learn a lot about the shipping receiving industry. I was responsible for pulling orders and loading pallets on trailer to be shipped out the next morning.
good,"Before Office Max and Office Depot became one, it was a different company. Change is good, my friends. This is why you see Office Max, Sands, then Office Depot on my application."
good,"The job is not too difficult, but the management at certain stores is not very good.  The people you meet there and work with make you stay however."
good,"Fast paced. Worked well with other departments and sales rep making the customer come first."
good,"wonderful customers, good co-workers, reasonable hours and overall good vibes, as well as learning more about yourself by doing various tasks."
good,"Steady job and income but as with most retail based companies, the work is endless, demands are high and the pay is low. Most Office Max employees are incredibly knowledgeable, fun, and hard working. The company has been involved with a merger with Office Depot for over a year and is again in merger talks with Staples in February 2015. Keeping up with all of the changes in policy, payroll, personnel at corporate and district level, and company culture is tough when it changes so often and drastically. Being in the print department is all guts and little glory but if you love print and graphics work then it is a great way to hone your skills, release creative energy, and if you can do that then you can most likely do anything."
good,Was a good company to work for. The coworkers we all great people to work with. Developed many friends that were customers
good,Good retail job to work at. Great service. Get customer service. Learned how to be patient with customers and how to provide excellent service to those who needed help. Hardest part was trying to be patient with someone who was rude. Enjoyable part is making the customer happy.
good,worked for a small trucking firm before i get out in the morning i would load then unload my own trucks.
good,"Company is in transition and working out the kinks. "

good,Assist customers and manage associates. I've enjoyed hiring a team that is motivated and eager to be part of a team.
good,"It was awesome working with the copy and print department at Office Depot. I learned a lot of things I didn't know about printing, paper types and the different things I could print out. We would print everything from books to flyers, and advertising."
good,met veel plezier orderpicker/ magazijnmedewerker geweest
good,Empresa comprometida en ser la numero uno en la venta de artículos de papelería y oficina.
good,"I would come in balance money, ensure registers are put out. Manage all employees, maintain daily tasks."
good,Made sure had all the necessary supplies to ensure a positive business day. This job made me be a responsible employee and prepared me for the future endeavors.
good,This isn't important. Its a whole new company and will have its own new culture. It's old culture has been swept under a rug
good,I was a Cashier at Office Depot.  I helped customers with purchases.
good,I loved making custom orders for people and letting my creative side shine in the workplace.
good,"Worked on the phones to sell products"
good,"Office Depot has exposed me to a completely different culture of the retail world. When the product changes, so does the atmosphere. Working as a team to complete daily tasks, working side by side each individual from each department shows me the importance of not limiting oneself. The most enjoyable part of my job is my ability to be useful and help as many customers and co-workers as I can."
good,"Office Depot is a decent part time job, and I was fortunate enough to have an excellent manager who worked very well with my school schedule."
good,"Working for Office Depot was a dead end job with low pay. The crew was fun and nice to work with, and the job itself was ok, but I felt that there was no room for advancement."

good,"Friendly work enviorment.Flexible scheduling, but pay is not that great"
good,"I love networking and meeting new people."
good,an typical day work is basically unloading trucks 6 or 7am and stocking shelves by 11:00. I have learned how to use a register and how to take inventory. Management was a bit lacking and but ok at times. My co-workers were awesome I was able to get along with very easy. The hardest part of the job was the constant changes of routine everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with customers and watching them leave with smiles on their faces knowing that I did a great job.
good,"Excess work with little time for your personal life."
good,"I was fortunate to work at a store with mostly good management, which can make or break retail. Commission is virtually non existent, so dont let them fool you with that. I loved my co-workers and still remain friends with most of them today. There really isnt anything difficult regarding your daily job duties. The most enjoyable part was it being a relatively nonchalant work environment. If you dont mind retail, I'd say go for it."
good,Fast paced work environment with high expectations and all about customer service.A typical day would be doing some displays and coaching and guiding employees on selling and keeping customers happy. I learned time management because all my tasks are timed. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customer happy and taking care of them with whatever they need.
good,This was a nice job that offered an excellent opportunity to understand the inner workings of the business supplies industry.
good,Everyone was fun to work with and staff were easy going. management were firm and strong. the hours were long and got boring at times therefore working and motivation was less appealing. I enjoyed the experience.
good,I have learned and am still learning a lot from this position but the pay is lousy
good,"Company is undergoing major change since recent merger with OfficeMax, causing a stressful work environment."
good,Creative work environment. Beautiful place to work. Very creative artist to work with in the advertising department.
good,"A typical retail job."
good,very fun place because the management people show the fairness of the job for every employee.
good,Running cashier is a slow job but the pay is not bad for those looking for beginning work. Mixed feelings about the management. Most enjoyable part of the job were working with the customers and putting a smile on their faces. Hardest part of the job was the lack of training and dealing with the management sometimes.
good,"A typical day at  work was to come in, log onto the register and help every customer as sufficiently and as quickly as possible."
good,"Veel ervaring opgedaan op het gebied van internationale sales."
good,Premerger it was a very good place to work.  Was  a close nit family with well defined goals
good,running front register and helping customers find items they need
good,"I try to do my best every single day, but it seems that no matter how hard I try to excel, I am always brought down by negativity of most of the managers at this location.  This negativity has made its way down to most of the associates and they don't strive to do their best anymore."
good,"A typical day at work was bouncing around departments. Cash register, stock room, tech depo, copy and print, and furniture."
good,"La oportunidad de crecimiento no es muy buena, el compañerismo fue excelente al igual que el trabajo en equipo."
good,office depot is a small company for individuals who are still in school.i learned alot about comuters and i learned how to install and assemble furniture.managment is goood.coworkers are young and motivated.the hardesr part of job was working so hard for the little amount of pay
good,"Responsible for providing an exceptional in-store customer service experience by acknowledging customers, and ensuring freight is processed efficiently to maximize product service levels."
good,"The most enjoyable part about working at office depot, would have to be interacting with customers and assisting them in finding what ever they need. Working at office depot is never a dull moment when it comes to assisting new customers or seeing the same frequent office depot shoppers it is always a great moment. As far as the working environment its a great team work environment with great co-workers."
good,I learned from this company and was able to take real world skills when I left.
good,"it was stressful, did not treat each employee fair. The store manager picked favorites and you barely got a raise"
good,OfficeMax was a great place to work.  Sorry it merged with Office Depot.
good,"The company is great that is all  I can say. I have learned how to resolve problems, tolerance, and patience"
good,"As Sales professional at Office Depot, Management usually directed the day to day operations of the environment. Often, if you were in the acceptable crowd, you were given leads and promotions a lot easier. What I learned from this experience is that loyalty is not valued. "
good,Great job for students. Not an easy company to move up in. Love the people I work with. Not to crazy about the company itself.
good,"Managed the copy center with assisting customers with creating, designing, and producing a variety of projects. Worked closely with Microsoft (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Publisher), Adobe, and Photoshop."
good,hopaco/OfficeMax is an office supply and commercial product distributor. The retail store is a small space that you do a little of everything. From stocking shelves to pulling orders from the warehouse to fill the store. It's a fun job because you work with a lot of familiar people and return customers. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time in the day to always complete your task. The most rewarding part of the job is the accomplishments you make.
good,"assist with the remodel of stores also restock stores, help with copy and print, cashier and sales."
good,"Successfully orchestrated the distribution of new inventory while "
good,"If you don't mind asking a lot of questions to sell insurence for everything under the sun, or ""do you need paper today?"" then this is the place. Customer satisfaction is top priority, but so is getting an ""maxassurence"". If certain requirements aren't met a talking to is in order. Management is confusing to understand; one will require this while another wants something totally different. Just be prepared."
good,"Although I was just mainly a cashier time would run slow. for the short period of time i learned how to work the copy machine printers, and fax machine; as well as some of the merchandise they sell. The management were very helpful as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the little hours I was given as well as competing with the other co-workers selling the protection plans that each worker needed minimum 2 a week."
good,A great place to start in retail. Management was always willing to provide assistance to help you learn and grow as a person. The changing culture made it harder and harder to accomplice the day to day task of running the store. I really enjoyed learning the different departments.
good,"Office Depot was a fast paced, large employer with consistent expectations of their employees (management and salary).  However, due to the economic down turn in past years, many employees such as myself found hours reduced to a level that was not sufficient for supporting a family with basic needs.  Hopefully with the slow recovering economy, Office Depot will bounce back"
good,i like the company want to learn more on repographic and office work
good,"I love my job just would like to find something that fits my personality. its great to work great pay! very nice, reasonable mangers"
good,forklift operation and merchandise relocation for shipping and receiving functions and maintaining inventory records
good,Job insecurity is a big problem facing all Office Depot assoictaes due to Office Max and Office Depot merging.
good,"If your looking for a job to just get by, this is the job for you. It does not require much education or heavy lifting. They are also flexible with scheduling."
good,"Relaxed atmosphere.  There is no room for advancement, but a good place to get some experience."
good,This job is ok.I learned how to deal with different types of people and situations. The most enjoyable part of working there would have to be meeting new people and learning about different business solutions. The hardest part would be dealing with rude people.
good,HAD A LOT GREAT PEOPLE WORKING THERE.                                                  the on hand training was very good

good,"I loved meeting all the proactive college students and business owners of Kansas City, MO metro area."
good,Along with the great customers and experience working there will be one of the great things that I will carry with me forever.
good,A typical work day at Office Depot was going right in to work and starting my day with unloading the truck.  I learned how to multitask in different areas of the store without supervision.  Management would review you annually and inform you of the areas where you were most strongest in and what you needed to work on to better yourself within the company.  Co-workers were challenging at times.  The hardest part of the job is the advancement within the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job is how I could help customers and be a team leader.
good,"picking and staging is the typical day"
good,"A day at work can vary stressful to calm, depending on the day of the week. Monday through Thursday were very slow days and we had time to preform our other duties such as setting prices we have missed, editing prices and making sure all the items were marked correctly.Friday through Sunday were our busy days and we focused highly on customer service and sales, i had to instruct my team how to deliver and excellent customer experience and close the sale. The store manager and assistant store manager were a great and helpful team and i had a positive learning experience."
good,Good for Job Security and Long-Term Career.  Nothing else to say.
good,"Office Depot has great core values, but struggles with upper management supporting the customer service culture they so desperately need."
good,"Managers are easy to get along with. Pay is minimum wage."
good,just another job helping customers that walk into a store with a tech side. hardest part of the job wasn't really hard just to give an understanding to customers on what the latest technology is
good,My day usually begins at 7 am.  I am responsible for getting new freight out and then filling the shelves.  I do many jobs depending on where I am needed that day.  I do the damages and defective merchandise.  Which means I get them together and do the appropriate paper work and then ship them out.  I also cashier and help in the copy center.  I have worked for many years in the cash office.  Doing the paper work and the receiving and sending out monies.  In the early years I was the anual inventory controller.  I've been with Office Depot for over 24 years.  I've done a lot of different task through out the years and they continue to change every day.
good,No big complaints I guess. I mean its retail management so you work a ton of hours and miss alot of stuff you want to do due to spuratic changes in the schedule. But thats anywhere.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of shipping off certain products to other branches of office depot, sometimes helping package. I learned about the ins and outs of warehouse working and also how to manage workers, such as myself."

good,Loved working with customers the most. Needed a better game
good,"A wonderful place to work, shop and invest.."
good,The work environment was great. It's a slow pace workload until sale week or big holidays.
good,Enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job. The experience work about growing.
good,Slightly outdated ways of doing business but staffed with good people.
good,"I truly enjoyed working with the copy and print center. I loved designing for my customers. I would work with customers and associates on getting their business started with business cards, postcard, brochures, and other related office items. I got to learn each department within the store. The worst thing was that was to much moving from one store to another store, without any warning. The store was always changing the structure of the business. The reconstructing was always in place. They could not agree on how to run the company, difference from home office to district manager was always causing a disruption in the flow of the stores."
good,very narrow minded. management treated you like they were above you and didnt see them selves on the same level. horrible hours and minimal pay for how hard they expect you to work and the duties they expect you to accomplish.
good,A typical day at work consist of sales. our job is to make sure every customer have purchased items and are satisfied. It is a well diverse environment. The Hardest part is keeping the manager happy he complained about everything everyone did.   
good,"Great Company and core values."
good,"	Handling the commercial activities like monthly billings, invoice submission & payment collection"
good,if you need a job and looking to make some money here is a job for you
good,Muchas actividades diarias donde poco a poco vas desarrollando diferentes virtudes que no siempre sabes que cuentas con ellas y te ayudan a mejorar en tu desarrollo profecional.
good,"The people who work there are very nice."
good,"Predominantly, my responsibilities at this job included customer service and technology sales. The management was helpful and worked to establish a team-centered environment for the employees."
good,not focused on employees. not enough health benifits. most employees unhappy.
good,"I start the day by checking the office email to see if any print jobs are in need of attention. If there are any jobs in the email, I would attend to those first. Then, customers would walk in for either design jobs, business cards, banners, or perhaps shipping via postal office or ups and I would assist those customers throughout their process for whatever is needed for successful customer service. If it gets to busy I might cashier or answer the phones to help the other team members so the store is operating in a smooth fashion."
good,"Es un trabajo rutinario, con mucho ambiente de trabajo en el cual hay mucho apoyo por parte los compañeros, aprendes sobre el manejo de mercancia, recibirla, manejar montacargas, haces stock de mercancia, los jefes son flexibles y comprensibos, el sueldo esta regular."
good,Life in retail is an ever changing situation that has excitement everyday.hardest part of the job is the
good,Your basic retail job. They are very flexible with work hours that makes it ideal for students. High turn over rate. First real job for most people. Might be a second job for some. Hardest part of the job is low pay and limited advancement. Flexibility and easy to master.
good,"I enjoy talking to the customers and meeting new people that become my regulars. You do not ever know how many hours each week you will be allowed to get and upper management changes more than I expected. I have learned a lot about face to face interactions with cusomers where before most of my interactions were over the phone. My co-workers are nice. On a typical day you will make copies, special order whatever the customer needs that is done outside, print pictures, resumes and any other data from a flash drive or their email. Create wide format posters and pictures. Also, make copies, create bound books, presentations, laminated products, order checks, invitations and same day business cards."
good,"was never a bad job, just got old and boring after a few years."
good,"Typical day is calling on 2 to 4 new prospects along with taking care of current customers. Reponsible for large base of 1.8 million along with cold calling to get new customers responsible for $450,000."
good,"This is a good organization. The reality is that office supplies are not an overly attractive business and it is completely commoditized. More and more of the office supply business is going to online sales and ""big-box"" office supply retailers will continue to feel a lot more pressure to feel relevant in the marketplace. OfficeMax is creative, but I think are fighting a losing battle."
good,"Good company to work for, takes care of its employees. Nothing negative to say about OD"
good,"it was a good part time job .laid back environment,managers were nice,job advanement"
good,Working at this job was a great experience. My favorite part about the job was the people that I worked with. My team of co-workers were a great group of people.
good,Fun and challenging working with customers on delivery issues each day.
good,Large IT staff at the time with a large number of consultants
good,"A typical day would be helping customers find what they needed then ringing up their purchases. I also balanced the safe at night, balanced all the drawers and made the drawers for the next day. I learned a lot about accounting. My main manager was not an easy person to go to, she was not a very caring person, I had one sub-manager that I could go to for help and who I continue to be friends with today. Hardest part of the job would be learning about all the technology items and office supplies. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the accounting end of things."
good,"I enjoyed the people i worked with became really close to them really fast. I like useing my creative side there when it came to coming up with business cards, flyers, posters,cd covers, etc. I like working with the public and getting to know them."
good,I really enjoyed it. The only reason I left is because of the money.
good,"Entry level position that consisted of cold calling, business to business, foot canvasing. Good opportunity for out of college. Had a lot of competition."

good,An enjoyable place to work with great team members and multiple learning vessels.
good,The company's focus is to deliver exceptional customer service.
good,"Mornings start with filling department holes then customer centered service from 12p to 4p. Closing shifts involve customer service, department projects and store recovery for next sale day."
good,I would begin the day by stocking the shelves with product that was received the day before. Then once the freight had been worked and put away I would start to process the returns from the day before. Anything that was able to be shipped back to the vendor was packaged and returned. I learned how to operate and maintain a forklift aswell as receive in the product when the manager was out. Management and the other co-workers were very helpful.
good,"I loved the job, but the pay was god awful. Working 35+ hours a week, I was pulling in paycheck barely touching 150 bucks every two weeks. Cost me more to drive out there every day than I was making. And businesses like Office Depot/Office Max/Circuit City/Best Buy are wondering why they are going out of business and can't keep good employees."
good,I enjoyed my time at Office Depot it was a nice environment and had it's great experiences. I had a lot to learn about the computer and electronics as well as the copy center. I met some really great people and some good supervisors.
good,"I learned about retail, inventory management and supplier management, good place to learn."
good,"My typical day at work includes: sign in; greeting customer with curtesy and respect; answer telephone. I have learned different job assignments. Managing customer special orders do enjoy interacting with my fellow empoyees.I have not found a ""hardest"" part of my job. Working with all cultures and languages is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Verify and prepare bank deposits, prepare tills and provide change for cashier associates as needed, daily data entry of delivery orders and research if necessary restock general sales floor, retrieve high ticket items from locked storage"
good,"If you don't like being told ""no"" you might want to find somewhere else to work. You are told ""no"" a lot, but the good thing is that eventually you get that one ""yes"" and the rest follow suit."
good,Great plans and hopefully a great future. Been here for a few years and I must say OfficeMax has impressed me thusfar!~
good,"A typical day for me in the office is going through my emails first thing in the morning so I can prioritize my day. I am usually busy working with vendors on product maintenance such as invoices, new items, item mainenance, vendor agreement updates, cost and retail changes, online set ups or issues. I also work heavily with advertising due to our preprint ads and online email blasts. I also work with the contract side of the business and I'm responsible for our catalog maintenance. I assist my buyer on all levels of business from product selection, pricing strategies and store executions such as planogram changes and seasonal only products to how it is advertised on TV and in our weekly ads. I started off working for the pricing department for OfficeMax so I understand all angles of the business and why quality and efficency is so important. Management at OfficeMax is forever changing which means policies and procedures are forever changing and it sometimes complicates how we work but we work through it. Working for a major retail supply chain means you have to be flexible, punctual and very detailed. No time for complaints! My co-workers are all over worked and stressed so I try to bring fun to the office. I am the leader of our fun committee and I plan quarterly events and holiday charity events to try to boost the moral around the office. I personally believe a happy worker works happy. The hardest part about my job is that I am overwhelmed sometimes and it does become stressful. I just have to make sure I prioritize my workload accordingly. The most enjoyable part about"
good,"helpful coworkers, not very exciting or fast paced. this is the kind of job that you spend alot of time watching the clock until you can go home."
good,greeted customers collected payments for merchandise...........
good,-New challenges every day and every moment
good,a good begging job to get your feet wet in the working world. a potential to work with new and great people and a good experiance with customers in a nice work enviorment
good,Your really a robot with little flexability. retail changes everyday and the company has you work their way or the highway.
good,"i dont like the job, too far from my house. the co workers are nice and pretty cool."
good,It was great working in the cash office balancing the vault and processing the floats for the cashiers and the drivers.
good,production warehouse so no set schedule
good,Training there could have been a little better and more organized but other than that working there was great.
good,"A typical day at work consists of multiple customer service issues that have to be resolved, as well as overseeing the tasks of associates and the culture of the business. My co-workers respect me as a manager and my decisions concerning customer service and issues of running the business. The hardest part of the job is driving sales; pushing my associates to meet sales goals set by the company."
good,"When I come in, I fax the paper with the orders listed to the warehouse and receive fax from the warehouse. I call customers to let them know about our great specials. I call to place orders for customers, sell customers office supplies, help customers on the sales floor, charge customers for the office supplies, I perform the paper work accountability when closing and organize and clean the store."
good,"Unfortunately, the company chose to close my store, but I enjoyed my experience there. My store mgr was tough and demanding, but fair - and the people I worked with helped to make the experience a good one."
good,My day would consist of checking if any shipments came in and unload them. Once I was done with that I would assist the customers in looking for a particular product. Some of the coworkers were outgoing and others usually kept to themselves. Unloading the freight off the truck probably was the hardest part.
good,I have been with this company for a long time and its hard to move up.
good,Office Depot is a great company to work for if your trying to get a job. The benefits aren't great though. If you show your a hard worker and that you care about your job then advancement isn't a problem.
good,"I learned alot while working here, but after 10 years, they like to see you move on."
good,not too bad but it was just for me to get a job after graduating basic training. I had applied for one of their jobs but they had offered me another job with higher pay and i accepted.
good,"The general manager is a really good person who has been in the sales industry for decades and can pass on that experience to others. The hardest part of the job is often working with the customers, as is true of any retail job."
good,Not much to say really its just another 3rd shift warehouse job.  The last Trailer almost always come late and is usually the fullest. Pay is high for a warehouse but its still about a dollar low for the amount of work.  High school style drama and lazy incompitent people like any other warehouse job. The crew lead was cool but hr and upper management are idiots. Healthcare is expensive. ccomprehensive
good,Good management they do care about everyone there. Retail is retail it can be difficult but you'll have people to ask questions. You need to be adaptable because things will turn on a dime you don't get a set schedule. Co-workers are the better part of working there everyone is very nice. I recommend applying its a decent place to work.
good,"La gerencia esta sobre el trabajador en cuanto a las actividades a realizar, cuando las actividades son simples yrepetitivas."
good,I had some good days and some bad days. the manager I got would blame all the coworkers for something the manager didnt do and take it out on other managers as well. also the manager would threaten to write you up for not getting your percentage up or people signed up for rewards. Managers need to be organized and get their stuff done.
good,"Organization started as OfficeMax and merged with Office Depot, Inc. Job responsibilities and territories were ever changing which contributed to a unstable employment outlook."
good,"Productive and fun place Would recommend that there are good people to work."
good,"The most fun part about working at my Office Depot location is the type of Co-Workers and Managers I have. They're all well meaning and knowledgeable people, My managers helped me out greatly with learning what I need to do and how to do it best. Typically I spend the days on the sales floor assisting customers with different items, whether it be tech related or office supply related.I think the hardest part of the job would have to be the occasional rude customer, but that's not a hard thing to deal with when you have a kind attitude."
good,A lot of manual labor. It consist of a lot of multitasking. It consist of a lot of teamwork. You have to sometimes do things that are only meant for upper management to do such as conference calls etc
good,"I started out as a part time cashier and advanced to become a full time employee as Senior Sales Consultant for Furniture. I survived 5 managers and with the last one I was later placed back as a cashier when I had my own department to care for. I was given one hour for the department twice a month to care for it  ."
good,The turn over  rate for this company is extremely high due to the under pay for the responsibilities one has to take on. Also its never enough staff on board. The company is slowly losing business
good,"It’s an okay environment to work it. Store is very slow and boring but the print center is very face paced. The pay is okay. Thats it, that’s the review."
good,"Whether you are in the copy and print center, tech, registers, or working the floor, it is almost certain that you are severely underpaid. For the amount of work ODOM employee do (especially in an understaffed store), the pay might as well be slave wages (it's minimum wage with no chance for increase unless you promote). You can get ""bonuses"" and such through district-wide activities and tech sign-ups, but that doesn't include the things you have to do day-to-day. It can get pretty stressful, which is why it helps to have a great team by your side."
good,"30 plus years with Grand and Toy, it was a great training ground for sales as well as Management and Branch manager duties. They have had many changes over the years, however they are struggling to find a solid path and competitive offering. The staff were great to work with especially considering the weak and or struggling culture. I enjoyed coaching and developing the staff to ensure they have success in their careers, as well as add value to the organization."
good,Trying to change and adapt to emerging market conditions.  Declining sales environment with minimal payroll/hours to staff store.  Customer service is stressed but old school approach and borderline harassment tactics are utilized to enhance sales culture.
good,The company has abandoned any culture it had and is directionless.  They stupped promoting from within and applicants from outside of the company have a better chance at management level positions.
good,"Most people like working at Office Depot, but my manager had issues with me and treated me unfairly so I had to leave. "
good,The pay is decent for starting but not enough once you hit management. The work environment can also be incredibly stressful as stores are almost always understaffed.
good,Having been employed there for 6 years I can honestly say that it wasn't a bad place to work at. The building whoever is not temperature controlled so be ready for cold temps in winter and hot dry air in the summer. Company is good about buying food for its employees at  least once a month.
good,"I am currently an employee and I can honestly say that my experience is somewhat high and low. When I first started there I was ecstatic and eager to get my tasks done, but recently my outlook has changed. One thing i've noticed is that management seems to ""favorite"" employees from time to time."
good,"Like to surrounded by younger generation people and serve different people from all walks of life and get to know something about them."
good,It's a great work environment but they offer very little benefits and they do not promote from within. Everything falls onto the store managers if they dont reach their sales numbers they are removed.
good,Always being very active with my customers and there jobs that need to be done on a timely manner. There great with working with your personal life and work schedule
good,"Some work is challenging, some work is somewhat dated.  They are modernizing architecture, but testing methodology is archaic. A lot of shifting gears with changing priorities. Good balance for work/life"
good,"Beaucoup d'avantages que ce soit une bonne mutuelle, les primes, les tickets resto et la relation avec des clients pros."
good,"I worked my way up from a part time associate in the print department to the Supervisor in 4 years. from 2008 to 2018 I ran the Print Center and was responsible for it and training associates to handle the day to day operations as needed when I wasn't there. When I would come in daily I would see the previous nights notes on what customer jobs (design or printing) needed finished. In my time there I learned how to bind (coil or comb), create stamps, order supplies for the Xerox machines, ship packages for FedEx using a kiosk supplied by them. I handled large print job orders as well as designed menus, business cards, flyers, invitations, programs for events and funerals. The hardest part of the job was dealing with associates unwilling to learn how to do something new and customers who weren't willing to listen to reason and treat me with respect. Stress was another big issue. While i cross trained many people in the store to help when they were slow, it was not designed to have to pull them off the floor. I was the only one running the Print Center. If I did not have help by pulling people off the floor the Print Center would have fallen apart. 1 person working in the busiest part of the store is not a good business design practice. Getting to know fellow associates who had the same drive to do great work was enjoyable."
good,Office Depot is a nice place to work.i rarely had a bad day.i felt appreciation for my manager and co workers.i works there for three years and had a nice experience
good,"Office Depot, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODP) is a leading B2B integrated distribution company providing business services and supplies, products and technology solutions through its fully integrated omni-channel platform of approximately 1,350 stores, online presence, and dedicated sales professionals and technicians to small, medium and enterprise businesses. Through its banner brands Office Depot®, OfficeMax®, CompuCom® and Grand&Toy®, the company offers its customers the tools and resources they need to focus on their passion of starting, growing and running their business."
good,"Office Depot is an office supplies chain that is trying to shift into business to a business metric. It is an okay job with okay hours but not that good of pay, especially if you work in the mornings where everything is just super hectic, too many customers with very few employees. Dress code is moderate, you can wear jeans and black shoes with a belt, and the shirt is really comfortable. If you are a cashier you'll be under the most stress because you have to push for protection plans for everything that qualifies, rewards programs, ink subs, 2 for $12 paper and stamps. If you are in the print department, the stress levels go overboard, you are asked to be a graphic designer with an hourly pay of $9, it is the most profitable place in the store aside from tech services, however you will demand to do a lot, meet unreasonable deadlines, and very cocky and demanding people. It is not our fault you've had 2 weeks to print these 20000 pages report and want us to do it in 2 hours."
good,"Office Depot work day was fast pace and enjoyable, Talking to vendors and giving good customer service was the highlight of my job.The company  provides  different  training program to help you develop and be more productive."
good,"Good company fun company but, some times to much stuff to dealwith. I was there for 12 years , it was cool but to earn a full-time job you need to earn it , and that's something that's no one in OfficeMax like it."
good,"Typical work day is normal for any place. The company though does not allow over time at all without getting in trouble. Also no holiday pay at all even though we don't make enough money to keep the store open on the holidays. I loved working with my managers and everyone at those stores, but there is not enough benefits or pay given to allow a person to live off of working at Office Depot. Its stupid."
good,This was a fun company to work for. I had to learn a lot about all types of technology while maintaining everyday store standards. We had many types of customers from the tech savvy to the school parents to the organizations that needed copies. Hiring was a challenge due to the area we were in and their level of experience.
good,"Everything here is a revolving door. HIgh turnover, I wasn't sure why at first, but the customers in the in the area are rude and unappreciative. Management always had something to say, but didn't help out as much as they could. High numbers were expected in a slow store."
good,Learned a lot of customer service and caring people. Learned how to use different tools/ technology and learned how to become a much fast worker than before
good,Internationale contacten met mijn binnen en buiten collegae.
good,"I had a depressive moment within the company. The management structure is quite stifling, however it was not a terrible work place. The company culture is very subservient to the customer and their wants. Which at times was saddening because no matter how they treated us employees, we would bend to their will."
good,"At the  Copy and Print Center at Office Depot we opened at 7:00 am and customers were already making a line to make copies , order letterheads or simply reproduce pamphlets. Working at a fast pace quick decision making was the key for success. My job was to accurately process customers orders, call them when the item had arrived and make sure the quality of work was perfect. In a team of four people we managed to succeed with a loyal customer base that we created in the ten years that I spent working  for the company."
good,The day I started was also the day I found out the store location was closing no managers told me it was a temporary position . The pay seemed alright at the time but not enough to live off of
good,"In the beginning, Office Depot was a great work environment. As time went on, they wouldn't work with my schedule as in the beginning. The management didn't treat workers very fairly."
good,"The job gave a ton of hours. The pay wasn’t bad either. "
good,Basic retail position.  Store Manager had OCD and was a micromanager that preferred to step in and complete a task instead of training the employee on how to do it ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
good,"Working at Office Depot was not a bad experience in all honesty. It was easy, smooth work days,and management was not that bad. It did change often, however. The manager that hired me was relocated, the assistant managers switched a few times. The coworkers were nice and easy to work with as well. The days weren't too long and it was either an easy day, or a rushed day with no room for a break. hardly any super slow days."
good,Not enough working hours & was given a different job than applied for. Couldn't maintain enough money due to lack of working hours to maintain a reasonable standard of living.
good,Associates are pushed to sell services and ink subscriptions to customers when they come in for anything when the customers don't even want it or it's not the best deal for them.
good,Focuses too much on subscriptions and new services and not enough on Employee Staffing  and store needs. Making sure that stores have what they need in order to make to the store success. no matter how many new subscriptions and services you come out with if the stores are not staffed and paid properly then you're always going to run into bad service.
good,"Standard Retail enviornment. Copy center is seen as a profit center, but with the lack of training and no ablitity to staff with exprierenced employees due to low budgets for wages, there is more waste than profit."
good,"When I started with the company, business was great and the work environment was enjoyable. A series of changes at the very top of company management (CEO, President etc.) led to a downturn in sales, a severe drop in the stock price, and numerous changes that didn't work very well and didn't last very long."
good,"OfficeDepot is a fun place to work, gives you opportunities for advancement. If you become a store manager you get under preforming store and no help."
good,"A typical day at work consists of walking the floor and helping customers. Also, cleaning restrooms and taking out trash. Management was great and very flexible with my schedule. The hardest part of the job was staying on top of customer recruits for Office Depot cards. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment."
good,The environment is comfortable and everyone is there to help. Managers are encouraging and supportive. There are a lot of incentives that Office Depot/ Office Max offer to their employees.
good,"Primero entre como cajero vendedor en piso de venta ,luego me dieron la oportunidad como impresor, poco tiempo después me dieron la oportunidad de una supervisión donde continue 2 años más"
good,Ok place to work if you live close to warehouse not much money to make at first would have to be there for years to see real income and company and hours are on the decline from observations
good,"This was my first job, didn't expect much customers here were very rude, the managment took care of you employees kinda felt like a high school group."
good,Trés bonne ambiance au sein du plateau mais qui malheureusement ne fait pas tout
good,"There was a lot of work but it was consistent. Management didnt really care for contractors though, unless you were a good worker of course. There was always something to do especially if you had the background I did and can do most of the jobs there. It was never boring. The management there was no good though. It was a bit of a mess in that regard."
good,"Fast paced work environment with great benefits, but the pay was definitely inadequate.  I not sure everyone would working in this type of operation, but the benefits shine through......"
good,"Culture was good, but pay was not enough to cover cost of living.  Benefits were better, but still lacked substance.  Friendly co-workers and monthly team and department luncheons."
good,"With the advancement in technology and how easy it is to access anything and ship anything form online, Office Depot stores are taking a big hit in sales and this has led to a decrease in production.  Several stores have shut down and many managers have left the company.  The company is very focused on growth that they sometimes forget that their average employee may very well be working their first job.  The stores have a great culture and the relationships between the employees is great but the corporate culture is mainly focused on making money.  The hardest part of the job is trying to reach goals that corporate has set for you.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexible hours and the store culture."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of starting your day responding and reviewing emails. Then the store manager would conduct routine store walks to identify opportunities for the store. He would then translate that into work lists that would be dispersed to the team.  After that that their were daily operational procedures that needed to be evaluated before the store opened. Prior to opening we would conduct daily meetings and give sales goals to the associates. Once the store was opened we were fully engaged in customer service. The workplace culture seemed to be very inviting before the merger of Office Depot. Things began to change and as a result of the merger many stores closed. This left a huge uncertainty in job security, which prompted me to leave. When I was the their the payroll structure was very hard to manage especially during peak season."
good,I enjoyed working at Office Depot greatly and stayed only due to the wonderful people I worked with and the customers I got to know while working there. The salary was too low for my standards and the store manager could be better.
good,Help teach you the business world aspect of life. help business advertise there company with business cards or banners with the company logo. plus it is a fast pace work environment.
good,"Working here as part time while attending school was a bit challenging. Even though through the week i would only work 3 and a half hours a day, I received most of my earms from working all day Saturday and/or Sunday. This job was a great start for me."
good,There is no consistency for how layoffs were handled.  too many great people were let go and many that just hid or avoided work made it through all layoffs
good,Assist customer's with placing on line orders. Assist field representatives with setting up potential accounts. Back round check using Lexus Nexus and Better Business Bureau.
good,A typical day at work would be just going through out the store to make sure everything is in order. I learned on how to approach customers the right way and and how to make sales by knowing on what I’m informing the customer about. Management was descent they really wouldn’t care as much as us sales consultants did about the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you brought customers smiles because they liked what you sold to them.
good,Its retail and its a corporation so it sometimes forgets about there worker but that any job depending on how big the corporation is. Overall it has it good and bad moments
good,Work flow can varies from time to time. I learned how to used an RF gun device that help locates items and creates sells tags. Managements are great they helps you every times you need help. They are easy to talked to.I enjoyed working there.
good,"Coworkers are great and try to help out as often as possible but Copy and Print can often get really bad, really fast. Customers are rude and often ask you to do that that is not allowed."
good,The workplace culture was diverse and it wasn't the hardest job and also wasn't the easiest. A typical day at work consisted of me for the most part being independent and helping people with what they wanted.
good,"As a sales person, you want to get paid for what you sell.  Office Depot does not compensate well.  Salaries are low and spiffs are down right insulting."
good,"Mi experiencia en esa esa empresa su estupenda"
good,The customers are really the most difficult part. Sure officemax can print your childs baby pictures but they are not a photo department. Glass scanners can only get such a good quality. Customers will fight you tooth and nail to do better and better but officemax is no high end print company. On that topic you should know. Printing is EXPENSIVE. Ink is an oil byproduct and I've seen full grown adults throw temper tantrums over a 12$ job cost.
good,"Office Depot Office Max was a great place to work and advance career. During my recent tenure we merged with Office Max and endured a pending acquisition from Staples which led to managing  through a stressful and ambiguous period."
good,"Aprendes la disciplina del trabajo, sin embargo a pesar de valorar mucho al personal muchos chicos buenos en nivel jefatura se salieron porque no podían crecer por escolaridad y no se considero su resultado, bastante bueno por cierto"
good,"Was a great place to learn about all the new tech that was out at the time. "
good,"Most of the management staff was great, but there were a select few who were not. Sometimes the workplace was very clique-y and there were groups of people who disliked each other. But other than that, the work was engaging, not overly difficult and the customers were usually always great."
good,"I learned a lot from this place. Would recommend this for a first retail job candidate. You were expected to learn a lot. It sets a good foundation for someone who wants a taste of a lot of different objectives. They want you to be present good customer service, as well as working cashier, and doing stock."
good,There is always something to do and and something new to learn. Management encourages growth and provides great support to employees looking to advance within the company.
good,"Trabajar ahí fue bueno, pero siempre hay gente que te quiere ver mal y busca la manera de fregarte la vida causando chismes y cosas así, pero en fin, ahí conocí a la que será mi esposa en unos cuantos meses más, así que agradezco haber trabajado ahí."
good,"The job is nice. Theres always a task to do and you're never bored. The management team is flexible and worked with me while going to school. But, there is little room for advancement or raises."
good,"i would make sure my area was stocked and ready for my shift, and begin working on the list of side work. in spare time i would shadow different departments to learn new things."
good,The job is in an easy job. You have to maintain sells and hit pvp sales and sign ups. It can get competitive at times to make sure you sell alot of protection plans and mcafee.
good,"Very Stressful environment to work in, there was no since of team coroperation or since of urgency in dealing with customer issues. Learned what I didn't want to do as a manager by the way I was dealt with."
good,"The one thing I loved about working at Office Depot were the people I reported to. The Managers who I reported directly to were some of the best I have ever worked with in my career. Unfortunately, they are gone, so not sure how much that has changed."
good,"During my time at Office Depot/Max, I enjoyed the work at the print center of getting something new every day and being able to create projects for people on a daily basis. The down side is that the print center is severely underappreciated and it is very tough to work at the print center because management does not work with the associates to help make things easier at the print center. The store relies on leadership but it heavily lacks in it."
good,On a typical day we make sure each customer is helped accordingly while still finding ways to have fun. I've learned many things on how to sell items.
good,"It was a nice work place and great people. Kind of slow. I would usually sit and work on projects which was nice. Quite nice management, low pay though"
good,Very busy work environment. Growth opportunity is there with hard work. There is plenty of training at the company. I do wish that since the stores sell the latest in new technology that they update the store wifi networks and print department equipment on a more timely manner.
good,Worked at OfficeMax while attending college. They were always willing to find a way around my class times and ensure that I had enough hours to pay my bills
good,"Big corporation. I was just a number here. I liked the job. Everybody uses office supplies. That made it easy to make sales calls. We were allowed to call on ALL businesses, no matter whaty size"
good,It's alot to learn you can get experience in any area of the store if you have the interest. Advancements come if your flexible with hours not having any set days or times you can't work and you have a good knowledge of different parts of the store.  Management changes and team members change often. Stores close often  so positions go away too sometimes but the store runs typically with 5 people or less a shift so it gets hectic.
good,When I worked there it was Office Max so things I am sure are different now. It was a great place for a student and hours were flexible and I  had the opportunity to move up twice while I was there. I left when we got a new store manager
good,"The local store team was kind and supportive, while corporate showed little loyalty to its longest standing employees. The managers and fellow employee had a great team atmosphere despite the stressful retail environment. However Office Depot OfficeMax was rotating door of laying off senior management and training/hiring junior managers fresh out of college."
good,I worked in the business department but they really ran it like their retail business.  Compared to my other jobs very little time off and few holidays.
good,"Worked here for quite some time. You definitely have a job you can go to everyday....and all the hours you want. When a new system starts to get under control, then another one comes around. Very difficult to get stable with a constant changing procedures."
good,The managers I worked with are very professional and hard-working. The pay is below average and raises are very low.  When I was transferred with my full time job I had to quit and I was not paid for my 30 plus hours of vacation pay.
good,"I feel like I would  leave more of a review when I no longer work for the company. A typical day at work is working alone, with a line of customers constantly at the counter. Customers often leave upset because due to the flow of customers, we can't do their order right away."
good,"Learned a lot about team building, motivating others, and laying out a daily work plan and executing it. Hardest part, having to retrain because of turnover rate."
good,"In 4 1/2 years at Office Depot I experienced many changes. I started as an Office ""Max"" employee and experienced the merger with Office Depot. In my time with the companies one thing remained consistent. Changes made were made without consulting the people who were actually capable and currently doing the job. Management showed little interest in the day to day challenges faced by the workforce."
good,This was a very busy location in probably the most culturally diverse areas in the U.S. (I started with Office Depot in a rural Texas town called Marble Falls before transferring to Houston in 2013). There was good teamwork and camaraderie among the employees that helped us get through many difficult situations.
good,"Walking in blind to work, you never know how much work is their, start hours constantly change, management doesnt know the operation', volume changes day to day."
good,"Good job, managment needs more communication between them. Driver dismissals can be made more quick to avoid traffic. Overall comea to mis-communication between managment."
good,Overall the company is fast paced and competitive. This is great place to start working whether it is your first job or looking for better skills. Overall the culture of the company is laid back and there is opportunity to grow as long as you stick around long enough. The hardest part of the job is finding a good work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyday will provide a new obstacle or challenge to overcome.
good,"Flexible hours and easy training. This was perfect for my college schedule. If you want a part-time job, while in school, this is for you. Descent commission if you work on sales floor as well."
good,Es una buena empresa solo que el salario es bajo..
good,"Office Depot has been an enjoyable place to work, in which I have learned a lot and met great people, some which I call my friends."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and fast paced but for my department it can get a little difficult since only one person works per shift for the print center. I learned how to adjust to different situations and multitask better. I also learned how to make posters, banners, business cards, invitations, etc. Most of the management team is good. The hardest part of the job was just trying to keep each customer happy while waiting in the long line to be helped and also lifting heavy equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the connections that you make with customers."
good,the work is fast during back to school sales and back to business. You work will work long hours during those times but during march- mid July it is very slow and don't get full 8 hours
good,"Works around your schedule (i.e. other jobs or school). Very laid back and easy going environment. If you're looking to move up or even get full-time in the company, an opportunity to do so is rare."
good,Multitasking abilities are thoroughly tested and strengthened over time... You have to be careful not to get burnt out from the stress of it all. If you have a good manager the job will be just fine.
good,Working for this company was the equivalent of having a migraine on a daily basis. There is limited communication from the corporate office to the stores. The expectations for management and their staff are unattainable. There is little assistance from district managers and above to resolve issues or provide training.
good,"Although working in customer service for the first time was tough, coworkers and the working environment made everything easier. I had support of everyone to keep learning."
good,"I was a part time employee, I worked in the copy department. The training was good and enjoyable. We had meetings in the morning before  store opened and a breakfast was always served."
good,Working in the retail store was a great place to work during college. Working on computers and smartphones was fun because it gave me skills that I didn't have before the job.
good,"Fue un ambiente trabajo regular no aprendí mucho, solo reafirme el conocimiento que tenia en cuanto a piso de ventas."
good,"The location I was working at was very slow during the night shifts I worked. However, there was hardly ever an appropriete amount of staff to get out in a timely fashion, especially on weekends, which meant that on Fridays and Saturdays we always ended up working over time, in addition to a lack of prioritization. This lack of organization was the hardest part of working the job. Overall, I did enjoy the company of my coworkers and I learned patience and the importance of innovation."
good,Working at Office max helped me develop great customer service skills. It also allowed me to work with great individuals as well as learn how to stock and put out new merchandise
good,"Working for Office Depot was a very great experience, giving me more understanding on product knowledge about electronics. Great team members great management, always willing to help an giving great understanding on in-store products."
good,"If you are able to put up with many customers on a VERY strict payroll budget, then OD can definitely be a great career option. "
good,"Desde el primer día fue agradable, todo el personal te da la bienvenida de buena manera , en momentos de dificultad como el manejo de equipos de trabajo ayudan sin ningún problema aun así cuando me costo un poco de recordar los pasos, los auxiliares como el gerente me ayudaban de buena manera y explicaban cuando fuera necesario , el equipo de trabajo era un poco escaso pero cuando se hacia se trabajaba de manera eficiente y se cumplían los objetivos , la relación con gerencia fue buena escuchaban los problemas y las cosas que proponías para mejorar el trabajo lo tomaban en cuenta fue muy buen lugar de trabajo por lo cual aprendí muchas cosas como el trabajo en equipo, el saber relacionar con clientes y personal, formar estrategias de ventas , y solucionar problemas para que nadie salga perjudicado , así como la dificultad de aprender en lagunas áreas donde se concentraba mucha gente y el personal no te apoyaba mucho, fue un lugar alegre."
good,I wish the company was not so frugal. They do not value their employees. They genuinely do not care about customers and are only concerned with making money. Management could be better but the only good thing that I will say is that there is always fun coworkers to work with
good,Retail is retail.  I deal with customers every day.  I learned a lot about respect that is for sure.  I enjoy the people I work with and for however there is a huge separation between corporate and the store level.
good,Inside of the short period of time at OfficeMax I went from a part-time associate to the operations manager overseeing the revenue of the store and security of inventory as well as maintaining sales production matrix. My abrupt departure was brought on by a short term health issue coupled with the store’s location closing.
good,"Okay place to work, pay was sub par. Main thing that kept me there was the managers and my co-workers. Work itself was repetitious working in the print center. Customers are either overly rude or overly polite."
good,These are all great places to work; I wish they were all still in business.  Each company has either been sold or has gone through bankruptcy and no longer exists...
good,El trabajo es bueno desgraciadamente el tiempo que nos obligan a permanecer es normalmente muy excesivo.
good,Started working Office Max after a previous workplace closed down and was glad that I had the chance to work with a team of talented individuals who were kind and always happy to help.
good,"Co-workers are excellent people they will help you when you are struggling. However, management is very poor and there is no communication."
good,Was a nice full time position while i was in college. Worked around my school schedule and gave me as many hours as i needed. Liked working freight and stocking shelves.
good,"Typical day of work was floor sales, mostly in technology and/ or supplies. Though technology is a mainstay of my knowledge and interest, it did not delve deeply enough to truly engage my abilities. Focus was on getting to know the customers and selling products and/ or services related to their needs."
good,I have enjoyed my time working for Office Depot the management is great and I have a great work life balance. The problem is there is very limited movement though the company and the pay isn't good.
good,You should'nt make us review jobs that we had around 18 years ago.  Its not fair to judge companies in my opinion that long ago.  I know the food and atmosphere is the best qualities as a patron.
good,I worked as an admin specialist. I trained all new employees. I managed all new and existing accounts/data entry. Later I was promoted to Customer Service Lead. A typical day would be to enter orders in the system for dedicated accounts as well as phone and fax orders. You were strongly advised to have a certain amount of orders completed daily. Credits and returns were entered as well.
good,Se trabaja en equipo para alcanzar metas fijadas en un buen ambiente de trabajo y compañerismo
good,Like the job but not the hours work late till 3 a.m but overall it's a good place to work at. Long time standing on you feet. And you have to be fast with this job.
good,"The hardest part of the job is definitely back to school season, it is a very fast paced and stressful time. I have learned a lot about customer satisfaction and leading a team dedicated to helping customers."
good,Good part-time job.  Very flexible on hours if you are a student.  All training is done from videos that you need to try and find time to view.
good,"Management is very caring, understanding and open. Every store is in sync and have weekly conference calls to ensure the company will continue to run smoothly. Compensation is very un encouraging. Definitely do not get paid what you are worth. They expect a lot but pay very little. If it was not for company standards I may of already left. They provide a wonderful work environment however."
good,"Busca equilibrio de vida, trata de dar oportunidades por igual."
good,"This company is not doing well over all. I learned a lot in the different roles I have worked, but it will not last. Ever since the two companies merged, more and more demands have been placed on associates and store level management while payroll gets continuously cut. More locations are getting closed, while the remaining stores are not receiving any help from corporate to handle the massively increased workload. Is the company a great place to learn? Yeah, not a bad place to get going in retail. They don't place a degree over experience, which is a big plus. Overall, not the worst place to work, but definitely not the place for me anymore."
good,A average day at work was productive and fast paced. I learned new skills that i didn't previously know. Management was fair and i had a great relationship with the management team. The hardest part of the job may have been lifting very heavy packages. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay that i was able to receive to help feed me and my family.
good,you learn a lot of new the to do in retail far as customer service find the product for the customer and put a smile on there face a over all nice place to work
good,I liked the fact  that it is a learning company. The pay should have been better you did not get a raise un less you advanced. The people were ok. management did not live the core values
good,The merger with office max was the worst desicion.  Disappointment with last minutes decision for people without good criteria of knowledge making wrong decisions
good,"Okay place to work, the pay could be better for the amount of work you have to do. More fair scheduling would have been good."
good,I found it very comfortable to work in the people were very friendly. I enjoyed working there and meeting new people. And a good atmosphere and not to much of a fast paste just right.
good,"Office Depot/OfficeMax allowed me to work from home, which was big help with work life balance. The management has turned over a lot since the merger and it is still in the early stages of transition."
good,"Haben sich stets für ihre Mitarbeiter eingesetzt."
good,"It is a nice environment, the customer are annoying at times. If you keep up with all the new updates then everything should run smoothly."
good,"not bad for a first job, wouldn't recommend anyone to stick around much after that. benefits are okay, I got a couple weeks vacation."
good,"Typical Day at work involves getting freight done. In the Logistics Team, we have to sort out the inventory for the delivery and stock up on merchandise. Always on the move and never a dull moment. Learned a lot of new skills like how to do mobile transaction, place order for customers online, and occasionally man the register. Fellow Associates are more than willing to lend a helping hand if you ever need one. Work involves a lot of lifting items for restocking but overall time fly by so quickly when you are always busy."
good,"unloading and checking freight in a busy warehouse , working quickly accurately and safely as part of a small team on the goods inward .side"
good,ok prices but a lack of interest in what needs to be done. sell sell sell but dont put new products out so we can sell the new stuff instead of the out of stock instore stuff
good,"I enjoyed working on the telecom team. I met some really talented people who cared about our customers, both internal and external."
good,"Stocking is great at first but then the goal time gets shorter and shorter."
good,if you have the right management team this will be a fun job with lots of competitions to try to keep every one on sales goals. if you don't like nights weekends or holidays this is not the place for you.
good,"Management overall is very nice, helpful, and competent. My most enjoyable part of the job is fixing computers because that's what I want to do as a career. I learned how to conduct myself professional by observing management."
good,"Great place to work. Training was easy and it offered sales and customers service exeperice at entry level. I was able to learn about computers and all office needs for the consumer such as computer software, printing, copying and help with their web desires and also it gave me the exeperice for sutomer service."
good,"Difficult transition period for the once proud retail organization.  In the last five years or so, Office Depot has changed senior management and operating models on three occasions, which makes it difficult to operate with consistency."
good,"My typical day at work involves handling customers, producing custom works for customers. Resolving any conflicts, fixing errors that may have happened with other jobs. Completely other unfinished works from co-workers."
good,"Change is the main word to describe working at Office Depot. Change is not always bad or good, it's just change.  Sometimes difficult to move forward because we're trying to figure out what needs to be done."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo era bueno, pero te exigían mucho y había compañeros muy mala onda que no conocen la frase ""trabajo en equipo"". El gerente y el subgerente eran buenas personas, comprensivas, razonables y estrictos y duros cuando tenían que serlo."
good,"The people who work at OfficeMax are generally fantastic and work hard to make their customers happy. That said, everyone working there clearly knows that they don't get paid enough for their work and have little expectation of the situation improving as long as they stay employed there. Corporate ensures that only managers get full-time hours or a living wage, leaving all other employees to struggle to make a living. Hours are constantly cut based on the store's sales, regardless of how many people are actually needed on shift in order to perform duties adequately. "
good,"I loved working for Office Max but unfortunately they decided to reorganize and finally merge with Office Depot. Other than that it was a fun place to work, specially when the new gadgets came out."
good,"They do not really train anyone properly, High turnover rate with unqualified employees. They will throw anyone in that department. I was constantly having to run the department, fix what other employees screwed up, and do the majority of the production work."
good,"This is my first job. It's been great working here, just a very stressful environment. The customers can be a bit rude and difficult to work with, but I've learned to tolerate."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company and enjoyed my coworkers, although at times, some created a stressful environment for me personally.  I am a perfectionist, so at times, I became bothered when things did not meet my standards.  My managers worked around my schedule nicely and I felt I was given enough freedom in that I could ask off for certain days.  I learned a lot from this job, especially how to deal with people that proved difficult, particularly customers.  The best part of the job was the laid back atmosphere and the fact that my managers kind of let me choose what I wanted to work on most times if their were enough employees present.  The hardest part was working in the print center and dealing with demanding customers that wanted their projects done immediately."
good,"The training period was critical.  Managing, coaching and meeting daily goals.  Challenging customers were met with strong and well trained employees."
good,"The work environment was fun, and the managers were awesome. The hardest part of the job was having to fill two positions."
good,"Aprendí a andar en la calle, es decir conocer nuevos lugares "
good,Lots of really good people in a tough spot right now. I have been there for fifteen years and have learned a great deal about Supply Chain.
good,Only really busy during certain times of the year. When not busy your extremely slow. Not much for opportunity for advancement.
good,"worked in Pittsburgh with great group of fleet drivers, management was very supportive and did not get in the way of day to day operations"
good,"New managment made it more difficult to get the job done in a timely manner. "
good,Not a place I would recommend if you are looking to advance your career but it is a great job if you are in an undergrad look for some additional income
good,"dissect ,and file away daily paper work, and set up  employee tasks, and sales goals for the day . putting out registers counting the safe daily. Inventory scan all holes through out the store . Review all damage , and defective merchandise from previous day returns. delegate duties such as planograms, and pull overstock items to fill the floor. Number one priority taking care of the customers."
good,Good place to work but the future is uncertain as Staples is in the process of acquiring Office Depot.  Good work/life balance but that really depends on your manager.
good,Came to work in professional appearance. Always was dependable never absent for work with my employer. Enjoyed greeting customers and to offer any assistance they needed in purchasing office products. Provided a friendly attitude with management  staff and all my co workers. Multi-tasked many things at the same time. Customer service and cashier assistance was the main objective in a successful day at work.
good,"The job is not hard. On second shift you work until the work is completed. End of the shift is 1130, but if the workload goes past that you must stay until the work is done. During the peak season we get a good amount of overtime and during the off season we don't get our 40 hours. Management is OK depending on the mood they are in for the day but mostly they leave you to your work."
good,"es una buena empresa llena de retos y logros en los cuales se tiene que tener y mantener un ritmo constancte de trabajo por las auditorias internas que son estrictas asi como sus politicas."
good,"Grew knowledge in selling products"
good,"When I started at OD almost 3 years ago it was a great place.  But like most places, that really depends on the culture and the people you work with.  But with all the changes with acquiring OMAX and the soon to take place buyout by Staples, the company has forgotten about culture and keeping or creating a great work environment.  It seems that maximizing profit it all that matters, so reduce labor of course, reducing customer service, and in turn traffic.  We all know this is the end of any company using this model to increase assets to make their company seem more lucrative in a potential buyout.  Now with more and more pressure, fear tactics in coaching, and reduced applicants of talented associates, the culture at Office Depot has become stale and soon feel as lonely as an empty store on a Saturday afternoon remembering how it used to be!"
good,The store was an underperformer by company standards. We were in the process of changing that when I left. The manager was eager to get me out of the freight department and out into the customer environment because she was able to recognize my intelligence and ability to interact with customers.
good,Work with customers to assist is streamlining their buying of multiple areas. Responsible for providing high level customer service throughout sale.
good,"the thing I liked about this job is teamwork and everyday learning something new either by employees or customers."
good,"Typical day is clocking in, reviewing the job board and signing in. You head on the sales floor and meet up with a manager about your job duties for the day. Pretty laid back place to work."
good,"Great company to work for until office depot took over."
good,"Checked to see what needed to be done concerning the stores and the corporate office, and made sure everything was taken care.    Co-workers were great.  The best part of my job was the ability to get things done without having to be overseen by my manager."
good,"I loved how you were always busy and there is always something to do. I learned how to do shipping and receiving, digital printing and scanning, finishing, and over size prints. My job covered a huge spectrum in the printing business. The benefits were great and I enjoyed working with my co-workers. Management could be better as I went through two managers."
good,si el gerente esta de buenas el día es bueno si no solo ay reclamos y nada de lo que se hace esta bien
good,"The company is very well organized in some ways and in other ways it is a huge and extremely disorganized bureaucracy.  They have very good career paths and lots of excellent training, but they totally drop the ball when it comes to customer service and the management is clueless."
good,"It is a good place to work"
good,"CVS was my first job when I was in my teens. I learned a great deal in terms of how a retail company operates, Starting as a cashier, promoted to lead cashier then landing a shift supervisor position with the company made my experience truly unforgettable. Helped me understand the structure of a company."
good,Good company to work for.  Work is consistent.  Benefits were not very good.  Management during my time of employment was concerned.
good,"My day is very varied due to working in stock control as we run reports for management internal and to external such as a Q Report showing what and why certain product are not available to pick. I also sort out bulk queries where product come out of locations that should not be there, we also log this information and analyse the data and report back to departments responsible. Sometime l run reports that show  what products is or isn't moving and move to suitable locations. l work in a team of 10 and we all get along and help each other if needed. What I enjoy about my job is dealing with customer queries or doing tours with account managers, customers and other where needed discussing processes within the D.C."
good,"• A typical day includes assisting customers and managing freight"
good,not a bad place to work i worked on the warehouse side. decent pay and overtime management was pretty solid. worked with good people made it a lot better.
good,"Great work, heavy on Logistics and customer sales/service. Planograms and visual merchandising. Went to different stores in the NW for remodels. Location closed after opening a little 2 years after."
good,"This Job was a nice mixture of task oriented projects and customer service. During my time there, the store did a complete sales turnaround thanks to new employees and better management. Most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that each day i made a positive difference with the company and also with the customers.  Hardest part was getting all needed tasks completed while trying to help each and every customer. Was short on staff for last few months working."
good,"As my first time in customer service, I wasn't expecting much. Pay, I had little understanding of. Compensation and benefits were almost non-existent for part time employees. Hours, functional, but difficult if I had other commitments. Location, business central and clientele reflected that. Service, customer based and sale based, focused on getting everyone something in their hand before they left. Co-workers, supportive and willing to swing hours so everyone could have a chance to reach their marks. "
good,"Account management to include pre and post sales for technology projects, as well was maintenance with the account to include finance and shipping requests. The organization is still developing many of the sales platforms and team strategies, so this has created obstacles in individual performance development and leadership communication. Overall a decent place to develop your skillset and experience."
good,"Office Depot is an office supplies retailer specializing in fanatical customer service.  Its staff are friendly and its item selection wide.  The work environment is fun, however, it is not challenging and offers limited room for advancement.  There are many opportunities for the people to enjoy great customer feedback and assistance, however, there are weak incentives for customer sales.  Overall though, this is a good place to work part time for those just starting out."
good,"Dynamic and enterprising executive leader with proven ability to positively impact results. Motivational management style with a successful record of developing and retaining highly successful talent throughout regional and corporate teams. Broad scope of increasing responsibilities that include implementing business development strategies, financial planning, P & L management, and profitable client relationships.  Proven ability to develop a collaborative culture of teamwork, accountability and associate development that yields increased revenues and profits"
good,"Good company to work for, although is going thru hard economic times. Dealing with low operational budgets and keeping a high morale was something that make me a better manager. Their customer service culture is excellent. Dealing with mid-tier management was the hardest part of the job."
good,"As with all retail work, responsibilities at Office Depot mostly focused on stocking the shelves. In the Copy & Print Department I also had teh responsibility of interpereting the customer's orders and providing the fasted and most accurate work I could. Frequent customers would often ask for my help in finishing graphic designs and coming up with new ideas. "
good,"Enjoyed my time with the company. Due to restructuring, job security was an issue."
good,I was enjoying my job because of being successful and moving forward.  Then Office Depot decided to discontinue my position company wide starting 12/15/13.  This goes against my moving forward which contributes to me enjoying working for the company.  I have decided to explore my options because I feel as if I have moved backwards and have been betrayed.
good,working for the company I got a lot of on the job training. not enough job security or advancement
good,"Every day had its own challenges,"
good,A day at work I had to be organized and ready for a workout and a fast thinker.
good,"A typical day of Office Depot is this,"
good,"An ordinary day involved maintaining the stores appearance, and cleanliness. While assisting every customer that would enter the store. As a customer expert my job would involve greeting every customer and directing them their desired area, while at the same time, directing my co-workers to meet each customer and assist them."
good,A Typical Day For Me Started At 5:30 Am With Logistics and Finished With Me Cleaning Storage Area...What I learned From Working Their is Team Work And Orginazation...My Co-Workers were Fun And Helpful...Hardest Part Was Always Correcting Someones Mistake...
good,It is a good job for a person who never worked. I enjoyed meeting new people and liked the people that was working with me at the time.
good,"I worked in the warehouse unloading merchandise for the store, assembled furniture for display, assisted customers with carry-out orders, cashiering, copy center, stocking, I did it all."
good,"As a Department Manager (entry level management), there were a lot of responsibilities that were handed down by upper management that they themselves did not want to do.  For the most part, the staff and customers are friendly and outgoing. "
good,"not much room to move up"
good,"A typical day would involve dealing with repeat customers, who were mostly decent, and having to deal with alot of requests from management. Co-workers were nice and made the day go by quicker. All in all a pleasant place to work, just doesn't have much room for advancement."
good,"Great opportunity to work with high-end clientele on a regular basis, which include administrative assistants, teachers, attorneys, etc., because they're always going to meet their needs of having ample supplies to perform their jobs at the best of their abilities."
good,i learned a lot of things and met a lot of people and ended up liking my boss
good,"I worked for this company for a few years. Everything was great until they started the ISCE program. The management is pretty nice, with a store manager its a hit or miss. I have had some good ones, and some bad ones. Employees are great and everything. They completely changed the health care for part time employees. They dont cover anything thing now. You learn alot about everything."
good,Review project calendar and status on pending changes or review of catalogs. Implement and proof changes and communicate and update all internal departments.Communicate effectively with various individuals and or departments to meet deadlines. Constant re-organization and structure of department with new management leaders made it difficult for advancement.Professional environment but friendly and easy going with my co-workers. To streamline and create effective solutions to communicate and produce results in a timely manner was difficult at time due to so many internal and external input and departments as well. The software system was user friendly and informative to be effective did make my work enjoyable
good,"My over all experience at Office Depot has been great. About two years ago, they allowed jeans Friday every Friday. The only thing is that, I am in IT and the network and server operation have been outsourced, the only internal operations are the endpoint management."
good,I absolutely loved what I did at office depot. A typical day at work consisted of taking care of customers copy and print needs. Maintaining a sufficient time schedule. Keeping things organized and making sure the orders came out of the productions line with no errors. Making the customers happy.
good,stocking and helping customers
good,Good part time work. Great way to learn the ropes of the work environment.
good,Relaxed days except for when you have to do unload the truck.
good,"When I joined this company it was great. Benefits, bonuses, etc. all top notch. Now the campany have gone through several changes during the years especially the past year. With the new CEO they have adapted an ISCE program (In Store Customer Experience). The theory of this program is not bad. Make sure during the peak hours you do nothing but help customers. Problem is Regional Vice Presidents and even District Managers have their own take and try to manupliate it to fit them. There is no consistentcy and Store Managers are still having problems grasping everything about this program."
good,I was recruited to Office Depot Business Services Division as a District Manager.
good,"My work day is jammed packed with supporting existing and incremental customer sales. In the print world every customer print job is a customized transaction. Most of my customers in this region are State, County or local governments. I also have sizeable percentage of large (10k plus white collar workers) business. Through formal sales certification training and hardwork, this job has taught me how be very successful in sales. In 2011 I was in the top 3% in sales and margin in the country and received numerous sales awards. The hardest part of the job was coordinating delivery of printed products using multiple internal organizations and external vendors who aren't as accountable to my customers needs as I am. I met these challenges by communicating clearly and concisely, being honest about our capabilities and delivering on my commitments."
good,"Alot of product's, good access to information for reps and customers. Easy to sell great prices for clients. Good incentive programs for reps."
good,"At first I loved working with Office Depot. I had an ""in"" with the company so I got in as fulltime with a great starting rate (cashier) The benefits sucked & were expensive. They have 3 Customer Service levels which determines your pay & ""rank"" in the store. Level One which is part time, minimum wage. (everyone always gets hired at this. I was just lucky when I got hired) Level Two which is full time & decent pay (this is what i got hired at) & Level Three which is full time & preps you for Department Manager (or so they say). I stay at Level 3 for two years. Only once did I get offered a potential transfer to a store that was not included in the 5 stores I had said I could transfer to. After that I had to get demoted back down to Level Two, all because there wasn't any positions available to me (even though they had brought in two department managers from the outside within the time I was ""training"") Regardless, I pulled my own. I was not only in charge of a million things in the store that had absolutely nothing to do with the front end department (clearance, copy & print department, out of stock items, etc, etc, etc), I could not for the life of me come to work happy. The job was miserable. At first I thought it was the customers that I hated. I soon found out that since I had been with the company for almost four years, the customers were the least of my problems. My raise a year was .14 cents. Yes, you read that right. So after four years I had year to make a dollar raise. My therapy cost me $45 dollars a week because the benefits were through Aetna & that was just a mistake."
good,"As expected for retail, long hours but a little more flexibility here. One will enjoy working here with the right group of people."
good,"Loved my co workers and managers. However, our store was unrightfully closed down and nobody at corporate cared to fight for our store even though it was the most profitable Office Depot in the area. Our district manager made no efforts to transfer any employees."
good,"I throughly enjoyed my time at Office Depot, I had to leave (unfortunately) due to health reasons and school. But the environment, management and overall experience was nothing short of very positive and nice."
good,Supervisors will overload you with work to take the slack off of others and then be upset with you when your tasks and goals are not completed even though you wirk extra hours through lunch
good,"Nice place to work. Not a very busy location, so sometimes you do dumb stuff to keep busy. Management was nice and let me do homework as long as nobody was in the store that needed help and as long as my daily projects were done."
good,I learned something new every day.  Enjoyed my co-workers as well as working with my customers  Developed long lasting relationships with both customers and co-workers   They all helped me grow as a person
good,"Very fun flexible job for part timers. Benefits available for full timers. Pay is not worth the work performed especially for 2nd tier level jobs and management. Job security is high, but turn over is also high due to lack of employee moral. Scheduling issues as well as poor management and inconsistency is usual in my and my associates experience."
good,"Empresa en proceso de digitalización, sistema obsoleto, procesos estructurados que retrasan la óperacion y el servicio al cliente, logística falta definir realmente cual es la nedecidad primordial  a las unidades de negocio, en recursos humanos se triangula demasiada la información el departamento actúa d con poca ética profesional."
good,"Better than minimum wage, but depending on the management team,  can determine your success there.  Just got to know your position and learn your staff members."
good,"Decent culture. Your Ability to grow your career depends on you and which manager you have. Some foster growth, many do not."
good,Good people to work with and a customer service focused mindset. Unfortunately very understaffed for entire year with company both the managers I started with have been fired quit or relocated to other stores. The actual managers them selves were humble and understanding they were loyal to the company but the company and inspired the same in their workers. The low pay and sometimes over 60 hour work weeks due to low staffing especially during sales and holidays lead to burn out from all departments.
good,Office Depot was at a time in my life when I was working two jobs at the same time as going to school. I learned a lot about the general workplace and I learned about how to deal with irrate customers.
good,"suprervisor is horrible comes to work drunk every day talks bad about "
good,"Office Depot happened to be one of the best jobs that I was able to work for. I had to learn quickly how to sell different items and also how to gain confidence when approaching individuals. During the back to school month in July, things normally got stressful as multiple lines were getting backed up on the floor and at the register. I was able to quickly overcome a lot of the stress due to the fact that I have good communications and multi tasking skills."
good,Flexible modern office work environment in a highly competitive market. Corporate directive with defined aggressive revenue and profitability targets in the business of equipment and supplies vertical.
good,"Good Work environment, great employees emphasis on customer service.  does promote from within  great for part time employees going to school and need flexible schedules."
good,Working at Office Depot was a good job to be at. Being there really helped me learn responsibility and learn how to figure things out on my own. This job also helped me realize that being a team player really helps the overall flow of the job.
good,Office Depot was a fun work environment except for the management. The store operated as if anyone could not show up and stay hired on. The discipline for some of the employees was very loose.
good,"I learned how to work on the register, how to better interact with customers, how to sell better, and I learned a lot from other employees and the managers. The management is good. I enjoyed the flexibility with working here. I was able to balance work and family and school life."
good,"As a sales manager, working under the GM, I felt of value to the store and company. "
good,Works around part time schedules. Other than that the work is boring and dull. There is no future advancement whether you work hard or not. Super easy job but you sit around a lot and not allowed to read for school or do anything.
good,Needs improvement  in workplace. I believe it’s just this location. No help. Small staff. Not many people are knowledgeable in their position which shows how desperate we are.
good,The position allows for some autonomy with your book of business. Positions are hired within and referral processes. Set work schedules and no weekends are a plus.
good,"we had a set time to come in, but not a set time off. every night varied, we could be there 8 hours one night, and the other we could be there 12. we would have no knowledge of what time we could get off until 6:30PM. most days we would go in at 11, and not get off until 10 or 11 that night."
good,"inconvénient très physique et poste de nuit."
good,"working at office wasnt a good experience managers were rude and non comprehensive  of matters managers were rude "
good,"Though most days can be pretty slow with customers, the tasks are actually manageable with enough time put in. My only problem can be last-minute customers arriving when closing, though."
good,"A typical day at work includes cleaning, keen customer service and putting a lot thing back in their location. I learn how to communicate with customer as a sales man. The management was new when i was hired so for it being so fresh it was okay. The hardest part of the job which wasn't too much of a problem for me a lot of you managers will tell you to things out of you way. The co-workers were my favorite part of the job."
good,"Office Depot as a whole is a good company, I think I've had really bad experience with certain management. I've worked at three locations and two of them had the same manager. She has a few problems with anger management and it's been hard working for her. You get great money for selling things."
good,They’re an okay company just really giving me a hard time about being rehires after leaving for maternity leave it wasn’t like I was a bad employee so I don’t know what the problem is
good,"In terms of the workplace, it's not that bad because of the associates and the management team. However, due to the overall change that the company is taking, it has made the company less than desirable to work for."
good,You will work 8-12 hours a day depending on the season within the company and sometimes not get a lunch. You'll also get handed extra work that doesn't always go with your job.
good,"If you willing to invest in a lot of hard work, this company will invest in you with day to day hands on training. The hardest part of the job is working through the summer months, its very hot. The employees has a good attitude and they make this company."
good,this place is fun when you first start learning lots of new things. As you get more knowledge you get more hours. running the cash register is simple just follow the screen
good,"Office depot was not a bad job but it doesnt compensate appropriately You work very hard for barely above minimum wage. I loved my team and co workers and the skills I was able to learn. I picked up print soft ware skills, and technology skills as well."
good,"I have been with Office Depot since 2005, since that time things have changed dramatically. I have always enjoyed working here, working remotely for the last 6 years has been a great benefit."
good,"OD is the type of place that provides a variety of areas to plug-in to. It is not just an office supply store or an office furniture store, but it is a computer store and shop as well, along with a copying center. There is a lot the store has to offer.The job duties are fairly the same regardless of the areas worked; keep a positive attitude and a neat and clean work area. Be prepared to assist customers at all times, regardless of whether they are in your assigned area or not, because customer service is essential."
good,the atmosphere and people were overall great plenty of consistent hours the location I was in switched managers too often plenty to keep busy but because of competition from staples and online we were really only busy during back to school.
good,"Learned a lot about employee satisfaction and copy and print, customer satisfaction was most enjoyable the final manager does not want to enhance my wages"
good,"It is likely due to the school season rush, but the stocking procedure was lackluster. The store was almost always overstocked, which led to multiple informal storage locations. This would be fine if it was just for the season, but it seemed as though it had been happening for a while making back-stock hard to find even though it was logged into the computer system. "
good,The environment was great until many employees started quitting which left us understaff. Management was great but the hardest part was trying to fulfill my own job and doing other duties that were not my responsibility because we were understaff. While being trained to work in the print department I had to also clean the restrooms and more while not being paid fairly.
good,"I worked at office depot as a sales associate for a big part of my job experience and I think it was a very good job for the experience, but I was ready to move forward with college and that required that I move away. Each day was pretty routine, but often not in a bad way and it taught me a lot about cash handling and customer service."
good,Customer service was always first. there have been days when it got very hectic and times were hard to complete tasks. Ihad to learn how to muli- task in most cases and even then sometimes forgot where i left off.Of course there was cashier. Positive note everyone could run it.Most of the time I was logistics {checking counts and verification} along with real outs. Everyone could do most multiple jobs. The hardest part of the job was when there was too much multi tasking.The most enjoyable was satisfies customers when you went above and beyond.
good,"A typical day at work, I usually come in, in the mornings and leave a little after noon. Working here consists of helping customers the whole time I'm there. I work at the register so it's a lot of communication that has to go on. Management is good, but it could be better. The workplace culture is a good environment to be in. I have really enjoyed working with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job... I can't really say, because it's pretty simple if you do what you're supposed to do. The most enjoyable part about this job, I would have to say going home. Just kidding. I enjoyed working here all in all."
good,"Working at Office Depot was was my first job while I was in High school. It's good if you want to work part time to gain some extra cash, but definitley not enough to support yourself living in a city like Austin, Tx. It's pretty slow unless it's back to school season but it's really relaxed and they give you the breaks you need  and the hours are pleasant. Being a cashier gave me the basic skills I needed to apply to other jobs."
good,"More of a starter job. Very good for a first job. Managers are patient, and the schedule is flexible. They allow for school. There are associate discounts and bonuses. Its more relaxed than most."
good,Overall it was good job just when things began during school it would be quite a hassle and quite quick paced . You do work well with a good team and they are flexible
good,"While I enjoyed working at OD during the first 14 years, it was the last two that became very stressful. "
good,"It's not a terrible job, the pay is okay, but you wont get enough work hours in the day for it to make a difference. Where I worked, you were lucky to get 25 hours a week."
good,"The work environment was easy to handle and the managers were great. Office Depot as a company wasn't great, however my co-workers were all great people."
good,A good corporate culture.Benefits are good. 401k matching. Lack of locations makes it hard to relocate. Good communication from upper management. Competitive pricing.
good,this is a great Part-Time job for a college student. it is very hard to seek career advancement. but the management is very tight on the schedule. it is very hard to get consistent work days
good,Managers were extremely passive aggressive and petty but other than that job was good very nice customers great team ethic from store manager and fellow coworkers
good,"Office depot as a whole is great place to work. The Management currently at this store has a lot of issues."
good,"This job, as a CPD associate, is not great for beginners; at least at the location I work at. You have customers constantly coming in and out asking for various things to have done, and when pick-up orders begin to get backed up it can leave you alone in the department dealing with several customers at once. Even getting paid .75 over the minimum wage here was not enough for just how much you have to learn and do at this job-- juggling seven customers at once by yourself is not worth 9 dollars an hour."
good,It’s a decent job  fast paced it the print center shifts go by quickly and are fun when you are working a busy shift pay is decent people are great to work with
good,"As a Copy and Print specialist at Office depot there was never a slow day. I had to deal with a variety of customers with different attitudes but I always try to ensure a good experience with them. I learned a lot from making copies, faxes, making business cards, and texture of papers. The hardest part would have to be dealing with customers who are in a rush and in a bad mood,coworkers who get orders wrong and the customers are upset. The mos enjoyable part is seeing the customers satisfy and leaving the store with smile"
good,"some times is slow and some times is a fast paste depending of the hours of the day. how to restock and place the products, the management of the register, how to worked with the copy machine. Not all the managers were good but some of them were really helpful and assist on questions about the job. some of the costumers are rude and it would make the job stressful. you always learn something new by just talking to the costumers on what they needed to buy"
good,"If your attitude is a good one, you can do well there. Employees are multi-tasked, a little of everything. Can be some very heavy lifting with furniture and chairs. Breaks are given. Just have to work holidays, no paid holidays."
good,"Option to work from home as needed."
good,"I had very specific set of things to do when coming into the door. A list of items that needed to get done by any particular shift. The hardest part was managing my time in between the many things that we had to do. However, I learned to not stretch myself thin, and finish one thing at a time, very well. The most enjoyable part is when you have a customer who appreciates your work and will defend you to upper management if need be."
good,Office Depot m'a donné l'opportunité de passer des Approvisionnements aux systèmes d'information jusqu'à la responsabilité des Achats Europe.
good,A typical day at work would start with me first making sure I had the proper tools to accomplish my daily task. Working here I learned to drive a SP as well as warehouse safety and proper picking procedures. Keeping my production up while picking would have to be the hardest part. I enjoyed communicating and meeting different people.
good,"Busy periods are overwhelming with customers needed help, while the store is understaffed because of payroll. Salary to low for previous experience. 50/20 chance to have to deal with an annoying or bad customer. Have asked to advance to position of CPD supervisor after working in CPD for more than a year, Still waiting on that reply."
good,"Busy day, time goes fast, great group of people and managers to work with. Schedule can vary do to time of the year and business needs. Expect to work some nights."
good,This was a temporary job for me and it filled that role just fine. I wasn't looking for anything spectacular and I went to work and school at the same time. Worked early in the mornings as it worked around my schedule. It's sales.
good,"I left because the company was unable to complete the delivery of the solutions I sold in the area.  Many others on my time also left.  Now that the company is part of Office Depot, I hope the company has improved those areas and is a more competitive player in the industry."
good,"Sales consultant***"
good,"It's not a bad job, but the retail industry is changing and brick and mortar stores are just not going to be around long.  It seems that everything the company is doing to hold on as long as it can is just the equivalent of dying a death of a 1,000 cuts (mostly payroll)."
good,Good for part time employment.  Thankful for the experience while in school.   I was able to keep up with my college courses and get good hours without work interfering with my education.
good,"Amazing company culture. Low careers advancement and high employee turn over due to below average salary. "
good,OfficeMax was a good but demanding company to work for.  Requires you to work a lot of hours during back to school. Typical day starts at 7 am with logistics
good,the company is good but the management staff at this store is poor understaffed long hours of work with only one associate at the print department no lunch or break ever asked by management team.
good,"Most stores have relatively relaxed work environment."
good,"the team is fun but the pay,hrs,and benefits were lacking. The manager Kenny was very enthusiastic and motivational and he genuinely cares about his team and the company and wants to see nothing but success from you."
good,"Office Depot is an improving retailer with good available hours, solid compensation packages, and a slow work pace (compared to other retailers, that is). The opportunity to advance is obtainable and streamlined."
good,the store i was working at closed due to lower than expected sales and unreasonable building lease costs that could not be met by the state of sales at that time.
good,Great place to work at. Enjoyed interacting with the customers.  Sometimes I wish I could work there again.  Good job for high school kids or if you are in college.
good,"It's not a bad place to work."
good,I was with the company for 10 years. My last 2 years the company changed drastically. They added more and more tasks and requirements and continued to cut payroll. My last 2 years with the company were exhausting. I felt I was constantly rushing to keep up and always still behind. No payroll meant you didn't have enough people to take care of customers. You would try to help a customer as quickly as possible just to be able to hurry and get to the next customer which of course meant low customer service quality. Hopefully the company can get back to providing the payroll to be able to give the attention to the customer they deserve.
good,"My first job was a cashier at Office Depot. I stood in one spot behind my register and checked out customers for 5-8 hours. The coupons never worked, the registers would freeze often, and customers were never happy. Not much room for promotions or advancement, but you were able to work there until you died."
good,"- A typical day at Office Depot consisted of greeting customers, ringing their purchases and offering protection plans on certain products.  Keeping the front end neat and secure and also keeping an eye out for shop lifters or quick change artists."
good,"Pretty good work environment and co workers. Decent upward mobility and nice place to work if you have a good manager. Technology and on the job training is pretty good. I would go back to work there for the right opportunity.However, the health insurance is very expensive and a lot of out of pocket responsibility. I think it would be difficult to work as a single parent."
good,Working for Office Depot was fantastic. The management was great. They were willing to teach you any position in the store if you asked and were interested in learning.
good,Its a good place to learn basic job experience. I was able to handle money and interact with customers all day.Some are not to great but overall its very convenient when you want to work while being a student.
good,"Moving in a positive direction. Changes happen often. Depending on the store manager and the executives in corporate, it has been a great place to work and it has been a stressful place to work."
good,I enjoy working at this job during me senior year in high school. I was able to stay focus while in school as well as received funds for my first year in college.
good,"Helping people in the tech section, help unload trucks ffrom shipments then stock the whole store. The management was good, never had any problems, just not my choice of work. It was too boring"
good,"A typical day at work fun and a team work"
good,"I worked as the assistant manager for one of their brick and mortar stores. Trained and helped with the hiring of staff. Ran day to day operations and worked as the floor supervisor daily. Hardest part, short staffed. Best part, customer interactions."
good,They do not hire full time employees or give opportunity for advancement. Hourly pay lacks incentive or justifiable for work put in. Benefits not available.
good,I enjoyed working for a company that put there employees 1st. I loved the benifits and the work atmosphere was just amazing made me happy to come to work and be apart of the team.
good,A decent place to work but it gets old fast. a lot of the same. I found it difficult to advance when i wanted to get a raise or get a promotion even with support from my managers.
good,its and okay place for a teen not a career job but good for part time and to learn new thing from technology to customer service its a great door opener
good,The only reason why I left was because of the whole transition from Office Max to Office Depot was not planned correctly and was way to stressful on everyone that worked at the store. Manager was great and left a lasting impression on me. pay was ok for the work done.
good,Every so often there are some customers where you will have to give your complete knowledge of a product. Your training helps with that. Its easy to ask management questions. They are always willing to help and give advice if you're unsure of anything. Scheduling is very flexible.
good,"It was a good place to learn how to communicate with other people, and helped me get an understanding how to explain products. A bad thing was that sometimes i was working alone so there were a lot of customers and only me to help."
good,It was a great opportunity to work for this company and gave you a chance to get knowlegable about certain products and services that were offered and also a chance to meet great people.
good,"A typical day at work included talking with many customers to try and make a sale and diagnose and fix a problem on their existing PC. As well as being a leader on duty with keys, to get into lock up, cash office and overrides on the cash register. Reset and clean my department. Making sure employees went for lunches and breaks accordingly . "
good,"Generally the day started at 5 am when the opening manager and I went into the store, I began with verifying the front end cash drawer, balance the daily deposit, adjust sales tags for the daily sales, audit a random department for any discrepancy, then the rest of the day aid on the sales floor to be informative for any guest that required any kind of office supplies of technical equipment."
good,It's really a bad place to work for unless you brown nose your way up. Otherwise you're stuck at minimum wage doing the managers job on top of your own in a short time frame then get talked to whenever you go over.
good,answering and directing calls; handling purchases; friendly environment; entry level job into the customer service industry
good,"Though there were many associates that were not suited for this company, I enjoyed my time working for Office Depot/OfficeMax. In my employment, I learned an innumerable sum of abilities that I can easily apply to any line of work I have the pleasure of experiencing."
good,"Exciting! A New challenge of Goals everyday. Never a Dull moment."
good,Muy buen trabajo hay buena estabilidad el ambiente laboral muy pesado para mi gusto
good,"Most coworkers are easy to get along with and at most locations there is room for improvement if you show your worth.The hardest part of the job will be the customers, but once you get used to it, the job is pretty good."
good,"I clock in put the radio on that way you can communicate with the other team members. They assign you which area you will be working in. your job is to help greet and help any customers in that area. Was a lot of talking to people, develop better communication skills. And learned how to use the register. Management was good always talking over the radio trying to keep the job fun and lively. With any customer service job you will get some bad customers to so that probably was the hardest dealing with difficult people. Most enjoyable was when I would make a sale in the furniture or tech department."
good,"Une structure bien huilé avec un personnel à l'écoute des demandes de la direction, mais pas dans le sens haute direction personnel"
good,"Management is pretty good and so is job security. Schedule flexibility a huge plus."
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting customers and providing excellent customer service. I've learned a lot during my time at Office Depot, working with computers and co-workers to ensure customer satisfaction. Management at Office Depot is superb as they always strive to help their employees grow. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, but with a little patience and a calm attitude, it was manageable."
good,"I really loved working with this company, even though I do not agree with some of their policies concerning customers and compensation. Some management training could probably help some store managers maintain their sub managers and employees. Overall I really wish I could stay with the company, but life had other plans."
good,Lo que más me gusto fue aprender mucho y desarrollarme laboralmente en poco tiempo
good,"I feel good working in office depot ,co workers also good and feel ever y happy to be a part in the office depot."
good,My job at Office Depot required maintaining inventory and managing our warehouse including deliveries and our IMS (inventory management system)
good,"Overall, Office Depot has been a good company to work for, however, the pay scale is on the low end, even for retail. They don't have a scale comparable with employees experience levels."
good,Co-workers are great but can be a burden at times but that's anywhere you go. Management has its ups and downs but overall they are great. It is very rare to take lunch breaks due to scheduling/not having the coverage to go.
good,This company is good in terms of customer service training and how to have an appropriate approach to customers. I really learnt a lot and got experience in there.
good,"The coworkers I had/have are amazing and make working here fun. The managers are, for the most part, really nice people. But I've had two pretty not okay managers, and hours have been very few so far. (around five months so far)"
good,"My particular store is fun and exciting. However, the corporate hierarchical control rears its ugly head often. I refuse to use scripts."
good,"Great company to work for if you're apart of management. a lot of company changes, print department is severely underpaid."
good,"My time at Office Depot was tricky at times. Obsessed with sales quotas, they pushed us to try to get more customers and get them to buy more and more, oftentimes not telling us HOW we were supposed to do it. When I first was hired there, I was pretty much thrust onto the cash register with little to no training and had to learn fast. When I moved to the copy and print depot, It was pretty much the same, the only difference is was that even the management was not given training to give to me as well. This resulted in us not knowing the standards and procedures we were supposed to know and we had to learn as we go. It was a difficult effort, but once we got an understanding of what we needed to do, working at Office Depot was enjoyable. The employees there were hard working, endearing and loved to help customers. I gained quite a following among regular customers there who relied on me to get their projects done and done properly. "
good,Nice place to work I met a lot of people there. Great for first timers. Had a great time working with all the ladies up stairs in the mezz.
good,Great place to grow and develop. Very fast paced. No formal training. Leadership capabilities vary based on department. Sink or swim mentality in some businesses. Leadership needs to work more as a team. Too many big egos.
good,At work i usually help customers find what they need and offer the some excessive products as well that I know will benefit them as well. stay handling cash at the register and completing transactions. I learned how to be efficient when handling money. how to display exceptional customer experience. the best part of my day is making are sales and sericeing customers.
good,Pay is minimal but hours are very flexible given that most positions are part-time. Room to grow in company as well if desired. Most managers are pretty efficient while some are not.
good,"The Office Depot Inside Sales Group, located in Austin Texas has a strong sales culture, rooted in hard work and customer relationships."
good,"I liked working at office depot but there is little room for employees to advance, its hard to contact the corporate office and there are no benefits"
good,"OfficeMax/Office Depot is a good place to work and managers are willing to help you find a balanced schedule when trying to juggle school and work. I cannot comment on a grade for benefits because I was part-time."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cash management, but very little customer consultation. I've learned to take every chance you get to advance within your job. Management was not very flexible as it related to times of hardship. My co-workers were very understanding and always willing to know what they had to do to help me get the job done. The hardest part of the job was seeing others advance yet not advancing myself. The most enjoyable part of my job was finding ways to assist others when management and other co-workers couldn't."
good,"Typical day of taking customer orders and doing print production work. Non stressful multitasking of customers and projects. There is always some work to do for large clients we have. But with large clients there is no real system in place on their information and contract pricing as far as printing goes. Co-workers are great to work with but have many years under their belt so it's hard to pick up on things they already 'know' as far as clients and what they need. "
good,"Für ein holländisches Unternehmen zu arbeiten hat viele Vorteile, aber in US Hand sind diese auch gleich wieder über den Haufen geworfen."
good,"I love my job, but not crazy about the management I work with. I really think most of the managers could really use training on the products, sales, and the store overall. Most workers say they don't get paid enough to do their job, I really don't get paid enough to do my managers jobs.  I've learned almost nearly anything and everything their is about retail between computer repair, money handling, customer service, and print services. I love generally the people I work with but again, with proper training they could be awesome. Since they went without proper training we run into problems with customers and customer complaints. which in turn I usually have to deal with and fix their mistakes. I enjoy the flexible schedule, and how close I am with the mangers. The hardest part is having so much experience and full time isn't offered"
good,"A typical day would be answering 50-60 calls in one day.  Most of them customer service "
good,"I learned what ink went with what computer, different types of printer paper how to operate a computer etc. My coworkers are always amazing at any job. The hardest part was figuring out in the begining all the little details that seemed overwhelming at the time and at the end were extremely easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was that not only did i do cashering i was also allowed on the floor to stock my day went by so much faster"
good,"I loved my store for a few reasons. "
good,"•	Manage categories supporting all channels of business including retail, direct, and contract in a face paced environment"
good,"Etant simple stagiaire je ne connais pas les opportunités de développement."
good,"I really like this job the managers are caring."
good,"typical day would be to set up new laptops and desktops"
good,Good people to work for. They respect their employees. Good organization.
good,"Direct contact met klanten zowel binnendienst als buitendienst."
good,Productive fun workplace with ping pong table-great place to work. The people are the best!
good,It is a very enjoyable place to work at. Co-workers are great and management is great to work with. They are very flexible to work with especially if you can only work certain hours.
good,solo estuve un año y recibí oferta para subir de puesto lo cual me agradó
good,Esta empresa tiene altos niveles de servicio asi como estandares muy altos de atencion al cliente
good,Not a bad place to work at all if you don't mind the occasional abundance of annoying bureaucracy.
good,"DTechnicien Help-desk – Office Dépôt – Entrepôt logistique de matériel bureautique –Senlis"
good,"Slow retail store, not too intensive as far as demands go, but upper (district management) is probably home to the dumbest individuals ever, with unreasonable expectations of selling things as mundane as paper with rain-proof packaging. Store management is great, however."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. They are good to customers and fellow staff. I would not have left here for Sandia Computers's full time and pay increase if I knew what it was going to be like working there. They would keep me working between two locations to make the hours I needed to pay my bills. They took care of me the best they could and I never went without."
good,"Office depot has an operating platforms with structure. Everyday is planned, you even have a checklist to ensure you have completed the duties of that day."
good,I like the to work here. The copy and print was a great place to work at.
good,"I would start my day finishing up previously unfinished work, while helping customers and starting new customer assignments.  I learned to multi-task more efficiently, prioritize and to utilize my resources.  The Management was pretty average, they would play off their mood more frequently than one would prefer, my co-workers were a lot better and mostly easy to get along with. The hardest part is figuring out ""special"" customers, but when you do it is quite rewarding!"
good,Heres the place for you great training. Great people. 3 shifts mid morning and closing. get mids or mornings. make sure you're on your self about managing you time they like that. Over all food place to work
good,Stable employment..fast paced during the day..Laid back in the morning.
good,company change too much customer services goals are not good any more
good,Management needs more communication. Overall I am fine working there been there over a year... wonderful benefits.
good,"A typical day would be to have store opening duties done before our peak time comes. This consists of missing tags, cleanliness, drawers balanced, shelves filled with out of strock items, price changes, etc. During peak hours we just concentrait on customers and leave the duties such as plan-o-grams, closing duties, filling shelves, etc. My team was fun to work with as they kept a great attitude to maintain moral through their shifts. I really didn't fell like there was a hard part of the day. I always used each new journey as a learning experience and a challenge because challenges are something I alway loved. The funnest part of the day was when we would radio our earnings and here that we were always ahead of our company goal for our store."
good,I worked on the sales floor. Morning shift consisted of doing price changes and helping with inventory and focusing on helping customers after those duties are completed. Evening shift starts out helping customers then collecting trash/reshop/recovery.
good,Had the opportunity to be a Department Manager for a year.
good,etiquetar vender cobrar y ordenar
good,I was assigned a specific territory and was expected to develop my client base from within.
good,"Bookkeeping, (AP/AR), typing, ten key, multiline line phone system,"
good,Office Depot is a very nice place to work. I have a chance to work with great people as well as educated customers from different careers and background.
good,"I was assigned there through a temporary company, but once my three monthsa where up i'm guessing my background disqualiffied me."
good,You know what you are getting into with a job with a company like this. In a way you are reviewed as a number...one of the regular employees with the company.
good,"Easy job, mainly customer service. Intro to retail job, got it when I was 17 and it was my first real job. I mainly worked the print center and it was fun (minus some customers asking for too much)."
good,"Flexible Hours, fast paced, great management, fun work environment, but not a lot of pay. "
good,"I was an exceeds performer and survived several round of layoffs.  After working incredible hours and garnering two promotions and being relocated 3 times until I got to corporate I was let go along with several other high performers, some recently promoted."
good,"Not many customers outside of back to school season and not much room for mobility. Very slow job, very little to do. Very nice people, though, and i appreciated that."
good,"Es una excelente empresa con políticas y procedimientos que no se aplican correctamente. clima laboral agradable, ideal para estudiar y trabajar al mismo tiempo."
good,The most enjoyable part of my career was building relationships that turned into partnerships.  Building trust with my immediate manager and with my clients was very rewarding.
good,It is a very good work environment to work in the mangers wants what's best for the customer and employee.  Office max taught me a lot while I was there life skills that I will do in everyday life.
good,"Overall a good company to work for when starting off with job experience. The company does have issues, like any other, but they are more dealing with the corporate side of things."
good,The main reason I took this job was to get involved with the process of designing projects for clients. I haven’t received a raise or promotion but was promised one more than twice. The management seems to care about their employees but can’t keep their promises.
good,"This company isn't one I would recommend to anyone. Although they have their upside, my experience was much better thanks to my management and co-workers. I feel like we made all the fun happen at the job rather than the company caring for us."
good,I learned how to operate equipment Office Depot was my first warehouse job I learned a lot only thing I bought the job is does not have enough hours for your living other than that it was a great job I learn management skills working with people I am a hard worker people respect everybody willing to learn willing to be a team player than work well with others
good,"I have been working for office depot for 3 yrs now. Its a okay place, i work in the copy and print which is the most demanding department. Because of customers, some know what they want others dont. There are some that are nice and others that are very rude and expect you to work miracles which we cant always do. The pay starts out low for some people and other start high, it depends on who the manager is. And some times you are able to get little rises with out it being a seasonal one. That also depends on the manager and how long and hard you work. If you want to work part time or seasonal i would say yes but i dont know about long term because it can get stressful. And the store wants to reach specific goals so you are going to get pushed my the managers. Not all or bad and i have been through both and when there is a good manager the store gets run great. Just letting you know, if you do decide to work in copy and print and for some locations it would either make or break you. Have seen many leave or be asked to be moved to a different position."
good,"We have plenty of work, but probably not enough people scheduled to reach and beat our stocking goals on time. The culture is positive, and the managers are patient and informative."
good,The comany has continued to decline over the past years as far as being accommodating to the associates. Breaks arent given regularly and the demand for higher productivity wasnt consistent to rate of pay
good,A typical day at work would be really busy and most of the time when i came in for my shift we would be under staff. The hardest part of the job would be getting help sometimes from my coworkers.
good,"•	Hardware and software issues with desktops and laptops including Citrix sessions, Outlook 2003, Office 2003,computers tune ups, virus and spyware removal, new installations, migrations, hardware upgrades and repairs, Cisco any connect VPN implementation and support."
good,"Good place to work.  Management does care about their employees and work life balance.  "
good,Over the last 5 years I have worked with Office Depot I have been promoted from Merchandise Stock associate to General Manager. Work Life balance and career growth are its 2 best attributes.
good,This was one of the best jobs I had. I loved management and they were very understanding. The most enjoyable part was being able to help the customers and seeing them leave happy.
good,"This company had its ups and downs, my first manager was AWESOME and really helped me navigate through the corporate ladder. However, once the merge happened with Office Max the management went WAY down and it became a hostile environment."
good,Work enviornment wasn't bad at all.  It is best to try and be trained everywhere they can train you so you have a better chance to be promoted.  Some higher management were not known to show that they care too much.  All of my atore managers were excellent but anyone higher had a 50/50 chance of actually being a great leader.
good,The employees are great. The job is pretty easy. I just wish we could get a stool behind the counter and a longer break. It requires you to stand for long periods.
good,Office Depot gave me a great experience to develop my hunting and account management sales skills.  I developed the ability to effectively communicate and close sales with entry level personal to C-Level executives.  I also had to the opportunity to be promoted to DSM and develop my sales management skills within Office Depot.
good,"I've worked there a few months and haven't found many ways to advance or get more than 2 or 3 days a week. Working less than 20 hours a week is not a livable wage, so be prepared to find another job."
good,"Great place to work if apart of the production team (Split-Case, Shipping, and Receiving, and most of the time for non-production team (Admin, Maintenance, and Inventory Control) until the past few months when company had to make deep cuts in budget, and started with non-production teams.  Company does takes good care of their employees, and good benefits.  Needs better health care."
good,"The manager at my store was very good at recognition and appreciating people for the hard work that they put in, and as a result, hard workers were able to be promoted accordingly."
good,"Office Depot OfficeMax is a great company to work for at the store level. Everyone works together and management doesn't micromanage individuals without pulling their weight- which helps employees feel supported. Management is typically involved in the store's daily operations and supporting each department and they seem to care about the well being of their employees. Another positive- I attended some college classes and they worked with my school schedule. "
good,I loved my job it was stressful but worth the stress I worked with a great team until office depot got involved they made the job alot harder you have to do a million steps for one job more so a waste of time and the management from there was highly lazy
good,"This was first job when I turned 16 and it was a good place to start. I think that it is because retail is easy but its work. At office max, I stocked shelves and worked the register"
good,Office Max/Office Depot isn't a bad place to work.  It truly depends who your managers are and if you are willing to work.  I have learned several things and attained many skills working for them.  Being in management I've learned to keep it positive and fun but yet still get the job done. I do enjoy the regular customers that come in.  The hardest part of the job is the hours.  When you have a young family it is hard to enjoy them when having to work some many nights and weekends. A typical day of work is doing morning office paper work.  Then it is scanning for inventory mistakes and taking care of customers.  Not to mention setting plan o grams and helping out in the print area. Multitasking I have learned to do very well.
good,Supervised a staff of approximately 6 associates.  Handled copy order and business supply orders.   Handled transactions and made sure everything ran smooth.  Ensured customers were satisfied.
good,"Good job, bad job. Its retail to many ups and downs and changes. When its good its great when its bad it can be stressful to the max. You never know when your getting a change in the roster and when its managment things could go up or down. Worst part you dont get holidays with family like you used to."
good,"Working in the print department, you were always bending over for a customer. Over my three years, had customers complain about everything and I had to deliver. No matter how insane the timeline was, often stayed late to complete orders."
good,"Once you're assigned for a specific role, that you would do whatever that role ask you to do excluding other things (even helping a long-awaited customer can cause you to be reprimanded). "
good,"I loved working here but the pay was very poor for my position. I then moved locations and at my second location I was unappreciated completely. I was barely given hours and my supervisors and peers ignored me, gave me looks, and just seemed to dislike me. I resigned after I was asked to cashier for a shift even though that was not my job or job title."
good,"My time at OfficeMax was an experience I came to appreciate.  It was a professional customer service working environment.  Working with varied departments to meet goals of the Customers we served to our best ability.  It helped us as a center be effective and efficient.  I am in a place now where I am looking forward to a change of employment, where I believe I can take the skills I received there, and place them into the career I am working towards in childhood education.  I have and continue to wish my former coworkers well for those that remain and have departed."
good,"Competitive workplace where the primary goal is retail and customer satisfaction. Time management is key and verbal skills are equally important. On a typical day, it stays busy."
good,Compensation and Bonuses aligned with P&L
good,Great place to get entry level experience. Mostly young people at entry level wages. Easy scheduling and easy work without much pressure or intensity.
good,My managers at the store level always treated me well and were willing to work with me when I needed days off.  The people who run corporate at detached from their work force.  Corporate cares more about money than their employees.  Corporate makes changes without any clue to how they actually work in the store.
good,"I loved the job, however, they sent most of the positions overseas.  We did not have an option to secure our employment during a merger between OfficeMax and OfficeDepot."
good,"The office supply industry is on its way down, the company has been in steady decline for 5 or 6 years. I was done with the constant layoffs and always feeling like we were losing. I should have left sooner and not stayed so long."
good,I don't really remember about job it was a job I did right out of high school and there for things have changed so much my feeds back would not be relevant
good,My time working for what was then only called Office Depot was incredibly educational and stimulating in creative matters.  I earned a greater appreciation for the various ways in which to create printed and paper materials beginning from basic construction all the way to digital design.  I was grateful for the learning experiences.
good,"Trabajo estable, buen ambiente de trabajo, crecimiento."
good,"Good job to have. Great Staff. Orderly and well balanced management. Management is very caring and understanding. Employees work excellent as a team. Also, the teams priority is the customer."
good,"While I love being a print specialist and meeting new people, all the work that I do sometimes goes unnoticed and I do not get paid enough for all that I do. I love learning something new every day and building friendships. Office Depot does work really well with your school schedule."
good,This is a good place if you have never worked inside sales before.  They hire you with no experience and teach you the basics.  If you apply what you have learned you will outgrow your position within 18 months.
good,"Managing customer custom print orders. Making prints, leaflets, and book binding upon request. Basic cashier duties as required. Basic customer requests."
good,"The job I had at Office Depot was given to me when the previous two Print Service Managers quit, the last one was done very unexpectedly. A lot of information was laid on me but the pay was fine for the work that I did."
good,"If you're looking for a retail job that is fast paced, this wouldn't be the place for you. On a typical day, you would ring up customers, but most of the time you're waiting for customers to show up. It's a fairly easy job, some customers may expect you to know details about products you may have never heard of. Most coworkers and managers are friendly and easy to get along with. Very open and flexible to scheduling."
good,CEO doesn't seem to make great decisions part timers are not allowed to get PTO(Paid time off) also to qualify to work full time you need to have an open availability so lets say you cannot work sundays  due to church that will  disqualify you from any benefits. Other that that it I really fun working there customers are great  my coworks are amazing I cannot really say anything bad about them.
good,"el ambiente con los compañeros era bueno, y aunque aveces el trabajo era pesado, se pasaba rápido el tiempo"
good,As far as part time jobs go this is a great option for anyone looking to get a few extra dollars while in high school or college.
good,"Great place to learn retail, customer service and not be flipping hamburgers.  You will also learn to be better organized all the way around."
good,Es una empresa que ofrece crecimiento y buen ambiente de trabajo
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es bueno"
good,"atención a clientes, horario de comida 1 hora, buen ambiente laboral."
good,"I got there at 8am and worked till 1am the next morning on overtime during September - March. Otherwise, I would get done at 4pm. Management had their favorite employee's which I didn't was fair. I worked at BP Gas Station at the same time and pulled a lot of over time and I still didn't get a raise money wise or trained as a supervisor. I was stuck and got let go 4 months after I told them I wanted to quit."
good,"Everyone I worked with was great. My supervisor was always there when they're was an issue and helped solve it. I would take phone calls, place orders, track orders, process Po's with sap, process returns, run reports."
good,I enjoy woking here because of the people I work with. We always work as a team and the management is great. We all get along well.
good,"I would go in and go to the position I would be sign too. I learned how to scan and check for the correct product within the boxes. I would also put away, received, shipped, picked, pack, and sort all the merchandise. They would have me more around the environment to do different positions as the management would assign me to it."
good,I worked in an OfficeMax call center when OfficeMax and Office Depot merged. I greatly preferred to work for OfficeMax as it seemed that Office Depot didn't care much for providing excellent customer service.
good,"Office Depot/Max is a great place to work.  They offer great benefits, tuition reimbursement and have lots of room for growth.  The production facility is a fast pace environment but has a systems in place to be able to manage.  Most of team is long term and enjoy what they do."
good,"The management structure of each individual Office Depot/Office Max that I have worked for in the past is supportive and understanding of the members of the team.  The problem though is that as a retail facility, growth is stagnant.  The ability to move upwards in the business only ever opens up when someone is fired or leaves.  There are rarely any growth oppurtunities.  If you get hired, get used to what you are doing, you may be there awhile."
good,"a great experience working with young enthusiasts. great opportunity in retail sales. no benefit if you are part-time to the employees a few hours, culture of management is not to give Merit to those associated when they make a good job. no growth opportunities."
good,"A typical day at work is busy and have a schedule to meet. We work as a team to assure we take care of our customer. Management is supportive and work with us. The hardest of the job is that we"
good,Officemax is a wonderful place to work. My typical day is very productive. I work hard and am constantly learning how to do my job better and more efficiently. Management is great! Co-workers are very helpful and trustworthy.
good,"Transitional time due to buyout of Boise Corporation to OfficeMax. So there were changes in management and focus in sales/marketing  from business- to -business sales to business- to- business & retail sales.  Larger corporation offers career opportunities, however, more subject to relocating for  advancement.  Excellent opportunity to grow sales & customer relations skills and exposure to variety of clients."
good,This job was good as a first job. I did love my workplace at the beginning but I did burn out  from working so much. Management in my store was a little nightmare but always over came that situation. I would get boring when it would start to slow down but everything you do in that store is team oriented so you will never be left alone.
good,"junta diaria, evaluando las ventas del día anterior así como prescindir con el servicio fanático y servicio al cliente."
good,Team work is an opportunity to face. Supervisors are nice and accessible. While I work here I have more time to spend with my family and having medical appointments is never an issue.
good,"enjoyable part of the job was the customers "
good,I accepted a position at office depot and left my stable company of 5 years and two weeks into my position at office depot the CEO announced that Staples will be purchasing the company and most of us will soon be out of a job.
good,"Office Depot Business Solutions is a fun place to work and offers a great deal of flexibility.  As long as the numbers are there and your job is being done, management leaves you alone.  They let you run your territory as if it were your own business but offer support when needed.  Expectations are high and you must be accountable but as  I said minimal micro-managing which makes you want to work."
good,Okay working environment. Pay could be a little better as well as hours given and management
good,I have met and worked with a ton of great people. I love this company and working for them has been nothing but amazing.
good,"Processing orders on a daily basis"
good,"Cant complain the pay is ok. The managers are good people, but they seem to get changed out a lot."
good,"Productive work place, full of hard workers. I feel Management could be more business oriented, by displaying better communication skills with employees. Overall If you are doing your job, and meeting expectations this is a good workplace."
good,"Typical day of work consisted of helping customers and checking out the customers at the cash registers. I was taught how to use the cash register and explained what to do and not to do. Management was always there and if I needed help, I could always call for it. Co workers were very friendly. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers which really wasn't that hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have conversations with happy customers."
good,"had a lot of flexible time"
good,"Good place to work.  The corporate campus has gym, dry cleaning, bank, café and bike rack."
good,"Work was a good place for the most part. I enjoyed the people I worked with, even though we didn't have much in common with each other. I generally talked to customers about their computers, and which new computer would work best for their needs. I was used all over the store to help on registers, stalking product/taking customers product to cars, and I worked in the Copy & Print department helping with photo editing, customer printing requests, ect."
good,Working with customers every day. Helping them with questions and services.
good,"Managing existing and new major accounts to ensure customer expectations are met. "
good,The pay should increase and the hours should vary more. The atmosphere is nice. The workers are good and diligent. The management is good.
good,"Great started job for students. Management was great and keeping everyone motivated. Good teamwork, great people."
good,A typical work day is clocking in and immediately attending customers on the floor.
good,"A typical day at work for me before I became a manager was come in with a smile, assist customers on the floor, at the registers or on the phone. Merchandise the stores with new products, put out price changes and do various jobs management asked of me. After I became a manager, I would come in, greet everyone on our radio headsets, go over what we did in sales the day before and prior to when my shift started, announced to the team where we were doing good and what we needed help in, then assist customers where needed. I also had to do various jobs my managers asked me to do."
good,"Es una empresa de retail, es muy importante la atención al cliente"
good,it was a good experience. Was my first job so i really can’t complain. I made a decent amount of money. Worked a decent amount of hours. And my coworkers were always good to me.
good,It’s a good place to work although corporate is pushing online services harder than sales in store but want both in the green and it is bringing a lot of confusion into the company.
good,My experience working at Office Depot OfficeMax was fast paced but well manged the cultured there was extremely friendly however the only down side is pay. Great for experience building.
good,"As the retail industry is under hot water currently, the company's focus has shifted from products oriented to services oriented. The pressure is on. If a person is able to handle the pressure would be a good fit and I personally feel some of the goals are unrealistic and the company makes it difficult by not providing enough payroll. The spiffs on technology items are good but if an employee is in CA then it is not worth it because of the taxes. I am lucky that I am working for a good and understanding store and assistant managers."
good,"Though was hired as the Senior Tech at this location, the atmosphere is really to do as little actual tech work at the location, and rather be available for customer interaction on the floor of the store."
good,"Getting to learn new methods everyday.Able to manage time and finish the development within the time frame.The approach I follow is from the dust,So i feel responsible for it from the stratch."
good,"Office Depot itself has made negligible decisions regarding store changes. Items unnecessarily move, Prices fly all over the place, and project time frames are limited. However, the print center never failed to impress. I am a little biased since I was apart of that team. The print center went relatively untouched over the 3 years I was there. Policies didn't change, services provided remained the same, client base had it's regulars, and the counters were always organized. The only changes made to the print center were new equipment and software."
good,"Office Depot Officemax stores tend to be small with a minimum amount of employees to run the store. Managment will work with employees to have flexible. As nice as this is when staff is kept to a minimum this will cause a heavier burden of responsibility to the other employees if anyone doesn't show up for work. Managment tends to slowly train employees responsibilities for every role in the store over time. While this increases the skills of employees and makes working easier, pay only increases annually or for job title change. Pay normally never increases due to responsibility increase."
good,"Très formateur, rend plus fort, plus guerrier ... entreprise qui favorise l évolution interne des collaborateurs engages. De nombreuses formations internes pour l amélioration continue. Home office favorisé."
good,The managers strives for everyone to do there part and to get work done in a certain amount of time. Very good job to have depending on what area your in. If your around nice and respectful managers and managers who love to communicate and have fun. You will enjoy OfficeMax/ Office Depot but if you don't have that then it can be hard to get through.The work load shouldn't be hard as long as you take responsibility and do your part.
good,Good place to work if your young. They are understanding and caring individuals. If your not sure on something they will help you and make sure that you get it.
good,"I work with but, be willing to work in all parts of the store not just in your assigned area and not stand around and twidle your thumbs. you can can promoted if you willing to work and show initiative. just low pay for what I do"
good,"overall i think that office depot was a good starting job, fairly easy with a high efficiency on their work. on the floor it was all about customer service and pushing for a sale. which is a good platform to gauge if you want to work in sales or a customer service role later down the road."
good,It was not a bad place to work. Flexible when you need it them. I had to quite because the warehouse was located in Weston and I had to relocate to miami.
good,Could not have asked for better local management and coworkers. Wonderful work environment. Accommodating for family life. Good sales training. Good relationship with vendors.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, cuenta con todas las prestaciones de ley."
good,"day at work "
good,"Even though my department can get very overwhelming, I love it. I love assisting customers and coming up with solutions to their problems that they wouldn't think of. Some people aren't as pleasant to deal with, but the ones that are friendly make it all worth it. The most difficult part of the job is managing your time and staying organized. Since I work in a high-volume store, there's always something to do. There's constantly customers at the counter, and they all have to be taken care of in a timely manner. Some don't mind the wait, but others are in a rush. Knowing how to handle both is the challenge. With all the machines running at the same time, there's paper literally everywhere, so things do get mixed up every now & then. So making sure things are marked correctly and where they belong are a big part of staying organized."
good,"Working here you have many options of positions in the store which can help people who tend to get ""burn-out"". Like all retail businesses there are slow seasons, just have to weather the storm so to speak. Learn from all that you can and you definitely can advance."
good,I learned a lot  about sales and made lots of money on a product that sold itself. I enjoyed contacting my clients and they loyalty to me not the company.
good,"I would say working here is a very beneficial experience for me. I've built a more efficient and consistent way of producing prints everyday. Might have some ups and downs along the way but that doesn't stop me from trying to improve myself to benefit the company's core values. I may disagree with some methods of how management team operates the floor, but I think they're doing this for the benefit of the company. I think."
good,"It's a pretty laid back job. If you are a truck driver you're basically guaranteed overtime which is good but if you are a desktop delivery person like I am, you'll get close to 40 hours a week."
good,Work with field counterparts to assist customer with technology solutions.  Learned to work with distributors and manufactures.  Fun place to work but issues with bonus structure.
good,"Kind of ran my own area. Most customers were nice to deal with. Always had repeat business."
good,"Its a Good place to work but very demanding, the pay is OK just don't make a career out of it they have a salary cap for lower level employees."
good,Great place to work if you are a) a person with little to no work experience b) in school or c) really love office supplies. other than those reasons you would not want to work there. Easy job with little to no thinking.
good,"Management was great, but there were't much opportunities for advancement and raises were never given out. I learned how to do lots of design work in copy and print."
good,"A typical day at work consists of dealing with many personalities and making sure the customer is always satisfied. I've learned a lot of things while working there such as the register and dealing with money. I also learned new things at the Copy and Print center such as faxing, filing, special copying and scanning. Management was very helpful and lenient. Coworkers are very friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job I would say is dealing with customers."
good,A typical day consists of serving the customers that come into the store. I learned how to assist customer with their business office needs. I had a good management team as well as great co-workers.
good,"la empresa tiene muy buen ambiente de trabajo y excelente comunicación jefe-auxiliar, pero las instalaciones y el equipo de trabajo están en muy malas condiciones."
good,"Great for a starting job for anyone looking for tech work, logistics work, or print services. good pace for advancement, but the workplace can be very slow if there is no business."
good,"As a whole, Office Depot is a very social and happy environment. "
good,"This was my first job after college, and my first just job since leaving the US Navy. The managers there were great and really cared about their employees."
good,Challenging and something new to work on everyday. Enjoyed working with my co-workers to resolve issues and provide the best customer service experience for our customers. I felt comfortable asking for help when needed and worked well with my supervisor. The hardest part was not always having the tools or resources needed to complete a task in a timely manner.  I learned how to manage a busy workload and meet customers expectations by organizing and keeping good records.
good,The employees are rude and petty. They don't give new people an opportunity. The management is AMAZING! The hours were good. I enjoyed having weekends off. The pay was god just wish there was room to get more hours.
good,learning new things from the colleagues personally makes us grow and improve our skills decent amount of red tape and politics but this is expected from a big
good,"Great customer service is the number one priority here. ""Approach every customer"" is the motto that was enforced. Management tends to ""do more with less"" while logistics sets the tone for the entire day."
good,"good company to work for very energetic people, good environment , fast past, good communications with in employees if you want to know more contact the company for direct answers"
good,"A typical day at work included me greeting and attending to customers. Handling monetary transactions constantly throughout the day. I was responsible for answering phones, and keeping the workplace clean. I also, specialized in technology sales, so typically I would take care of any customer that needed help with a printer, computer, tablet, etc. The most tedious part of the job was being in charge of all the advertisements around the store, I had to change sale prices and signs weekly."
good,"A typical day at work consists of our daily meetings, where our manager Mark Bloom talks about any announcements he has and how heavy or light the day will be, what the count for the day is. In the short time I have worked for Office Max I learned how to operate some of the equipment. I am now certified on a fork lift and have a little experience with the pallet jack."
good,"A typical day at work consists of continuous customer service and also repetitive actions. Here I grew to understand what customer service actually means. Management is fine when everyone is busy and working w/ one accord. My co-workers are pretty easy going and friendly for the most part. Toughest part about the job, is that we would have to work in different departments of the store."
good,"A typical day at work is taking customers print orders and using the register to check out customers. I learned much about software programs such as Photoshop, publisher and excel."
good,Motivate employees to increase sales and give excellent customer service.  Create schedule to cover the store needs and process pay role.
good,"This was my first full-time job. I enjoyed the new technologies emerging, such as css and DHTML, which enabled me to bring more life to the web functionality of their user experience, both internal and external websites."
good,"Office Depot was a fun company to work for, however with the location the store was at not many customers came through, leaving a lot of the associates to keep the store tidy. I did learn the full copy and print center while working there, and continued to work on my sales of protection plans for the items customers bought, which gave great compensation."
good,"Goede werksfeer, goede secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden."
good,"Personalize making of business cards, stamps, photo- shop editing. Mailing services for UPS and USPS services as well as inventory, stocking, price changes, and cashier."
good,"I love this company but with all the changes, it's time to change and move forward. After 16 years, so many changes have occurred it has left me with no choice but to move forward."
good,"My store had decent management, who tried to work with your hours and they do there best to help you learn what you need to succeed. The print center takes a special kind of person you need to be calm in stressful situations and multitask very well."
good,"Every store I have worked at has been very forgiving with frequently changing college schedules. Hours can be hard to come by at certain times of the year. If you're full time or dual income, it's tolerable. If you're part time or seasonal, do not rely on this job if you have a lot of bills."
good,"Going in and clocking in digitally, to start working as a cashier with nice management and relaxed work space. "
good,"surtido de mercancía en piso de venta y atención a clientes era lo mas común y no era muy pesado, se aprende a tratar con todo tipo de gente ya que se vendían artículos escolares, artículos de oficina, muebles y aparatos electrónicos, lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es que si tienes ganas aprendes de todo"
good,"it was slow and easy some days but other days it was bad, it just depends on the day you work. it a good place to work while in  school, they work around my school"
good,"There are a lot of opportunities to build residual compensation though offering the best solutions to clients. "
good,"Monitor multi-bin storage tracking."
good,It's a good place to work at when starting to work in retail because you are given task that revolve around helping the customer either save money or just leave satisfied with their purchases.
good,it is a good place to work at and nice people to work with. The costumers are a bit particual in the place of town where this store is located but other than that it's a pretty good place to work at.
good,"A typical day at work for Office Max is usually stressful as we are understaffed, we open the gates and start the computers and registers up. Then we proceed to work on outs and beginning print jobs from last night. Around 9am-11am customers come in and we take care of them and provide them with the total solution."
good,I worked harder than what I was paid and never really got a raise after being there for about 3-4 years. The staff were so much fun to work with on the contrary.
good,It's A Nice Working environment I like the work environment and my co workers but they do not believe in helping each other pursue their dreams.........
good,"OfficeMax was the very first job I got when I was 16 years old. At first, my coworkers treated me with respect. Now, they still do, but don't really seem to care much for the store or the customers."
good,"I would much rather have a more demanding job with better compensation and more opportunities for advancement.  If, however, you like to come and go as you please, and take time off as it suits you, this place might be for you."
good,"Worked there for 10 years. Cycled through a bit of managers but that is retail."
good,I learned how to effectively work with other individuals in a professional environment. I also gained experience with computer softwares and copy and print equipment.
good,Great place to advance in a company. Pay is okay for retail work. Typical day consists of doing various jobs. Hours per week is not great.
good,There is a lot of room for growth with this company. I worked with some great persons in management who taught me so much to help me grow in the company.
good,"When I started at Office Depot the culture was relaxed and fun."
good,The office depot i worked at had incentives for rewards and selling plans which was nice.  Somewhat laid back and understanding of human error.
good,"recibir de 3 a 4 camiones semanales con al rededor de 6000 piezas cada uno "
good,Office depot is a really good job to start at if you need a job for college. they also work well with your daily life.
good,"Customer Service Sales Representative, Office Depot, Panama City, FL       01/2006-05/2007"
good,its a good place to learn a lot of skills from cashier to book keeping. i do enjoy the co worker. and good to be around.
good,good customer service people customers were great including the staff at office depot.
good,"A typical day in the print center is rather very easy-going. It can become hectic when customers begin to come in and start to get impatient about having their work completed in a certain amount of time. What people do not realize is that our department gets tons of orders way before theirs and they expect theirs to come first. It doesn't work that way. Our policy is ""first come, first served"". You can either wait your turn in line or you can leave. The enjoyable part of working for office max is the employees. Everyone can relate to each other on some subjects then again not on so many subjects."
good,Really great company whose main focus are the customers. Great customer service. Friendliest people on earth.
good,"cubrir dos areas como cajera, servio al cliente y servicentro de negocios y algunas veces piso de venta aprendi a superviasr a las persona y que las cosa se hagan confiorme a las reglas, me gusta mucho el trato al cliente y manejar la administracion"
good,Office Depot was the best place I have ever worked. My team quickly became some of my best friends. I highly recommend working here. Everyone helps everyone. The pay is good and they are quick to help you out when you need it. The print department is very fast paced most of the time. On some occasions you will have very slow days and nights. Your team will always help.
good,"My store was a Max turned Depot, so I know we are very out of the ordinary. I had great managers. We are a smaller store due to our location, so our clientele is smaller, and it is really nice to have that smaller business aspect. "
good,"Office Depot is a relaxed work environment, but the constant chatting in the ear set can get old fast."
good,"Loved the coworkers and the job was easy and straight forward. No frills, plenty of departments to work in so you don't get bored doing the same thing every day."
good,it was very competitive had to make sure i made sales and provide good customer services.  i handled cash register and answer customer's questions. I would  recommend it .
good,Short staffed but they don't just hire anybody. They want to make sure they hire care people who want to continually advance everyday. They hired me on giving me a shot in the dark and I believe we are both pleased. I have grown so much their and have gotten to see my co-workers grow along with the business itself. Don't let me down Office Depot/Office Max! I plan on sticking with you for a long time!
good,"I had to offer solutions on the financial side to the Office Depot's customers from the UK and Ireland. After promotion I was on working on the Risk Assessment Department, where I had to check the orders and the fraud probabilities before the order confirmation."
good,Office Depot is a great place to develop your skills. There seems to be a lot of opportunity for advancement if you are flexible and willing to relocate.
good,I liked working for office depot sometimes it was hard but I got t  though it for 13 Years and I liked my boss everybody that worked there was there for a long time.
good,Not to hard to work there. hours are limited when its not back to school season. C-class executives dont know where they want to take the company. fun environment though
good,"El trato con los clientes siempre sera dificil, pero es aun peor si no tienes un equipo de trabajo con quien te puedas apoyar, en mi caso siempre he tenido quienes me apoyen, pero es hora de crecer, y esa es mi razon por la que me gustaría un cambio"
good,"I worked as a live-in senior care giver.  I prepared meals, clean up after, and gave companionship to the lovely elderly woman that I cared for.  It was a joy doing my job because the family was very caring and just overall great to be around.  The hardest part was separating my personal life from work because it was such a demanding job.  I would go to doctors appointments, if needed.  I really enjoyed her company as she did mine."
good,processed orders in a timely manner. co-workers play a big part in your daily activities. managers need more training for the field they are placed in. the hardest part was leaving.
good,"enjoyable, you get to meet new people  of all walks of life.  Always helping some one in need"
good,"My station is copy/print.  Assist customers ship ups or usps packages, assisting with printing business cards, printing docs, printing pictures, Also assist with phone calls."
good,"This particular job was a very competitive job it was a very active job and also it is for to be willing to go above and beyond."
good,"I took this job because I had been out of work for awhile and was having trouble. The job itself wasn't bad but you had too watch some of the customer like a hawk when they came in. This place change a lot after I left, there is a completely new staff and it seems a lot better now."
good,I trace orders for customers. I have worked with a lot of people  across the country in assisting customers. My co-workers are the best part of my job. I have made life long friends. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a customer that is so angry for not getting their delivery and I have to tell them it is lost and we will credit and reorder.
good,"I've learned to cope with peoples, manage my time and money learned different about areas of the store that I didn't know. I was the youngest person working there so not that much exciting. over all I can say It was ok working there"
good,"paga buena, promocioes paralos empleados . buenas intalaciones ,reconocimiento alempleado del mesy del año."
good,"Es una buena empresa para crecer y salir adelante, se aprende mucho en cuanto a el servicio y la presentación de los trabajadores, lo dejan desenvolverse dentro de su área de trabajo."
good,Expérience très enrichissante m ayant permis de mettre à profit mes compétences.
good,avg work day is copying and making business cards and flyers. the co-workers was easy to get along with. Management needs some help. the most i have enjoyed of this job is the customers
good,"Working with office depot has been interesting and fun. Though there is a VERY high emphasis on your selling abilities, it is not worth the compensation. They attempt to argue this point by giving you ways to earn commission but it is more difficult to earn commission to the point of not being fiscally worth it. For example, you have to sell $200 worth of extended warranties to earn the 5% spiff of those warranties. few make that goal. The demands of responsibilities far outweigh what your initial job summary entails. The people, however are what makes the difference in every store. There are always plenty of ways to earn a few extra dollars here and there but it mainly depends on your ability to sell. The worst part of this company that I've seen so far is that there is no job security. In my few years of employment i have seen at least 6 managers come and go through my store. I have deliberately turned down higher positions solely on the fact that the positions never last more than a few months."
good,"My store manager was awful. She plays favorites and treats her employees like garbage. She was always cutting my hours, cut others hours so badly they had to quit even though they liked the job, and I never had any consistency to a work schedule. It's a toxic environment  and not worth it for just minimum wage. Do not recommend working there..."
good,"Management was Okay. Some were young & loved the position of control and basically acted like drill sergeants. I never learned anything working at Office Depot. The hardest part of the job is Managers forcing cashiers & sales floor people to sell so many ""protection plans"" in one day. If we did not meet our quota we were punished for it."
good,"I was always busy moving around and stocking shelves and helping customers.i got to learn how to do the price changes which I loved doing. I also got to learn about doing the copy and print. I didn't like that when we got snow and I couldn't get to work safely, that the manager told me I had to get to work, and when I finally made it in I find out that same manager didn't show up due to not being able to make it safely."
good,"good place when i worked there  was too long ago to remember  "
good,"Buen trabajo "
good,I have learn lot about the system and the people with whom i work.
good,Everything about the job was really great except the management. I was training to be operations manager. I feel like I could  have ran the store if I got the opportunity. I was there less than a year and was doing everything the managers were.
good,Office Depot is not really a good store to work for.  The management is not great and I only get little hours to work.  Office Depot is also closing store across the country.
good,"I enjoyed working here during my teen years. It gives you great experience for the business world, especially in the Copy and Print Department. A lot of customers went to Copy and Print department and got business jobs done, so in return you learned plenty in regards to resumes, cover letters, business stamps, shipping with UPS/ USPS and more!"
good,Very typically I would manage the front of the store as a cashier helping customers in front of the aisles but staying close enough to my register to help anyone in line. I would also keep the storefront clean and organized and check stock for expiration
good,"Ayudar al cliente a  encontrar lo que necesitaba , cobrar ."
good,Bonne ambiance entre chauffeur rigolade tous les jours. Chef d'équipe pas assez performant trop de problèmes avec lui manque de communication fait n'importe quoi feignant.
good,"The job itself was fast paced and i love helping people, my personal experience is that i was only part time and earning minimum wage. The environment based on co-workers could have been better but not a bad aspect of the job."
good,"Pretty okay place to work for not that amazing. I learned how to deal with costumers , and good tactics for sales. Management was absolutely awful , will just leave it at that. You get written up for being sick , because in the rules it says you have to have a pre planned sickness to call out. that doesn't make since at all."
good,"It's a job work is tough and a lot of times thankless. You need to know alot about everything, be able to work all departments whenever required and have a completely open availability."
good,"Office depot is an alright place to work for as long as you can handle stress in the workplace. Working in copy and print was a h*ll in itself, and was honestly the worst position you could have. Constantly working with people who are upset at you for no reason and dealing with machines that were years behind the standard age making everything slow and clunky especially during rush hour."
good,"A typical workday consisted of placing 35 to 50 outbound calls, updating credit card orders.  I became familiar with various financial  programs specific to the business sector.  Management fostered a team environment.  I found nothing hard as part of this job.  Being able to provide superb customer service and solutions to costumers was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I worked in the impress center with OfficeMax with 2 other employees. We worked well together, but there was not enough employees to do all the work needed to get done during the busy seasons. Overall, it was a good place to work."
good,Florida was nice so were my coworkers very nice and reliable Obtain a position as a team-player in a people-oriented organization where I can maximize my customer-service experience in a challenging environment to achieve corporate goals.
good,"Management seemed to praise sales people more often than people in the printing department.  No discipline when employees did not do their job correctly but Assistant Manager would talk to them.  They will look at your experience and make an offer THEN when you accept the job will pay much less claiming ""sales are down"" and you'll get a raise when things are better but the raise is pennies and not to the level promised."
good,"It isnt stressful but it is kind of boring after hours of no one being there."
good,"Learned alot at this job"
good,Es bueno el ambiente pero los gerentes luego no tienes la capacitación necesaria
good,The hardest part of the job was to learn to adapt and change with the times.  Retail is a changing landscape.  The customer is shopping so many different ways...retail brick and mortar is a tough place to be in the current environment.  Great fun working with the customers and learning about all of the new products!
good,Just know when you start they are just filling positions with anyone. You will soon after find out that you will not be moved up.Instead you will be used to fix up stores and will be moved from store to store with no compensation
good,This company review has been done already on a previous review. Cutting hours to save payroll only hurts the customers in the end.
good,I really loved working here until management became a problem. I have a hard time balancing work with my kids and other actives at home. My co-workers are awesome but everyone is constantly in a bad mood because of the way that we are treated by management most of the time. I've learned a lot about customer experience and customer service and it will help me be more successful in future customer service jobs.
good,"On a typical day I would greet and check out customers. "
good,This company was a very active job even through if your part time you would be not only doing warehouse jobs but also cashier and janitor all in one. Even through when you first inquire about a Customer Service Associate there are no guidelines stating that you will be covering other peoples jobs. Don't get me wrong I don't mind doing cashier or even Electronic representative but being a janitor wasn't the idea I had a mind for a part time job. The hours was okay even through staying beyond certain time frame I didn't really see a huge pay in doing so because its a retail job. The best thing about this job was being able to sell product replacement plans and the more you sell the money you made on your paycheck when possible. But as I was told by an older employee who had been with the retailer long then me. Promotions from within was only given to a certain few who may not be a minority which I was sad to hear and see why people kept quitting this job. At one point the manager told me he ran out of hours for me because business had gone down due economic issues which I can understand but a person has to make a living for him or herself and that wasn't cutting it for me. So my advice take this job if you just coming out of high school but if you are a college student or beyond stay clear away from it.
good,"Any day can be quick paced or dead in the copy ctr with copies, posters, online orders, getting rewards. "
good,Nice part time job. Relaxed atmosphere and fun people to work with. As long as you do what you are suppossed to do and show up for your shift you will do fine here.
good,"Ringing up customers ,letting the new customers know about our rewards card. make sure they found everything ok. I  enjoyed seeing repeat customers .  management was close by. the team working was always helpful."
good,Very fortunate to be given an opportunity to prove myself and self developed concept.  Office Depot is very customer focused and for a large company works hard to stand behind its vision statement.
good,"I loved my job here, I had worked for a manager that I had worked for at a different company and we had a great relationship. He got moved to another store and we got a new Store manager, he tried changing too many things too quickly and did not take the time to get to know me before asking me to step down from my position. I decided to part ways with the company instead and go back to school for Cyber Security."
good,I learned how to prioritize different duties and delegate these duties to those I was managing.  Corporate and upper management in the position I was in (Furniture department manager) did not provide the necessary training or opportunity to advance.
good,Great people to work alongside. Low stress environment. The hardest part of the job was being away from family for such long hours. Everyone gets along and very easy to talk and engage with.
good,OfficeMax/Office Depot is a going place to start if you want to learn sales and stocking of shelves. You'll have a lot of training videos to complete throughout the course of your stay with the company.
good,Area de oportunidad en salud laboral equilibrio entre vida laboral y familiar . Atencion a los trabajadores.
good,Very fast paced work environment to complete daily tasks. The employees are very helpful to each other and to the customers. The ability to interact with customers and help them with their needs was exciting.
good,"Management does not pay attention to his employees when it comes to the work schedules, and payroll. The copy and print area was unorganized, the wait for customer service was not quick enough for the customers, and customer orders was not meeting their expectations."
good,I do not understand why I get underpaid for the work I do when I come into work. It is just a little frustrating knowing that there are some co-works who do the same work as I get paid a lot more than I.
good,"With the right management and excellent teamwork it can be either a great place to work or just another job for a quick paycheck. I've worked at a few different locations in different states. When management treats employees fairly (no favoritism, using correct choice of words, not abusing power, setting a correct example) it can be a great place to work."
good,Great job for people seeking a first job. My managers were always on their employees and it shapes you to be on top of your game. But theirs a fine line between being a manager and just being disrespectful and they are very disrespectful. Absolutely unprofessional and not called for. We as employees understand you need the team to always be the best. But verbal abuse is not needed. Hopefully other Office Depots are different.
good,"Responsable,puntual y siempre fijando una meta al dia"
good,"stock and assist customers"
good,"On an average day, work is slow at most times but can pick up at any moment. At times there can be miscommunication amongst coworkers and management and sometimes the assistant managers are not knowledgeable enough to fix the probably. The store manager would not listen to suggestions that could help the store run a little smoother. Also on some shifts, the store is understaff which puts a strain on the other workers. The co-workers there were awesome, I had a great working relationship with them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with my job and trying to do someone else's job when they didn't complete it.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction in completing the job or project giving to me and being able to sit back and appreciate what I have done."
good,"I enjoyed my time here, I feel that there was a lack of structure and training for advancement in comparison with some other companies, and like so many others they pay pennies and ask for technical knowledge and experience worth many times the wage they offer. Worst of all they have NO concern for their employee's future, when Staples made an offer to purchase they acted like it was the greatest thing ever, knowing full well it would cost hundreds if not thousands of jobs."
good,"OfficeMax was the first job I've had that allowed me to put some of my potential to good use but the environment within the company is very volatile. I've worked there 9 months and have had 3 Store Managers, and the assistant managers come and go even more frequently. "
good,"Job was fine if you like assisting people over the phone. I wound up doing a lot of deescalating situations, and that go extremely old. people would try and keep you on the phone just to run you in circles so the could complain to get what they want."
good,"A typical day is hoping that a computer comes in so you can have something other than planograms or stocking to do. If you want a job as a tech, find something a little better."
good,"Working at Office Depot was an enriching experience. I had obtained many experiences with dealing with customers need and wants. Management was good. My hours were compensated to my school schedule, which was perfect."
good,"started out loading and unloading trucks operated many types of equipment.Hi low,Stand ups,flat bed lifts also did put away both full case and large bulk items, became a route driver promotion ."
good,OfficeMax is a wonderful place to work. Great staff and great customers made working there fullfilling
good,It was a fun work environment. The employees were friendly. Management could and should improve.
good,"good starting place to work, customer service was not a priority"
good,"its really quite workplace. the people there are very tight nip you get the familiarity type, everyone seems to like it and they all joke around on the earpiece but they still get the job done."
good,Overall not bad for retail.  Didn't like the mandatory swing shifts for management causing closing one night opening the next (little sleep).  Advanced from stocker and store manager and championed district programs so advancement was good.  Towards the end got so micromanaged from the top felt alot less like a manager and more of a number and worklife balance suffured with amount of hours.
good,"I think that this company is a good one to work under if you're looking for employment, but it's important to note who is staffing the location you're seeking employment under because poor management makes the job and daily tasks almost impossible to complete."
good,"Good place to work if you  can handle high stressful situations and end time being different on a day to day basis. The end time is ""WHEN DONE"" which is different every day. Also it is very competitive and has a production quota you must meet. High volume"
good,"Day to day work was fun and always provided new experiences for me. I learned a lot about my own capabilities and capacity to work hard and meet deadlines. The manager was a jerk, and very sexist. He never gave me consistent amounts of hours, although I put in repeated requests. There was no understanding on his part for needing a sick/mental health day. Workplace culture was fun and we all were pretty much friends. It was always a blast working in the print center. The hardest part of the job was probably getting angry, difficult, or inconsiderate  customers, and the manager was AWFUL. (Just a heads up, he doesn't work there anymore.) The most enjoyable part of the job was walking away with new friends and the fun we had on the job, while still remaining serious enough to get stuff done."
good,"The job is ideal for people who may be in college or high school. Otherwise, there is absolutely no way anyone could survive off of the salary offered."
good,"Office Depot (office max) is an amazing store with amazing people. The environment definitely allows you to be yourself & it is easy to get along with others however, I just do not believe that the pay roll is the best. Minus that my experience there has been great."
good,"first impressions are important and my first impression is that this is a company with problems including organizing schedules, and training employees."
good,"You do not learn much. If you try and advance to learn more, then they put you in a department without much knowledge and make you guess. It does not take much to work here. They will hire anyone but be prepared if they just throw you random places and there is minimum communication."
good,This location has been closed and moved all work to it's Chicago location. During the seven years I worked there I enjoyed working with every employee they hired.
good,"After merger, hours were minimal. Constantly had skeleton crews, easily inundated with customers. Never got recognition for efforts. Employee moral was low. Management performance declined."
good,"If you don't get caught up in the drama of coworkers then the job can be fun.  There is a lot of negativity at this store.  The hours are not great, there are no benefits unless your are full time but all those positions are taken.  Some managers are great to work with, others not so much.  I have a good time working there as I do not get caught up in the drama and my focus are the customers who come in to shop."
good,"It is a place where you will learn a lot about many different types of products, but you will only learn these things if you teach yourself. There is not much training provided."
good,Great place to work for students looking for part-time employment.  It's been a great two years. I am appreciative of the scheduling flexibility that Office Depot has to offer.
good,"I was responsible for engaging and providing an exceptional customer service experience. I must quickly build ongoing customer relationships and become a trusted advisor by utilizing advanced selling skills and knowledge (including cross-selling of products and services) to meet the customer's needs. I had to demonstrate a passion for the brand, product and services solutions knowledge. I also utilized Office Depot's proven sales principles to proactively engage customers. I then must quickly develop product and solution expertise in key areas such as technology, furniture, with a general understanding of copy and print department as well."
good,"the atmosphere was very busy and very loud but this enable me to build skills in working under pressure."
good,"Long time at Office Depot.  Was hired when the first attempt to merge with Staples went belly up.  Was given the opportunity to develop and learn many areas of the organization.  "
good,"The managers were pretty nice except one manager that was very rude. One was also a racist but he got fired. My schedule was never the same for two weeks, it was always different. I used to get 35 hours but then I started dropping to the mid to low 20s. You can't really make plans because they will change your schedule like crazy. I was supposed to be a sales associate but I was stuck cashiering all day. Co workers were nice, I got along with almost all of them and they were really helpful. Hardest part of the job was probably having to offer protection plans that people wouldn't ever want."
good,Good management team who are friendly and comprehensive. The team leaders are hard working knowing how to treat their customers.
good,very cool place to work and learn things. Not to mention the new gadgets and software you can catch up on just really a office store
good,"Come in get your assignment, pick orders using pick labels, RF guns and stand up forklifts. Co workers were like family and good friends. We worked together to complete mission."
good,"Workplace is decent enough, hours are good for a part time employee. Wage is above minimum. Managers are friendly as are co-workers."
good,Typical day was fast paced constant customers and great creations with different works. I learned how to work different creating programs with no prior experience. The hardest part was to complete copy and print tasks with machines breaking down constantly. The most enjoyable part was my customers and creating.
good,Very busy work environment . Has some slow days and some days are very busy. Especially during back to school and tax free weekend ...its a zoo.
good,"A relaxed environment with the capability of being stressful in some ways is a good example of an everyday experience at Office Depot. The mornings were very relaxed with simple jobs to do for customers; for example copying a simple black and white page or faxing. The morning associate would finish jobs that could not be completed the night before. Afternoon was our ""rush hour"". Most of the time that is when the associate would take large orders from customers; for example it could be making business cards, or making books, or even printing out several posters. Another associate for Copy Center would usually come in to assist around 1pm. Our days could be simple or hectic, it really just depended on what was on the ""to-do"" list that day. It was a very friendly atmosphere. I loved going to work knowing that I could be around people that I enjoyed. I enjoy an ""office"" type of job where I can do any kind of paperwork or data entry..."
good,"This job is a good position for people who do not have families."
good,"On a typical work day I encountered at least 20 customers that had jobs ranging from simplistic to difficult. I learned that there are many kinds of people in the world and a lot of them wait until last minute to do things that are very important, It was my job to help them succeed to get this task accomplished in a short amount of time. My co-workers were great, everyone got along and helped out in each department when necessary. The hardest part of my job had to be the fact that I did not receive training in the department in which I worked, it was a learn as you go environment, which in the long run made me be able to memorize and do my job my own way. The most enjoyable part of my job would have had to have been the interpersonal relationship/bond that I earned with my customers, as well as the computer experience."
good,"a typical day at work is ring up what the customers are buying"
good,"Meet customer,find out what we will move and move it.I liked the fact that every job was different."
good,The staff is accepting and easy to get a long with making work enjoyable and quick.
good,Job was fairly easy stocking low supplies helping customers at the end of the day cleaned store.  Since the job was temporary barly got hrs. Supervisor was nice and let me work an extra month
good,Pay wasnt good for all the hard work I had to do. The employees were fun and nive to work with. The customers were rude. Management was horrible.
good,Man utvecklas mycket som person och man lär sig mycket varje dag.
good,"it was a fun and relaxing job, the environment was easy going and friendly cowokers. The only downfall is prevention of advancement or pay raises (they will use anything to not give even pennies as a raise)"
good,I loved working at Office Depot until we lost a lot of associates and managers. Then it wasn't fun being short handed constantly. The associates were great but it was hard to find good associates.
good,This job is very hard on the body at the time I was working there I was apart of the freight logistics team when they first started I'm sure things have calmed down but they aren't the most organized company and need to learn to cross train better.
good,Good company to work for other than needing to have open availability Sunday-Saturday for a 14-16 hour window. Scheduling is done about 4 days before the new week so planning anything outside of work is impossible.
good,"It's as though working at another retail job; it depends on your managers and location."
good,"The work place where I was had a lack of leaders for the job. after a fellow bosswas to leave, was hired I liked the old boss the new one took me off of my position in the electronics department and thought he could make better sales than I."
good,"Crazy from minute 1, extremely fast paced. Brand is moving toward a more service oriented brand concept, less retail sales. This has changed the culture a lot."
good,"Upon starting employment at Office Max i was told by the manager at the time  that i was way over qualified for the position in the print department. "
good,"My direct managers were awesome but I believe my issues are more with how the company runs. They are under staff much of the time, forcing employees to have to learn different skills to accommodate the high demand but receiving no compensation for the multi-skills they've learned for multiple departments. "
good,"I worked at office max during highschool and some of college, I helped customers with computer issues or concerns and was the computer specialist onhand."
good,"It was poor management, but the location was closed and relocate to another location. It was a better work environment since the two years at Office Depot"
good,"no one goes to work at offfice depot and expects to stay there long. there are chances to move up and become management but the responsibility and demand,drastically accelerates from what most part time employees can handle"
good,i think the setting in store is laid back but at the higher level they are always coming out with new policies that create confusion as well as whiplash with those who go into the store
good,"Its a good place to work part time, and the atmosphere among the employees was the best part about it. Like any retail job it had its issues, usually with customers, but I feel it could have been worse. The management at my location was good, with the exception of the GM who didn't seem to understand that my department was suffering from an employee who did not want to do their job. It wasn't the store's fault, and if we had another person on shift the job was downright good usually. Copy/Print is a service, so it isn't as cut and paste as the retail part of the store, but we had good training. Usually we would have at least 2 associates working so that if 1 was working on jobs, the other could run the counter. On closing shifts copy/print is responsible for vacuuming carpeted areas and refilling/servicing the copiers which is rough, but its better than inventory control."
good,"The job was overall fun. The culture was decent. The pay was decent for the amount of work. The benefits were decent also. Most of the store managers were great, unfortunately the store I worked at had a store manager more concerned with himself than his employees and that made it a little less fun."
good,I love working where I do. I get to make an idea into real life. The only thing that kills me is that I get paid less than everyone else in my department.
good,"Comfortable work environment, very busy and management was decent. Had a great boss at the time. Loved having my own office. Unfortunately, the pay was too low."
good,Depends on the store and the store manager I've work at serval store and  with great leadership from top to bottom will usually the work experience is great but when the culture isn't set in place there is no accountably it is awful just clocking waiting to clock out.
good,"great pace to work , just to many mangers that do not want to work."
good,"Daily Follow UP Calls, Prospecting and Portfolio Management."
good,When working here it taught  me a lot about customer service. I would recommend this job to any teenager in high school to get them started. The management is causally very good to work with
good,"I do enjoy retail, I just don't enjoy the inconsistent hours and the lack of benefits. I do like being around people and helping the customers. I also like to talk with the customers."
good,I enjoyed my time here. My district sales manager was awesome. Learned lot of things that helped me move ahead in my career. The place was getting slower and slower due to economy and oil prices. So management decided to close it down. Was good place with nice people to work with
good,I would have never left this company if it wasn't do to the lack of advancement within my store or the level of work and going above and beyond that was left unnoticed .
good,Everyone that they hire here or the people who had worked here are so nice and friendly to each other. So overall the environment is good. I just don't like the hours we get each week and the pay isn't that great.
good,"I would unload semi truck and I would put my deliveries on my truck and drove until all packages were delivered"
good,Was called in constantly because people call out. Never got a raise in the year i was there. Great team. Assistant manager and supervisors were great.
good,"Performed copy and print functions then later I switched over to Cash Register.  I held the top spot in the Rewards signup competition.  Also earned a $50 Bonus for my work with the Office Max Rewards customer loyalty program.,"
good,"Weekends off, over worked for low pay. New drivers coming in making lots more than drivers who have been there for years. No direction from transportation manager. Always told you what you wanted to hear but hid the real truth from the employees. Promised bonuses but never received any."
good,"This was an easy but stressful job, especially during back to school time. Management was very poor but the people were nice. The store was very clean and organized."
good,"My Duties and the Duties of the store often would be straining. My task was to work on corporate contracts that brought in thousands of dollars to the store dealing with their printing and production means. But the needs of the store often distracted me from those duties. While it was enjoyable to help people, it was distracting from duties others in the store could not fill in on professionally on."
good,"Office Depot is currently undergoing change following a buy out so there is added daily pressures and uncertainties around the business and site at Leicester. As yet the DC has been untouched however it is believed this may be reviewed in 6 months time with further redundancies"
good,"I worked here all throughout my senior year and summer. This is a great job to get a nice resume started for an upcoming college freshmen. All the positons are open, so even if you do not have the experience you can definitely get trained on it. The starting pay is $8.05. But that's typical minimum wage. Compensation is offered depending on your job title. You can get at least 20-35 hours weekly if you show that you are dependable."
good,"La boite a subi un plan social j’ai donc été licencié."
good,"Had the opportunity to meet a lot of great people not only outside the company via customer service, but inside as well. The pay and hours are okay, but wishing things were better."
good,Some of the best co workers to work with but it is an ever changing work  environment because of the merger with Office Depot.
good,"learned computer technology, copying, stocking and dealing with customers.the management was more interested in the women that worked there than doing their job."
good,"Operated cash register was the bulk of my duties. I was also responsible for stocking and restocking the shelves, assisting customers and keeping the front line clean."
good,I work in the copy and printing department and its none stop there. I love what I do and surely recommend it. Its extremely hectic and its not easy but you do get the hang of it. I also love my coworkers and there extremely helpful when CPD (Copy and printing department) gets busy.
good,"I love the job only because I love dealing with the customers, and some of my co-workers are fun to work with. I've learned how to stock in my almost 2 months of working there. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time and hours to finish my work."
good,productive and engaging work environment and great people to boot. Sometimes a few issues and tensions arose between management and employees.
good,"not a bad place to work, not the best. management was less than stellar - often incompetent, lazy and full of hypocrisy.... the expectations are very high with low wage (heavy lifting)."
good,"I love working at Office Max in the Impress department. I get to let my imagination and creativity flourish in order to give the customer a better product. In helping others, easing at least one burden from the customers list."
good,"I had this job during my enrollment at Texas State University - San Marcos."
good,Working for Office Depot was an experience always fast-pace.Co-workers are always involved.I would work for them again.
good,If you're looking for a job while your in school this is the job for you. There isn't much room to move up in the company and no raises unless you cross train to a different department. Management sucked. The manager was mean and never had the employees backs.
good,Everyday at this job I have to that team work is the most important .. aloso along with communication ....my goal is to one day advance in my career of choice. right now office depot has given me the skill to do that and the passion I need to succceed in a hectic retail world.
good,"I loved the work I did in CPD, but I cannot stand the upper management. There is no job security, they only come around when you've done something wrong, and they impose lots of stipulations and goals to high school workers that end up quitting, making the job harder on the people who have stuck around. Overall, I loved the job I did in CPD and loved my coworkers and customers, but upper management needs A LOT of work."
good,Everyone is nice certain management people can be difficult but overall its ok not the best job but ok. co-workers are nice its not the place that your are happy to go to everyday
good,"Arbeit: abwechslungsreich"
good,Only there for a few months but I enjoyed working there. I wish I could have stayed instead of moving from the state.
good,"Decent pay, good work environment, customer service is above average. Excellent guidelines as far as completing daily tasks. Peers work well together."
good,"Overall good place to work, secure"
good,"I enjoyed working here, even though customers, associates, and management were sometimes difficult to deal with. I learned how to build rapport with customers and vendors. Management, for the most part, was understanding and lenient, but were usually very fair. Favoritism didn't really rear its ugly head at this store, except for during selection of ""Employee of the Month"" and ""Brand Ambassador"". The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers that were extremely demanding or would ignore protocol and demand we break rules just for them. The best part was the customers who were very understanding and the repeat customers. It was easy to be noticed by management for your potential, but very difficult to advance; this is another area favoritism played a huge part in."
good,I enjoyed working here because I got to meet all types of people with all types of attitudes. It is an humbling experience. I enjoyed the coworkers I had.
good,"I enjoyed working at Office Depot although I didn't get paid much, it was still a job for me. I loved my management and the people I worked with. They did have me doing a lot of things outside my job description and expected me to work in many different departments and doing jobs they paid other people 11+ and they were only paying me 8+.. I would recommend if if you weren't looking for something to pay your bills, just to have some spending money"
good,"Knowing how to sell is key to working at Office Depot, I have done it very well and made 3 times my pay check from commission in some cases."
good,"Office Depot is an awesome company to work for they love there employees and treat them with respect staff is very friendly and have a different back grounds of all races theres wam hearts and faces starting with security, the managers, an all the staff."
good,"The typical day involved unload trucks, moving products to the floor and helping customers locate items. I learned a lot about how to manage inventory, improve customer satisfaction and maintain an efficient store."
good,"Fun place to work but the lack of employees on the floor gets stressful real quick especially when clients come in waves. "
good,Buena empresa y excelente lugar para trabajar y actitud
good,El tipo y cantidad de trabajo varía según la sucursal
good,Yearly store closures and position cuts. Multiple leadership changes yearly. Change in culture and goals with every leadership change. Company supplies little marketing support at store level.
good,"Working retail is rough, but this company culture makes it a little more tolerable. They value work/life balance, and are flexible with scheduling. Great place for students to work."
good,"Good company to work at, great people and atmosphere. You work at an easy and fast pace. Friendly people to work with. If you want vacation it well be hard to take off."
good,It’s a really good place to start acquiring new experiences in the work field. The only thing I criticize is their pay rate. I think they should pay their employs more than what they get paid.
good,"Typically working in the print department there are waves of people, so for 10 minutes you will be clear and for 20 you will be stacked with customers. It is just a balance of getting online jobs done and customers. It was difficult to work there and go to school because we were understaffed and I had no time for school work and was constantly stressed but I loved the job itself and most of the management. Its very rewarding in seeing the projects be completed."
good,"As people shifted to on-line sales, this model is dying.   Store closings, staff reductions, pay raises delayed - all were common."
good,management was a little off on this location as a cashier at that location I felt my opinions weren't heard and were pushed aside due to miscommunication but overall excellent work environment. all my customers were super friendly and willing to come back just to catch up with me.
good,Company went through a lot of transition but was able to do my job or anything asked of me.  The hardest part of the job was navigating internally.  But customers were generally happy
good,Good place to work part time only. This position does require physical strength and also timing to complete certain job tasks. I don't think the pay compensates the amount of work we put into the position. Hard times expressing work related concerns to the management. Position recommended for a student beginning first job or needing a part time with limited hours.
good,"Overall, Office Depot, Office Max is a fairly nice job to start off with. I've been with this company for almost 4years now, this being my first job in high school. It can range from being quick paced to laid back throughout the day, and the environment is pretty friendly.  This is a good temporary job for high schoolers or maybe as a second job, but I wouldn't recommend settling down here unless you're trying to ""move up"" in the ranks? I haven't received a raise in maybe a year or two? Last I checked, my manager told me I'd get an extra quarter tossed on my pay. But they do not do monthly evaluations, or any at all, to see if you've excelled enough to qualify for a raise. Since I'm a part of the printing department, we get A LOT of customers. Half the customers that come to the store are most likely coming to get prints and copies or even Fed Ex. I'm confident enough to say I've mastered everything there is to learn in the department, and for my level of knowledge, expertise, as well as custom designing for businesses- the amount I'm getting paid is no where near worth the hard work that I do. I'm requested to do so many designs, almost daily. Customers even request me to create their designs and come in on my shifts. If Office Depot had it to where employee's were allowed to gain a portion of their design comissions, maybe it would be worth the stay. But you can't expect much for a cooperate business. No tips, and hardly any raises. Maybe a whopping dime to quarter every now and then, but not enough to make me want to stay."
good,The day working is okay but they want you to push for customers to sign up even when the customer don't want to be signed up. And puts a lot on the cashiers to get the sign up and even pushing them to sign up for ink subs when they say no we still have to push for it.
good,"I got a temporary job for the back to school season at Office Depot, and they actually kept me after the back to school season. I had to leave because the job was getting in the way of my school/personal life, though that was back when I was in high school and I was literally required to be at school every week day. It paid fairly for the job I was doing, though it's not enough to live on around here, but I also didn't care about the pay back then. Management was the best I've ever experienced, super chill and understanding."
good,"As one of the Team Managers, our days started with Team Huddles to address concerns, team building, and update employees of expectations and current goal status'.  I enjoyed training employees and assisting customers with their needs."
good,"I worked at two different stores.  First one had pretty good mgmt., second was a training store for mgmt.  Not sure how much they spent training, but lacked any people skills training.  Was more like working in a high school environment.  Was required to watch training videos, but never given the time the do so."
good,"We try to keep busy on the slow days otherwise busy days we have a lot to do and have to keep up on the things we have to finish for the day, Coworkers are very nice and fun to work with."
good,"I loved this job when I first started, everyone in the store liked eachother, management was kind and understanding of needs. Store manager got transferred and they hired someone from outside and he came in and ruined store morale, other managers are great but the store manager was not very understanding and did not care for individuals, he wanted everything to be exactly how he wanted it and did not care what others thiught"
good,good place to work for if you want to be in retail. the management I had was great and were like family. they wanted me to succeed and move forward in life.
good,"On a typical day, I helped down stock merchandise from the overheads, operated cash registers, and collected carts from the parking lot as needed as well as near closing time. I assisted customers with locating back to school items. It went fairly well aside from having a manager blame me when a cash register frequently froze and needed to reboot"
good,"Es buen trabajo pero no se gana mucho, se rolan turnos."
good,"I operated duplicating equipment, served as cashier, provided inventory control and placed special orders.  I demonstrated equipment for customers in the self-service area utilizing my customer service skills and I provided preventive equipment maintenance procedures."
good,"une bonne entreprise pour débuter dans le métier de tech."
good,"Fairly relaxed atmosphere, training is rushed. Sometimes even skipped. Switch between stocking shelves and cashiering. The scheduling system is teribble. It is difficult to request a day off and even then you may not get it. The new district manager is taking over the store and reducing our hours even more (from 20 per week to 15 per week)."
good,This is a fast paced/high stress environment. As a member of the management team with office depot you are responsible for all aspects of the business.
good,"If you're young, it's a good place to start. It's very slow paced so if you like a fast paced environment this is not for you. The managers are great."
good,It was a pretty easy job.l staying focused was easy It had great room for advancement but horrible manager choices. All the big decisions came from corporate.
good,my job as morning logistics staff was stressful due to the work load we had. we had the most to do of any non-mangement position. we were given more hour due to this work load. the people are relatively nice to work with and the managers were easy to get along with.
good,"I found I really liked helping the customers. I started out full time then policy changed and I was part time and the hours keep getting less."
good,Decent job for young people who are in high school. Calm and collective environment. All depends where the store is located really. But also enjoy working and helping customers on a daily basis
good,"Development and growth focused place. Incentive programs,with a workout room to balance work ad health care.  Supervisory team cared about individuals"
good,"Once you get your things put in your locker, sign in and head up to your station for the day.  It could be either at a register or on the floor.  I liked working either positions.  You have such an advantage in selling extended warranty plans if you work on the floor, as you are one on one with the customer and guiding them to their best decision.  We did get a minor commission for selling EW plans.  Just need to watch your check to make sure you got the extra commission.  When working the register you have a better chance of getting the customers going online to do the survey about your service.  They then have the chance to be put in a drawing for $5,000 cash, and also, when we get a good rating, we as employees, get put in a drawing for a small amount of cash too.  3 months in a row I was the front runner, but did not get any recognition for said surveys."
good,I enjoyed my time here. The management was the main reason I left along with no room to advance. I did learn to work with many types of personalities both customers and staff. Can be challenging because upper management doesn't really know what is happening at the store locations. There isn't a training program and store managers really only worry about their own location.
good,Skeleton crew always and lots to do and not enough help to do it. Poor scheduling. Not consistent with days worked week to week. Schedule changes weekly hard to schedule appointments around it.
good,"fast paced got to be able to juggle tow or more things, the hardest part of the job is learning how to manage your time. The most  enjoyable part of my day is working with amazing co-workers"
good,"Lifting heavy thing, i learned that everyone was different people could communicate well and some couldn't so you had to find out a way to get everyone on the same page. The job itself was not to bad."
good,"I got lucky and had some awesome co-workers. I think I also found my niche for graphic design and customer service while working at the Print Center. Can't promise the same will happen to anyone else. If you don't like what you do, you won't like it here."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the majority of the coworkers because they are all around the same age so we all feel accepted and get along really quickly. The worst part of the job is dealing with the majority of customers when there is a slight change in anything such as an increase of price or a new policy and then they get upset with the workers that have no control over any company choices.
good,"Supervisors are friendly, the workplace could do with a good clean up, the best thing i enjoyed about working there was the work and people i built relationships with."
good,"It was a good job to work, and go to school.  I was able to manage my school work and work at the same time with no problems.  I would go back if the pay was higher."
good,"It's a great company to work for. "
good,this job was great for a secondary job in which i only had so many hours available. The management was potentially my favorite yet and the work load was minimal
good,The typical work day was very laid back. Everyone enjoyed coming in to work. Everyone got along excellent. We were really one big family. Also the manager spoiled the employees with food delivered often!
good,"An OK place to work but coming from a more highly skilled career path the position is low key, had to take a job because of forced health care,   ACA. Very high turn over rate of associates in this distribuion center."
good,Office Depot can be a learning experience as a first job or can be an opportunity to advance in the company. Benefits arent the best and managers do rotate so it can become hectic.
good,Working here was fun and easy. Main issue was the lack of technology for the department in which I worked. its very hard do function as a virtual developer or designer when the computers offered for the job are from the stone age. My cell phone had more RAM than the computers that were supposed to seamlessly run photoshop.
good,"For the amount of work required and expected, the compensation levels are low. The manager is a great guy and makes working fun and enjoyable where he can. But some disciplinary actions are just not there. Sometimes feels like if you go above and beyond, they will use that, and start expecting those extraordinary accomplishments from shift to shift for now on. That being said, I enjoyed a lot of the jobs perks, Black Friday was super easy. Christmas rushes are even better. The customers are more than  appreciative when assisted appropriately. And the amount of regulars that frequent the store and get to know the employees, makes just about every day worth working there. It is super easy to advance from the cashier position in as little as a couple weeks.  And, the Employees get a pretty great discount on some really cool gadgets."
good,It was o.k. when I first started and trained. Then there was a change in management. I feel that the training I received was not up to standards when the new management came back from leave and everything learned was not as I should have been trained. : (
good,"a typical day at office depot is pretty routine. always learning and training, very friendly. management is very friendly and sufficient. workplace culture is very dynamic and balanced out very well."
good,Door overname's en reorganisatie een uitdaging om de klanten te behouden
good,"I started working at Office Depot when I was 17, and as a part-time job it is what is to be expected. Not much room for advancement. I have learned a lot from being there, such as product knowledge and especially customer service (customer and employee). I could make a few recommendations to the management on how to build a better team environment. The hardest part about working there is being made to stand the entire day without being allowed to sit down. This makes a lot of employees irritable which in turn creates a negative environment."
good,Good work place with a fast pace.  Really enjoyed helping  customers build their business.  Enjoyed learning new technology and applying sales techniques.  The hardest thing about my role was helping my associates understand changes in the business model.
good,good place to work at every one is nice good to each other very helpful but the only bad thing is wearing the microphone hard to hear when every one is all talking at once sometimes it doesn't even work so our manager would get on to us about it and they don't even know that it works.
good,"Beaucoup de pression pour peu de résultats, clientèle peu exigeante en général mais managers qui se répètent beaucoup et qui passent beaucoup de temps en salle de pause quand on a besoin d'eux en caisse"
good,"Worked in print, customers there needed constant attention for their projects, not too much work. Overall a friendly place. Managers didnt do the best job of making the schedule, i really enjoyed the type of people i met."
good,"Corporate came up with some unrealistic programs and expectations"
good,"Declining industry look for turbulence and more job cuts with reorgs."
good,Could be a great place to work outside of work politics. I have a few wishes but who doesn't. No organization is perfect. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting involved in projects that directly align with the vision and direction of the organization.
good,"Una empresa muy buena, con un poco de obstáculos para subir de puesto"
good,Work day is busy and no room for down time. The job isn't hard and anyone can do it with the proper training. Engaging with the customers is the best part of the job.
good,I prefer not to write anything.  Hours and shifts are not Ideal. Scheduling and staffing does not leave you in the best possible position to provide good customer service.
good,The company is well and treats their employees fairly however management does need improvements due to the fact that the turnover rate is very high in my position due to lack of training lack of hiring and lack of advancement opportunities things not typical of a company of this nature and professionalism
good,"Print customer project and help customers in the store. Pay is minimal but it's a good place to start work. Busy during holidays. Have to print projects like documents, laminations, business cards, etc."
good,"Working for them for 3 years, it did take them 2 years to offer me a raise which was not enough, but I was not in it for the money. By this time, I was more into offereing services to my frequent customers."
good,"I been working here for a few years. I learned that you have to be very patient to deal with customers. The hardest task about working here is that many customers dont see that some things are far out an associates reach and management is most of the time to blame. Retail does consume you and sometimes it can be stressful so take the time to work on self outside of work. I started off as a cashier that would ring the customers up and provide customer service skills to everyone that came to my counter. I moved up to copy print were the heat of customers is more intense. Prints, copies, posters and binds is what I usually do in a daily basis and still to provide customer services skills. One of the reasons why I enjoy working her is because it gives me skills to work with difficult situations and people. Be warned it can be stressful."
good,I perfected my loading ad unloading skills here. The environment is very customer friendly. It's awesome to meet different types of people everyday. Friendly co-workers.
good,"The pay is decent, the people are friendly enough, the schedule is kind of odd and tends to start late and run long. but you have weekends off so thats a plus. They tend to hire from the outside as opposed to promoting people within though, and thats annoying"
good,"Early mornings, lots of customer service based work"
good,Doesn't have the best management in some of the stores and doesn't do much in the way of training. most of the training is required to do yourself and at your own time when you rarely can get the time to do the training.
good,"Product learning was a very rewording and the one on one customer service with clients was very rewarding A plus, the flexability of the work schedule"
good,"Decent work place with terrible pay (but what does one expect when minimum wage is below poverty line)."
good,They have set shifts and if you can not be there within their shift times you cant work that day. You get one break if cashier and do not have a lunch. It is not long shifts but you only have two options for shifts morning shift or closing shift. It is a smaller store so as a cashier you have more duties to do.
good,its a fun place to work at helping out customers with the items they need. Manager is rude if we well the old manager usually talks down on us if we don't get a card for customer he makes it like its our fault .
good,They have a great inventory system that shows locations of products on shelf and in top stock. New and updated receiving procedures.
good,"The work environment is comfortable and many ways to grow and learn. However, there is very little ways to advance in the job. I have been able to learn and improve my costumer service skills."
good,"My only issue is with the way that the customers and management staff treat the employees. From never giving us breaks and lunch, to throwing things at us,the customers and management seem to put themselves before the actual employees. To keep it short, sweet, and to the point, ive worked there for several months now and have only gotten maybe 2 breaks. On top of that, ive had rude customers get angry with me and complain about me for no reason at all, and have been confronted about it even though there were several attempts at explaining my story, all in vain. The other problem ive seen at this job is the way that the coworkers treat each other, rolling their eyes when someone asks for help, and spreading rumors about others' personal lives like its high school. I seldom say i have enemies, but i do have people at my job who dislike me for various unsupported reasons, which really puts a damper on working there. All in all, i love my job and wouldnt trade it for the world, but would really love to be respected more in my line of work."
good,"Busy work place with fun co-workers. Always on your feet, always moving. The next thing you know it's time to go home. You're so busy it's sometimes hard to relax when your done."
good,"Each day was interesting as you never knew what types of problems/concerns would arise."
good,I worked in copy and print. The days were usually hectic. Unfortunately i was constantly redoing other employees print jobs do to unsatisfied customers. When i wasn't busy doing print jobs i would go onto the sales floor and assist customers.
good,"The management at this particular is not the best. "
good,"A typical day at work would be hot because the a/c wasn't fixed but I don't know about the othe Office Depot stores. It would be boring sometimes depends on who your working with. The manager was nice and cool. She would give more hours if needed. Overall, its an average place to work at."
good,"Working together to feel safe and get the jobs done quickly while having fun!  I learned something new everyday, whether it was about technology, printers, how to cashier easier, ink, helping others, and so much more. Management was a wonderful team to have the opportunity to work along side. Co-workers were a great team.  At times the maturity level lacked and I did not understand why some would not want to help make it easy for everyone. "
good,"Opening and closing duties. Check out products and help customers find what they need, problem solving for customers, shipping and faxing sevices"
good,Most managers are pretty incompetent. Good job to have if your looking for strictly part-time work. Learn a lot of different skills in Copy & Print
good,restocking shelves of paper and pens and other office equipment each day. nice place to work at for a job but not much job advancement opportunities as a career.
good,En ocaciones chocan las opiniones de los altos mandos en jerarquias
good,"El ambiente con los compañeros es muy bueno, pero se ve opacado por la falta de oportunidades de crecimiento laboral y la falta de compromiso en el pago de tiempos extras ya que lo hacen a destiempo o a veces no lo realizan."
good,I was able to deal with a lot of people and get to learn excatly how to properly deal with any kind of situation. Working in the print department i was able to make and print all sorts of materials for customers while also giving me experience in being able to give them what they ask for.
good,"A typical day at work would be me clocking in and announcing the goal for the Print department over the radio. First thing first check the Print production log for any open print order that are waiting to be done or finished. Then greet customers as they approach the counter, assist them in their wants or needs for their print project. If their aren't any customers, I offer my assistance as a back up cashier & technician for the tech department."
good,Store manager makes this job workable.  I've been able to move up once I became full time but the wages are still low.  Store Manager is very flexible with my schedule and that is a major reason I stay.
good,As a Logistics associate i  typically deal with the incoming trucks and customers on the sales floor. i put way stock and use a telexon for excess stock.
good,had this job while in college. good part time work. flexible schedule. was a great place while also a full time student and the company was not shady.
good,Great place to work.  Would have liked to have more hours.  Shame they only hire temporary help for ninety days and rehire new temporary workers for the next ninety days.
good,"Company maybe leaving il.  No room for advancement ,  management will not have your back. The job culture is poor and depressing"
good,OfficeMax was a great place to work.  It was very family oriented and the management was very supportive of the workers making proper decisions.
good,learning how to do upsell was a challenge for me but it was fun taking on that challenge. but getting to talk to a different customer was the highlight of the job
good,In the beginning the company was a great place to work until they started to change upper Management and decided to merge
good,"I worked in the Impress Department of OfficeMax, I helped customers with many print orders and even helping customers by developing or editing designs that were for their business."
good,"I sold technology and furniture. Customer service was my main focus."
good,Not bad big compediter with office depot good employees pay not to good and need better customer support need to grow more as  company of  that size more as a team working better together
good,"Great company that had a positive economic turnaround and showing positive results with promising future."
good,"If you're working in sales, customer service, or logistics, working in an Office Depot store isn't all that bad of a retail-focused work experience. The work is straight-forward, decently delegated, and the customers--while many ignorant--are usually a pleasure to work with and have a good head on their shoulders."
good,"good first job for any young man or women looking for work, It had a great and nice environment for learning new skills that may apply to any job."
good,This position was new to OfficeMax.  They recently purchased Boise Cascade and I was the first outside sales person.  A typical day was cold calls and we were selling against Staples.
good,i loved working here i got alot of experenice working with this company i just wish that they cared more about there employees
good,"Very Relaxing And Fun Place To Work"
good,"It was rare that there was ever a dull moment at work because we were always so busy. I learned almost every position the job offered except for the grill area, and thankfully the management understood that. But, the hardest part of the job was when the managers were upset they took it out on us as workers and the customers spoke to us as if we were idiots. It was severely degrading and was what made the job unbearable at times. But, we all tried to be friends with one another and get along for the sake of the job, which was one of the most enjoyable parts of the job."
good,"This was a perfect job to have while going to school full time.  The management was nice and willing to work around my schedule.  The most frustrating part was the holidays.  I had to work on Thanksgiving, which is disrespectful to the employees.  There was basic advancement, though it seemed unbalanced as some people who deserved it got nothing, and others who didn't deserve to be advanced ended up getting promotions."
good,A typical day at work was both productive and rewarding.  Co-workers were friendly and fun to work with.
good,"I had some of the best co-workers and both stores I worked at. I learned very fast what my job was, and how to do and my managers appreciated it."
good,"Overall this place is a good place to work. I love the co-workers and they make the job worthwhile."
good,"The company was great when I was there.  The upper management had outrageous expectations for the stores and micro managed them accordingly.  No performance based advancement opportunities, all good ol boy system."
good,"US Multinational business that has just gone through a global merger. High staff turnover has left the business with a new leadership team that was rebuilding an under performing business."
good,"Office Depot is a good first job for 18+ year old people. It's not too stressful and a good learning experience. I learned the basics of being part of a retail team. My co-workers are the best part and are amazing to work with. The hardest part of the job is getting to all of the customers' needs with a small amount of staff (that could easily be rectified if the manager opened up more hours for us). Overall, it's a good first job but definitely needs room for career advancement."
good,At first it was good but management lacked in training. The hours are balanced within all associates.
good,Receive calls regarding business catalog request for supplies & furniture. Responsible for billing & ordering.Co workers were fun & helpfully.
good,Managers are extremely nice and helpful. Co-workers are very friendly. Great for a first time job.
good,"Bonne ambiance de travail"
good,provide outstanding customer utilizing the arc 3 program and give the sales leader a recap of what we did to make that customers experience memorable.co-workers are ok just need to be motivated. Hardest part of the job would probably be what's expected from the freight team in so little time.
good,Great job if your looking for something part time. Management is very helpful with making it a good job environment.
good,"fun to work for customers, understanding their needs and fulfill them. nice to see them happy in achieving their goals."
good,The best part of the job was working with the customers and coworkers were friendly as well.
good,"Working in the Copy and Print department I got the chance to help others express themselves with custom made business cards and others things. I learned how to really listen to my customers so that I could get a better understanding of what they wanted. The management team as well as fellow coworkers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job dividing my time between projects, because you get so into what you're working on."
good,"It is a good company to work for, but I havent gone anywhere. I enjoy working under my currents manangers but I want to go somewhere in this world"
good,I was a sales rep. this was a summer an job to have while i was in school. I learn how to interact with other people help out with technical problems and etc. My co-worker where great got along well. the hardest thing was the pay. I need it more money
good,el ambiente de trabajo suele ser muy bueno entre los trabajadores ademas de ser muy solidarios entre si mas el personal de recursos humanos deja mucho que desear asi como el gerente general.
good,"OD does not offer competitive pay rate. EVERY associate, no matter the number of years in retail, makes minimum wage.Pretty much my only complaint. Had I lived closer, I would have stayed. I had to resign due to school. Management was bad about changing the schedule on you. Other than those small things, the work was simple and enjoyable."
good,off loading trucks stock items sale computers and help customers
good,A very pleasant work environment. The delivery job is a back breaking job. its takes up all of your time monday thru friday. The management knows what they are doing. The co-drivers are very friendly.
good,Overall it was a good place to work in my experience.  I was able to move up the ranks quickly (sr tech in 1 month)  and pay increase with it.  I had a good experience.
good,Working was very stress free as the environment was very slow and relaxed. There were not a lot of growth opportunities. Better training would create a better work enviornment.
good,"Working for Office Depot was a great experience. Working in retail can be a challenging, but rewarding experience. Thankfully, my managers and co-workers helped me a lot and made my time working for the company a great one."
good,"We do our best to have a good time. Taking care of the customer and our employees."
good,"Felt a sense of belonging as soon as I started working there. Co-workers were very friendly. helpful and welcoming. Since I was in the area for only 2 months, they were nice enough to accept me as a part-time worker as I was also going to school."
good,"everyone there is friendly, easy to work with and they have your back. the work place feels comfortable, everyone there is like family, when you have something you need help with, they are always there to provide assisstance."
good,The positions are great. It is a high paced position within the store structure. The expectations are high.   Working at Office Depot is fun though because as a team they make the work experience fun. Customer interaction is at the highest importance for the organizations theory.
good,"This is an overall nice place to work. you are encouraged to make a sale go through with your customers whenever possible; adding complementary products the customer might need with what they originally came for. Be prepared to work in multiple areas of the store when requested. The employees who can sell the most services(protection plans, subscriptions, etc.) are likely the ones who will advance to higher positions over others. You do receive small monetary rewards on your check for most services you are able to entice the customer to buy."
good,Working at Office Depot showed me how work has to be done right and how completing the over all objective as a team is important for each individual. The environment was clean for the most part and everything had an order. Safety was held highly there.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, was learning to communicate better not only with employees but also with customers. Learning to operate various amounts of software that I had no previous training on before the job i.e. Microsoft Publisher and Adobe Photoshop. Bettering Customer Service skills to the point where our customers were only wanting to work with me specifically."
good,"Fast paced, Team work driven with training to move up if desired, very multi cultural environment and very friendly with chances to evolve in different departments. Started as a loader and advanced to Productions department and received training on P.E. to be able to deliver and close stores."
good,The job is fair and fun. You meet a lot of people who tell all kinds of stories. The managers always have a joke to crack and a tip of advice to give.
good,"When I was hired it was fun with friendly employees to work with but as the years drag on with previous employees leaving and new ones come in, I am stuck up at the registers helping customers check out and once finished, I find things to clean and stock to stay busy with. As new employees come in, I do not get to talk as much as I was before with my previous employees is enjoyed talking with, but now it's like my opinion does not matter and I just keep quite all the time during my work hours only to talk with the customers when they want to express their concerns on me. Now I am do not have a manager title and can not but in the conversations but they will stand and talk while customers need to be assisted and they rely on me to help everyone. The managers can be in a negative attitude when it is busy hours sometimes. The hardest thing for me is when I leave the register and a customer, who has came to me for help, needs assisting then out of nowhere a manager takes my customer away from me and helps them instead and wants me back up front. Also I don't like it when there is work to be done and everyone has time to stand around and talk. The things I enjoy at office depot are finding things to keep busy with like helping customers, cleaning the front area, stocking merchandise, helping other employees with small tasks."
good,"It is a great starter job. If you are looking for somewhere temporary or permanent, this is the place for you. I have been working for about 2 years and will reccomend this job to others."
good,"A typical day at work includes customer satisfaction and performing tasks required to help run the store smoothly. These may include helping in the print center with making copies, scanning documents, etc. It also may include being cashier to help ring costumers up for their purchases as well as helping costumers on the sales floor to find whatever they may need."
good,From the beginning to the end non stop working. i learned their work system in over a week with proper training. Management was cristal clear and straightforward. The hardest part was getting there really early morning every day and the most enjoyable part of the job was the monthly employees meeting about the company status etc.
good,"El día a día muy bueno, es una trabajo de gran exigencia, pero al tiempo de acostumbras y se hace mucho más fácil todo, buenos supervisores, buen local, pero considero que el pago debería ser un poco más"
good,It was a decent job. Managers weren't over bearing. There was a variety of things to do. It's a shame the store I worked at went out of business. The pay isn't that high.
good,It was fine.  Not great management but he was nice.  The manager ended up quitting with no notice and left us all working extra shifts.  But i liked everyone else I worked with
good,"Good atmosphere! Transitioned over into the Office Depot location in 2015 and has experienced nothing but great success....Going from Inventory Specialist role and moving up into a managers role, which was an exciting position....Recently I've stepped down and back into an specialist role, due to a family emergency, which I greatly appreciate, allowing me to step down and handle things with my family.."
good,"I really enjoy working here most of the time.  My coworkers are great, they are always willing to help and care about the stores success.  The main problem I have with working here is the pay,  it is minimum wage and I think it should be higher."
good,"Una empresa con buenas prestaciones, buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Priorities are in the correct place for the type of business it is, but with almost no advancement opportunities. Almost impossible to even receive full time hours and underappreciated workers produce a high turn over rate, very stressful work environment with little to no recognition, and just overall meant for a very specific type of staffing that most ordinary people can't fulfill."
good,"I worked for OfficeMax for 17 years. It was a great place to work, but as most big box retailers are struggling today, the lack of support, payroll and product assortment pushed me over the line."
good,Office Depot/Max is my first time working with the general public. The employees are very friendly and were able to help me learn and grow when it come to working with the General Public.
good,"You are giving tasks to do and everyday you just come in and start your work. You have daily task which you carry out on a regular basis. There are a lot of meetings and training which sometimes keep you away from your desk and work, sometimes all day."
good,"Responsible for selling only technology into all verticals for the state of Florida.  The work-life balance was excellent.  As a re-seller for many different vendors, I learned how to work with multiple partners and distributors to offer the customer the best solution.  I managed over 1000 accounts in Florida which meant not only selling into the accounts but retaining them too."
good,"Awesome co-workers, but the pay could be better. It's honestly a really good job, I love it! I just wish the pay was better. Some people come in and give you a hard time, but it's awesome that you can vent with your co-workers and feel better."
good,bonne entreprise mais celle-ci n'est pas compatible avec mon profil
good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of varied time periods working the registers (alone or with another team member, depending on how busy it was) and interacting with customers if you weren't on register duty. Management differed between managers; some were very adamant about the employees speaking to customers, others were a bit more laid back."
good,"I worked the print department, and I interacted with a wide variety of customers. I was always kept busy, and learning new things. The team was great."
good,Buena empresa. Buen salario. Recomendada para trabajar
good,"Everyday was a new lesson, a lot of responsibility in a fast paced environment. Earned good Customer Service experienced because of the daily situations."
good,Working at office max is a wonderful experience I started out as cashier and worked my way over to copy & print specialist and working with the public in this area was amazing over all.
good,"The job itself was not the most energetic or motivational experience as it was often slow and uneventful, but the energy and close bonds between the coworkers and management made the workplace feel like family."
good,Good fast paced environment meeting lots of customers with business problems.  Always something to do.  Management team good and worries about employees.
good,"Working for Office Depot I achieved a lot of knowledge and skills with operating a forklift, assembling and selling furniture, receiving and shipping merchandise and assisting customers."
good,"Es una buena empresa para cualquiera que no haya trabajado antes, buen ambiente, buenas prestaciones."
good,A great perk of the sales position with Office Depot is the Champion Circle trips. Attended four times and those are great memories for me and my wife.
good,I love working here but over the past few weeks i went from working 20-32 hours a week to only working 13-18 hours a week. The managers will complain about having poor workers but don't want to fill out the paper work to fire them. they complain on being over payroll but continue to hire more workers. the customers can be extremely rude or nice just depends on the day. one of the major downfalls of working at the Puyallup location means that there are a ton of theives and drug abusers that come in and steal.
good,i inventory all sm outlets also the warehouse. reconcile there sales every month. checking deliveries ang pull out products. they have a good office and co workers.
good,"This job is as stale as a year old bag of potato chips. What do you do everyday? A whole lot of nothing. You either are reseting the store, putting merchandise away, cleaning up, storing excess product away, or you are standing around waiting to ring up a customer, deal with a complaint of how prices are too expensive from pencils or paper, or even just dealing with your manager just sounding horrendously miserable about their life and job. If you need something that is easy, uninteractive and not difficult to get as a job, this is your calling. Otherwise, don't bother."
good,"At one time Office Depot/Office Max was a great place to work. The culture was one of taking care of its people.  Family was important. Today, it is all about taking care of yourself.  Everyone is under unrealistic expectations with the threat of termination if these expectations are not met.  Half of the GM's in the company were given Needs Improvement Reviews with an unrealistic goasl to attain in order to keep their jobs.  The District Managers are more concerned with keeping their jobs than helping the GM's be successful."
good,I didn't get the full benefit from working for this company was there for about a month and started having health issue's sad to say I had to walk away from this opportunity.
good,"It's a great place to work. The only problem is that they only offer a full-time position to managers. So you have to be there years to work your way up. However, the culture and atmosphere are amazing."
good,"Chill Job. Some customers suck, but that happens everywhere. Some days are busy then others you cold hear a feather fall, It is a very calm job for new college students..."
good,"There is always something to do and even though management sucks, your coworkers make up for it. Free Chick-Fila day was always great but this is a good store to work at, just management needs to improve a bit more."
good,"Overall, It is a great place to start working in retail. They offer many chances to advance if you are willing to commit and put in the effort. You are rarely rewarded for doing a good job, but If you make a mistake you aren't heavily criticized. You start off as a cashier and you learn the basics of how to interact with a patron. Then they typically give you video assignments for training purposes (which I never received). As long as you enjoy talking with people and helping others find their answers, this is a great job. "
good,a typical day at work will be spent attending to customers and their needs plus helping them choose between certain items. The hardest part of the job would have to be how slow and mind-numbingly boring it is to spend 6-8 hours working there.
good,Office Depot is a wonderful place to work.  It's fast paced in the copy print area and all the workers are nice to each other.  And the managers are very flexible.
good,The work can be quite frustrating at times but it does go fast when your team is helping. The hours can be unbearable if you dont have a strong support system to help you. I think the warehouse job is more for single young people that dont mind the long 13 hours or more thur peak season.
good,"You can move up but you have to commit, which, understandably, not everyone does. Just like everywhere there are good managers and bad ones. Sometimes there can be cliques among the managers. They pay fairly for the work you're expected to do."
good,"You have to be comfortable with the fact that corporate headquarters for most Retail business have high turnover. In one year I have had 2 different VPs, 2 different managers, and 3 different directors."
good,Work life balance here is not all they say it is.  Mandatory 12 hour days and working during PTO or your regular days off is not unheard of.  DM constantly calling you on off days.
good,"It was a good place to work for at Office Depot and Office Max occurred, career advancement was difficult.  Work life balance was difficult as I was required to work over 50 hours and after 40 hours the overtime pay decreased not time and a half like what is typical."
good,Office depot was an organized place to work when I was there which made it easy to work during the day.  All items had locations even the top stock.  The operating procedures were very clear and everything went smoothly.
good,It is not a bad place to work at if you are looking for a quick job on the side.  It is only part time which is not bad if you are looking for that.  It definitely does not pay the bills unless you advance in rank which is very rare.  Overall it is pretty fun and it does keep you on your toes when helping customers and doing logistics work.
good,The company is a good company but it's like they put to much stress and pressure on you when it came to upselling and asking customers for the extra insurance on the items they purchased I was really getting nerve wrecking because it was almost like management was watching you all the time to make sure you talked about the extra insurance and to be honest people wasn't interested in it
good,"I enjoyed the other employees. Easy going attitude always helpful, energetic, and mostly free spirited . Great discounts, company and vendor incentives were the best. Training provided from company as well as vendors within the company."
good,"A typical day at work is not so great, i learned how much customer service means to a company, management is key to achieve a company's goal, the culture there is all about sales, the hardest part of the job is coming in at 6 in the morning and lifting desks and chairs, the most enjoyable is cleaning when closed."
good,I was working  part time while looking for full time work- it was an interesting experience and I liked working for the prior manager- I was looking forward to learning management from him as he was good- they unfortunately let him go as they did not like that he was a hands on manager- sad
good,My time at Ashfield was somewhat brief. The poeple I met during my time were very professioal and the working environment was fantastic place to work. The MD was a very pleasant man to work alongside.
good,"Some of the management is less than usefull, but there are some rockstars that make everything worth it and make working for this company enjoyable. the pay isn't the best, but it is a still just another retail position, so typically you can't expect much at all anyhow."
good,"Learnt to excel in costumer service. Coworkers help was a big plus. Management was, at the time, very productive. Learnt to place large scale orders in copy and print, furniture, and tech departments."
good,I was hired at office depot when i was 16 years old and it was a great experience to learn about myself and how working with customers is awesome and getting feedback to how well i served them.
good,"We had a lot of planograms that were expected to be finished in a timely manner. we had all sorts of printers, computers, and laptops that I was responsible for to get up and running. On the laptops I put a program on it so people weren't able to put their passwords on them. We had computer programs as well that were flying on the shelves a lot. I enjoyed going to Seattle for demos on how to use the new programs that were coming out as well as going to conferences enabling me to better learn how to best serve the customer through asking various questions."
good,Working at Office Depot is fun! The working environment is great.
good,ok place to work for but want to move up quicker. They don't provide enough help for your position and when asked its always call another store.. Help me progress not deter me
good,"Assisting with managing day to day operations of the store, working with employees, helping customers, doing receiving duties, stocking product to floor, setting planograms, etc."
good,"es buena empresa para iniciar un trabajo laboral, para personas jóvenes."
good,"Not a boring day passes, a new situation, new customers, and new challenges everyday! Never a dull moment, the job is also rewarding when your customers come back to you and trust your judgement as their certified tech advisor. But ..... Pay can't raise a family and barely pays your bills. Great place to work for a kid just graduating Highschool."
good,Lo que más me gusto fue conocer al personal y el trabajo en equipo.
good,"A great team made all the difference.  If the store hadn't been shut down in favor of keeping open larger, less well kept locations we might still be having fun.  However, budgets and management drive bad decisions faster than a sports car and so our little store was gone in 60 seconds."
good,"It is a decent work environment, and a relatively fair job; would recommend for people.Workplace culture is alright, and management is understandable. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers."
good,good work place...love going to work here everyday..ive learned how to talk to people professionally  management of this place is awesome they treat their  employees right...hardest part of this job is going home...the most enjoyable is management having a BBQ every quarter.
good,Fun environment working with customers and learning sales techniques. Good experience for people looking to get into retail/customer service. I learned a lot while working here.
good,Typically it was mind-numbing labor work. Managment was fun to hang out with since there was a party culture outside of work. The compensation was poor for the modern era but they don't require experience so what can you say.
good,Postion afforded experience in dealing with customers and fellow employees in providing an overall productive culture meeting Office depot goals. Great computer training to maintain up to date info for employees.
good,"low pay, only $8. per hour.    alternating times of easy and frustrating, especially when it came to heavy lifting - loading big boxes of paper or boxed furniture into customers' cars."
good,Mangement postions are competetive and working from a sattelite has its challenges regarding access to important information on a regular basis. I would say overall good place to work
good,"Great job, poor management, pay does not reflect the amount of work produced in copy/print section like i was. I would go back in a heart beat. I loved my co workers and my job."
good,Typical days were kind of slow with spurts of high traffic. I did learn how to talk fairly well with customers and with how small the store is learned  at minimum the basics of each area . The management varied a lot some where very nice and relaxed some were a bit more on the serious side . overall the workplace was decent. the hardest part when i was there was how inconstant the trucks we would get for merchandise some shipments we would get 3-4 pallets other times we would get 10. the best part for myself was when we would get truck done reasonably quick with some customers made those days go by quick.
good,I dealt with customers. Learned a lot when it comes to tech and management. It was a very fast paced job. The hardest part of the job was to reach certain goals in the store. The most enjoyable part of the store is the employee that helped and train to be successful as my self and providing excellent customer service to customers.
good,"Don't really know what the company is like after Office Depot and OfficeMax merged.  When the company was OfficeMax, they provided great career advancement and training."
good,I use to have customer that came in to see me when some projects needed to be done. I have learned to pace myself and get the jobs done. I love working under most mangers until the change started and things had to change. The hardest part of the job was went we didn't have the coverage on the floor to assist the members. The enjoyable thing that I love was to help customers and see them come back for more services.
good,"easy to learn,"
good,"The job is really slow and relaxed. Management is super nice and everyone is great to work with. Always helpful and understanding. Pretty chill job, would def recommend."
good,"I would not work there again, but I would recommend it to someone else. I was the youngest and I think that I was treated with little respect due to that."
good,Kept me on my toes with lots of different responsibilities. I liked the fast paced environment. The people you work with are generally nice people and are all looking out for each other. Sometimes the customers can get mad at you and you have to have a bit of a thick skin.
good,"buen ambiente laboral, no hay oportunidad de  crecimiento, mala organización y planeacion con los empleados"
good,"I enjoyed my time the management were easily approached "
good,rather fun but many slow days. There can be rushes and the day moves more quickly with more customers. Overall the other staff are friendly and helpful.
good,"Environnement de travail agréable, très bonne expérience"
good,Great place for a first job. Management works well with all staff to keep that store running the way it should be. Great for getting a feel for the good and bad of customer experience.
good,It was usually slow paced but that was good as it allowed me to get a feel for customer service and get into working as this was one of my first jobs.
good,"It has taught me a lot about working in retail, and helped me develop skills with which I can succeed in other positions. I deeply enjoy working there."
good,It was a good experince working there but the hours and benefits where poor. Not much understanding with the assosiates. Good for a job start not for a career.
good,"It's a great job for high school, doesn't pay much and it gives general skills like customer service. Sometimes it is really slow and other times it is packed like in back to school."
good,"The organization was focused on delivering products and services as efficiently as possible for the corporate customer.  The systems in place, from the online ordering portal to next day delivery, were state of the art."
good,oversee day by day operations make deliveries oversee eight drivers and nine routes load and unload trucks.started as a route driver then a rotation driver then a lead driver then i was made the operation lead so i ran the warehouse most of the time. the hardest time is when the truck is late and all 1600 pkgs has to be sorted and loaded.the most enjoyable part is when everybody shows up for work and the truck is on time i have time to catch my breath.
good,"Pleasant atmosphere, but the machines kept breaking down!  Heaping amounts of work, insufficient number of employees in copy center to deal with customer demand."
good,"Good place to start from if you want to be good at customer service. Do not think it isn't difficult, as customers will always be after you for one thing or another, but it is for solutions that you can solve without incident. A great way to learn how customer interactions should go and how to temper yourself for dealing with difficult customers."
good,"I had the opportunity to work with a wonderful store manager, assistant store manager, and logistics managers while I was with this company. The most difficult part of the job was the constant changes in personnel just before the Office Depot buyout. There was a stretch of time where there were managers who micromanaged the print department."
good,Any typical day at office max you work 8 hours.Nice working enviroment and you learn alot about the retail buisness and the customers and managers are nice to work with
good,"I just had a bad experience working there. I have heard somethings about being there, but mine was it was way to competitive where the sales associated were always bossing the managers around and I couldn't stand that. Also there was a lot of drama."
good,Great place to work. I am challenged to achieve a better understanding of our products everyday. The staff is extremely nice and I am fortunate to be able to work here.
good,"Usually easy and calm work day,  customers occasionally caused problems due to their bad days. Simple job,  only had to cashier and clean the story during closing"
good,I feel like they could have been more organized with management and hired better managers because some of them honestly didn't know how to run a store.
good,Man simple task that usually can be completed by your self or with another associate. The hardest task at the store will definitely be helping with bad customers.
good,"Project manager for high end commercial interior design projects. "
good,Office Depot its a good place to work if you like to be involved in all the activities that the company as. If we have a good quarter we will get bonus and free lunches for accident free.
good,"Once you've clocked in you start on the fill list if your manager approves. You stock the empty places throughout the store for an hour before the store opens. Once opened you continue the fill list and help customers, this being the most annoying thing you have to deal with mostly because the customers take away time from completing your other duties. once finished you move on to paper work which is more about stocking the store. Then you have your freight days when supplies come in and you a day to finish between 4-9 pallets. Probably different for every store. They tell you to help customers and finish breaking down the pallets and put everything away before you leave. The hardest part of all because if you don't complete before your shift is over they ask why your working so slow, and why your not able to complete your work. This was my experience and yours may be different but just a heads up if you're thinking about joining them. "
good,The pay at office max is decent but  salary increase is few and far in between. Management is efficient with personnel training. Commission based incentive on technology is great also.
good,"Great managers and coworkers, slow paced, great way to learn to use fax and printing skills, great benefits, greats discounts if in need of technology."
good,"Overall, OfficeDepot is a great place to work. The employee discount and the benefits package is actually worth it for full-time employees. The only issue I see with the company isn't even an issue with the company, it's an issue with the senior management in this region,"
good,Trabajaba ayudando a un amigo a repartir todas las cajas a las oficinas de wall street
good,"For part time employment the hours can be very flexible, but staffing can be thin so don't call out.You will be tasked across the whole store and have challenges completing tasks. Lots of interruptions."
good,"I enjoyed my time with office depot, I would see a lot of employees come and go but always everyone was friendly and great to work with. It can get stressful at times (something you will learn to get used to is being understaffed daily) but just as quick as stressful as it would get, it would turn into a relaxing environment without many issues. Overall it was a good first job especially for experience."
good,"Very slow until the start of the school, then it is just chaos for a couple of weeks. Besides that they really just pushed you to sell the warranties and credit cards just like anywhere else would."
good,This was one of my first jobs and I really liked it. The people were fun and I enjoyed working with them. I worked there for 5 years before the store closed.
good,This was temporary. The days were long at times however the work was simple .. I do not have much of a review or tips because I wasn't there long enough.
good,I liked to people I worked with. Everyone was extremely helpful. I learned a lot about the public selling system and on running the cash register. Loved working with the public.
good,"The management here was always great, the people always had a good time here. The management wanted to make sure you were comfortable while working that's for sure."
good,"Fun place to work, and a nice team that is always willing to help you learn. They train and work with you constantly and help you along every step of the way."
good,"Office Depot has an amazing culture with great people working in its company. They do an amazing job with management and who they choose. The only real downside to working their is the lack of ability to advance in the company. It is a really, really slow process for most employees. Including myself. I would still recommend them though. Especially as a first job/part time job."
good,"Coming to work in the morning, I prepared for the order selecting process.I continue supervising and observing the operation as might change during the day. I learned new processes and train associates to do and understand them. I enjoy when my team realized they hit the goal for the day and we started wrapping up to pass the operation to the second shift team."
good,"I enjoyed working at Office Depot. The people were great and the work was rewarding. I worked cash register, some print services, Tech Depot, and Logistics."
good,"Dagelijks contacteren van mijn klanten "
good,"Been a while, but I remember vividly having overall good management, for the most part (the few bad asst. managers didn't stay very long). Was able to build a VERY good repertoire with the customers, who would ask for us BY NAME."
good,"Learned lots of new things. I worked in the Impress department so I learned how to make business cards, flyers, stamps, and other cool things I did not know how to do. Also learned what services they offered."
good,"Stocking shelves, helping customers find ink, toner, computers, paper and everything in between is the daily job."
good,The only positive side of working here is that the hours are very flexible which was highly beneficial the time I was a student. It is a slow paced environment and very low stress.
good,"This was one of the worst jobs with management I have ever experienced. The management did not care about their reps. Especially if you were a female on the particular team I was on. "
good,Empresa responsable con su personal y atención al cliente.
good,"Typical part time sales associate job. Fast paced, flexible hours. 20-30 hours a week. Management is decent. Probably has changed management since I was there."
good,"I had many opportunities learning different parts of the business. I was able to work with different teams of people which made the job very interesting."
good,Plenty of opportunities for learning new skills. Very Corporate atmosphere for day to day. Loved working the Tech desk and helping customers with any and all issues.
good,"It was a job didnt love it but didnt hate it. You worked a a seasonal and if they liked you enough you where hired on. Great people, it was fun, 3rd shift was my favorite."
good,"Very productive workplace, if you didn't produce you were written up. It was mandatory to get production no matter how hot or cold the warehouse would be."
good,Empresa sólida en vías de Expansión con una administración antigua
good,You will get the occasional angry customers. However in my store the managers dealt with these angry customers so it made it much easier for me. Getting to talk to different kinds of people was enjoyable to me.
good,Working at office depot will be a challenging thing and gives you good working experience if you are a person who likes challenging roles. overall this can add an great advantage to your experience as there are many roles involved in
good,The job didn't really have any challenge to it but was a great way to get some work experience and learn about customer service. It was a great community that was always fair.
good,Office Depot has its perks. however when it comes to hours and pay its doesnt have enough to provide full time. everything else about the role. i enjoy
good,Not a bad place to work really. The raises they gave weren't good though and it took forever to advance. After awhile you get asked what shift you want.
good,"Starting my job at office depot, I completely loved it. I loved working in the copy and print center plus my manager was the best ever. I left because I had a better opportunity for my future and the store was just going down hill. New employees came and go, nobody ever stayed including the assistant managers. Customers were rude and would throw items at us or talk down on us. It just became a hostile environment and that is not what I wanted for myself. However, they were extremely flexible with scheduling since I was in school, so it worked out perfect for me, work days usually weren't very long and the work is very fast paced. You must be willing to learn all parts and aspects of the store in case someone calls out. Nobody is stuck as a cashier their whole shift."
good,"Hours are typical 9.00 to 17.30"
good,"Can be very boring when slow, pretty easy job. Do not recommend working in the print department. Doesn't pay enough for the level of responsibility required."
good,The job had challenges daily. We all worked well as a team. Daily we were able to complete tasks. The hardest part of the day was dealing with the customers.
good,it was a good Job we worked I learned a lot of skills working there as far leadership packing skills and also communication skills teamwork was very important we to get a lot of tasks done in a certain amount of time
good,I didnt work there that long bc my branch had closed but it was a nice place to work. Very relaxed and cool people. Work wasnt hard at all most of the time it was just standing and talking.
good,fast paced but fun and learned a lot. learned how to multitask and how to work programs I didn't know existed. management was okay but now the greatest.
good,My experience there was not enjoyable. They ask a lot from their employees without offering very much compensation or benefits. I would only recommend working there temporarily.
good,"At the time I worked for OfficeMax, the company had become a bona fide category killer.  Customers wanting ANYTHING for business, offices, or schools had a one stop shop for everything they needed.  Replenishment and fulfillment systems were efficient and required only a modicum of employee involvement."
good,"Office max es un lugar bastante agradable para trabajar, hay una buena relación entre los compañeros y los jefes suelen ser muy accesibles con las necesidades de sus empleados, ademas siempre estan dispuestos a ayudar, el trabajo exige que seas bueno para realizar varias tareas aparte de la asignada por tu puesto, lo que da la oportunidad a aprender nuevas tareas de otros puestos al mismo tiempo que desempeñas el tuyo."
good,"Was a summer job. Had fun doing it. The people who I worked with were good people to work for, they motivated and encouraged growth. I would recommend this job to a friend if they were in need."
good,Working at Office Max/Office Depot seems to be a very nice place to work. So far enjoy meeting all the employees and also nice to meet people. Looking forward to the future.
good,"I transitioned into Office Depot from another retail store and the change was much needed. Just like all retail companies, they provide a hair pulling scenario between payroll, employee benefits, expectations with operating procedures, and lack of communication. But, they are not nearly as bad around holidays and planning as other companies I have worked for. Their biggest opportunity is that the payroll model and logistics model for the higher volume stores are not efficient. They need new ones and no one wants to listen about your idea to change it. Also, their training videos are not effective. Overall, not a bad place to work, but not the best."
good,"Existe buen ambiente laboral, obtienes aprendizajes sobre, inventarios, cortes y arqueos"
good,"I had no problem working at this job, the only thing I didn't like was when I requested to work mornings on the weekends I would never get it. Other than that it was a laid back job but could get busy."
good,Very fast environment with lots of items to be in order and packaged quickly. A lot of office orders to be filled. Input delivery orders. Check for container availability. Sort papers. Interchange tickets sort by orders of dates. Copy paper needed and record driver logs and give back to the driver a copy.
good,Associates have fairly structured work days.  Most management teams are trained fairly well.  Great place to get training for products and learn retail.
good,"The Employees Made It A Fun Place 2 Work At, The Location I Worked At Which Was In Dearborn Wasnt 2 Busy Which Sometimes Made The Shifts Go By Very Slow Or Boring. If You Are A Cashier It Was Fun And Easy But If You Had 2 Work The Floor It Could Sometimes Get Annoying."
good,OfficeMax was wonderful environment to go to everyday.  Regular shared lunches and social events. Busy and fast paced work but vibrant and social as well.
good,"Office Depot is a huge company with many levels, divisions, and layers. I only experienced the in-store level. As a retail establishment, yes it is somewhat wearing work. It's not overly hard or complex, but their applicants are the bottom of the barrel and management struggles to make a positive situation out of low wage, unmotivated employees. Overall their corporate structure is very organized and their ""upper level store management"" is often very hard working and positive. The management teams seem to feed off each other and keep each other from running away from retail and so they keep some pretty talented managers and staff in many locations."
good,"The time that I spent there was a little chaotic as that management was going through a shift and stores were being bought out. Otherwise it was a fun place to work, always things to do, projects to work on and the people were a lot of fun to work with."
good,"the job was fair, i had not too many complaints on my end of the job . the employer of the building where very friendly to me and was always there when i needed a hand."
good,"Trabajé como promotor de créditos,y si volveria a trabajar en la empresa.y aprendes bastante sobre tecnología."
good,"New store hire, set pods per OD guidelines and stocked store for grand opening. Manned the front end cash register, stocked and worked in the Design, Print,  Ship department as needed. I loved working DPS where I could print, fax, help customers with whatever their needs were, ship UPS packages, refill ink cartridges and a host of other things I might not have learned as just the front end cashier. "
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, aprendí sobre el manejo de efectivo, trabajar bajo presión y practique mucho la atención al cliente; la parte mas difícil es el trato con clientes difíciles, pero la gerencia apoya bastante al trabajador en estos aspectos. Lo que mas me gusto fue aprender bastante y ser tomada en cuenta para realizar diferentes actividades."
good,Working there was nice. I had a good discount and the job was easy enough. The only thing was trying to get the managers to remember to give you time off for classes.
good,Good company to start out with if you are looking for a first job. Stayed for a long time due to loyalty of co workers. Large corporate company can feel impersonal but that is sometimes a good thing.
good,"Een organisatie waar ik al ruim 11 jaar met plezier werk. Een organisatie, actief in een branche die zijn uitdagingen kent. Veranderingen hebben plaatsgevonden om de organisatie de komende jaren extra toekomstperspectief te geven."
good,They have excellent people in charge  they provide good benefits to their employees and is a great place to work  show res[pet and professionalism to all employees
good,work atmosphere is fairly laid back. Customer service driven work ethic in order to drive sales. Days are fairly consistent as far as day to day work needing done. Have to be able to help a wide range of customer in order to get be able to discover each needs and provide a total solution for every customer.
good,"To work here, you must be able to balance multiple tasks. Stockers have to have all their work done in a limited time while still having to help customers and their fellow employees. Copy and Print workers get loaded up with many projects at once that customers want done by unreasonable times and they can be rude and nasty when told their project can't be finished in that time limit."
good,The job was seasonal but it was okay overall. It wasn't no hard work but it was interesting and some what challenging trying to gain a certain number of rewards.
good,"I worked at Office Depot warehouse for about three years. It is a good job with great benefits and I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested. Also, they hire pretty quickly which is a plus."
good,"This was a pretty fun job for the most part.  I walked around and helped customers, tried to sell them extra things, and maintained the cleanliness of the store.  Sales goals were sometimes too ambitious but there weren't any real consequences to not meeting them.  Advancement isn't really there for me because I was delayed in moving to a Sales Manager position until my boss got promoted and left without promoting me.  The store will usually have 4 managers and with not many of them around there aren't many open management positions at any given time."
good,"Es una excelente empresa de la que estoy muy agradecido por todo lo que pude aprender y el despunte y empuje que me dió. No fue posible consolidar mi promoción para tener un balance bueno entre percepciones y responsabilidades, sin embargo y sin duda fue una excelente etapa de crecimiento."
good,"Everyone got along really well and helped out each other. A specific boss did not get along with me personally for reasons ive yet to learn. I always treated everyone with respect no matter what. The job was overall easy because the way they explained my duties i was capable enough to understand the first time, and rarely had questions once i started doing it. Although i believe questions are recommended to be asked to ensure you perform the job correctly."
good,The days can vary greatly from being very busy to only have a few customers per hour.  My current store manager is very nice and approachable.  My fellow coworkers are very nice and helpful.
good,"A typical work day includes: designing posters, business cards, banners, and flyers, and collaborating with other coworkers to help design projects for large and small businesses. "
good,"Flexible hours even though posted as 8:30 to 5:30. More about getting the job done. Best feature, the down to earth nature of most associates. Downside, industry downturn has caused tremendous stress on associates at all levels creating a less than favorable environment."
good,I learned how to communicate better and how to make customers come back . The hardest part of the job was keeping myself busy because services were very slow
good,"A typical day at work usually began with making sure we were fully staffed for the day, setting our sales goals for the day. I enjoyed because every day was different, you never knew what to expect."
good,Office Depot is a great place to build your career.  You will have to work hard and be passionate about what you do to grow within this organization. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with everyday!
good,office max is easy going work place not a hard job at all with good people who love to help as much as they can at all times so yes good place to work if i may say
good,good training session .... okay hours  ... good place to work if you are looking for a jump start in career for computer and tec ......................
good,Office Max is a great place to work for part time. They will meet any schedule conflicts that come up. Full time schedules can be scattered at times but overall it was fun place to work at.
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Very laid back and easy job, for the most part. I was promoted quickly (a few months after initial hire), and they pay for training and everything. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with my peers and learn together. Hardest part was dealing with conflicting views from superiors, but you take it and go with it."
good,"Más cultura de trabajó."
good,"Office Depot is a company in decline that is struggling to compete with Amazon and others. The previous CEO was brought in to merge Office Max and Office Depot and provide cost synergies, but did not find ways to maintain sales. Coworkers were generally helpful and kind to each other, doing their best to improve profitable performance of the company."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere"
good,Working at office depot can be crazy but it is a great work environment that makes the day go by faster. Management at time can be over worried about making money that they over shadow the associates
good,As long as my customers were satisfied that's all that mattered. I had several different job duties which was mainly making sure all customers are treated equal
good,"Nothing to tell, I unload the freight, sort the freight, then stock the shelves. "
good,The coworker are ok but this place doesn't tell you anything you've done right only everything you've done wrong. They over work you and  never thank you.
good,"Great team work with other team members. Great rapport with with customers that I delivered to. Vehicles maintenance kept up to date."
good,"Kind to employees, gives many breaks when needed. Managed well but unfortunately due to working in a new location it did not exceed and I had to find other work."
good,it is  a good  company to work  but only disadvantage is  people stay  there for life  long  so there are not  many changes on career path
good,Great company. Not much room for improvement or progress in the company. Management was great and attentive. Work is part time only.
good,"Good entry level positions for sales and management oriented people. You can learn sales, stocking, ordering, management, etc in a small box environment."
good,Read sku and search for appropriate location. Inventory and product loss prevention.build displays and make labels for new product. Stock product in its proper location and carefully organize older product.
good,Working there was fun due to the coworkers I had. Management was always willing to work with me on my schedule when things came up.
good,I love to help customers with computers whether it's selling them or fixing them. Unfortunately this company has stopped repairing computers for the time being. Overall the management does not respect it's employees and just cares about making money and helping their customers. I would probably never work for this company again.
good,"Emplois sympathique,organisation et motivation personnelle requis ce qui me plaisait beaucoup. Collègues et environnement très appréciable. Horaires très agréables, me permettant de concilier vie personnelle et vie professionnelle. Management clair, précis, efficace et a l ecoute."
good,Help customers find supplies as needed. Pay could be better. Expect a lot of you for so little pay and little time. Sometimes customers could be not so understanding with time frame. you will meet a lot of business people that will always offer you jobs.
good,Excellent DSM that helped support the team and was very engaged with customers.  Team building is a focus throughout the organization.  Company encourages a work life balance as well.
good,this was my first job in the high desert and I enjoyed working at office max it is perfect for a young student to learn customer service skills. and take these skills to another job and apply it.
good,"If you have a great store manager then, even if your district manager is terrible, you'll make it through and enjoy the work. There are opportunities to move up, but most places will require you be available to work full-time for it, which is to be expected. Most health care options are cheap compared to other places, but are for preventable medical help. It beats working at a grocery store, and is often a lot cleaner. Your experience will depend on the team you work with. Some stores care about everything and in some stores there isn't a person that cares about more than being paid. I was fortunate enough to have a good, strong team with only a few problem people, and we did well."
good,"Office Depot was a great place to work.  My managers were great and the work associates were very easy to get along with.  Pay was the only issue.  Other than the pay, every other aspect of working for Office Depot was pretty nice."
good,summary says it all. the assistant store manager and the supervisors were great however. store manager had some personal issues he needs to work on.
good,It was a good and fun place to work. i worked the closing shift so there was a lot of high schoolers so it had its ups and downs. People called in a lot.
good,"In 2014, Grand & Toy conducted a survey of key stakeholders in order to establish which sustainability issues were most important to them. Each respondent was asked to pick five aspects they considered to be the most relevant. "
good,"COMMERCIAL SEDENTAIRE,en interim, la mission s'est achevée dans le cadre d'une restructuration"
good,"cashier, train, daily paper work, special orders. Changed the complete computer system. Sent me to school to train all the employees. The CEO said it was the smoothest change had ever seen. Everyone was well trained."
good,"Amazing company to work for and grow with. I started with OD-OM in 2012 and have moved all over the country, because of the ethics with this company that are hard to find anywhere else I keep coming back."
good,"High quality in product"
good,Good place to work just not enough hours .One week they give you 6 hours and the next week they give you 20 hours. Overall it is a fun place to work at.
good,"Its a decent job overall. But the company seems not to care about the work overload. I'm only one person. And we never have enough payroll"
good,Typical days can be rewarding. Management training programs are really good. Expectations can be a bit out of reach but ample time to improve is available. An overall good place to learn retail.
good,"My problem wasn't really with the work itself. I enjoyed the work and was quit good at it. My issue was with the constant cutting of my hours, which i really needed at the time."
good,"Overall, I enjoy working for Office Depot/OfficeMax. I've learned how to communicate with customers better about what they're wanting, and I've learned how to prioritize jobs in the fast-paced environment that is the Print Center. On a personal level, I've also gained invaluable knowledge of different production processes, as well as knowledge on how to set up and send digital files to a printer correctly."
good,"A day at the Copy and Print center was typically fast pace, multitasking with different projects, and working with customer. I learned organization is key to any job, especially when different projects are getting done. Also, communication between yourself and the customer in order to get the job done correctly and professionally. Management was pretty well organized and communication among one another, as well as with the associates. The hardest part of the job was working with customers and their time limit of when they wanted the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was that customers knew you by name and I already knew what they came into the store for."
good,Good Place to work slow advancement opportunity. If you are a hard worker and follow company policies to the letter you can succeed.
good,"Pretty fast-paced, some customers are difficult but others are great. It's retail! Most of the managers are great. I only had trouble with one, but the others were competent and easy-going."
good,"Friendly co-workers, fun to be around. Great environment all around great store. Learned how to break pallets down and build them."
good,"Good place to work with good co-workers and very nice customers. Manager works with you arranging your schedule needs as much as possible. "
good,"Great opportunity to learn sales/trend analysis. Many training sessions to attend, but you must take initiative to grow your career."
good,"I rather enjoyed my time at Office Depot. The environment was very professional, and the work was on par with my ability. My only complaint was the elder supervisor, as he would create problems where there weren't any. They were many customers to tend to at time, but we all worked as a team for the most part t oget the job done. The hardest paart was dealing with the manager, as for the fact that he would bring up something that wasnt really an issue, or blame me for prblems I had no part in or control over, and then resume to not give me a proper way to fix or address the issue."
good,"My first experience at retail and learned so much."
good,"Working at two different OfficeMax locations has allowed me to see the types of work places one can expect. Some days are more hectic than others or during back to school season; but overall the people working there make you want to be there and create a great atmosphere. Being a sales associate means handling the register and forming relationships with the customers through exceptional customer service. I've learned several things about the items we sell along with the addition of working the print section. The management has always been flexible with hours. However, the set up of the stores and how they are run could use some work. The main thing I would disagree with is the script they make you use at register."
good,Office Max was a great places to work. Through this job I was able to perfect my customer service skills and time management.
good,"- The typical day for a sales associate includes restocking shelves, helping customers find products they need, straightening the products on shelves, and doing projects and tasks delegated to the associate by a manager. "
good,Office Depot/Max has given a lot back to their employees and creates a fun work environment.  I enjoyed my time with Office Depot.
good,Good place to work. Great building and amenities. Decent amount of time off. Hard to say with merger with Staples happening or not..?
good,"I enjoyed my 2.5 years working there to say the least. By the end, management made me feel like family and the work load was not too much. However, it was clear to everyone that we did not have enough employees on each shift to complete the desired tasks, but they still got done within a certain time."
good,"Some days were busy, some days were not. The non busy days were a bit boring. Co-workers and the manager were fine. Typical retail pay. Not a bad place to work."
good,"Worked on local and out of state projects from initial conception through completion."
good,"I've worked here for two years. Friendly people, friendly atmosphere, part time, flexible hours, five percent commission, busy store location"
good,I have gained a lot of experience and knowledge to the inner running of a retail store at this job. I have been able to learn many positions and learn how to multitask and flex to other areas as needed.
good,"Great working environment filled with knowledgable experiences. Positive work environment combining management, sales and customer service."
good,The pay was good but the hours were long and did not mesh well with having time for family. Quality customer service. Not enough employees so there was plenty to do. Good company culture and training though
good,"I liked working at the center, had a lot of friends and enjoyed the work. I only worked Monday through Friday, no weekends or holidays. I liked the work and enjoyed talking to the different customers in different states."
good,"Typically what was done everyday was vey simple and taken care of correctly. Floorstaff, customer service, cashier, and at times, stocking, really were the most important jobs being done. I learned that without team cooperation there's barely any type of work being done. Management is was strict but it was on point, not just any slack type of job, the managers placed instructions as they suppose to. The people I worked with were the best, they really did work as a great team to reach weekly goals for the store. I honestly can say that the only part of the job that was hard was multitasking between customer care. But I enjoyed the job because everyone I worked with had no complaint."
good,"A typical day would start with unloading pallets, then putting them on the correct carts to then stock on the shelves. If I got that done early enough there would always be a checklist or some other help, and random tasks that needed to be done.  I enjoyed my managers, they were very good to me."
good,Very fast paced environment where customer service is most important. Being in management took strong communication skills and prioritizing different tasks at hand. Overall the customers and employees were very happy leaving the store everyday.
good,I learned all about customer service as well as handling cash. I am able to deal and resolve all customer issues. I also learned phone etiquette.
good,Solid management and culture. Promoted six times in 11 years. Toughest part was the continued buyouts. Great opportunities for those that didn't lose their jobs with the buyouts.
good,Not a great job but not bad either. If you can excel here your future is bright within the company. Fair benefits and time off provided as well.
good,"Too much work, very few associates and very poor training for print and copy associate. Have to adapt really fast to fit in."
good,"Une journée de travail se compose de l'accueil de clients et d'accompagnement dans les achats. Il s'agit également de la fidélisation en proposant les meilleures offres."
good,co workers are ok but management can be a bit challenging due to their own personal problems that they bring to the store and the district manager is okay
good,"Um bom local de trabalho,bastante movimentado com mais de 300 paletes por dia.Todos sabiam o que fazer e todos conheciam as operacoes para fazer o departamento correr tudo bem.Todos sabiam que tinhamos que dar o nosso melhor todos os dias.No fim do dia era uma satisfacao ver que tudo tinha sido feito."
good,"I learned plenty of sales approaches, how to use xerox machines and even do some very minor repairs to them. A bit sexist environment overall throughout the company. Tend to not hire females for technology or management positions."
good,Nice products and environment.  Room to grow if you are motivated and put in the effort. At the time the company was constantly changing.
good,Fun to work and supportive management. They worked with you and helped you grow. work hard and rewards will be there. Team work is important and is part of the culture.
good,"La oportunidad de conocer el sistema de compra y venta, saber valorar los requerimientos para devoluciones y garantías, brindar las ofertas del día."
good,it was a pleasure working here at office depot the employees was friendly. It never was a dull moment here at work i loved it
good,Recent and pending mergers have made work somewhat challenging. Pay is lower than industry standard and if you don;t impress the district manager don't expect to go far. Store managers are great.
good,"I loved my position, and what I did. I loved my customers and the employees that I supervised. However, payroll was always a problem. Due to payroll being a problem, our really busy store was always short staffed causing a bunch of problems."
good,"Payroll"
good,"Average company, new workers paid better than old ones. Typical corporation. Nothing special. Nothing Special Nothing Special"
good,"Management is great, need more employee involvement.  Need more management training.  Overall is a good company to work for."
good,Delaware store has room for advancement especially when you learn a lot about the comapny you can apply within to other locations.
good,"Wonderful, clean, and fast paced environment to work.  It is all about the people you are with, as I was able to work at two stores.  High quality of product delivered to the community and online customers."
good,I enjoyed working with my co workers. I have learned how to deal with irate customers and how to calm them down. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day.
good,Can be stressful if you are the type that wants 100%. The staff can be trained more thoroughly. I've almost trained myself to do what I do now. They are very bad at simply responding whether to a customer or co-employee. There's very little communication between shifts so the process of daily objectives are stretched to where it's almost unnecessary. And with commission being so low (5% for any store outside of the top 100 in Plans and Services) it's kind of hard to be motivated by anything else than just pure competition.
good,The company has been in an ongoing merger. Constant policy and procedures changes make if difficult to perform at the optimum level.
good,"If you've worked in retail before, you should know what to expect.  Office Depot isn't especially better or worse than any other employer you'll find in this setting."
good,Great company to teach you how to grow from a manager to leader to owner.  Requires high attention to detail and time management.
good,"With 13 years at OfficeMax I earned a lot about the ever-changing world of technology. I worked with a great, dedicated team focused on customer service and a well-merchandised store."
good,"Overall Office Depot is a good place to work, they need more people at the front and on registers, and more people in copy and print."
good,"On a typical work day my main focus is to make sure our customers receive the most memorable shopping experience. I achieve this by personally making sure every customer is taken care of and receive a smooth, fast, and simple shopping experience. I also train and coach associates to make sure they are giving the best customer service."
good,"Office Depot is a decent job, but take it with a grain of salt; it is a decent job ""for retail work"". It isn't a fantastic job by comparison to other jobs I've held, but for what it is (a retail job) it's pretty good. The compensation could definitely be better than it is (especially given some of the stuff the employees have to deal with), but the managers are generally easy to work with, and are willing to respect work-life balance, especially with regard to college students. It isn't my first choice for employment, but I would recommend it to those looking for a relatively easy paycheck."
good,"Es una empresa solida y buena en General, el departamento en el que yo entre era de reciente creación y aun le faltaba un poco de estructura."
good,"Colegas muy amables, buen sitio de trabajo, horario accesible. Lo malo es la falta de compromiso con el personal."
good,Corp gives you lots of support and the company tools have grown and are very useful.  Customers can be a little demanding....advancement has become very difficult.
good,Great company at one time.  A lot of turnover before the company was bought out.   Many stores closed and lay offs happened.  I was one of them.  Work was fun in my store.  Plenty of down time to train employees and role play.
good,Fun group of co-workers made this job much better. This job involved multi-tasking customer service and sales simultaneously.
good,OfficeMax is a place where an employee can enter as a cashier and work up to a managerial position. They always strive to better sales and the overall customer experience. Their staff is well trained in all things surrounding office supplies and consumer electronics.
good,"Great company, strong core values. Many tenored assiociates. "
good,"Officemax was a very productive workplace. There was always something to keep you busy,and that was one of the big things I learned working there. You always have something to do, and you always ask others if they need help. My co-workers were all very nice and easy to work with. I think that the hardest part of the job was dealing with displeased customers. That also was a big learning experience for me. I had to learn to stay calm and diffuse the situation and make the customer happy to keep them coming back."
good,"Imagine a morning as a remote worker: You sit down on the couch with your laptop, start running through your to-do list, while slurping Lucky Charms out of a bowl and watching Survivor reruns. Spoiler alert: That is not what it’s like to work virtually—not even close."
good,A typical day at the job consider clocking in and going to your department to see what needs to be done and assisting the customers that come in. I learned some things that I didn't know about some of the technology components. Management was very good at their job. I enjoyed working with my co-workers because we were able to teach each other some things about the job. The hardest part  would be the disgruntle customers. The most enjoyable part was getting to do what I love and that was deal with technology and provide customers with what they were looking for.
good,it is closing and had changed company s three times in the short time i was there then they are being bought out not a stable place to work
good,it was  good place to work easy tasks great coworks but the bosses were push overs and some people suffered for it staying late to fix other mistakes and bosses leaving early
good,I learned a lot at this job about retail and customer service. I would recommend this job to anyone that wants to acquire skills and a good work ethic.
good,"My days are filled with interacting with customers to discover what computer problems they may be having, or what technology product best suits their needs. After the customer interaction comes the time when my colleagues and I work, using various software and techniques, to fix the problem on the customers computer."

good,"Un dia normal en el trabajo era muy tranqilo, si llegaba mercancia tenia que descargarla del camion para posteriormente exhibirla en pasillo, con precio y en su respectivo lugar, y de ahi atender a la gente y mostrarle la mercancia, aprendí ah utilizar softwares que en la empresa era necesario utilizar, la gerencia no era muy participativa en el area de lo operativo, solo se encargaban de las tacticas y de decirnos como hacer las cosas, mis compañeros de trabajo eran un buen apoyo porque entre nosotros nos ayudabamos a realizar el trabajo mejor y mas rapido, la parte mas dificil era hacer varias actividades al mismo tiempo cuando estaba acomodando la mercancia en su lugar y un cliente me distraia y lo acompañaba al pasillo donde estaba lo que buscaba eso hacia que me perdiera de mi actividad y me desconcentrara un poco, lo que mas me gusto del trabajo era el ambiente laboral ya que no trabajabamos bajo mucha presion y todo el personal haciamos equipo para un mejor trabajo."
good,"Empresa solida, lider en ramo papelero del pais, politicas bien establecidas, regida dentro del marco legal en todos los aspectos."

Aprendi a trabajar bajo mucha presión y a ser  valorado solo por cumplimiento de objetivos . la empresa   al ser una multinacional enorme solo eras  un nº .  A nivel de compañeros muy buena  sintonía . Mantener una cartera de 60 000€ solo vendiendo consumibles de oficina justo en el arranque de la crisis  esto resultaba difícil.   Me justo el reconocimiento de mis compañeros  pues durante el 2005-.06- 07  quede dentro de mi rango de cartera de clientes  en el primer puesto (con consecución de premios como tres viajes de incentivos a diferentes países  EE.UU  en Hawái por  ej.)  .esta claro que la empresa no lo entendio asi  . Y también la relación personal con  los clientes que  se acerca  a veces  a  la amistad  y saber que  ellos confían  en ti y no les puedes  fallar.
good,A company that challenges one to do their best.  A friendly environment that allows one to learn and grow.  The company is very customer service oriented.
good,Great work/life balance and management team. Loved the ability to work as a team during meetings then execute tasks independently with minimal supervision allowed a low pressure yet effective work environment.
good,It was a typical cashier job. But the company relies on numbers way too much. It affected the customer service factor too much.

However, the other associates that work here are very kind and helpful. Management is only seen when called or when there is a sale to be made."
good,Early Mornings are very quite and focused on daily task. A little chaotic at opening. I learned how to better engage with customer on a variety of products. Management is at par when it comes to cooperation and assistance with a couple of shining very helpful managers. 90% of Co-workers are very reliable and willing to work a team. The hardest part of the job is likely the need to be able to work all departments. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting task complete and seeing customers rejoice in what they see before them in store.

good,Providing customer service and performing transactions with little assistance.
good,For how much they charge for items and how much work you do they don't compensate you nearly enough. I worked computer repair and sales rep for technology making $7.40 an hour by the time i was done there (2 Years 3 months). You can make more for skills you have and use. The management is having hard times with staffing for the reason i listed above.
good,"It was great having a customer oriented and team based working environment. The coworkers were fun and it was a very easy job.

My co-workers were probably the most relaxed people to work with, never stressing out on tight schedules and always having fun. the hardest part of my job was managing a two departments.

good,"I was contracted when I worked there, so I don't know about there benefits and direct compensation.  What I do know is that management kind of stuck together.  The manager that I had was not a nice person at all and hardly ever spoke to me.  Maybe because I wasn't actual employee?  Either way, she was so rude.  And I found that the departments were built of ""cliques"".  Some people were friendly, some not so friendly.  Beautiful office, the cafeteria is awesome, and covered parking was a plus."

Also having a set time  (Depot Time) for all associates to be on the floor was the best idea I have seen in a store yet. During the busiest times was the best because we were all out there helping the customers and knowing we were working as a team."

I love to learn new things & so I learned a lot about printing, computers, various software programs, computer networking & more.

The store played games to learn new things instead of just training videos, had incentive programs and awarded bonuses for various displays of excellence (including stocking the break room with drinks & snacks for the employees to enjoy on their breaks).

good,I learned alot about technology and different software.. how to use and exsplain them.
good,During my time at Office Depot I had the opportunity of working with a lot of great people including managers and co-workers. When I started I only did the very basic of tasks which included stocking breaking down and sorting freight as well as putting on the shelves. Over the years I have moved from being just a stock person to a person who has worked in all departments where I assist customers whether it is just around the store finding an item or placing an order or dealing with an issue a customer has.
good,"*Duties: Opened and closed store, supervised the tasks of store staff. Administration of store transactions and depositing, product shipping and receiving and compiling of various daily and weekly reports as required by store management."
good,"Friendly staff, always willing to help the customer find what they are looking for."

good,The most enjoyable part of my job is time management.  I work in a very fast paced work environment with minimal assistance.  Every day is different which I love.
good,Early morning great second job part time hours don't have supervisor breathing down your neck cool co workers at my location in Chesapeake easy work any one can do it if your a overnight person 4am-8am
good,Management here had its ups and downs on one side the driver manager who use to be a driver at one point was great because he understood what we would go through in out daily routes but the main manager had never been a driver and would always give drivers a hard time for taking more than a certain amount of time from stop to stop
good,It is a nice place to work. They offer a Monday through Friday schedule which is nice. It is a smaller center so the day does not feel as strenuous as other centers I've been in.
good,Fun as long as your team supports you. Retail breeds turnover so you need to be able to balance lots of training new people. Company is restructuring again so get answers before you commit.
good,"Working here was fun, the management was good, co workers were fun to talk to, at first I found it hard to interact with customers but I got used to it pretty quickly, its just a really good starter job."
good,"The atmosphere is extremely relaxed, everyone is super nice and will to help you with anything. Coworkers are the nicest people and since there are so few of us, you start to feel like family after only a few weeks time. The management team is wonderful and willing to help at any time. The overall work is basic retail stuff like cashiering, stocking shelves, helping customers find things around the store, which is all easy to pick up on. My only real complaint is that it can get extremely boring on low traffic days, which gives you more time to get to know coworkers, and the pay isnt much to live off of, especially if you live alone. I loved my time at Office Max but ultimately had to leave so that I could move on to a higher paying, more challenging position."
good,"I think Office Depot needs to focus less on corporate and shareholders and more on customer and employee satisfaction.  Make coupons work without 1000 exclusions.  Also, they should offer better insurance."
good,Great atmosphere and friendly coworkers. Very team oriented environment. People work together to achieve tasks assigned. Management has an open door policy to discuss any issues or concerns.
good,"Cant say much bad about it, the clients are great sometimes you get some that are not so great, but over all it's a good environment and the staff made my day."
good,"It's a dying retail operation. It's sad but most people are getting this stuff at Walmart or Amazon. It was great interacting with customers, but, most of the day is spent at the register, resetting the displays, or straightening shelves. Pushing Loyalty sign-ups, bending over backwards if we get a bad online review from some nut job who does nothing but complain is the focus"
good,muy buena empresa exelentes instalaciones del coorporativo
good,It was a good place to work but hard to move up. The management is fair and most of the time easy to work with. The employees are also quite easy to get along with
good,"A typical day of work at Office Depot would go as follows; getting rewards signups, greeting and engaging in meaningful conversations with customers, and pushing sales in every area of the store. While working at Office Depot I picked a new sales skills such as knowing if a customer is going to buy that day or just window shopping by listening to key words they might say and body language. The culture of the job is like a family even though we were a very diverse group of employees including races of black, white, Mexican and middle eastern. The hardest part of the job was constantly learning the new sales promotions every new week nut the most enjoyable part in my opinion was pulling the tags on Saturdays."
good,Working with Office Depot has been a great experience; A typical work day is coming in with a plan to help my associates and I obtain our goals and also make it fun while doing so;  The best skills I have at Office Depot is Customer Service and delegation; Being a manager with Office Depot has been a great experience not only am I only responsible for my area yet I am often in charge often of running the store because I work with the Store Manager.
good,"A typical day of work include hitting sale goals, replenishing product on sales floor, greeting / assisting customers. while working in office depot i've learned to time management , mult-task , working at a high pace environment ."
good,"Develops and implements tools and analysis that assist the buyers in the management of their categories."
good,"Pretty good experience if you’re looking for a first time job in retail. It is very male dominant but everyone was pretty friendly. They do focus on “the customer is right” philosophy though, so that can be frustrating at times but then again that’s all retail really. Not a lot of benefits if you’re only part time though."
good,"Great job to work at for gaining experience in the workforce."
good,I liked working at OfficeMax. I liked the people it was a fun environment. I left because there wasn’t enough compensation and managers refused to move me up after being there for 3+ years.
good,"It's a nice place to work at of you need a job fast, only downside I experienced management sometimes seemed to pressure all of its employees even when reaching goals"
good,"Lo que aprendí en esta empresa fue bastante en diferentes áreas y lo que más me gustó fue haber recorrido varias áreas durante mi estancia y aprender diferentes funciones. La parte más difícil fue no haber tenido la oportunidad de crecer laboralmente, puesto que no había vacantes y lo que más me gusto fue haber aprendido de todas las áreas."
good,"Te job itself is fun and lets you be creative, but several workers were less than desirable. the managers are the same. the job was almost always changing and getting worse to compensate for the paper business failing"
good,"I love the people I work with. The fun part about the job is that I never know what each day will bring. The managers are laid back. The other employees are friendly. They are flexible with me scheduling wise. My issue with them is that I don’t get paid enough for what I deal with. If it wasn’t the for the fact that they pay low wages, I wouldn’t be looking for a job right now. I got a promotion and am not even making $10 per hour.  If you’re good at promoting their programs, reliable, and work hard then you’ll get a promotion."
good,"En lo general buena cultura organizacional, empresa de buenos valores, estructura corporativa eficiente, buena programacion de cargas de trabajo, unidades de trabajo confortables, interes por cuidara sus colaboradores, niveles de tabulador adecuados y paquete de beneficios muy buenos."
good,Cool place to work. Fast paced challenging work environment. Nice pay and performance based bonus. Culture is very corporate follow the rules and everything is good.
good,"Competitive wages"
good,Cuentan con las herramientas necesarias para para la labor silicitada en general me voy feliz por aprendido.
good,"Working here is a great place to learn how to work in a professional environment. The store level culture is great, but the corporate culture is questionable."
good,"An excellent way to gain experience for future jobs. Really enjoyable place to work at, there was nothing hard about the job. My only complaint is that they expect you to do so much for minimum wage, there's a lot you have to sell, a lot of other tasks that you have to do other than your main task."
good,was great working there as a team member and also as manager later on.had fun celebrating Bdays and holidays and also big achievements for store and company.
good,"Sales of office supplies including furniture.  get to know businesses and be able to provide them the solutions they're looking for, in addition, introduce them to new solutions based on my expertise."
good,"It was just OfficeMax when I worked there.  Not a bad place.  Laid back, relatively low stress.  Nice people, pay was about average.  I would go back if the opportunity arouse."
good,Its a nice place to work at but not a place to get a stable income. You gotta have clear mind to deal with customers. This place made me learn that we have some entitled people.
good,It was a cool place to work and they let me work around my school schedule. Management was cool and not too demanding. Work load was light. And I received a raise pretty quickly.
good,"My experience at the Office Depot Copy & Print center has been positive overall. It can be very stressful and chaotic, but the print department has taught me a lot of very useful and marketable skills. Also, my coworkers have been excellent. We really are a team, and we look out for each other at this location. It may not be the most ideal place for someone looking for a permanent career, but for someone like me - a university student who needed a useful part-time job with flexible hours - it was great. With this location located in the Lafayette area, around 20 minutes from Purdue Campus and less than 10 away from Ivy Tech (by car), it's a really friendly place for a student to work part time, and you get discounts on all sorts of things you really need: pens, pencils, paper, binders, bookbags, calculators...even some specialty things like architect tools, slide rules, etc. Plus, associates get a big discount on print services, so you can print out stuff for research papers, presentations, or final projects and make them look really impressive to a professor for a pretty cheap price."
good,"The commute was rough after location moved from Garland to Ft. Worth, TX, "
good,The typical day at Office Max is slow-paced. The things that keep from wanting to stay at Office Max are pay and advancement. You're basically stuck in your position unless someone leaves and you are closest to management status.
good,"Many companies talk a good talk but OD walks the walk and really cares about their people.  "
good,"La gerencia se deja guiar por jefes, sin antes escuchar la version propia de uno como afectado."
good,"I worked there for about 6 years. Sometimes it was busy you would get complaints sometimes, lot if times not enough help, couldnt really get overtime. Had to always watched others and cashiering was a bit challenging."
good,I learned a lot from this company. The Assistant Manager was very helpful and friendly. The Store Manager was the reason I left this company. The print department is always poorly trained and staffed.
good,Make alright money just need a full time job and the management is good very relaxed and I also just need a full time job and they just need part time right now.
good,"The company as a whole is very stable and easy to work with. In my experience, management is typically very understanding when it comes to scheduling. The only drawback tends to be with low staffing (in some areas), and a high turnover rate (due to most people choosing the company for temporary or short-term work.) Building a career with OfficeDepot OfficeMax should mainly be for those looking to get into a very sales-heavy career or a corporate career."
good,"Management could be better, lack of leadership.  Co workers where always great.  Paid vacation is always a plus.  Took away pay for holidays which didn’t go well with employees.  Under staffed."
good,"I have worked at office depot on and off for several years. I have seen the changes good and absoultely awful!. This company still lacks a direction it has many facets of operation that need to be containted and perfected."
good,Long hours really good and good people and bosses were lovely and i enjoyed it at office maxs and i dont mind working there again amzing stuff and repacking nd putting stationary into packs was really cool
good,"Glass ceiling if you are looking to advance your role within the walls of officedepot and office max."
good,I loved my team I worked with and management was great as well.  It's a family feel working there and I learned a lot.  Training is thorough.  Pay is usually minimum wage but okay for a art-time position.
good,"I enjoyed working at this store the fellow employees were like family. Management was kind, helpful and fair. Customers were great, lots of regulars. It was hard seeing our store closed."
good,"It's a decent cashier position that has you doing more than just sitting behind a register for the entire shift, and you have many opportunities to work in different departments."
good,Office Depot has been a great place to work.  I have learned and grown so much since beginning my career here.  I have made wonderful friends and enjoy the people I work with.
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, pero llega a convertirse en un trabajo pesado y más con gerentes incompetentes"
good,"Office Depot was a good place to work and gain experience, however the pay was very low so one would need additional income to survive on their own.  All-in-all an enjoyable job."
good,i really would love more hours.people great love the customers just think i deserve a chance because i work very hard.and need benifits and better pay
good,"A Typical Day at Officemax consisted of me learning how to operate the cashier, providing customer assistance to anyone who needed to find something within the store, or cleaning and stocking items. It taught me how to be a part of a team."
good,Om 7 uur beginnen.. Het lossen van een 40ft met verschillende producten op een pallet zetten.. wegrijden van de volle pallets. trailers laden . Orderspicken met een wagentje die ook omhoog gaat. als ik iets voor mekaar krijg zoals een zeecontainer laden.. of het overleggen met collega's en toch voor het gene gaan wat ik heb voorgesteld. Dat niet iedereen het altijd met je een kan zijn..
good,I am one to learn quickly and I did enjoy the work experience regardless if I didn't stay. 8/10 would still recommend the job to anyone wanting to go.
good,"I was given the opportunity for employment at a time when it really mattered. For that reason alone, I am truly grateful to Office Depot. The management and supervisors were supportive and hands-on from the beginning of my employment until the time of my departure."
good,"I liked working at Office Depot, It was fun at times but, the industry is very competitive and was a dying industry. Maybe one day it will get better."
good,Company was a nice place to work.  Job offered different areas to work in and offered challenges to your typical day.  Everyday was a different day.  Overall experience was good.
good,A typical day started at 7am and usually ended a 5pm.
good,The tasks on an everyday basis is the same task. Must be able sell the required goals on rewards but overall and good place to work for with the exception of customer experiences are never the same.
good,"Typically the day would start of with opening the store, reviewing audit reports, counting registers, and looking completing reports before they are due on our Activity Calendar. The culture at Office Depot is actually quite enjoyable, from employees to customer relations. The hardest part of my job is learning to lead other employees my age and former friends from when I was an employee, but mutual respect has played a big part in it. The most enjoyable part is actually the job, it's map changes, executing buy-backs, working the freight in the morning, and completing tasks on time."
good,I work as a cashier that came easy to me I learned that a cashier when I was 18. I was 35 by this point. I stock shelves rearranged Isles. Then I moved up to shipping and receiving which I loved and that was 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.
good,"Great place to work and team setting. However, as online sales changed the dynamics of the marketplace, changes happened to levels of service and product quality that affected our engagement."
good,Working retail is never fun but my time spent at Officemax was one of the best experiences working in retail I've ever had. The management was awesome and genuinely cared about you. The other employees were all team players and made the store run great. The regular customers are amazing and you can develop long lasting relationships with them. Overall a very friendly experience and a great place to shop
good,"Office Depot was a pretty good place to work. I started as a cashier and was able to move up into a Management position. I didn't like the Store Manager when I worked there, but that was a long time ago and they are no longer with the company.They taught us about the products that we sell and we could work different shifts so it was easy to work around another schedule."
good,"Nice place to work if you need quick money or experience to use for future growth.For me Management was all over when I worked at the Cary Store, also be wary of ware and tear after a while of constantly bending and squatting."
good,"Part time on paper, but working long fulltime hours sometimes because its a pick until finish policy. I was looking for something with a more structured work schedule."
good,"Most days were simple cash register days with some inventory management thrown in, but with Technology services it was more customer centered with sales in mind. Employees work together for most tasks, and the workplace isn't too competitive."
good,Typical retail environment!
good,"The hours are very flexible, you learn a lot about tech and ink, the management is pretty good,and the employees are friendly. The hardest part of the job was when it got busy you couldn't get other work done. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a diversity of tasks to keep you from being bored."
good,"If you could last the first one to three months you could work there for the rest of your life if you wanted. Various parts of the store had their problems. But the lower level employees were a tight-knit group. You ended up coming to work for them, more than the customer it felt like sometimes. Don't get me wrong though the work got done, every day. Other than that it had the standard retail problems, demanding customers and a corporate that was out of touch with the individual store. So management style could change on a daily bases, new selling techniques were always being pushed on the employees when old ones worked better. People ended up using a mixture of them as they had been taught so many, while newer employees grew accustomed to the latest version. The only other issue I saw faced was a consistent running dry of product resources even with the promise of ""They will be in tomorrow."", only for that to never happen until a month later. Day to day was fine working there, but in the long term, the company needs to get its focus on."
good,"Office depot is a good starter job in my opinion i would not recommend for long term there is very little upward mobility no real pay increase and its a fast paced and sometimes stressful environment.  They have high expectations especially for certain job titles like Freight and Logistics, copy and print, and tech associates are held to a very high standard with very little room for error. If yo work the freight team you will be expected to finish unloading shipments and stocking shelves within a certain time frame and it must be done accurately then you have to keep track of and maintain proper merchandise labeling and pricing while also checking the availability and counts of merchandise on sales floor and in top stock, setting up planograms and store displays accurately and efficiently and while doing this be able to provide customer service and cashier when needed and assist in tech and in copy and print if necessary."
good,"Open the store, turn on all machines in Stationary so there heated up and ready for daily operations. Set up all tills, placed them in the registers for the cashiers when they arrive. Check all orders that are due and needed for daily pick up. Scheduling for up coming weeks. Check payroll for time management and production of the business. Check for ant new display changes that are needed."
good,"En si la empresa tiene una excelentes prestaciones. El trabajo es de lunes a viernes de 8 a 6 PM, descansos de ley."
good,Helping customers with what they are looking for and give them suggestions on their projects. Upper management thinks on store level and makes decisions that make sense for retail stores.
good,"Excellent pay for retail, but to my credit, I launched the OfficeMax of Indianapolis and Moved to Milwaukee. I won three customer service of the year pins."
good,"Love helping customers, but they lack in management and pay.  Loved helping customers in copy and print but there have been many times I had break away from my print jobs to cover front counter. Good place to work if your in school"
good,I learned a lot while working at Office Max. It was a fast pace and creative work place. Working with the people that I did allowed me to learn and take much away.
good,"It varied between quickly-paced and slow-paced. It was stressful in that multiple customers were handled daily and at the same time. Most of the time management was compliant with scheduling. The coworkers I had were very enjoyable and pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers who often did not want to be told they were in the wrong, but I was always backed up by management when I was in the right. The best part was seeing customer satisfaction and hearing compliments about myself, coworkers and the company."
good,"A typical day at work here was pretty easy. All that was necessary was that you arrived, clocked in and talked to the manager on duty to see what needed to be done and what they were to have you do."
good,"At the time I was there it was a fun easy going place, it was like a dysfunctional family. managers were easy going and fun to work with. None of them are there anymore tho."
good,My typical day to day was either running the register or being on the sales floor. Also you would clean the store and stock inventory. It taught me a lot about how to interact with different people.
good,"I enjoy working here, but I believe I should be getting paid more. I think people with experience should start higher than $8.50. Some managers are not very great, while others are awesome."
good,"This is a job for someone who really wants to help people and work in a fast-paced environment. People come in because they need a product or assistance in completing a project. If you're willing to help them achieve their goals, then you will be successful here."
good,"During my time at OfficeMax, it was a really fun and great place to work.  All the employees got along for the most part and it was a great environment at the time.  Advancement opportunities were available and the bonuses and incentives were great.  The only reason I left is that that benefits were horrible and there weren't set hours."
good,I had a great time working with the people at Office Depot I only hate how slow it got some parts of the day. I don’t really have any complaints for the job.
good,I enjoyed working at Office Max.  I was told upon hiring that I would get up to 40 hours a week. This did not happen.  I ended up leaving not long after being hired in.  I was in search for a full-time job.
good,OD est une très bonne entreprise humaine et qui donne la chance à ses collaborateurs en évolution interne.
good,A typical day as an ops manager at office depot would include the process of dealing with inventory. From the process of receiving new merchandise to shipping back or returning old merchandise. We will train other associates and be sales lead for the store.
good,"1. Typically busy in coding and taking interviews."
good,"Good company to work for, the management team works hard to get daily task done efficiently. Salaries need to rise to retain the proper talent and offer promotions"
good,"Job is good for filling a gap, nothing great for long term. Day is usually filled with Bursts of being busy, Always seems under staffed. People usually know what they need and are in and out."
good,"The culture at Office Depot is very organized and fair. On the other hand, the management team makes it impossible to advance throughout the company. As long you make them look good to their bosses they will not allow you to move on and advance through the company."
good,"It is important to focus on the Customer while balancing work orders and work flow.  When taking orders you need to be detailed with instructions and communicate well with coworkers regarding work orders.  I love the people I work with, and taking care of my customers."
good,They prefer to promote from within whenever possible. I gained a lot of knowledge and experience from working here for many years. The company has modern technology and techniques and that is refreshing.
good,"At Office Depot , Usually it would be really busy but the day would go by really smooth. I've actually learned a lot from Office Depot , from technology to designing . I never knew i was creative when it came to designing like business cards for businesses or just designing things for someone period. I can say the hardest part about the job was to make everyone happy because we were always busy and the lines were long so we had to make sure we got everyone we could . To make everyone happy . The most enjoyable part about the job was the co-workers i worked with became friends and i got to learn so much without going to college learning all of these things I never knew."
good,Saw lots of changes during my time at Office Depot. 15 years is a long time at one employer so just shows my time was enjoyable. Only moved on as they closed our warehouse and relocated it further north.
good,"In prior times it was positive and a great place to work.  However, many changes throughout the organization that recently affected many people negatively."
good,"come in, run daily reports, open up the shifts, pull old prices and replace with new, count 6 cash drawers and put out.  assign positions and breaks   do sectioned inventory   restock in spots that are empty  when store opens  we provided customer service through out the shift while cross training employees.   most enjoyable part is the people    the hardest is the long hours and the turnover in retail"
good,"A typical work day was to cashier, running the floor for sales, EBW ad sets (setting up new merchandise), repairing computers for customers."
good,It's a great entry level sales job. Management can be a different experience for anyone depending on who your manager is. You don't have to cold call.
good,"Good company but the culture was changing to outsourcing everything from customer service to billing which was a challenge. "
good,"A typical day included working the cashier, educating customers on knowledge of products, where they're located. Organized inventory, then security locked needed products and then stocked products."
good,This company offered chances for advancement.  It gave me the opportunity to learn all aspects of the organization.  I would still be working for this company but the decision was made to close it.
good,"The job is part sales and part customer service. WIll require much multi-tasking and sometimes long, tired hours. You will be expected to work at a fast pace and keep up with customer demands."
good,"Aunque nada más trabaje durante el periodo de verano en el 2015, fue una experiencia agradable, era un trabaja exigente en mi opinión porque nunca había teñido experiencia en ese ámbito de trabajo, pero mis compañeros y superiores me enseñaron mucho por lo que se aligeró el trabajo."
good,"Working at OfficeDepot/OfficeMax wasn't half bad. The pay wasn't anything special and it lacked benefits for its part-time workers, but the people where fantastic, management even though they had their moments they where super professional when needed and friendly, they are people I was happy to have manage me. During back to school time, and the Christmas holidays we where pretty well slammed all day everyday and it became a hassle due to under-staffing but other than that I loved working there."
good,"Worked the floor greeting customers with great customer service skills and a very polite attitude. Responsible for assisting customers as well as making sure the floor was properly stocked and in order. Also worked the cashier some days, as well as working in the copy in print department; where assisted customers with print orders, copy jobs, working with Microsoft word, publisher, and office."
good,Need to update everything in Copy & Print cant work as fast as really could if they updated all the computers and equipment. Makes it hard to get things done when stuff breaks down.
good,"puede resultar un poco demandante al momento del tiempo laboral pero aun asi la considero como una buena empresa a office depot, también se presta para un buen ambiente laboral lo que hace un poco ligero el trabajo de todos los días."
good,I loved working there. Everyone was so nice. The typical day at work is simple. You help customers then you take a break. THe hardest part of the job is really customers.
good,Daily I would get cash management in order then develop a action plan for the day.  I would have  every associate job description ready for the day and let them know what the expectations were.  I would then manage the sales floor and complete any operations paperwork accordingly.
good,"As same store sales decline the company continues to look for new opportunities to find new revenue streams. Change is a constant part of the work experience, and Store managers are the key to the overall success and future of the company. If your looking for a fast-paced company, and a challenge, this is a job that offers both."
good,"A leader in the B2B Office product category, with a positive work environment.  Good benefits with competitive compensation. Overall a good place to work."
good,officemax was an amazing opportunity for me coming out of high school. I learned an abundance on information there that i did not think i would learn from a major retailer. I went through the ranks very quickly and helped the store succeed in any aspect i could. i enjoyed my time there for the most part. it was definitely a very knowledgeable experience.
good,"I was originally trying to work as a computer repair technician, but was hired in the copy & print center. It was my manager, her assistant, and myself. They were both older women, so I tried to carry all the heavy boxes of paper, or other materials we would need throughout the day of work. Some days it was fast past due to the amount of large-format printing that needed to be done, some days was nothing more than a proud parent coming in for a picture being blown up. We did everything from binding folders, to making business cards and stamps, taking in larger print orders in the thousands of copies, creating over-sized posters and banners, and we could laminate up to large posters."
good,"It was a pleasant environment to work in and management always acknowledged our efforts. There is a wide variety of customers always coming in the store which are new learning opportunities whether it's assisting them in the technology department or with copy and prints services, I learned something new."
good,The work can be physically demanding if your not using all the tools that are available to you.  If you help them they will help you.  Supervisors had no problem helping when needed.
good,In our area we had a small constant stream of customers. Not to crazy and easy enough to handle any customer demands/questions. Mostly adults with part-time high schoolers.
good,"Le métier de la fournitures de bureaux et du mobilier de bureau est un domaine extrèmement concurrentiel ou la rôle du commercial est primordial."
good,A typical day can vary from sales with customer interaction to assisting with checking out and answering customer questions. The staff was amazing and over the years we became  a family. The hardest part of the job was leaving the people you loved. The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team and being able to place a smile on a angry customers face.
good,"Company can be fun to work for however the pay is poor, the customers are rude and ignorant. After training for a long time with the company to become a manager they still prefer to hire new under qualified manager that lack the skills to do their own job successfully. After years of working for the company as a top selling sales consultant in the district only recieved minimal raises (35 cents an hour)."
good,"easiest job I've had, worked here part time whilst at college, all agency workers however didn't feel valued from office depot. good work place high morale"
good,This was my first real job and was an AMAZING opportunity for me to learn and grow.  There were many opportunities for career growth and personal development.
good,Buen lugar para trabajar con desarrollo y con personas activas y jóvenes
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar, el salario es competitivo, mas las responsabilidades son muy demandantes  tienes que dedicarte en tiempo completo a la empresa. es una empresa perfeccionista y carece de buen ambiente o buen clima laboral.en mi opinion office depot ya  llego al estado de explotacion a los empleados."
good,It wasn't a bad place to work part time for some extra cash. I had a full time job some where else and had this as a second job. They were good about working around my other schedule
good,Typical day would involve customers coming in to either have some created or printing done. Hardest part is having customers who aren't satisfied with he work. Most enjoyable love doing what I do and creating.
good,"On a typical day I would help customers find items or help them with their printing. I learned a lot from them, for example: how to make labels from your computer, how to use photoshop, and more. I was always asking questions and they would have answers. The management was good at listening to the needs of their employees and understanding them. The hardest part is achieving all the goals that they set. However, the most enjoyable part was when you get praise for doing a good job."
good,"Office depot is a cery noce work environment, coworkers are great and helping customers is very rewarding/satisfying. You don't have to worry about getting hurt or even breaking a sweat haha"
good,"Working at Office Depot for ten years has given me an interesting perspective on retail life.  A typical workday includes lots of customer interactions, completing multiple tasks, and being flexible to new situations.  Customer relations is now the number one concern for most retail stores so be ready to help customers in any way you can.  The atmosphere in the store is typical balanced, going from customer busy to more task oriented.  The managers attempt to keep associates motivated to do their jobs while creating an atmosphere that is fun to work in.  The hardest part of the job is dealing difficult customers, but this can also be the most rewarding part of the job.  Retail is a job that changes on a daily basis so always be prepared for new challenges."
good,Check emails for print jobs and print them accordingly to the schedule. How to mutlitask to an efficient rate without wasting time.Working with the coworkers at an efficient made the job easier when we worked as a TEAM. Management is less to  be desired..
good,The manager I worked with at the time took me under his wing and tought me everything I needed to know about selling computers/printers. People I worked with were very nice and helped me in anyway they could.
good,"Not super busy. Calm environment. Sometimes management is hard to deal with, but most managers are good. Employees are nice people. I like it because it is calm, but it doesn't feel like a nice environment all the time."
good,"Good people, good strategies, work with employees to advance.  Good plan on building moral and continuity.  Needing some structure reorganization, but feel they are working on it."
good,worked here for several years but the company went through to many policy changes and a merger with another store. Gained a lot of experience and got the opportunity to be placed in a management role.
good,sérieux motivé est disponible carte conducteur plus fimo a jour
good,"While the management team is great at my store, I can't say the same for the other store. The opportunities to move up and receive a raise are extremely difficult. A typical work day for me is dealing with customers all day at the front register, the main you learn is that customers will fight with you for a discount. You learn a lot about ink and supplies. There is always a friendly environment in the work place. The hardest part is doing everything management wants you to do, at the front end you must up-sell and attach like there is no tomorrow, sign people up for rewards cards, answers the phone calls by the third ring, and lastly you have to keep the line down to a minimum of two people. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you really help a customer find what they need and they come back next week asking for you because they trust you."
good,The management staff and associates are friendly and great to work with. There is room for advancements if retail is the career path for you. The hours are flexible.
good,Bonne école tant dans le professionnel que  personnel
good,"Gran empresa donde aprendi más y mejores cosas sobre como desempeñar mejor mi trabajo"
good,"The hours commitment for retail was better than most. The stress of making numbers is always there, and with a declining business it can be a challenge."
good,"OfficeMax can be a complex and challenging place to work but rewarding with a decent salary for straightforward work. "
good,"Due to mergers of OfficeMax and failed merger of Staples Office Depot, company  had worldwide reorganization / restructuring, resulting in massive job cuts."
good,"it was a fast/ slow paced job. As a service manager I repaired computers and took care of sales I very much enjoyed my job."
good,"Operated Standing Forklifts and Order Pickers"
good,"Its retail, little chance for advancement or fill time opportunities. Small stores with a tight staff but the lack of promotion potential made it a job not a career path."
good,Good experience with good compensation. Great customer service culture. A lot experience on market development is one of the most valuable time. Have a good continued training module.
good,"Falta cultura organizacional, el Director general impulsa a los colaboradores"
good,"Management is friendly.  Always something different to produce in CPD.  Great team to work with."
good,"A typical shift would usually include making sure associates are continuing to uphold customer service standards. Cleaning and adjusting merchandise on the sales floor. And assisting customers in finding the products they need."
good,I informed people how things worked with tech what they need and how to work the items I make people feel that I am trust worthy I will sale and watch the costumer walk out happy that they bought what they bought with a smile on there face most of my costumers only wanted to work with me if they came to the store and I was not there yet they would wait for me or leave and come back at a time I was working my shift I fixed computers as well and made orders for costumers and made work orders for computer work to be done
good,Es un buen lugar para alguien que apenas empezara a laborar ya que te permite tener la experiencia necesaria y a lo mejor mas adelante buscar otro empleo
good,Great company for fast paced environment. Unfortunately they closed down my location and position was eliminated. All they offered me to relocate was a part time position and pay would be decreased.
good,Good Company to work for. If you can follow SOP you will be very successful. They are always willing to train employee's and do a good job of promoting within.
good,Tech Support for services sold Phone/Remote assistance only. Although Sales Associates who are changed often tend to oversell services or did not understand the scope of said services.
good,A typical day at my current job consists of associating with employees .Some co-workers attitudes differ from others but me as a person i come to place of employment to do my job and i feel like im easy to get along with.
good,It was an excellent work experience.  I did have a problem with the old manager not be professional and not being to friendly with me a s a worker.
good,It was an ok experience. I wish I would have gotten more hours. I wasn't able to move out of my mothers house on the pay I made but I was able to feed myself.
good,"Good company but deals in antiquated technology. Most companies going to paperless environment. Requires large amount of floor space to keep running. Printers, paper, desks, other furniture."
good,"Es una buena empresa, el detalle es que el lugar donde estuve carecen de escuchar al empleado completamente, el crear ideas y aplicarlas es un problema ya que habrá gente que no le guste la visión que uno maneja y tus ideas serán frenadas. Son muy conservadores en el trabajo. Piensan que tu puedes con todo pero no lo es así. Ademas cuidado si llegas tarde te suspenden sin goce de sueldo aun cuando te quedes a apoyar hasta 3 horas diarias mas."
good,"The company has potential. With the failed merger with Staples, it's a constant change of procedure. Multiple reports due each day on top of trying to run store with minimal staffing.  Communication isn't very well, at least not at the store level. The job isn't hard, District Manager is ok, Store Management could be a lot better."
good,Answering phones through a designated queue. Learned more about different softwares and work-arounds that helped me learn how to code in my free time. Management was fair. Most dificult part was meeting certain quotas. Most enjoyable part was learning about frequest customers and their place of work/job.
good,"Es un trabajo donde interactuar con gente, atiendes a gente haces mucha labor de venta ym así como almacenista. "
good,Office Depot is geared to service internal and external customers while providing a memorable experience.  Work days are typically fast paced and in a fun environment.
good,It's a very fast paced job at times. The CPD center is a giant attraction center inside the store you will need to deal with all different types of customers there. The associates are great. The customers at times can be the hardest part of the job.
good,This job has its high and lows in my opinion the company expects too much and gives us too many things to do at once resulting in quantity instead of quality of service
good,"The job is what you make of it. It has its highs and lows. And that the end of the day I got lucky, I have great coworkers and at least one very good manager whom all make the work day better."
good,"Constant work to keep you busy. Great Customers, coworkers pretty much satisfied with the Status Quo. Hard to motivate for upward mobility because of the lack of stores to work at without relocating."
good,"A typical day at work consists of pulling bulk orders on an order picker forklift. Loading and unloading trucks with a stand up pallet jack or a stand up fork lift. We also sort out product for delivery at the end of the night. "
good,"Production pipeline was streamlined however, training was minimal. I was able to develop experience in operations of the print department as well as managing a team of creatives. Very much a fly by the seat of your pants and learn as you go operation. The hardest part of the job is simply managing the balance between assisting clients and hands-on production work."
good,"great place for a job learn alot of new things and get to meet new people and also build connections, great staff very friendly and"
good,"Management is annoying and not realistic about expectations in regards to making sales, which can be de-motivational. My coworkers are the main reason I lasted this long."
good,The environment at Office Depot offered employees the opportunity to interact with the public on a one on one basis. This company is exceptional when it comes to training new associates on how to build public relations with potential customers. I believe that from my first day on the job the most enjoyable part of my job pertained to the customer interaction along with my other associates.
good,Office Depot is a good Company to work for. I enjoyed my team and the fact that the DLPM's worked together and supported one another. They have good benefits and treat employees very well.
good,"I feel that what I learned most in my time at OfficeMax was how to deal with customers, regardless of how they treated me. A typical day would include putting away freight we had received, helping customers find what they needed, helping over at the print center or pc repair bench if they needed help, and then cleaning the store up for the next day. I like every one of the managers except one, they were all very down to earth and willing to help me learn. The hardest part in the beginning was dealing with rude customers, but now it has become trying to make sales to increase my commission without being too pushy and making the customer uncomfortable or angry. The most enjoyable part of this job was the time I spent with one of my favorite coworkers just putting up chairs in receiving. Some of my best memories and stories from this store are from those times."
good,"My typical night consisted of manageing a team of 8 associates,responsible of getting all the routes sorted out with the days deliveries,making sure the vehicles were loaded correctly in order for the drivers to collect their paperwork and get out on the road on time "
good,A place with great co workers.  Spent all day on phone working with customers.  Very micro managed.  Day was had a lot of variety.  Company bought out by Office Depot.  Things went downhill rapidly from there.  Moved operations overseas.
good,Nice place to work. You have the ability to advance as far as you want. Its a great opportunity to learn about all office related products. Great upper management support.
good,"As agency I felt let down.Had. Experience in different departments,and still was'nt given the work required to live on."
good,N/A If inquiring about a job and want to know the environment of certain location then just visit the location and you will see how it is ran.
good,"Aprendi absolutamente toda la operacion del retail, los compañeros son excelentes, lo que hace un buen ambiente laboral, lo mas dificil, es sobrellevar el hecho que hay muchas personas en puestos equivocados, lo que llega a afectar el buen ambiente de las sucursales, la otra parte mala es que falta apoyo para cubrir horarios, descansos, vacaciones programadas."
good,"A typical day at work will consist of counting till, making sure work area is clean, assisting customers both on the floor as well as on the phone, and working as a team with the other employees to meet the store's quotes of the day in each department. I really enjoyed the position."
good,Un lugar bueno para trabajar y hacer amigos aveces mala la administracion pero muy buena empresa
good,Fun job for extra cash! :) Very lucky to have had a wonderful/nice team that was very supportive. Very easy to catch on with the register. Just wish the pay was a bit better.
good,I started as a cashier and worked my way up to management. It was a fun place to work. The managers for the most part were great and my co-workers were mostly great as well. They offer benefits and pay competitive with other retail jobs. There is a lot of room for advancement for the right people.
good,"Office Depot is a great place to learn many new things about technology and new items in general. Helping customers was one of my favorite things to do in the kindest way. I learned a lot about repairing computers and some new software to clean viruses. The co-workers were not the best, most of the time they would just stand around on their phones, while the managers would not care. Along with the Store Manager always hounding everyone that things must be done a specific way and have a time limit, made the job very stressful and not so fun."
good,"work as a team, meet new customers and establish relationships. unload and stock items to shelves, keep store clean and organized."
good,"I really enjoyed working with my customers, helping correct any problems that they may have. Or just to be able to stop with there order and say hello."
good,"Greet customers in a polite manner, help customers find the products they are looking for also help stock the items. Check out customers on the cash register."
good,"I've very much enjoyed working at Office Depot OfficeMax, however it is very difficult to move up and about within the company. They are great at attracting employees, but can be constraining once they're hired. Management makes it difficult should you need to alter your original availability for any reason. Also, unless you're a GM, there are next to no benefits or discount offered for store-level employees."
good,Office Max is great at working with your schedule. Customers can be a handful at times but nothing unmanageable. The co-workers are easy to get along with and customers are friendly for the most part. It was a great way to learn about document control.
good,"Para mi la empresa ofrece estabilidad a sus empleados y brinda un buen servicio a sus clientes."
good,I really enjoyed working in the kids club. My co-workers were nice and outgoing. Management was the downside to the job- not professional at all.
good,"Great place to work, fun atmosphere, decent pay and benefits. You will have to work hard, possibility of overtime. I started by working in the copy center. This was a fun job because you just take care of the customers, stock paper and supplies, and run the register. I would work at Office Max again."
good,"Supportive management. Started at this company with a excellent understanding of IT, learned asset management and supply chain logistics in a retail environment."
good,"Fast paced working environment, okay pay, can advance if you work hard, benefits are okay, schedule is rough (you may close one night and open the next.)"
good,Employees were actually able truly assist customers and recognize customer's satisfaction through their gratitude.
good,"OfficeDepot and Office Max, have turned into a company that want nothing but your extra dollar, it no longer is about the customer, unless you pay for it, and im talking about the Protection Plans (extended warrantys) they actually threatened my job becuase i didnt sell ENOUGH of them!!!!"
good,"This company is starting to make changes to help bring Officemax and Office Depot together.  I dont feel that there is enough help in my department during the day to keep customers happy.  I love to interact with all customers.  I am great at multi tasking but not to 3 or more customers at one time, which is the hardest part of my job."
good,"On a typical day I am selling full solutions to customers, fixing both hardware and software problems on various systems, and figuring out problems no one else can figure out. I have learned a lot about communication and calming a customer down who has believed all their data has been lost or their data stolen. My management gives me room to grow and learn by allowing me the opportunity to take on the the problems no one else would even if it is a service we don't usually offer. My co-workers are all very supportive and together we grow and learn from one another, we are more like a family rather than co-workers. The hardest part of my job is working on systems with no documentation on use, software, or even how the custom built machines were built, while the most enjoyable part is the same I enjoy figuring out what a system is supposed to do and get it back to performing those functions while also figuring out the cause of the malfunction."
good,My daily experience work experience at office Depot Headquarters is great for the most part. The company is going through some changes and most positions are not secure. With this issues we are losing employees daily and work is doubled and tripled for each employee.
good,"Never got too busy, management was easy going, was easy to help customers, different positions to work, hours were often cut short, ocerallmi am happy to have worked thers and happy to have moved on"
good,"Sold contract furniture to businesses. Designed, quoted and project manage furniture transactions."
good,This was my first job and I enjoyed it for the most part. I just thought maybe after how long I'd been there maybe I would get a promotion or a raise.
good,The company really pushes goal driven employees and following the code of ethics. It is retail but is a good way to get experience dealing with troublesome situations.
good,"* Typical day at work:  clock in, turn on machines, daily log book, record information, check email, check TAYLOR orders, check IDEA orders, call UPS to schedule pickups, FedEx shipping, book binding, printing, folding, stapling, laminating, ream cutting, make stamps, call Xerox for maintenance, FedEx paperwork, restock paper, order paper, and order printer supplies. "
good,"Fun place to work, flexible schedule but no benefits. Management and staff very friendly plus they're easy to talk without being snobbish. Hardest part of the job is to deal with very adamant customers and the easiest is to meet and greet them who are understanding while being helped."
good,"Very good environment, not a great learning place, mostly lazy coworkers. The hardest part of the job were the mistakes others made that had to be corrected, miscommunication was a big issue."
good,Very fun place to work. The starting pay could be better. Enjoyed working with different machines in Copy & Print. Also enjoyed the customers.
good,"Very team oriented."
good,"I like this job , its was a fun place to work, hours great."
good,"I liked my coworkers and my boss, but i liked officemax before it was Office Depot. Don't get me wrong, depot is more operationally efficient then the max but officemax actually was better hr wise. Now they're merged and store closings and lay offs begin, so would I recommend you work there now!? NO! Especially now Staples wants to by them out!"
good,"Was working in the copy and print center, which was fun because i was able to help many customers on different types of things, business cards, shrink wrapping, laminations, copies, envelopes ext."
good,"I have worked in office supply retail for over 8 years.  The company is not what it use to be.  A once valued employee, I picked up many skills and became a chameleon of sorts, able to do much of everything in every area of the store.  Starting as a part time cashier I quickly grew to run my own department and then management positions within the store and copy department."
good,Office Depot is a lot more than a Office Supplier. I work with a great team and have learned lots of new skills from my colleagues.
good,"Working at OfficeMax has been a pretty good experience. The workload isn't very hard, but you do get enough to keep you occupied for an entire shift usually. The crew is very supportive and helpful. They're willing to help, teach, and guide you through whatever task you may have. The customers are usually very friendly and open to lots of suggestions. However, before corporate visits, management does have a tendency to get stressed out and it does trickle down to the employees, but it doesn't happen often."
good,"es una empresa donde se aprende y se adquiere experiencia en todas sus areas ,"
good,"Management was never consistent, some were excellent, some pitiful. Compensation and benefits were quite sparse, but there is always room to move up. Expect to help in other departments from time to time. Overly focused on sales figures during operating hours - constant chatter over our headsets distracted my tasks and ability to help customers."
good,"I was a customer service specialist that represented the company while communicating with its customers, whether face-to-face, over the telephone, over the Internet or through another method. Also referred to as a customer service representative, I performed a broad range of tasks to meet the need of the company's clients. For example, I provided support for the company's products and services, take order requests, answer questions, resolve complaints and even made sales. Customers often viewed me as the eyes, ears, face and voice of the company. My primary job duties were to often handle complaints, explain the company's policies, and provide information about products and services. I also handled cashier responsibilities, (incoming money, area cleanliness, met with each customer, first and last to represent the company when talking to the customer). All in all it's a high pressure environment in which you need to always be thinking of a way to assist the customer, employer, and co-workers in any way imaginable."
good,Office Depot was a great place to build many skills needed to be successful in any work environment.
good,Would recommend this job to someone who is fast paced and can handle working in a busy environnement
good,"typical day at work begins with truck unloading"
good,"The team I work with have always been upbeat and caring individuals. We've all grown as a family. The work can be pretty easy at times but then there are those days where nothing seems to go right. The machines dont want to work in the copy and print department, customers ask for things that they don't even know what it looks like and then get frustrated when we can't understand when they say ""Its a thingy that does this thing with a cable"" -_-"
good,temp service the work never lasted but they kept me working different places and i got experience in different warehouses like forklift and molding
good,Very busy for the typical work day I learned tons in the copy and print department. Co workers were very helpful and the hardest job would be to remember all the copy and print guidelines. The most enjoyable is learning all the functions of copying anf printing services.
good,"Working as a warehouse associate wasn't the most glamorous job I've ever  had, but the schedule allowed me to work the hours I needed as well as do other things such as finish my college courses, intern, and work another job."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job at Office Max was the customers and coworkers.
good,enjoyed the people i woked with day in and day out i also  made frends with my customer's
good,"I love being able to help people in need, so the job was very fullfiling. "
good,"Great for a student or as a stepping stone. Worked with pretty awesome people (MOST of the time), flexibility is okay, the pay is not the greatest. All in all, I acquired great skills in customer service and as well as working with creating things like brochures and what not."
good,"I enjoy working at OfficeMax Grand and Toy as there a lot of very talented people. In my role I work with many different departments, and gives me insight into the different aspects of the company as well learn many new skills."
good,"I would open the store as a cashier primarily and then would go to work performing my duties as a copy and print operator. I would perform tasks as completing previous daily jobs and setting up jobs for the night crew as we would each do if we worked days. I served the customers with quality and prompt attention. My co-workers and I made a great team together, we loved the challenge of taking on large assignments as long as we met our demands on previous ones."
good,"When I started at Office Depot in 2004, It was amazing company. Bonuses, good pay, fun environment it was great. As the years pass and We got more and more CEOs, the company just started taking away more and more from the stores. Recently they have change the management structure at the store level. The Assistant Manager's have gotten their overtime cut which as cut our pay. Are pay is at the bottom of most retailers. We are being paid as Department Managers with the responsibilities of an Assistant which I believe isn't right."
good,"A typical day would include opening cash duties, observing & following up with freight team productivity, daily reports, inventory management, assigning tasks, relaying stores sales & goals for the day, any reviews due, hiring interviews if needed, training of associates, customer service, resolving any customer/associates issues, stocking, setting planograms, & other various management duties."
good,"this job i enjoyed very much. I worked here while i was going through high school. It is a wonderful place for a youth to start out and gain customer service skills, cash management skills, as well as learning how to balance work, school and your personal life. I had wonderful co workers and very understanding and supportive managers."
good,I learned a lot about management and customer service.I got along well with co-workers.the hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers but I have never encoutered any that were to bad.My most enjoyable part would be helping repeat customers who ask ffor me by name
good,"Worked as cashier and on sales floor helping customers with purchases and item information. Worked well with other employees and management. Good place to work, but not much chance of advancement and pay was very low.  Overall, a good place to work until finding a career."
good,"job was good overall"
good,"this  company doesn't really give much room for current employees to move up in the company, but it is fair to the employee. the pay could be better but overall a good company."
good,Office Depot is a great place to work. Sometimes its busy and sometimes its slow. All the people that come in are nice. Managers are undrestanding as far as if you ask for time off or if you are late. All around a good place to work. The downside is the job is part-time with minimum weekly hours and low pay.
good,"It was a very nice job, learned new things every day. Liked helping customers find their needs."
good,"I come in, get my scanner, find a machine, log in to my work zone, print out my tickets and start to pick. I build pallets with my picked orders that are seperated by route, and I drop them off at a designated location. If I ever have an issue I go see our team specialist and he knows what to do. I work with a group of helpfull and funny guys."
good,"recover,help customers,restock shelves"
good,"I did enjoy this job a great deal as I love retail, the people were always friendly and always had a smile on their face. i was quick to learn everything needed for the job."
good,Its usually fun to work here just be prepared because when the crowd comes they come. Its usually fast-paced and all about the customer. Office depot is really customer friendly and they stand up to their word on helping the customers. Slow days are going to turn into a fast day. Got to have good communication.
good,"A typical day involved stocking supplies, creating business cards, bindery, and being a cashier. I learned the art of multitasking, management was great and hard working, co-workers were as well. the hardest part of the job was working late nights, the most enjoyable part was creating wedding invitations, and business cards."
good,"Most of the time my work day consists of helping customers. From time to time I have to reset planograms, work on customer's PCs, and cover different zones. I have learned a lot from my department manager and store manager. Sometimes it gets busy and a little stressful but for the most part we all pull together as a team and keep pushing forward to get everything done so the dust can settle. The most enjoyable part of the day is my co-workers most are great to work with and we all get along great."
good,"I had a great time at Office Depot, working my way from a cashier all the way to Asst. Mngr, I learned a lot about working with people (customers & associates). Had I not had a problem pregnancy and needed to stay home with my children I feel I would still be there today. Customer service is my niche!!"
good,I like working here because the co-workers are great and some of the management are really easy going.
good,Mi trabajo era un poco pesado bueno siempre tube los puestos mas complicados y sin embargo tube el caracter de hacer bien todo.
good,"This tipical 9 to 5 job started with reviewing sales and inventory numbers from previous day, meetings with sales force and vendors, and management. Order inventory and review sales trend. I have learn much more about the world of sales and inventory and how to assist management in their day to day duties. Management and coworkers were respectful and cooperative. The hardest part of the job was the size of the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunities for promotions."
good,"* un dia del trabajo llegar cargar la camioneta enrutar salir de la tienda repartir regresar por la tarde ayudar en piso de ventas a los auxiliares, recoleccion de mercancia al supervisor de telemarketin, o llevar pedidos de emergencia considerada en su caso por los ejecutivos de ventas."
good,"A typical day at OfficeMax would be relieving the current employee and working on print jobs and assisting customers as they arrive. I learned a lot about working independently and keeping a level head when work begins to pile up. I also learned that a smile and friendly tone of voice typically goes a long way when it comes to upset customers. My co-workers were very friendly and open individuals, and greatly enhanced my experience. It was sad to see some move on, and fun to welcome new-comers. The management needs some improvement. As a company OfficeMax needs to appreciate their employees more than they do, because the ""little guy"" is the foundation and without us the company will not succeed. The hardest part of my job was learning to trust that I can handle any situation that arises. What I enjoyed the most was joking around with co-workers and learning how to do new things."
good,"While working i enjoyed the services that i could provide the customers, management needs improvement."
good,"My day would start at 5am to count all lock up items then have the store ready to open at 7am. I have learned how to help run a bog box retail store,"
good,I had a great overall experience working there. I've meet great friends and great customers... just no management structure.
good,"Seperate boxes for your route, and then loading according to your stops, delivering packages in an accurate and timely manner, dealing with all the L.A. traffic and dealing with some drivers, enjoyed mostly the different people I worked with every day."
good,"It was a great place to work and a family friendly environment. Overall, I enjoyed my time there. Now my 20 yr. old daughter is employed w/them."
good,I liked the fact that I was able to grow in the company. Starting pout as a stockier receiving employ of the month my first month the the first in office depot history to do so. Moving of to learning how to make sales in technology. Then becoming the head of the furniture department at the same time becoming a cashier.
good,Had a good time working at Office Depot probably one of the best retail shops you can work for. Management for the most part if caring and easy to get along with.
good,"Very good job motivation,to use your knowledge and skills as prof of what you know by your resume.how to operate and repair all types of lifts.ability to help others to better there skills and hold there job in full on there own."
good,"Opportunities to learn about technology and services."
good,"Typically short staffed, which leads to certain employees taking on tasks that are needed in order to keep the store running. Very little time for breaks."
good,Job environment was diverse fun not very stressful friendly and had alot of like minded individuals who were laid back and helpful kind towards others
good,I usually am a cashier and help put out the freight from the truck. I learned where to put items in the store and also learned how read the handheld for item location on the shelf and in the store. The management is nice and treats associates fairly. The hardest part is trying to get things done when we have a lot of customers. The best part is to be able to work on projects.
good,"Many different shifts available.  "
good,"Long time associate manager,loved my job although Smart goals weren’t always so achieveable so to speak."
good,Las funciones sencillas a complejas dependiendo área
good,"the work environment was great, the managers treated each agent fairly and provided us each day will little gestures to show appreciation. it was sales driven which made it very competitive and the expectations were high however that is a person to person choice. if sales is your thing then this would have been perfect because the hour were great however they have closed and are no more."
good,"It's a good place to build your social skills and problem-solving skills. If you decide to work in retail for experience, this is a good place to start."
good,"Ambiente agradable en general, pero competitivo entre las áreas, desde mi ingreso me quede como unico responsable de BI con IBM Cognos, pero ya tenían la intención de quitar la aplicación y lo hicieron junto conmigo"
good,In my time there I went through 5 store managers all with there own personality. Some times we got along some times we didn't. With that being said my other co workers were always there to .
good,Ik heb met veel plezier daar gewerkt. Veel geleerd.
good,hours were great in the beginning but they cut all stores back drastically. I had a great crew to work with and management was very nice. only draw back is the hours available.
good,Typical day at work would include a starting  huddle meeting with team than off to your assignments. I learned a lot about record keeping and making sure accuracy was key.
good,"While much was left to be desired personally in terms of management and a rigid rule structure, the job was very flexible with my school hours and in terms of job security, I always felt comfortable until the day I left."
good,"My experience with office depot is only ok so far considering I've only been with them for 2.5-3 months. I took the job but at a much lower pay then I should have. It all depends how much you know copy and print center work. If you know a lot, then you can be very successful. Also if your good at selling or upselling. If your in the middle like me then the job might be ok for you, then again it might not. For as much as I do, I believe I should be paid more."
good,"I was given plenty of challenges and I always had a good team to help me accomplish any goal and over come any challenge. Just as any job, there were always good and bad days, but nothing was ever too much to handle because there were always good people around."
good,"This job requires good people skills and team work. As long as you have great approaching skills, the sales part will be easy for you once you find out what the customers needs/wants. Management is great there and will help you getting started with no problem. Great job overall!"
good,"Depending on the day of the week and time of day will determine how busy you are. Sometimes it can be slow, but sometimes there are so many projects, not enough people, not enough hours and too short of deadlines. Customers don't understand that your amount of projects you have and complain about the delivery time constantly on busier times. Bring your stuff in sooner and it can get one sooner. Besides that though, I had a great manager, and I made some great friends with my coworkers. Most enjoyable was the customers who come away smiling at your hard work. They need to train ALL management to be able to help behind the print counter though because the line can get long and they always act they have no idea what to do. You shouldn't be a manager if you don't know all the departments, your employees need your backup. If you are management, you should have a willingness to learn more for the print area even if you aren't the specific ""print manager"". The store is open more hours than the law is legally allowed to have the print manager on the clock, so help them out! Do more than just offer to ""man the register""!"
good,Manager was very understanding with your things going on out of work so made it easy to get flexibility on schedule. Free lunches if you got good reviews. Very chill only stressful during back to school time
good,"Office Depot / Max is a good job to have for a while, but I would not encourage anyone to search for it as a career. There are perks to getting into management, but anyone above store level only cares about the company bottom line, no matter what they might say."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Office Depot and the ability to work remotely.  I enjoyed the ""team"" environment - with other Project Managers, Pricing Analysts and Sales Team.  We had the opportunity to gather in person at the Corporate Office a few times a year, very valuable to have those face-to-face interactions.  "
good,"Was a pretty decent part-time job for someone trying to make some money for food and what not."
good,This is a good company to work for in a good location.  There are good benefits and pleasant co-workers.  The hours and holidays are better than my last job.
good,"For a younger employee with good physical ability, and willing to stay focus on your task is what the company looks for."
good,"Solicited, sold and implemented products and services to businesses within the private sector.  A typical day consisted of prospecting new potential clients while servicing existing accounts."
good,"Office Depot is a good place for entry level positions in customer service and sales. However, the pay is very low for an experience sales consultant."
good,Office Depot is a good job for those new to the work industry. The manager is awesome for working around medical appointments but has a hard time remembering when you can't work certain hours because of home life when you were hired for specific hours.
good,"I loved working for office depot, during my time there i picked up a lot of knowledge about printers, paper, office supplies, and what is needed to go into a successful business. I encountered many customers from a variety of sectors. I learned from them what they do and how they do it. I was able to advise them on how to organize, and manage their office supplies and technologies. I believe the insight i received is invaluable to my development and my career."
good,"An alight place to work certain management styles would be better."
good,"Great benefits from this company. Work life balance is good depending on your management because you can get time"
good,"Assist customers with their needs and desires.  Provide assistance and guidance when necessary."
good,Typical day would be to develop and implement solutions based on analysis and definition of requirements and business rules.  I learned new client server technology here at Acxiom.  Hardest part of my job was getting incomplete specifications and having to go back to architect to make accurate.  Most enjoyable was developing solutions and getting them to work.
good,This is a great place to apply for a first job. They work with your school schedule which is the best part. The way the stores are managed is a little questionable but other than that it is a great place to work.
good,"productive and fun place to work.Has helped me learn a lot about technology ,also learned a variety of different skills I can use in life,managers are very supportive when it comes to training."
good,"The manager was fun, enthusiastic, helpful and patient with everyone, especially the new hires. It was a summer gig for me but I would definitely consider working here again."
good,a typical day at office depot is just making sure that the operations department is going great and making sure that your team is doing their job on a daily basics.
good,Everyday is different when it comes to busy hours. You learn how to multi task greatly and maintain a good eye on your surroundings. Paying attention to customers and their needs are the most important and hardest part of the job.
good,It's a fun and relaxes place to work but it can bring sometimes because it is usually slow except on black Friday and back to school. when I first got the job I didn't think I was gonna learn anything but I learned a lot related to the business industry. Everybody is cool with one another.
good,Have been with the company for over 10 Years in Retail Management and have had a great experience and opportunity to apply my skills and experience to build leadership teams and grow with the company.
good,This job is mainly for somebody who is still in school full time and wants a side job too.  I enjoyed my time here it was not too stressful. It’s not a career type job unless you’re a manager which is not the easiest position to obtain. The pay is low so this is why they mainly hire younger people with few responsibilities. However it’s relaxing to work here I’d recommend it
good,"Capacitar mas a su personal de subgentes nuevos, para que sepan bien sus labores"
good,"Fast paced, highly competitive environment.  Allows you to build friendships and community. Great place to learn and build your resume for future endeavors."
good,"Working at Office depot was a fun experience that will teach you a great deal. Coworkers where very fun to work with. They made work fun, and helped if needed with no hesitation. Managers are great, like to promote from within. Fast advancement opportunities, but tend to plateau when you reach a low level manager."
good,"I enjoyed the different people that came in and all the things I learned about the different aspects of the job, you made copies of resume's and made calendars with kids and grandkids on the calendars, all in all a good company."
good,"While I worked at Office Depot, I did several different jobs from Business Machines Manager, (When 386 was a fast computer) to working with planogram changes and finally was a key carrying front end manager. I learned a lot from that job that has carried over to my last 20 years as a kitchen designer"
good,I think Office Max could care more about the customers and its employees than the dollar amount and how much they could earn from the customers. Also if the employee has issues with home or health then they should be made fun of of made to feel bad about their situation. Life happens.
good,"I enjoyed working on computers, and communicating to customers their needs. I lead a team of technicians on the sales floor to boost over all sales. I gained a plethora of knowledge on computers and other pieces of technology. The management were great people, they were a fun group to be apart of."
good,Mild-Pack working environment except during Back to School. The work day there focus on best communication with the client to recommend better solution then to deliver great customer service.
good,"Its a great place to work when you have great management in place. I learned great customer service skills, for it being my first job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and the family atmosphere."
good,"It was a good place to work, you worked hard but so did everyone else and the supervisor's came out and worked right along side of us to get the job done."
good,"Fue una experiencia muy interesante, aprendí a manejar personal a mi cargo y a inculcarles trabajo en equipo, lo que nos ayudó a tener cada vez mejores resultados, la parte más difícil para mí fue adoptar el estar de pie toda la jornada laboral ya que no se permite tomar asiento por ningún motivo, lo que más me gustó del trabajo fue tener un buen resultado en un puesto de supervisor."
good,"The only focus this manager has are the numbers, sales, customer count AOV, customer reward sign-ups and service sales. Our employees and customers come second."
good,"lots of rapistan conveyor fully automated pick modules pick to voice .over 600,000 square feet of warehouse space ,lots of crown fork lifts and reach trucks."
good,I appreciate the opportunity they gave from a graduate of high school to a graduate of college I have grown to be a great manager and a better service provider.
good,In a normal day at this company you are clocked in then begin your daily task. On a sheet there will be daily chores and tasks that need to be completed by the end of the shift.
good,Title says it all. I enjoyed the people and atmosphere of Office Depot and am sad to start looking else where. I am only looking to do so because I need to reduce the chaos in my life and they cannot give me a consistent enough schedule to do so.
good,"Office Depot/Office Max is a great place for people who are willing to work. If you can learn new things quickly, finish your assigned tasks in a decent amount of time, and can take the initiative to complete tasks without having to be told, this is a great place to work. "
good,A typical day in the life of an Office Depot OfficeMax employee consisted of interacting with friendly and helpful coworkers from various departments. Many resources available for educating  yourself for advancement. My interactions with Management were minimal as my leaders were confident with their employees.
good,"As long as you don't mix personal emotions with worklife, it's a fine place to work. Big times of the year, like the Holiday Season or Back to School can be incredibly stressful"
good,started as the furniture guy...became the tech guy...then the print manager...then customer service manager...but from day one i was the closing manager on duty...if you have an open schedule...you can move up in this company...the right attitude helps as well.
good,"Great management, good environment, but non competitive pay. Customer service can be challenging at times, but it can also be good. It is a good starter job in the professional field."
good,Job did provide income but needed more people skills there. It was always go go go not much time socialize not that you should but everyone deserves a stress reduction!
good,"It was fun there - I worked in every location in the store and was knowledgeable in all areas.  The training was alright, it was typical of retail training, but I learned everything I needed to know."
good,"I worked at office max for over a year and had a great time, however, for $8.75 an hour and under 20 hours a week I wasn't bringing home as much as I needed. I had several ""promotions"" from a regular associate to one being trained in computer repair and copy/print. But despite copy/print employees making more an hour I worked for months in that department without any increased pay or even more hours for that matter. It was an increase in stress and responsibilities that didn't fit my $8.75 role."
good,Use to be a great place to work.  But last few years has gone down hill.  People promoted just to fill positions.  Asked to do to much work with little resources.
good,"OFFICE DEPOT me párese una muy buen empresa ya que cuenta con todo para brindar un buen servicio a los clientes , en esta empresa aprendí a que la organización y la responsabilidad va de la mano par a poder crecer ya sea laboral o personal."
good,"As a print associate, I find it to be a relaxed place to work at, that still requires hard work and focus to succeed. Although the pay could be better, the work is not overkill and there are definitely upward growth opportunities."
good,It was always super slow but the people you would work with would make up for it. It's an easy job and they hire minors. I was still in high school at the time of my employment.
good,"Since the new CEO took over, there is a better direction for the company.  There is still the definite separation between the retail and business side and often policy and procedure stifles the ability of the inside sales org (tail wags the dog).  Good group of people though."
good,"If you have worked retail, you know what you are getting into. In Office Depot/OfficeMax, you might have to work harder than other retail stores. You are the expert at everything, or at least know who you can refer to. You do learn a lot, as the employees are some of the kindest people you will meet and will guide you through retail(well, if you are lucky). Expectations from Office Depot are high, so be prepared if you work there to have to meet their lofty goals. The employees are the best part, as they all are like you. You will learn a lot, as you have to in order to survive here. I was able to learn everything there is to learn about the the culture and the operations within a year, but once you do, it is smoother sailing than most anticipate. Just be prepared for the worst type of customers (and there can be many). Oh, and hope they compensate you properly if you do learn everything that Office Depot has to offer."
good,"Working at Office Depot OfficeMax was/is a great experience. However, the company is very good at keeping people in one position and not allowing them to move up or move around the store. If management thinks you're good at being copy and print, they'll keep you there even if you say you want out. It's just another customer service job."
good,"Office Depot, OfficeMax has been through a lot of changes in the last several years. If you are flexible and can adapt quickly, Office Depot is a great place to work and grow your career."
good,el trabajo es muy fácil no hay problema solo llegan personas por ratos y unos días que otros pero no te tienes permitido moverte de cierta harrea asta que los supervisores te permitan moverte  tienes que estar todo el día parado sin hacer nada y tienen como 6 cajeros  y no todos cobran 2 en copy y 4 en punto de venta los horarios no siempre van hacer rolados puedes estar todo un mes de cierre y si estas de cierre solo te dan 30 minutos para comer en mi opinión no hay problema con eso pero esa es culpa de los gerentes de la tienda también tienes que tener en cuenta que hay preferencias en empleados hay varios que no hacían nada no es que otros no lo insieran pero tenían cosas que hacer y no lo hacen solo se la pasaban con el teléfono o estaban sentados en el arrea de muebles los de piso no cambiaban precios yo no podía salir de mi arrea pero otros compañeros de caja si y solo se iban a caminar hay aveces que tenían que resurtir y no lo hacían por eso después regañaban a todos los de caja
good,"A typical day at work included almost every duty in the book. Stocking, cashier, customer assistance, online ordering, etc. At Office Depot, I learned how to effectively and efficiently do what my employer asks of me, and know my own limitations. The management of the store was top-notch, while Corporate showed that they have little to no experience in Customer Service. Workplace culture at Office Depot was very laid back, but always attentive. The hardest part of the job was Black Friday. The most enjoyable part was the relationships with my coworkers that were built."
good,only issues I have is that salary increases to low every year from 0 to 3  %  and medical premium went to the roof. We get more  medical increases instead more increases on salary
good,Office Depot was a great experience when I worked there.  The culture was collaborative and opportunities for advancement were available.  It was an excellent place to work to advance my customer service skills.
good,A typical day of work was counting inventory from a forklift. I improved in quick math skills. The culture was diverse. Management was descent. The hardest part was the graveyard shift. The most enjoyable part was coun.ting because i love math
good,"Office Depot is a medium size working environment. The technology (cash register, scanners) are outdated and interfere with responsibilities. We are short staffed for a majority of the time, and workers need to be flexible with their skills."
good,"decent work atmosphere, easy to make friends with coworkers, good pay, overall a good place to start in retail, because it can boost one's skills in various technologies that are rising in demand among employers."
good,"Office Depot is a retail outlet for office supplies. The location I work at is located by numerous offices in California and serves numerous small business owners."
good,This was a good learning experience in customer service. I helped customers make many decisions on technology and office supplies. I also managed the sales floor and receiving areas. I also experience dealing with inventory and hourly  budgets.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. It was only OfficeMax when  I was there and just before I left it turned to OfficeMax Office Depot. I liked the customers the most.
good,"Tienen muy buen ambiente de trabajo,pero para mi les falta un poco de ética profesional."
good,"Basic customer employee relationships. Where's this and that type of job with stocking, group related activities to create cohesion with work. Minor lifting and pallet jack operation."
good,I was a seasonal/college employee on and off for years. You have to push warranties and credit cards but the protection plans were legit. They would cover accidents or replace the item. It's easier to sell programs when they are of quality. No real employee discount - maybe 10%. Learned a lot of camera specifications.
good,"It was a decent place to work, i enjoyed my job and my co-workers.I enjoy my job as a driver and i like interacting with customers. I didn""t mind working 12 hour shifts and i was responsible for making hospital deliveries as well."
good,"As Store Manager you work 50 hrs. a week (or more) and you are the only salaried position in the building, which puts the onus of covering shifts when there are callouts."
good,"I'm very lucky that I have good managers at my location, We work together as a team. Everybody pitches in to help. I wish I could advance to a full time/management position."
good,"Office Depot is a nice place to work. It's selling culture is easy to grasp and work with and management is fair. The only issues with Office Depot is the lack of advancement available and problems with payroll. Management is filled with people that have been with the company 10+ years and every manager position is occupied. Therefor there's no room for promotion. Also, full-timers are forced to use PTO when the district cuts back payroll. We are cut down to 28 hours a week and forced to use PTO to get 32+ hours."
good,Most of the days consisted of disorganized management. Customers will always be right and therefore the employees will have to subjugate to any rude behavior.
good,There is a good culture at Office Depot.  The management here is strong and try their best to take care of the associates.  They have a television and ping pong table in the breakroom.
good,This company is very good at figuring out how to earn and maintain profit and is extremely organized on how they do business. Its a great place to work.
good,Office Depot is a fast paced productive workplace where you must work as a team to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is the long hours and constant moving.
good,"Good Management, when customers have a fun time shopping at Office Depot it makes us happy and its hard to satisfy all customers but we all try our very best to achieve that goal"
good,"on occasions such as back to school is very stressful and everyday stocking can get to hectic.  Depending on hired managers, some did not care as much and others are wonderful. I have learned so much, especial in customer service."
good,The days at Office Max can go fast or so but such is the nature of retail. There are always opportunities to learn new skills and to develop yourself within your role. Not a whole lot of room for advancement in the State of Wisconsin. If you are willing to move outside the state there is a lot you can do in this company!
good,Good place to get your feet wet in the work force. Its not a place to have a career but as for having something on a resume its a good place to work for.
good,"Empowering people, potential growth as an individual and quality people to know. Coworkers were friendly and for the most part, it was a team environment. Part-timers were given PTO annually."
good,"Decent pay, though the print department is expected to be professional even though you are not trained professionally. People come in expecting perfect, immediate products, but sometimes it's not feasible. It is a bit too demanding to work the copy position and work as the cashier at the same time. But the pay is higher than minimum wage and typically it's pretty hard to get fired (unless you steal or do something pretty bad) because they are usually short-staffed. Cashiering is not too bad by itself, but expect to learn more than one position here because short-staff = you will be needed in other positions to meet customer demands. My store had a great manager and a great team that made all the downsides bearable. Manager was flexible with school hours, which was extremely appreciated."
good,Enjoyed the opportunities afford me. Was unable to relocate when Corporate made the choice to relocate to a 'better area for cost related value.'  Detroit (Michigan) was getting 'cost to value return' too much.
good,"My job is simple. Check people out, keep front stocked, clean bathrooms at closing - little things like such. "
good,This was a great job to have while I was still in high school. The management was flexible with school hours and extracurricular activities. Great work environment
good,"I loved my manager and the people I worked with. I did front end, cashier, tech services and cpd. I loved the fast pace and providing exceptional customer service."
good,"Fast paced environment. Co workers are cool and helpful. Half have been there 10+ years and most others are 2-5 years. Most days are 10-12hours depending on the route but if you're experienced, you can make it a consistent 8-10 hours. Don't expect to get a satisfying break, if at all if you want to be time efficient. I recommend that you keep up with your physical health and be a cautious driver."
good,"yes, we even got a group picture with T-shirts.We went through 5 audits in the transition from Bizmart to Office Max."
good,"This job is very low maintenance and and manageable; if you're content."
good,"Large campus with many amenities. Opportunities to learn and use advanced technologies. Company faces challenges to compete with Amazon, Walmart, etc. Failed merger with Staples resulted in drop in stock values, and very high turnover with many changes in upper management. Some new directors do not appear to be well suited for their new roles."
good,"Office Max is a great place to work while you are trying to advance your life. They have great scheduling roles, and will work around        school. The rate of pay is low, but that's typical for the kind of retail work."
good,"I kept busy makes the day go faster and also fun. I learned that there "
good,The work is great the people you work with will help each other out if need be. Time spent at work will always have you helping customers out when they need it and its always something to do to keep you busy.
good,i worked at the copy and print center and there was always something to do! the coworkers were very helpful and really nice to the new kids and were patient enough to show us how things work. there was some drama but amongst the older employees. management was really cool and hours were amazing! they worked around my school schedule and were really understanding.
good,"This job was amazing! The management team was amazing and the company seemed to be on track. After three months into this amazing position, they did a mass lay-off."
good,The management is excellent and very respectful. They well-trained leaders and aim to inspire. Working the management team for store 6406 was an honor and privilege.
good,"I worked in the print center and it was one of the best jobs I've ever had. My boss worked right along side me and the two of us had a blast working together. Management will be hounding you to sell credit cards and protection plans, but all in all, Office Depot is a pretty good place to work."
good,"I worked at the office dept in Palestine Texas,and it was a very slow paced job. There was never a real rush even at school times. I was treated very well and the work environment was great. Basically if you did what you were supposed to every day there were no problems. Great company to work for."
good,"I worked for Office Depot, Inc. for two decades. I did find my work at Office Depot to be fun. Office Depot was a good employer and I enjoyed my time with them. There was a strong sense of team in every division. Everyone enjoyed their jobs. "
good,Typical work day at Office Depot would be fast paced with something always to be done. It was made easy by the friendly work staff and proper communication between employees.
good,"Great manager"
good,"Overall, Office Max is a good place to work. Management is friendly and schedules are pretty flexible. It's nice to be in a retail environment that doesn't require crazy hours."
good,"Worked in the accounting department, balanced books, called corporate and reported daily transactions, and straightened shelves all day. The management was kind and easy to work with."
good,alwayat work the days would be up and down. they would range from super busy to there being no one in the store at a given time. you always ahd soemthing to do while wokring there.
good,"I found Office Depot being a great place to work.  I enjoyed my time there, the culture was family oriented and well run and appreciation was key to the environment."
good,"With the ever changing market of Retail, a lot of company's have to change with it or perish. With that being said we have gone through a lot of changes in the last 10 years and will go through a lot more. Some good and some bad."
good,"My experience with OfficeMax/OfficeDepot was a great one. In my  sixteen years with the company I've always found management to be logical and fair. Despite a major company merger, the overall environment remained well structured."
good,Con un buen ambiente laboral pero muy poca promoción para subir de puesto.
good,"Overall good company to work for.  My senior leadership was present and accessible, looking to help us succeed instead of finding fault or finger pointing.  The nature of retail contributed to the overall sense of daily chaos that I disliked most about my job."
good,"Fun place to work.  Most of the people were good employees, though there's always THOSE ONES at every company who aren't.  Lots of work to keep busy with."
good,"I loved working there. I had great coworkers and manangment that made it easier to work with. I enjoyed working with the public, customers were nice. Hours were reasonable and I would work there again!"
good,"A typical day at work was usually very productive. I learned the importance of great customer service. Management was very hands on and helpful when it came to training. The workplace culture was very family oriented. The hardest part of the job would have to be the back to school time period and the black Friday sales. It wasn't hard, it was just extremely busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to develop friendships with coworkers."
good,Office Max was a nice place to work for and a nice environment. The employees were easy to get along with and very nice and got their work done. The managers were always available for questions and always on the floor to help customers
good,"A typical day at work was receiving products, unloading trailers, scanning the shipments in, putting the supplies where they belonged, used forklifts, and a battery powered pallet jack. When working for office depot i learned how to use a forklift, higher reach, scanner to scan products in, and learned how to work with many others. Management was good the hours they assigned were well liked by myself. Hardest part of the job was picking up tipped over pallets inside the truck. But the most enjoyable was the hours, the people and the benefits"
good,"Es un lugar bueno para trabajar, Aunq el sueldo no es tan bueno, y falta un poco mas de preocupación por los empleados"
good,"Office Max in Dilworth is a great place to start out a job for younger kids looking for work experience all the way up to adults looking to start a career, unfortunately in my case there were no opportunities for advancement within the company."
good,"I enjoyed creating and printing documents for customers.  Also, forced to work on Holidays.  However, there was only limited possibilities for advancement."
good,"Management at the store is Satisfactory"
good,I truly enjoyed working for this company. At the time I was employed there the CEO was wonderful. The company was growing leaps and bounds. The advancement was wonderful.
good,Good place to work if you like working.  They will push selling their plans and services and want you to push them to customers.  Also most store have few people working in them so you have to be able to manage several things and customers at once.
good,"Working at Office Depot was the best work environment I have been apart of. The job was challenging, but teamwork made it easier to achieve results. Very enjoyable"
good,"J'ai apprécié cet emploi me permettant de gérer mes dossiers de A à Z   de relever des défis de me remettre en question en permanence d'apprendre sans arrêt pour avancer pour m'enrichir ... L'esprit d'équipe y est très développé  et l'encadrement au plus près de l'activité. Je considère malgré la difficulté que représente la gestion en call center  du service client, exigent impatient , qu'il s'agit d'une expérience des plus enrichissantes de ma carrière."
good,I was lucky enough to have a great group of coworkers who were not only hard working like me but enjoyed having a good time and joking while working. The management was easy to get along with and very willing to work around a school schedule. I developed communication and critical thinking skills as well as learned how to juggle multiple tasks and customers all day long. Overall my experience at Office Depot enjoyable
good,Nothing spectacular one way or the other.  Work life balance is ok.  Environment was fun and provided a great opportunity to gain experience in big box retail management.  Upper management was ok.  Little room for advancement beyond store manager.
good,"When I was hired, I was told that I would be working a 40 hours a week with occasional overtime. I am now working 60+ hours a week lifting heavy boxes and furniture. Busy days always vary and some days you only work 6 hours but the next you might be working 12 hours. You never truly know when you are going to get out of work. "
good,"Quite slow with some weird rush hours, usually back-to-school time. I learned great customer service. Management was good, but I'm pretty sure one of them didn't like me because I was always set to hardcore cleaning when she was working. Workplace culture was good, very chill and the people I worked with were fun. Hardest part of the job.. had to be the one manager. Enjoyable part of the job was getting a review with your name posted in it and prizes during meetings."
good,"Work was always fun and upbeat.  The environment was entertaining and always busy.  Hardest part was making printer sales!  Management was sometimes hard to predict for the mood of the day, but he is not longer working at this location to my knowledge."
good,"Prácticamente el trabajo consta de hacer la rutina de todos los días, no hay algo diferente que se pueda hacer dentro como trabajador, ni para mejorar la empresa, ni empeorar la, es totalmente igual"
good,El ambiente de trabajo es bueno pocas capcitacione toman en pocas bese en cuenta a los asociados los gerentes no los toman en cuenta mucha corrupción
good,"at the time i worked there, staff was very friendly, we all got along and worked well together.  There were times when it was busy and also down time, as any typical work place. It was diverse of course"
good,"My experience thus far has been very enjoyable.  Helpful, friendly co-workers, supportive manager, and an open workspace make the workday enjoyable.  Would recommend for first job or part-time retiree income."
good,"Working at Office Depot has given me the absolute skill to maintain productive in areas of bieng organized in a timely manner, provide an immense skill in customer service, and applying strong sales skills for the company.  "
good,"Updating sales and goals from previous day , setting goals for team. It changes everyday you have to be very flexible. When we succeed our goals. Dealing with the daily grind of associates and customers issues. Meeting our goals and getting recognized."
good,I have applied at office depot years ago (2012) but I didn't get hired until 2015 (3 years later). I had to resign because of management at one store.
good,"It's been a few years and I know that everyone I worked with is no longer there. We had a pretty bad manager when i was there but she ended up quitting, and i left after."
good,"I've been with OfficeMax for 7 years.  With the merging with Office Depot, we've gone through a lot of change...most for the better.  Sales and services are top focus. I have the pleasure of working with an awesome team of Store Managers and District Managers in order to develop our teams into Leaders."
good,"no puedo decir que sea una mala opcion, pero en este caso la manera de dirigir del gerente no era la mejor ademas de hacer el ambiente tenso"
good,"The job is ok, although retail in general is struggling and I think that affects the people on bottom. Management is decent, sales incentives is weak and regulation could be better."
good,I enjoyed working for office depot. The only thing was that i had hardly see my kids and never had a st schedule. Management not professional.They wouldn't communicate. Our brakes were 15 min breaks were always 10 min.
good,A typical day at work consisted of meeting new people and being productive with your time. There was some density when looking to increase some employees pay by management. Overall a great place to work and have a steady job.
good,It is really a high school just when you come down to it not a whole lot of stuff to do but enough to get you started and get you some experience somewhere and make yourself some money.
good,I thought this job was one of my best and I really hated to leave. The company was in a transitional phase and I thought I needed a change. I would go back if the money was right.
good,handled the tech section for office depot. talked with customers about the latest tech and helped them make a decision on product was best for them. troubleshot and repaired computer issues
good,"Office Depot is an excellent first job, though it does not give benefits to most of the employees. Office Depot is indeed, an easy job once you get started. Though it does have a lack of professionalism when it comes to some of the management. Wish the stores closing, I fear that the company will not last much longer in the passing years."
good,"I've worked in a couple of Office Depots and an Office Max. It was a part-time college job for me, so I did what I needed to do to gain skills and personal growth. I have had both good and bad experiences at the stores I worked in, but mostly good. It all depends on the management and the other people working with you."
good,"I have learned alot working at officedepot. Working with customers and building relationships with as to how they want there projects done. Learned how to work in a very fast pace to please all the customers in a very timely manner. Working with machines that can help with producing projects such as large format printers, coil binding machines, making booklets, posters,etc"
good,"This was a good experience into learning retail. I learned more about meeting the needs of the customers, to what they wanted and needed for their offices, or home offices."
good,I loved working there especially had great co workers with me i wouldn't mind going back but they shut it down sadly but if there was still a chance I would
good,"This job has a pretty relaxed/laid back atmosphere."
good,"Great management team in the PNW.  Good work life balance of the past, but due to layoffs that has been changing.  Lots of freedom in your day."
good,"During employment the hardest part of my job was having to cover the register as well as the sales floor on most days. On average 70% of the time there were three employees; MOD ( manager on duty), copy and print department, and the cashier. Occasionally having an employee in electronics."
good,"Buen ambiente para trabajar como auxiliares y ejecutivos  de ventas. "
good,Great place to work also meeting people from all over the world with different walks if life. Very professional environmental work place.
good,"This about the same as my present job, retail. This place is like any retail, not much in growth or pay raises, but that's ok I choose this job and I realized this."
good,"Had learnt a lot and great work culture with high team support."
good,"My day consisted of working closely with clients in the copy and print center to brand their businesses and challenge them to think outside the box.  In an effort to increase revenue I also contacted local artists in the area to allow us to develop their artwork into cards and misc items to sell.  My favorite aspect of this particular job was every day was fraught with new challenges and stretched my management and artistic skills to the fullest.  Of course there were the usual copy jobs that were the foundation of the center. As with every company the economy effected training time, which resulted in lower customer service.  The fallout was unhappy customers, unhappy management teams and unhappy employees.  I saw a lot of turnover in my 5 years there and the stress level increased when man hours were cut back.  It was with a heavy heart that I decided to increase my ebay selling and take on a new project with storage auctions.  I loved this new adventure but feel it is now time to rejoin the workforce and support and contribute to a new company."
good,"Office depot probably wont be around much longer but I enjoyed working their in Florida. The merge with Office max didn't help much, but this place was way better than staples."
good,Depending on where you are management is either amazing or horrible there is no in between. When management is amazing it's a great work environment for customer service.
good,"A typical day at work is getting there 5 minutes before I clock in to get prepared for the day which is 5:55 in the morning. Store does not open until 8 but until then I'm in receiving sorting boxes, preparing them to be brought out onto the floor. Once the store opens I am on the floor assisting customers as well as stocking. At 11 we have something called DEPOT time which means Drop Everything People Over Time. The hardest part of my job is explaining to customers about how printers work and the most enjoyable is when I have to pull furniture from receiving because it kills time."
good,"mucho trabajo, se va el tiempo rápido , es un buen ambiente  laboral"
good,"I've worked with Office Depot since the summer of 2016, and it's an overall decent place to work. Managers tend to be super cool, and the work itself isn't that hard. I worked in the Technology Department, so my duties consisted of repairing the phones and computers. Back to school times are very busy and fast paced, while late fall/winter season is ridiculously slow."
good,It all fun and games till back to school starts then it just crazy for a couple of weeks. Good thing was i met a lot of new people and learned a lot. Also got more work experience.
good,I learned alot of copy and print and how to use the best customer service available. I know how to use every machine in the copy and print department.
good,"I started in the technology department.  From there I moved to the freight logistics team when the new system started.  I then moved back to technology when a senior position became available.  Throughout this time, I was able to participate in other functions as well, such as operations, inventory, and other miscellaneous activities.  Everyone would help in other capacities beyond their primary role.  Good teamwork.  Management would always lend a hand as needed."
good,"High Pressure sales. Continue with current move forward plan and digital growth to improve sales, build upon current success within business development and continue utilizing sustainability as a differentiator"
good,"Great building, cafeteria is the best in town.  Business processes are mature and structured.  Co-workers are dedicated.  Some micro-management culture evident."
good,"Meet a lot of new people every day,"
good,"management au top,esprit d'equipe super important mais trop de charge a porter ,debout toute la journée"
good,A retail environment which is very structured.  The people I work with are nice and the environment is very good.  They work around my schedule and I like working here.
good,"It's a decent place to work; pay starts at above minimum for part time but any advancement is solely based on if the position is available, not performance. Once (if) you get promoted to full time you are limited. There is no hope of becoming management at your own store as it is ""frowned upon"" by the company as a whole. If you want to be a manager you have to relocate to another store. When I started working there both full time and part time associates could get benefits packages but now it's only for full time and management. Paid holidays have reduced in my 4 years of employment from almost 10, down to 2. The health insurance packages are overpriced even at the lowest tier and barely cover anything."
good,"Office depot office max as a introduction to sales was surprisingly helpful, teaching several skills and never keeping doing one thing, everyone worked every department and you got an understanding of how the whole crew and store worked."
good,Een leuk bedrijf. Is helaas gefuseerd in Venlo. Leuke taken en uitdagend.
good,"Work days can vary from tasks (printing, ordering, designing assisting on the floor, and so on). I learned how to balance customers and work within the department while also managing my time with projects and cleaning the workspace. I believe the management was good overall. Our store as a team, had great chemistry in that we communicated about work responsibilities outside of work and generally had good rapport everyone and handled ourselves professionally. The hardest part of the job was working during the holiday season and back-to-school where we had to exercise patience and work quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with regular customers and having fun while being productive with my colleagues, which honestly felt like a family."
good,I enjoyed this job very much. Management though harassed me every time he came to visit. I tried to put a complaint in to HR but they wouldn't put the report in. But other than that I loved my job and the people I worked with.
good,"Great co-workers, low stress and good pay.  Work from home option was great, but some employees took advantage and had very production.  Very slow progressive discipline process."
good,"I have never worked at a place where teamwork was balanced and useful.  Here it is.  Also, management is wonderful here.  Typical day starts at 6 AM.  I do price changes, then help with freight right after.  I organize back rooms and while on the floor help customers find what they need."
good,I was a cashier/stocker.It was a very stressful job because you had to sale a certain amount of protection products a day but the management was the best and always there for you.
good,Walmart was a good job and my manager was great to work with. I meet new friends and enjoyed my co-workers. I recommend Walmart for someone looking for work.
good,"As a cashier I helped ring people of their purchases, I also helped them find their products. If they had questions on anything, I helped to explain the product. "
good,"I enjoyed working for OfficeMax, as they were flexible and supportive of my college schedule and career goals.  I took on a lot of projects in my position, kept myself busy and learned to better manage my time, and communication with customers and management."
good,Office Depot was a very great place to work. The management will always work with you if you have problems or question. It was a very enjoyable place to be and a great company to be apart of.
good,"Office Depot was a great place for me to work because I was able to perform so many different tasks on the job. I could start with freight in the morning putting new products on the shelves, then help customers on the sales floor by finding products and answering questions. I could then be moved up to cashier or head over to the copy&print department depending on where i was needed. The management was great and encouraged us do make sure we do everything properly and efficiently while the co-workers all got along very well. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with frustrated customers who would not budge an inch on what they wanted even if it was something we could not offer. The best part of the job was working with so many great people who could help each other get thins done properly."
good,"Un dia normal entre semana es llegar 15 minutos antes de la hora, encender las luces de la tienda, revisar caja chica que el dinero se encuentre completo que no falte ni sobre, preparar la junta diaria de ventas con todo el personal de la tienda indicando el presupuesto diario y las ventas del día anterior, tomar medidas en base a la información obtenida.  "
good,"This was my first job, but it helped me better my communication skills. Went from being a shy teenager to a talkative and hard working adult. Very nice place to work"
good,"This is a retail job, so beware of the pitfalls with said environment. Horrible customers, product setting, being understaffed, and not great pay. also of coarse, Black Friday."
good,"Organizar mi agenda y ruta la para la vista de mi cartera de clientes, contemplar visita de nuevos posibles clientes."
good,"El trabajr ahi no es malo, pero la cultura del gerente para manejar al equipo de trabajo es algo militarizada. Es lo unico que lo hace pesado."
good,Help customers find product they are looking for and recovery of store. Also making recommendations based on the customers needs.
good,"Working with the customers is the fun part of the day. Everyday brings different kinds of people and having the chance to talk about them is a good experience i look forward too."
good,I only contracted for a few months so my review would not be a valid one nor would it be fair therefore I will reframe from commenting at this time.
good,Good working culture and supportive management The team environment is very supportive and the management is approachable.
good,"The job does have advantages depending on the individual. However"
good,"This company can be good but it has a lot of up's and downs. Although my co-workers are very hardworking, it seems that management is not interested in creating bigger opportunities for their employees."
good,"too busy not enough staff to cover floor and registers. busiest hour of the day during lunch. some customers would get mad because we couldn't get to them as fast as they want us to. the management part on my opinion they need more training on how to assist associates on floor. "
good,"My day is consisted of working the register, helping customers with purchases, and advising if able to help them save money on products on sale."
good,"La empresa te marca los procesos a seguir, pero te permite buscar la mejor manera de re alisarlos y algo que encontré fue el trabajo en equipo siempre se facilitan las situaciones laborales para poder desarrollar un trabajo en conjunto. y como en todo grupo hay quien no este abierto a el trabajo grupal era interesante ver como por la dinámica de la operación se incluía hasta al mas renuente a el trabajo en equipo."
good,"It's a retail job, what can I say?  It's not the hardest job in the world, but you will definitely do a lot of work that is beyond your pay grade."
good,It's your typical corporate office environment.  Some departments are great to be in but others aren't.  Office politics is a sport there.
good,is a fun place the management are ok  i growth a lot in this job  but sometime is too much pressure for a not much of a payment but is pretty ok to start something.security is good  you learn something new everyday
good,Customer service is extremely important.  They tend to want to tell you what to say. At the end of the day it is ok.  The people are nice.
good,"Lot of long hours, but the people I work with were great. I was quickly promoted to a supervisor. Only after 2 years. They have holiday parties, and give gifts at the parties. like laptops and tvs"
good,"This job was a stressful day in and day out. If we didn't please a customer by bending over backwards we received a bad survey. When we were told we must stick to the quantities during back to school, we would get in trouble not only because of customer complaints, but then the store manager would cave to customers just to make them happy. Store Manager never really worked to his potential leaving the task to hourly managers who could not go over 40 hrs. Upper management has to no idea what it is like to run a store let alone help in one. This just sit on their duffs and boss people around."
good,"Overall, in the workplace it is not too bad especially if it is a busy shift. Good hours; they really work well on your hours and schedule."
good,"It was a great first retail experience. "
good,"Es una empresa la cual te deja trabajar, si haces bien las cosas no te dicen nada eso es todas la empresas."
good,"Its been along time since I worked for them."
good,"In the past 3 and a half year with the company, I have gained many skills from simply working with a cash register to providing excellent customer service. Their main goal is to provide excellent customer service and give employees activities/ goals everyday to help obtain the main goal. Management and co-workers are always in a great mood and willing to help at any time."
good,"Office Depot is a good place to earn experience since there are numerous positions that entail different skills. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people find the best product for them and teaching them how that particular item works. I really enjoy teaching and helping others it makes me feel as though I am making a difference. There is a lot to do each day from setting planograms to working/fixing infected computers and sometimes designing invitations for someone. What I do is a wide range of things, which I enjoy because multitasking is something I am really good at. However work would not be enjoyable without my fabulous coworkers, they are literally my best friends and we work so well together! They make even the hardest parts of the job, like assessing and creating a solution for a difficult customer a breeze. Along with the management team; the assistant manager at my store was the glue that held the store together. I have never met someone so reliable."
good,"Learning how to create business cards, flyers, invitations and much more. While employed at Office Depot I became proficient with Microsoft OfficeWord and Excel."
good,"It was an amazing work environment, it was a honor getting the opportunity to work with the people but things happen.I would recommend for anyone who gets the job to be ready to work because it's not an easy job. Although, the job will teach you how to be responsible and not only that but to respect the people around you."
good,"I worked with the accts payable department and we worked together as a team.  We filled in when trying to get dead lines for month end to get all invoices entered in timely manner to pay out in time. We had pot lucks for birthdays and all of us got along. The hardest part was when they sent our jobs overseas and we were let go, and teaching the new people about our accounts."
good,The work is easy but tidiness and the management can be over bearing but also kind and understanding and co-worker are sometimes not helpful but nice to the customers that come in
good,"Office Depot was a great company to work for. I was there for over 9 years and left due to company layoff."
good,Resolving issues with customers is a challenge. But every issue is a new one. It kept me on my toes. I was very sad to leave but unfortunately they laid of my department.
good,"Working with Office Depot Office Max ,has been memorable and fascinating. The company culture is great and provides employee's with a supportive environment. The only concern is they are growing and a lot of managers are trying to transition it into a corporate environment, so hopefully that doesn't continue. Over all it's a great company!"
good,"A typical day at work would be opening the store and receiving shipment. The management and coworkers worked well together, everyone was very close and respectful. The hardest part of that job was the fact that they closed down. The most enjoyable part was being apart of a great team."
good,"I had fun with helping out the customers, and getting great advise from my managers, It was fun learning about the products they had -I learned a great amount from working there about computers and the customers idea's ..My co-workers were great people and very polite.."
good,"Buenas prestacciones y salario atractivo"
good,"I work as a cashier interacting with customers being sure their needs are met.  Once a week I take down the old weekly ad and set up the new weekly ad.  I also do janitorial duties at the end of my shift by cleaning break room, bathrooms, clean trash, etc.  I have learned to always be responsible for the job set before you and get it done.  Always be kind and have a smile on your face.  Be positive.  I enjoy working with my fellow employees and the boss.  Each day is enjoyable working there.  The hardest part is going on a ladder and getting stock down.  The most enjoyable part is seeing customers day in and day out and being able to assist whenever possible."
good,"Todos los dias eran de labores similares, donde se hacian diseños, impresiones, acomodo de mercancia, atencion al cliente."
good,"A typical day at Office Depot was preparing the store for opening;count the drawers, restocking supply, making the store presentable for the customer's. Working at Office Depot I learned the responsibilities of running a store, time management, managing money and customer service . I enjoyed this job because there was there was room for advancement. I got to assist the manager with duties that were not of my job description. Things such as payroll, and other useful knowledge needed to keep a business a float."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Office Depot, although the company was going through a merger and the store I worked at closed.  The company typically provided associate managers with adequate training."
good,The Office Depot/OfficeMax family stresses the importance of customer service. Customers must walk out of the store feeling satisfied that they completed their shopping experience in one great place.
good,"I loved Office Max, learned so much about people, customer, excelled in my role very quickly. Learned several pieces of the organization."
good,Principalmente generar ventas reacomodo de mercancia cambio de precios de los productos limpieza del area
good,"Overall, pretty nice place to work as Office Max.  Went markedly downhill once merged with Office Depot.  The people in Boca seemed to 'know it all' and looked for very lilttle involvement from those of us at Office Max."
good,Fun place to work and friendly co workers. Did not like that most staff were students so many didnt care for the company. Management staff was always available when needed
good,delegated daily deliveries for 35 drivers. routing customer service concerns. Fleet and rentals budgets reports daily. delivery window confirmation follow ups.
good,Meeting # on a daily basics very stressful Met a lot of good people including management.Safety was very important.A lot of heavy lifting.
good,"I loved the environment and people that I worked with. This was probably one of the best jobs I've had. There was never a dull moment, and enough stuff to do that kept me busy through out the whole day."
good,"Try to deliver world class customer service is office depots goal."
good,"The new leadership teams are outstanding. But due to all of the merger and acquisition activity, the future is not clear or stable."
good,I would call customers to make sure they were ok on supplies. If they weren't I would get their order placed and their supplies to them in a timely matter.
good,It's an alright place to work very grateful that I have a job but I just want better
good,"As an Sales and Service Manager I was able to increase high dollar service sales while increasing Customer Satisfaction through constant training and observation of customer interactions.  As Operations Manager I controlled all the logistics process including freight, merchandising, and return-to-vendor operations. With the merger between Office Depot and Office Max the increase in traffic, due to the closing of a local store, without an increase in staff has been difficult."
good,It is gaining more experiences in retail job environment. meet and greet customers. More focusing on sales.
good,"Good place to work with good people.  With the recent merger of Office Max and Office Depot, many stores are closing. The closing of these stores changed what would have been considered good job security.  I'm sure when the entire merger has run its course, job security will be steady again.  Great place to move up the ladder if your willing to put in the time and work. However, many changes in the company has made it hard to be sure of standard operating procedures.  Overall, it has been a pleasure working with Office Depot, but I need more security."
good,This company was made me very comfortable when I first began. As time went by the company took away a lot of benefits and also made the job more stressful.
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, buscando la total satisfacción del cliente"
good,"personas simpáticas , un trabajo ameno , mucha comprensión por parte de los jefes con los trabajadores que estudiamos ."
good,Co-workers were great.  OMAX was a fun company to work at.  The co-workers worked well together as a team.
good,I enjoyed working at Office Depot. They work with my schedule to allow for me to work and still attend school.
good,"I find myself challenged everyday. A typical day involves issues on all fronts. As the company changes and is learning to adapt to the new and ever ""evolving"" business model, the associates are losing out most of all. I've worked my way up from Cashier, to Technology Associate, to Senior Technology Specialist, and on to Sales and Service Manager. Each step of that process was met with months and months of waiting due to management dragging the process on. Training involves mostly trial by fire due to understaffing from limited hours due to budget constraints. Management focus is mostly on following the program set in place by corporate. This program is geared toward the in-store customer experience yet there is more emphasis on following the program word for word then taking care of the customers in the store and using the program as a tool to do so. Issues from the copy and print department and tech depot service counter are a daily occurrence due to poor training of associates. ex: no time for management to train due to budget constraints and difficult to navigate training material. Managers are overworked and associates are not adequately compensated or recognized for achievements. The over all impression I've gotten from Office Depot is that you're excepted the squeeze water from stone. You're expected to squeeze so hard you bleed. Find a solution to a problem! ...just so long as it doesn't involve making Office Depot acknowledge the true heart of the problem, or giving associates healthcare, or going over the already tiny budget your allotted. Great Company!"
good,"I took a leadership role from the start of this job and that really taught me how to run a store and how to work with people in advancing them while bettering myself. Everyone knew each other from the other stores and the dm's even knew the names of the employees at each store, which really stuck out to me a lot."
good,"Although the culture has changed recently due to a major merger, the people are generally a pleasure to work with and the resources support sales department success."
good,"Prior to working at Office Depot, I had no experience in retail. It has been a big learning experience for me. I've learned a lot about assisting customers, and meeting their needs. Along with learning things about office supplies, and technology items like computers, and routers. My management at the store have been very friendly and helpful - having worked around my school schedule and giving me a fair amount of hours. All other co-workers are great to work it, a lot of different, interesting people. The hardest part of the job is continuously finding something to do - a lot times I have to ask my manager what I can do."
good,"I overall liked working for Office Depot. A typical day would involve assisting customers and answering telephones.  While working at Office Depot I learned the professional needs of local businesses. "
good,Just like any other retail job. There are some people that know what they're doing and others who have absolutely no clue. Overall it's a pretty good place to work if you're just looking for a part-time job and like working with people. The management is generally pretty lax except for when stuff really needs to get done and they have a pretty good attendance policy but it's difficult to advance in the company with the current restructure going on.
good,"This was my first job. There were many changes made over the years, and there was always something to do. It had common features, like ""help every customer"", but every customer is different, so it broke the monotony. Also, tasks were an everyday part of the job, but tasks changed daily as well. Along with the knowledge and understanding that comes with any job, I learned patience, perseverance, and humility in this customer service based environment. Over the course of my employment, I had many managers, some of which I like more than others, but all of whom I respect. I am pleased to say that I got along with almost all of my co-workers. The hardest part of this job for me was the changes to the management team (district manager and higher). It was hard to gain credibility when a new manager was appointed who had to spend time getting to know their new district. The most enjoyable was when after I assisted someone, they would come back and ask for me since I was now a trusted advisor."
good,"Management is great, but sometimes they play favorites. If you aren't looking to move ahead in life, or you just want some extra money part time, this would be a great start."
good,"ok, large company and not enough hours.     Never got the time off requested..."
good,"With the merger happening, things have certainly been chaotic. However, I love my position as well as the team I'm on. We work well together as a team and help each other strive as individuals. I am saddened to know that there will be no future in my career at OfficeMax but I am grateful at the opportunity I have been given."
good,"Its a great company to work for.  The procedures that they have in place from cooperate down is focused on giving customers the best service around, as long as though procedures are followed, but unfortunately, its hit or miss in this market."
good,"Customer satisfaction is most important and is always sought out above all else. Working with the computers can involve trouble shooting, software repair, data recovery/ destruction, and light hardware repair. The management is always giving helpful criticism, and is always there when you need them. Co-workers are usually friendly and part of an ever growing team with similar goals. The hardest part of the job would be to try to maintain a high level of customer service while trying to complete mandatory daily tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the many interactions on a daily basis with new people and provide information that you enjoy to talk about."
good,"Good company, plenty of advancement opportunity, they have an expendable philosophy."
good,"At Office Depot, my duties typically revolved around working the floor (directing customers to their desired items), stocking the shelves or ringing up orders at the cash register. Before working this job, I had actually never learned how to operate a register before, so that was definitely a plus. My manager was very fair and unobtrusive and my co-workers never hesitated to assist me if I ever requested help."
good,its fun to work here most of the time. I love the interaction with customers. I love hearing their stories.
good,"That is how much I love this job. My coworkers are amazing and I've literally never had as much fun anywhere else. There are a few people I don't get along too well with, but even with them it's still the best job I've had-people wise. I love interacting with everyone (even the customers!) "
good,Most of my day was interacting with customers. This was the fun part of the job. I also spent a big part of my day teaching and educating my employees. I  was very familiar with the P&L financials and exceeded by budgets on a Quarterly basis. Co-workers were fun to work with.
good,Co-workers could do a lot to care more for the company. Managers don't like to go by the book.
good,"Good environment to learn the aspects of data entry and retail billing."
good,"My typical day at work working at Office depot was fairly easy. I worked as a cashier. I also preformed other duties such as the copy and print area, stock and janitorial duties. I learned alot working for Office depot things like how to use a fax machine and a printer. Management was great. The manager Keith always made sure everybody was on task. The hardest part of the job i would have to say the people who worked on the sells floor have the hardest job i never really got to expereince that part I was always behind the reigester."
good,"I worked night receiving at Office Depot. It was a skeleton crew. We unloaded the back stockroom every night and worked the freight, We did special displays and rotated stock from high shelves. We checked basement stockroom to see if extra inventory could be stocked. We helped get sales floor and stock room inventory ready."
good,"Great place to work, not bad pay for starting retail.  Benefits are okay, but could be better.  Very sales oriented, as many retail locations are, and should be."
good,"Office Depot was good in that the co-workers cared about each other but it was also a long day with lots of expectations to meet and very hard on the feet and low back to stand so much.  Most of the customers were very nice but sometimes they were rude, which is typical for retail."
good,great staff and management at 1771 Alton Rd. great environment to work in team spirited 
good,OD is a great place to work because of the people you work with however the current environment has made things uncertain. Upper management changes often which then is followed by a change in direction. Luckily the foot soldiers are a great bunch.
good,A typical day will have constant lifting. I learned a lot of different jobs within the warehouse. I would do something new a least once a week. The management and co-workers were all cool. We were all on the same page containing getting the job done. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable and that was the exercise.
good,"I worked here for almost 3 years, worked my butt off and it seemed like they enjoyed paying me scraps. They emphasize everything about the customer which is cool but the worker gets nothing in return but attitude and bigger expectations dropped on them. To be such a known company worldwide with branches all across the globe the benefits suck and the pay is even worse."
good,a typical day was coming in early in the morning to stock the sales floor. I learned to be productive first thing in the morning. I never had a problem with my co-workers. There was nothing difficult about this job. The most enjoyable part was the regular customers and co-workers.
good,A typical day at Office Depot in the Copy and Print Department was crazy. We were always super busy but always made sure our customers were well take care of or beyond. We received various amounts of compliments on our work ethics. Management is not that great. That had to be one of the hardest parts about working for this company. I felt they were too leniant and never stuck to their word. The most enjoyable thing about working at Office Depot would have to be the employees. We had such great chemistry and an awesome work enviroment.
good,"un dia tipico era entrar a las 7:00 am y empezar a supervisar al personal, verificar que cumplan con tareas y asignaciones, atender al cliente desde que abre sus puertas, fue una experiencia agradable por que aprendi todo lo que se de una tienda departamental, servicio, arqueos, cobrar, la direccion siempre muy amable, cada tienda tiene su gerencia y cada gerente maneja diferente su tienda trabaje con varios gerentes y cada uno buscaba la solucion a sus problemas, el ambiente era muy sano y mis compañeros todos tratabamos de llevarno bien lo dificil era cuando no habia personal y no contrataban, haciendo la carga de trabajo mas pesado para otros, los valores y principios que enseñan en la empresa y la preocupacion por la gente."
good,Helping customers find solutions provides great satisfaction.
good,"Management staff and, support staff work well together. Overall the company is working functioning very will."
good,I worked in the copy and print center. I learned a lot of new skills while working there. Skills that I have taken with me to each job I've accepted.
good,"I love working here. Especially in the Copy & Print department. I learned so much in my first two weeks, and I have fun working with different people and different jobs. It can be rough some days, but for the most part it is laid back and fun."
good,"I enjoyed the continuous learning and recurrent training regarding the customer experience. The oppourtunity for advancement was limited, management utilized strong leadership however in directing tasks."
good,The Office Depot store i worked at had good chemistry and management. We work as the best team i have ever been on. We had constant backup from store managers.
good,"He trabajado durante dos años y medio, un trabajo ameno, bien organizado y con un ambiente entre los compañeros muy bueno."
good,Customer focused company that envelopes all aspects of running a large big box retailer. Constant facing with customers makes everyday a learning experience. Some development opportunity issues with associates made training a struggle
good,"My job consisted of me designing, create, and to produce promotional products for marketing puposes. in this job experience i have learned that hard work and great customer service helps a long way. the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new customers and showing them my great work"
good,My duties at Office Depot were to unload trucks with the use of a forklift and/or pallet jack. Sort merchandise and stage it for the floor. Package and return damaged and defective merchandise to vendor. Clean and organize warehouse. File paperwork.
good,"A typical day at work starts with checking my email and answering my suppliers, followed by solving queries regarding price and quantity, routing invoices, making reports and paying suppliers. Managers are mostly friends, yet driven to success. My co-workers are open-minded people who make the job enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is managing to finish things before the deadline, since we have a high work volume. The most enjoyable part of the job is managing people with different personalities and dealing with suppliers."
good,Office Depot allowed me to have great opportunities in learning different functions of BSD warehouse.
good,"• Coordinated and assisted in the integration of all Tech Depot accounting functions as A/P, A/R, Tax Department and Fixed Assets from Great Plains into Office Depot PeopleSoft accounting software to eliminate dual Journal entries and processes."
good,"Unfortunately, Boise/Office Max East Rutherford location relocated to Pennsylvania."
good,Insure that all equipment is working properly and that supplies are ordered. Check to make sure all customer orders that have been placed with outside vendors have been verified. Then check the production log to make to see which customer orders are due next and that they have been completed on time. Work customer design and print jobs to make deadlines. Take customer jobs and communicate what customer needs are to others in the department and provide great service.
good,Worked on ordering products and services for customers through FAX machines that was approved by the customer. Efficiently assisted customers with exchanges and refunds for products either already owned or damaged.
good,"The management does a good job at assigning tasks to associates while maintaining supervisory duties on floor. There is room for advancement, but only in the technology department, copy and print services, and management. Overall the company is good company that is continuously developing and growing."
good,cash handling
good,"I grew up working for this company. I moved up from part time technology employee to full time, then to department manager. I learned a great deal because Office Depot has a fairly extensive training program."
good,"Un buen lugar para trabajar y desarrollarte  "
good,"I worked in the printing department which was fantastic. I learned a great deal in marketing and advertisement. Must be good at multi-tasking to last in that department. Met all kinds of really great people from associates and customers. Management was good, I became manager of print center and my team was well trained, competent, super helpful and friendly. The part I enjoyed the most was the knowledge I obtained about getting organized, electronics, and working with customers, building rapport."
good,Stay active with your coworkers. Be nice to your coworkers and managers. Maintain your tone. And be open to ask for help/to learn anything thats related to work.
good,"With my time in office depot i did build many skills, such as cash handling and customer service. If the management is right the job will be a fun environment"
good,A great place to work for. Learned new skills that helped me throughout my stay It was a friendly environment with great people to work with and always room for improvement.
good,My first few weeks of working there were kind of hectic because it was like you’d have to learn as you go and like they let you have your own bubble. What’s great is that whenever you’d have a question somebody is always ready with an answer ! The customers are amazing! They provide for their employees and are flexible with you. It can get boring at times with how dead it is but you’ll learn to appreciate that once the print center starts to pack up
good,"I can only speak for the location I worked at and none other. All of my coworkers are great. My GM is a wonderful leader. The company can be more. I see so much potential of what Office Depot can become. Yet, I feel our executives only see it self as an Office Supply Retailer. OD is offering IT supports which I am a part of, but I feel they lack the convincing of believing the choices they make."
good,"A good place to work. "
good,"la distribución de trabajo es muy mala, todos los auxiliares ganan lo mismo pero unos trabajan mucho mas que otros"
good,The customers can be a little much but working there with the people that I did made it worth every minute there. When you are fully staffed its a great job but when there's not enough people on the shift it can get bad pretty quick.
good,Office Depot Office Max is a pretty good company when you compare it to other retail organizations but has the same problems as those organizations. Like many retail companies it all depends on the people you work with and the store you get assigned to. There are good stores and stores that have a lot of problems. The Mesa store specifically is a very good store with a strong manager currently
good,"Working with them was an experience, it was not to difficult to do but was a little confused since not many upper management new the direction that they want it to go."
good,"Working here was very stress free.  There's a lot to take in from learning cash register, promoting sales, reward sign ups, ink subscriptions, sell furniture, help in print and much more. but i guess that makes the time go by faster. Overall it has great staff, not too much diversity which can become uncomfortable because you notice a lot of low discrimination going on."
good,I went to this job while I was finishing college. I worked in the copy and print department as well as working in sales. The work experience was fine.
good,"During my last performance review, I brought up my desire for a raise/promotion. I was advised that we had a company wide hiring freeze/raise freeze. Since then the company had laid off 200 employees at the Corporate HQ alone, along with several store closure, but we have hired a new employee and promoted 2 internal employees in my department alone."
good,Job can be hectic sometimes but good coworkers makes it fun. Company has it pros and cons.. Could be better in certain ways and offer more incentives to employees.
good,Morning excersie started my day. Learned a lot of receiving skills. Management was fair . Culture very much could use work. the hardest part was the hours. most enjoyment was the learning of new skills
good,"I typically work in the morning where I complete my morning tasks. Throughout the day I am always tasking, as well as working with customers. We are pushed to sell services the company offers."
good,"They are “proud“ to be non-union; and their policies run to the “associates are disposable“ end of the spectrum "
good,"hatte eine super Firma, leider wurde der Standort in Lanken geschlossen und somit wurden alle  Kollegen entlassen."
good,"start 7am work probably till 3-5pm depending on your pace"
good,"Office Depot is a great place to work at depending on what area you want to be in. Cashier, printing, tech, or stock. They all have their pros and cons. Management there was always good to me and they have all been there for a while now and know what they're doing. You learn a lot from customers over time and can be beneficial to you over time. Overall a great place to work at!"
good,Es una empresa muy buena con buen ambiente de trabajo se aprende mucho. Puedes aprender de varias áreas.
good,I absolutely cherish my time spent at Office Depot.  But as the saying goes...all good things must come to an end. The company is changing due to the its market status and it is coming through in associate moral. The most recent employee cuts has made everyone uneasy.
good,"Need more hours the pay is way to low, need people who show up for work, stop playing with their phone when deal with customer. More vacation days. We have to sell to many things at the front, asking people about protection, plans ink, rewards, stamps, paper, too much, customers don't like all the questions."
good,I am a technician/management I help with issues on the floor and repair computers whenever someone brings one in. I am very skilled with technician work. I enjoy meeting new people and helping my customers to the best of my abilities and to what tools the store gives me.
good,Enjoyed the job would have transferred to another location but moved to another city. Would recommend job for a college student or someone interested in a part time job. Laid back and not stressful at all.
good,Great place to get to learn new things that you'd never expect ! Met great and new people that helped a lot along the way. You get many great benefits from learning with customers and how to respond with different situations.
good,"It's a nice place, the people are friendly and inviting. It's not a very demanding job, but there can be some times where you have to do alot(Back to school season). Overall it's a great place to get started in, but I didn't have much to do at my location and it got really dull. I got promoted twice in about half a year, so they do reward workers well, and they let you have a flexible schedule."
good,"A typical day at work would start with some reporting, product research and e-mails"
good,"Very approachable employees with a whole-hearted approach to making sure new hires are accustomed and acclimatized to the sales environment. Excellent training from managers and supervisors, as well as lots on on the job learning of the products youre selling."
good,"Office Depot has shown to be led by a great team and there's a real sense of teamwork. Unfortunately, it's still retail, so you'll be pulling your hair out from the usual call-outs, customers, clopens, and ever-changing schedule."
good,"Consistent work, sick leave and pro. Became good friends with upper management. Good hours at the time. Good pay at the time. Could have used benefits and more vacation time."
good,Its like having a family to work there. Everyone is extremely friendly and accommodating when sick or having family problems.  it was by far the best job I had ever had.
good,Started as a freight associate and left as a Store Manager. Not very many companies do that anymore. Lots of change occurring in the company now. Corporate needs to narrow its sight and focus on a few items. Currently changing direction almost weekly.
good,"I started right before back to school so I fell into the lions den. It was fast paced, but once I caught on it wasn't difficult at all. I loved the people I worked with and was sad to go."
good,"Had many customers that were regular and that were great to have. I learned a lot from the people that had been there years before me. My store managers were both great while I was working there (one retired during my time there). Everyone worked together, and I got along great with my co-workers. Most people I didn't get along with or like usually didn't make it there long (mostly work ethic). The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers or people attempting to steal/make false returns. Most enjoyable part was the flexibility of schedule since I did have to go on maternity leave while working there once. I have two kids so the flexible schedule definitely helped."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo era bueno porque entre los compañeros hacinamos un buen trabajo en equipo, aprendí a hacer todos los trabajos que se hacían dentro de área, lo mas difícil era aprender a tener buen trato con el cliente y saber su necesidad, lo que mas me gusto de trabajar ahí fue que pude superarme porque llegue sin saber hacer muchas cosas del área de copymax"
good,"It was a fun job, but the pay just wasn't enough. I was getting paid minimum wager at the time, and even when they upgraded my position (from Retail Associate to Stock Associate), the pay raise wasn't enough."
good,"At Office Depot and Office Max, every leader is responsible for growing total sales and services within the location. The Client Engagement Manager is responsible for customer satisfaction, community outreach, and in-store events for small and medium businesses.

good,"It was okay slow but under staffed 90% of the time so we stayed rather busy, the managers were rather chill, over all if you are in need of a job go ahead and work there."
good,une très bonne ambiance et entraide entre employé.
good,"Closing contracts with International Customers"
good,Great place to work fun and always something different happing also management is great also and we always try and make it a fun place to work we also dress up for the holidays coming up..
good,"I feel that when management and team work together, we all get a good result.  I enjoy the company of my coworkers and we get together on occasion for team building experiences"
good,"Liked working there fornever doing retail it was nice"
good,The hardest part of the job is getting over the amount of gossip some stores carry about other staff members or the resentment staff has towards management.
good,worked here in high school and came back while I was in college.  it was not a very demanding job but the pay reflects that  hours were more or less flexible
good,"Todo siempre depende de la gerencia que se encuentre, puede ser un lugar muy bueno para trabajar o muy dificil"
good,"i enjoyed my time at office depot. It was fast paced and  I got a chance to increase my administrative skills like filing documents, creating business cards and memos for customers."
good,"Tasking all day. When i started working here the store was in the middle of Store manager change. The 3 years that i worked there i had 4 different store managers that would all run the store differently so it was a little frustrating. Got promoted to Customer Service Manager within 1 year because the position became open, they like to promote within the company."
good,"I worked in the print services department. They were more than accommodating when it came to learning equipment and trying to help out someone new. I was hired on during college while in trying to get my degree in Graphic Design. I learned the importance of fine details and new skills in customer service. I was happy here, and it was unfortunate that I had to leave. Unfortunately, my store also closed three months after I left due to lack of business."
good,"Although I love my coworkers and the regulars at my store, the pay for the number of hours I work, and the amount of work I do is terrible. Also it feels as if we are constantly understaffed. At some times there is as many as 6-8 employees in the store, but when it opens and closes, there is normally only 4, making it very difficult for the store to be run effectively."
good,Working at office depot helps to build one as a person but the pay isn't sufficient for a adult. You have to work extra hard to get a little bonus on your check.
good,Once again learned very good customer service but was not too satisfied with job security and pay all in all a great place to work at could not afford too many living expenses for such low pay
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and returning customers. Learning all the jobs in copy and print shop. I enjoyed stocking and putting up sale items. Being a cashier was fun.
good,it was boring. I learned at lot about printing. The managers were cool. the culture was manageable. dealing with the customers was the hardest part. the most enjoyable part was the comradely with my coworkers.
good,"Great company culture, great facility. They offer career growth opportunities. I personally was able get promoted internally a couple of times.  The only downside is the pay isn't great compared to other competitors and some of the benefits such as the medical could be better. Aside from that, it is one of the best companies I have ever worked for."
good,"In a day at work I was able to have time to communicate directly with each associate and in groups giving the days topics and tasks. A team first environment that created a good working atmosphere. If someone struggled, a fellow associate was always willing to help. The hardest part of my job was getting all of the information that was given to me to share with the team that did not overwhelm them. The part of my job that enjoyed the most was rewarding success. It was great to see their reaction to being recognized with their peers. This industry is moving from a sales organization to a service organization in order to survive the on-line era we are in today."
good,"I worked predominantly as technology sales lead. I sold computers, printers etc and taught others the sales tactics that I learned from the classes OD sent me on. We held meetings to teach these skills. I also often worked register, general customer service and as a stockman. Most of the promotions were coming from other stores and the pay raises were roughly about 10 cents quarterly if you did your job well. I learned some things while I was there and its a great job to have as you are coming up."
good,U need to be a quick learner and quick on your feet and have a strong back for the amount of weight u will be lifting or pushing for the deliveries. Unless u have a really good back brace
good,"My typical day at work was engaging with customers and finding out what they needed. As per my job title, I dealt with mostly technology such as printers, laptops, desktops, tablets and other small devices. In addition to this, I learned a lot about diagnostics and troubleshooting on customer devices, as well as software and hardware installation."
good,"OfficeDepot is a good first time job, I highly recommend. I have had a great experience working there. My only complaint is that there is usually a lack of staff issue."
good,"Great place to work.  Meet very interesting people.  Worked with a lot of good employees. Good company for a first job, recommend to all high schoolers"
good,The work schedule was very flexible. The managers were understanding in doing weekly schedule. Friendly place to work. Demanding workload and very customer focused.
good,"First customer came and asked me about 2,5 Binder"
good,"Very good with teaching opportunities concerning electronics.  Good team to work with, good team environment.  Management would work along employees when necessary."
good,my bosses were great. my coworkers were awesome. I learned a lot as a worker there. a fantastic experience over-all. the only reason I left is I was offered a higher paying job.
good,Very much enjoyed my time but Office Depot went out of business where I lived. Met wonderful people and gained lots of skills. I do miss working there.
good,"The typical work day would be depending on what section you are in. Printing services is tech based. I learned quite a bit about cashiering, how the new systems work for cashiering and about other technology products. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with people."
good,"Its been 12years since working for Office Depot, but truly enjoyed my time with them, if it wasn't for a 1.5 hours commute both ways I would still be with them"
good,"When you start they only offer part time (20-28). You get health benefits if you become FULL TIME.  Discounts range between 10-30% depending on what you buy. Uniform consists of a polo (2), but presentable jeans are allowed. My store's atmosphere is pretty laid-back."
good,"Everything was really great.  The only thing that bothered me was, that it took me working there for 5 years before I got any kind of raise. The environment was always really fun and relaxed, even when it was a mad house (back to school season)."
good,"In claims you are expected to work well over the 40 salaried hours to keep up with the workload, and get no compensation for the extra time and effort. There is no work/life balance. The company as a whole presents an image of work/life balance and caring for their employees. There's plenty of extra-curricular activities which is a plus, but it doesn't outweigh the negatives within claims. There's very poor communication from management most of the time."
good,I worked hard at OfficeMax but was rewarded.  Hardest thing that happened was being bought out by Office Depot.  Culture was lost and everything moved at that point.
good,"Árut vettem át,segítettem a vásárlóknak,hogy megtalálják a számukra fontos dolgokat."
good,Working at office depot isn't easy. It's hard dealing with racist customers and managers who get anxious over the simplest things. I don't let that bother me.
good,"I liked this job, although it had it's challenges. Whenever the company made any major changes in procedures or adding new product categories, it was often difficult for the team to shift into the new thinking and duties in a timely fashion. This is also true whenever there was a shift in leadership either at a store level or higher. Overall, we had a good team there that was attentive to customers and the store appearance. I always enjoyed celebrating daily successes with the team. Being that I've had a long career in retail, I am always surprised by how companies differ. However, there are always the basic customer service, sales skills and general retail basics that remain the same. I hope this company remains successful because they treat there employees pretty well and I believe that Office Depot/Office Max generally has a good business model and is healthy competition for Staples."
good,"When I was first hired I absolutely loved working there, not just because it was a job but because of the people I worked with. It was a fun work place. You get to interact with all sorts of people."
good,"Just had too many days in a row too many times. 8 to 10 days straight with no day off then maybe 1 in between.  Pretty good benefits, hours of operation were good,"
good,I enjoyed working for Office Max - Office Depot. The amount of hours have increased and I just would prefer to work less hours each week. That is why I am deciding to put my self back on the job market.
good,I started on the order desk and worked my way up to the position of Operation specialist.   Manager can see when people have talent and encourage them to suceed.
good,"Excellent environment to work. They have a great team building environment and value the employees. Supervisors listen and are receptive to feedback, positive or negative. I enjoyed my tenure with Office Depot."
good,"I enjoyed working with this company. There’s plenty of room to move up and get raises. My personal problem was that if we(regular employees) were just a few minutes late we would get in trouble, but I’d the managers were late everything would be fine. I remember my very 1st day there the GM was 2 hours late. We were scheduled to go in at 4, he didn’t show up until 6"
good,"OfficeMax.....was a great place to work, learn and grow. The stores were all very close and helpful which lead to great long term friendships."
good,"A fantastic place to get the initial essential training for going out into the business world in full. The compensation and benefits are not amazing, but that's not to be expected from a company like this. I found my time there to be worthwhile and I am very happy with it."
good,"its typical retail, more budget-friendly than Best Buy.  Great place to learn about printing, selling, and information technology"
good,Un poco des organizado pero depende de cada sucursal sin embargo un excelente ambiente y oportunidad dde crecimiento
good,Even with leadership changes Office Depot is still a great company to work for. Most of the leadership is both family and company centered. I like the way the company is moving towards a tech savy vs. tangible items only company.
good,"I loved working at Office Depot.  The staff was energetic, supportive and team-oriented.  All of my supervisors were willing to train and educate the employees and when needed were available for customer interaction should a problem arise. The pay should be better and there should be an incentive raise structure put in place.  Overall, since I did not need benefits and was looking for extra income, this was a good, flexible job."
good,"Managers are hit-or-miss, but mostly good at what they do.  Corporate has a lot of big ideas that would only work in a perfect world - they've probably never actually set foot in a store to see how their ideas could be implemented.  Scheduling is very flexible, depending on your store management's preferences.  It's mostly a laidback place to work.  The stores are all in somewhat bad shape - I've worked in 4 locations and none of them had a working air conditioner.  We've had 4 CeOs in the 5 years I worked there."
good,Office Depot can get very slow at times. If the people you work with are fun then the job is easy. If you work with difficult people then it can be annoying.
good,"Worked on transition from Office Max to Office Depot platform."
good,"Office Depot is a very Fast paced store, can be a little stressful. I have learned to multitask. It's a busy store with a busy copy and print department."
good,The company was very ready to teach and work with it employees in growing in the company itself. Even when leaving the manager sat with me and discussed my options to transfer and farther my education elsewhere. Sadly that was not the case and I had to decline the amazing offer. Sure wish I stuck with them.
good,It is a welcoming workplace for anyone looking for a solid summer job.  Flexible work hours with understanding managers and friendly coworkers who were always willing to help out.
good,"ambiente laboral relajado, buenas prestaciones, pero mala administracion a nivel gerencial"
good,At office depot I learned how to be productive and time management. We worked on different projects so multi tasking and prioritizing is a must. Being on task and able to complete everything on time.
good,"I worked as a ""sales consultant print services"" employee at Office Max meaning I worked in the print center. I learned Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Publisher and I learned how to make stamps. I learned how to print on a large format printer, how to cut reams of paper, how to three hole punch and how to process shipments with Fed Ex."
good,"Lots of hard work, manual labor. Opportunity to move from temporary worker to full time. Even opportunity to get a machine operator license and get paid more."
good,Great place to work at while still in school. Full time jobs were always a issue due to a set amount of managers. Hours always increased in summer due to back to school. Met a bunch of friend that I still have to this day.
good,"I enjoyed my time here, but I had to relocate and the drive from there was about 120 miles total daily ..so I had to give it up. My managers were personal and professional."
good,"speak to a lot of people a day"
good,"Good company with a very energetic culture. It has a great campus, including a gym and a cafeteria with a lot of healthy choices. Work life balance is good."
good,se puede aprender de diversas areas dentro de la empresa el ambiente de trabajo es bueno y el sueldo y prestaciones de lo mejor
good,Office Depot is a good company to work for. Good starting pay and willing to train and advance if you are willing to work for it. I have been with Office Depot for almost 20 years and they have been a stable foundation throughout.
good,"Taking care of customers' needs and selling while adhering to daily operations."
good,"The Officemax I worked at was well managed, clean, organized as well as promoted nicely through their own company. Super customer orientated with great ethics."
good,"En general, es una buena empresa con mucha oportunidad de crecimiento."
good,"A typical day for me is making calls to prospects, following with my prospects, scheduling meetings, and hunting for new business. I keep track of all this through a CRM program. I'm also connecting with prospects via LinkedIn."
good,Working at Office Depot/Office Max was a great first job to gain experience in many different areas for future jobs. The management and staff was fun to work with and made the job super enjoyable.
good,"An excellent company to work for, well recognized and organized.I would recommend a friend or family member work there.I learned alot about the inventory system and quality control also the operation of various equipments including, forklifts, reach trucks, powered paletjacks and cherry pickers which I was cirtified for."
good,"Good company to work for, worked for a former manager that made work enjoyable. Guest made job enjoyable by not being so defensiveness as the entered the store."
good,Office Depot was a very great experience for me as my first real paying job. I had plenty of supportive co-workers and managers with reasonable hours and decent pay. The thing I learned most from this job is the importance of communication as the jobs I would work on in the copy and print department would either succeed or fail depending on how well me and my co-workers were communicating to each other.
good,Love love love my job! So sad that I had to leave because of daycare and the hours. Unfortunately working nights just didn't work out for me anymore. Other than that a very well paid and excellent company to work for.
good,A typical day at work for me started at 4 a.m.  I started by unloading freight and stocking shelves.  Then I would prepare the store for opening.  Management worked well with the employees and were very friendly.
good,"You'll have a lot of opportunities to learn and grow, if you're that type of person that will take initiative to approach a manager about being cross-trained. Once you reach management level you might find you make really great friends with your co-managers. Anyone above store level is a bit out of touch though, and that can make them difficult to deal with sometimes."
good,"Work was fast paced and at times, time crunching. Many projects had to make deadlines often. Learned how to teach and be productive in a work environment daily. Most enjoyably part of the job was the camaraderie with my teammates."
good,"was great company to work for, then purchased Corporate Express and took on CE philosophies and management."
good,It is a nice fast paced and competitive environment. It is fulfilling especially if you want to learn new skills such as working a cash register and learning about the store.
good,My tenure at Office Depot has been a journey of ups and downs. One hand I loved the flexibility as a college student. On the other I still have this feeling that the place has no true sense of direction as far a procedures that lead to a lot of miscommunication among staff and customers and lead to inconsistency of orders. While I wouldn't be against working for them again I would like to see a change in infrastructure at the work place.
good,"I enjoyed working at Office Depot. It was challenging at times, but I enjoyed learning new things. I loved the customers. I loved the times when a customer walked out smiling, this made me want to strive harder to insure that all my customers have a great customer experience. The management team was always available and very knowledgeable."
good,"I was taught the best customer services standards ever achievable throughout the industry and I am very grateful for this."
good,"Over a few years, able to advance, and pay is decent. Benefits are great. Typical is busy, stressful, expected 60 hours worth of work in a 40 hour week. Depending on management, it can be done with assistance. Managerial rotations can move your commute from 10 minutes to an hour."
good,"Un rôle propre bien encadré, mais manque d'intéressement à la vente."
good,"All in all the company is a good company to work for ,  they are competitive in wages and hours.  The company keeps you informed and is willing to cross train to ensure you are able to work different"
good,"My duties at this company included Merchandising, Sales, Product representation (Sprint/Dell), Warranty replacement, and Stocking. I also was responsible for Customer training with computer products and new technology."
good,They were a family oriented company. They always made sure that we were taken care of. The pay structure was fair and benefits were great. I had a great experience with the management while they were open. Unfortunately they had to close.
good,Working here will help you stay on your feet. It's fast paced always moving. There is always something to do. Managment is fair. The atmosphere is nice and calm
good,It was a great place to work. Coworkers were awesome as well as management. I worked in the print department and it was a great stepping stone for my graphic design career.
good,It was a good part time job but no advancement.  I had very flexible hours and the managers were willing to work with my schedule which allowed time with my family.
good,"Enjoy my work, but unfortunately my store is closing.  Office Depot purchased Office Max about 5 years ago, and they have decided the College Station Office Depot and Office Max are to close together.  They want to close one and Office Max was chosen to be eliminated."
good,I learned to have patience. My coworkers were very helpful. The cash registers are really old and need to be updated. I feel like the company can be more efficient if they replace their registers.
good,"Very friendly place to work with every  helps out, now iam working in Print shop department, which is fun to work, 1am still in learning mode there is always a new challenge i enjoying it.but some time if iam stuck in a job there is no is no one to help cause we are shot handed which is frustrating"
good,"The Office Depot headquarters is a great place to work.  There are many amenities on the campus such as a gym, cafeteria, dry cleaners, and message room.  A typical day at work is preparing for meetings and planning future meetings.  The workplace culture is great and there are many activities held at the corporate campus to boost employee moral and relieve stress."
good,The people are very nice they help locate whatever it is your looking for. And the copy and print center in the back is amazing. They are so helpful and willing to get things right the first go around.
good,"Work Days are tough, taxing on the body, hours vary throughout the season. Times you will get hours are back to school, back to business in January and two weeks in November around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Management is good for the most part. The managers are good, down to earth people, though they are demanding, they try to make work as fun and enjoyable as they can. I've learned more about the process of orders and working for a place like Office Depot will gives great exposure. For an individual that is young, working for a place like office depot is great on a resume, and great with school and furthering my education as they work with students in college and universities."
good,"This position was an amazing opportunity! Very caring and supportive supervisors. Everyone I worked for was extremely interested in my career advancement. Reviews were conducted every 6 months with raises coming yearly. The work became too physical for me as I reached age 40, but I am very grateful to have had this opportunity."
good,"Fun, fast paced. Hardest part was dealing with young kids always calling in. I enjoyed training employee's, and helping the customers. I learned a lot about computers, and electronics."
good,"Have enjoyed Office Depot Corporate Accounts division for many years and have been able to run a very profitable National accounts business under the OD umbrella. Very goal oriented atmosphere with much positive competition."
good,"Very fun, fast paced work environment. Advancements come easily. Training is effiencient and broken down in the easiest of ways to learn. Customers were always happy."
good,Working at Office Max was fun. Learning about the computers was a blast. Very fast paced environment with good pay and benefits. Learning to run a big box store has helped me in my other endeavors.
good,"Very, relaxed sometimes but overall was a good job. Some days were stressful. The school time like the back to school month was crazy but I managed and the lunch breaks were nice. The employee funny and friendly I loved them."
good,"Though I had a lot of responsibilities on this job, it typically came down to selling technology. I wanted to do a lot more of the repairing, but most of it is remotely done by another company. They seem pretty flexible with hours if you're lucky and get a reasonable manager. There were honestly a lot of fun days and the culture was decent. I learned a decent amount but anyone with basic technology knowledge could do the job I had, honestly. They want you to sell more than anything else, though, and that was the hard part of the job. Customer service seemed to be the focus, but they (upper management) really just wanted to see sales numbers. The best part of the job was definitely my coworkers and how helpful everyone was if I didn't know how to do something. YMMV though depending on your location."
good,"Challenges during the day good for a management learning environment  good for developing potential employees and good  customer service ,good  for showing your skills and good for learning."
good,"The management made it aware from day one that if you work hard, you will progress. Within the three years that I worked there, I was promoted 3 times from stocking, to sales, to Sr. Sales Consultant for business'."
good,"Es buena empresa para trabajar."
good,"At OfficeDepot or OfficeMax you will be treated pretty well.  You will perform many jobs and tasks but all of the following are pretty balanced: Job Work/Life Balance"
good,"Enjoyable company to work for. At the end of the recession, company began to eliminate the higher paid, long term managers in a way to cut expenses and it really hurt the individual stores."
good,"OfficeMax went though some changes prior to the merger, but it use to be a great store!  A warehouse environment for the office pro.  Now they are more like boutiques."
good,A well oiled engine that was operating well including delivering to commercial accounts. Management direction was the biggest plus to complete the task and employees were very dedicated in completing their tasks.
good,"I learned a variety of skills including laptop and desktop repair, Print services and how to operate the printer and design posters for customers along with unique individual customer requests. (my favorite was a 1920's scrap book with advertisements from the time period still intact."
good,"A typical day at office depot is fast paced, with freight to get out and customers to help, you have to learn how to prioritize and know when to use teamwork to accomplish your goals. The best part of the job experience is the cross training with the different departments inside the store."
good,"7:50 AM 10 customers lined up outside. One cashier, one zone 2/3 and me. Where is management? Manager is covering zone 2/3, looks like I'm in charge of the front again! We can do this, we've done it before. It's go time. It never stops until quieting time."
good,"As a Sales Associates at Office Depot, a typical day included stocking supplies, assembling furniture, and assisting customers. The work place culture was one of diversity and a drive to succeed."
good,They work very well with your hours. Pay is a little bit above minimum. Part time associates are only allowed to work up to 24 hours. Part time employees can also get PTO.
good,"The day starts fast and ends fast.  Lots to do from opening to close.  Consistent customer interaction, merchandise set up and organization.  Several areas to manage like frontend cashiers, copy and print area, freight receiving and stocking, sales floor depts. like tech and furniture and supplies.   "
good,I enjoy working there. I like dealing with customers and my staff is great. I drive 40 miles one way is the only reason I am looking for other jobs.I get to work on merchandising product daily. I enjoy our management team we have there.
good,Great place for entry-level sales. Environment is fast-paced but also balanced. Great customer service experience. Management is fair but lots of work top keep up with.
good,"can be stressful pushing sales all day long, store goals are a real priority at this job and can be annoying. you can end up working in diferent areas of the store"
good,"Great company with lots of positive support from team members. Team work is key for this job, and this location truly had teamwork. Staff and customers are highly respectful towards each other and rules of the store."
good,El ambiente de trabajo en Office max Acapulco era muy padre.
good,it was a pretty good place to work and the people where ok. Didnt really seem like the type of place you can make a career out of and move up but its good for a few month while you find another job.
good,"Team oriented, fun culture, competitive sales everyday there is a rush of customers so it's a bit of challenge multitasking and having patience Also keeping a positive attitude  is contagious to others"
good,A job that ranks well for retail. I enjoy my managers and the fast-paced environment that keeps me busy. I also enjoy helping customers find what they are looking for and exceeding their expectations.
good,"Working at office Max can be hard sometimes but it will teach you many life lessons."
good,"Officemax has been relaxed, yet organized retail job where I have learned basic customer service, sales, and point of sales skills. Working at OfficeMax was my first job outside of the pool (ie lifeguarding and swim coaching), and it was a quite enjoyable experience. The managers and supervisors all enjoyed my energy and ability to stay focused and work hard. The hardest part about the job is dealing with unsatisfied customers, who feel like they have been wronged by the company. It is always a nice, satisfying feeling to help one of these customers and see them leave the store with their problem fixed, and a smile on their face."
good,"I started as a part time cashier and ended as a full time manager. I was in charge of all shipments in and out of the store, all store resets, as well as opening the store and sometimes closing the store."
good,"Its okay. I don't like the new schedule system. They don't like to approve time off. I was told that if i couldn't work the weekends, i was wasting the company's time."
good,Worked for migration of Hyperion Artifact for all the financial business users.Worked on hyperion modules to understand the new applications and help users.
good,"The day started off when I had to unload trucks, 5+pallets every morning, by myself. Had to have it all unloaded by 8am. I showed up at 7am every morning. "
good,This position gave me the chance to troubleshoot computers first hand and gave me a great insight to the basics an IT should have. Involving that plus customer service brought together a very rare mix needed in the IT profession.
good,"Cashiering, Customer Service, and Sales are all part of a typical day. Keep your register tidy and organize, help out at print center or take a try at Tech."
good,"Fun to work with customer to create to develop and create orders. Coworkers were excellent. Always something to do, i.e. stock, registers, clean and more."
good,the people are the best part about the od/om life. work can go from nothing to smooth to stressful though in no time at all. it all depends on customers and the projects that day. .
good,It helps a lot with resume building. I learned everything from PC and software's to file documents and much more. The work place was about providing excellent customer service.
good,While i was there it was a chill job to work at and coworkers are good people but there furniture is to heavy for one person but they dont make 2 people do teamwork for the furniture you basically have to pick them up on your own if there heavy
good,"It's all about services.  (or was).  Computer Services, warranties, and surveys is what they used to talk about.  Sales, Profi,t and store appearance didn't seem to matter much"
good,"Check reports for sales, out of stock items, special orders and repairs.  Review incoming shipment,  review schedule, schedule lunch and breaks. Review payroll, plan morning meeting, assign tasks to members, ensure the front end is prepared, balance the safe, complete the deposit, prepare out going mail, communicate with store manage on sales and projections. Review company e-mail,"
good,They are flexible with school schedules and everyone gets along well. There is a lot to learn based on your department. You will always be productive if you work in the Copy & Print department. Sometimes it is very hard to clock out on time depending on customers in the store.
good,"Environnement de travail agréable, équipe dynamique"
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and full of tasks."
good,"Falta seriedad en la cuestión de seguridad ya que ni se cuenta con un CCT así como los sensores y alarmas en puerta no funcionan correctamente, aunado a esto la falta de capacitación y seriedad del personal externo de guardias de seguridad"
good,"The Location that I work at can be very fast paced, but at times can be dreadfully slow. Back-to-School is the peak time at his employer. Recently a new scheduling software was implemented, this right now is causing some hiccups(Implemented at the first of the year). Management can be nice,(this may vary by location) and can listen to any problems."
good,"This is a great place to work and has a beautiful campus. The industry is challenged and the company gone through a lot recently including many leadership changes, but with the right vision this could be a place of opportunity."
good,"Buena,empresa muy enfocada en los objetivos, importandole ademas de que se lograran las formas tambien,el ambiente laboral casi siempre dependia del gerente que estuviera en turno en la tienda."
good,"A typical day is always busy and there is never a dull moment. "
good,This store was busy and u had to be on ur best at all times.   U had to help in every area.   If copy and print center needed help u help.   If the sales floor need u stepped up and worked there.  U had to be very flexible
good,"Great place to work if it's your first job, compensation isn't the greatest but your coworkers are wonderful. The office depot/office max merge was handled very poorly."
good,"At Office Depot, I learned how to multitask, find solutions for customers, and how to keep a positive attitude. The overall atmosphere is great, everyone works as a team to help one another. A typical day consists of answering phones, greeting customers, handling money, and keeping the store in clean condition. The hardest part of the job is the multitasking. Helping customers proficiently can be tricky when you have to answer phones, grab furniture, and check customers out. It's all worth it when you build relationships with customers that bring them back time and time again."
good,"Jarenlang (bijna 21!) met veel plezier gewerkt bij Office Depot, waarbij je voldoende ontwikkelingskansen krijgt als je dat zelf ook kenbaar maakt. Zeer dynamische omgeving, wat ik altijd als een uitdaging zag maar iemand die zeer conventioneel ingesteld is zal daar wat meer moeite mee hebben. Afhankelijk van welke afdeling je werkzaam bent, ook goede doorgroeimogelijkheden. Plezierige werksfeer, goede primaire en secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden."
good,"When you first come in check that everything is neat and lined up on the shelves.. Next go to the tech bench and see if there are any notes on actions to take or if someone is coming early for pickup. "
good,The big thing with office depot is remembering that you are part of a team and that you have to divide and conquer on all the work. Always keep a level head otherwise the stress can get to you. Otherwise if you make it past the 90 days you can definitely make it in to something in the lines of management you just have to try.
good,I was happy for the chance to prove my worth to the company. It was a good fit for me at the time. Would recommend Office Depot to anyone looking to get some job experience.
good,"Like I said, not the most exciting job, but I got good hours, worked with great people, had great managers who took car of me and it was also pretty easy to advance in the company if you work hard."
good,"Nice, modern office building. "
good,Typical day would be a cashier. My managers listened to my problems and took care of them. Co-workers were always nice and willing to help. Most enjoyable part of my day would be seeing a good friend I worked with.
good,Improved my customer service skills. Very easy going.  My team was like family. The most enjoyable part of the day was satisfying customers
good,"The workload is manageable. If you work diligently with a good attitude, you will get along well with the managers. It's all about sales, customer service, and store maintenance."
good,Our environment at the store I worked at was great. I had a great Boss.  We worked together as a team to build sales and market the store.  We had training's that helped us learn more marketing strategies.
good,I was a cashier and I was near the front so I also greeted people.  I would assist in finding specific items for customers as well. My co workers were great.
good,"Fright is hard work 5-6 in the morning mainly 6 hours a day. I learned how to close a store, store management along with personal experience on shipments restocking locating items in store out of store and how to order items. Management know how to get what needs to be done. Friendly envierment. Hardest part it to get things done in time that applies with the store schedule. I enjoy getting this done on time."
good,"un día típico en el trabajo seria cuando espesamos a negar artículos por falta de existencia, lo que se aprendió muy bien es a realizar varias cosas a la vez, por parte de la dirección solo falto que cumplieran en tiempo y forma con lo que prometían, por otra parte mis colegas fuimos muy recíprocos y una de las cosas mas dificiles del trabajo era cuando llegaba mercancía y abia discrepancias ya que ponían en duda tu honestidad lo bueno de todo que a todos nos gusto es que siempre pagaban en tiempo y forma tu sueldo"
good,"I have no real complaints about this job, they are all people that you could really get along with, and call friends. I didn't know by ""constantly changing environment"" they meant ""new employees every week"". I didn't know where the original people were that I worked with when I walked in one day."
good,"I was constantly told that I was not moving fast enough (because I would help customers) and when I began moving adequately, I was chastised for not helping customers. It was frustrating. But the job was simple and my coworkers were great."
good,"Overall great atmosphere in the building. They offer very good benefits with competitive pay. The building includes a cafeteria, gym, auditorium and much more."
good,"los días en el trabajo transcurren normal sin altas ni bajas el ambiente entre compañeros es excelente si te llevas bien con ellos y eres respetuoso, en ese empleo aprendí mucho sobre las relaciones personales y sobre el correcto trato con el cliente,me agradaba mucho que el trabajo no era difícil y aprendía muchas cosas ya sea en el área de copiado o en almacén siempre había algo que aprender,lo malo era el mal manejo de los gerentes y regionales asi el personal siempre con prepotencia e ineptitud"
good,Steady work always something to do. The management team was excellent to work for. The employees became friends with them afterwards and still in contact with. I was a computer tech during that time and was the best department I worked in.
good,Office Depot is a chill working environment. They are willing to work with you if you are in school. It is a homely place where you can get comfortable with management and regular customers.
good,Its a good job the staff is nice and understanding. Its a fun job.There are many things you can work as. Its a great store with great departments. It has a lot of cool products as well.
good,Buena empresa sueldo atractivo y buen trato honestidad y calidad
good,After i left best buy i was offered a job here. I fell in love with helping the customers and fixing the computers. It was one of my favorite jobs. I would have stayed but the manager i liked passed away.
good,"As a manager I would say its a good company with room to grow, but with office depot and OfficeMax in merge, the OfficeMax side seems to have taken quite the blow between the two companies. Many OfficeMax stores are closing down because Office depot is essentially the primary company in the business model. For part time, it was an easy job with flexible hours."
good,"Excellent work life balance.  Unstable environment with pending mergers originally with Officedepot, then Staples."
good,I enjoy my position in the Print Center. My co-workers and management are great. The relationships I've personally built with my regular customers is heartwarming.
good,"Overall, it was a great place to work. I was there for 14 years and had reached my max compensation for the position unless I was willing to relocate."
good,Different locations vary but mine had great/strict serious management but they seem to be cutting hours because of business issues... hope its not a world wide thing cause its a pretty decent work enviornment a foot step through the door
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is selling products on the sales floor. I always enjoyed helping customers finding the right product. I learned a lot at OfficeMax. I became a better sales person and I also became more confident as I got promoted twice during my time at OfficeMax. I worked my way up during my time at OfficeMax and I worked as much as I could because it was fun and challenging. My co-workers were great and the management was always helpful.
good,"this company is good and challenging,because we have to do such things to make the costumers better and satisfied. like show him/her the product they are looking for,show them how to operate or used it."
good,This is a retail business like other retailers I enjoy working there but left to go work at a Disney Resort. They also have a problem with retention which made difficult to fill shifts.
good,I have spent a long time with OfficeMax and I speak highly of  them for employment.  I was offered knowledge on a daily basis to better my job productivity and I also moved up with in the company.  I enjoyed working with my fellow employees as we were like a family unit.
good,The pay was good and the work was some what easy until they asked me to use Photoshop and had no prior training nor did i receive training.
good,"I really liked to be able to do more than one job in a day, you got experience doing something different and learning something new. I have to say i really liked working with my coworkers."
good,I've learned that professionalism is the most important attribute to have in a retail setting. You have to be able to stay professional and smile no matter what is going on in your personal life.
good,"Great company to work for, but the management was poor. I worked with a great team.  A great place to work for a part time job. I enjoyed working with all of the people there."
good,"Tienen sus errores pero tratan bien a sus trabajadores."
good,"As my first real job, this was an invaluable experience. Learning to work with customers is a great skill, and learning the ins and outs of the retail life is good."
good,heavy work load but could be fun place to work. managers love you try hard to relate to you help you through your work day care about your well being
good,I would usually start the shift with some stocking with some associates than rotate around the store to see if customers have any questions and talk to them before giving them the best options for them. Most of the time the schedule were manageable in that you give in advance your school schedule for them to use as a tool for making the actual schedule.
good,A typical day at work would entail customer interactions and strategy sessions to support business goals.  It is a great joy building the relationships I have with both my customers and my internal support systems.
good,"A good first work experience with an amazing array of skills to pick up that could serve you as a launching pad for even greater opportunities. The coworkers are great and the feel of the Team mentality is 100%. That being said, management could use some tweaks, it might just be that I had the bad time of being put with sub par management, but I did get a lot of my schedules mixed up, sometimes a bit of lousy, sometimes even no training from management and at times a few words that do not encourage. Hardest part of this work was the management which at times just served as an obstacle for an excellent work team that worked within the rules. The most enjoyable part of the work was truly the learning experience."
good,"Prior to the merger, this company was very stable with upward mobility and good benefits for associates.  A typical day consisted of monitoring associates portfolios to ensure they were tracking toward goal and were being productive in their customer contacts.  I learned many areas of billing, accounting and collections during my tenure.  The biggest area of focus I was able to work on was third party EDI platforms for billing.  My co-workers were very supportive and my team was self sufficient when needed.  The hardest part of the job was administering disciplinary action when necessary, but that's the nature of the beast that is management.  The most enjoyable part of my job was when the team was tracking well and making good progress.  They worked well as a group and it was nice to see them treat each other as family, helping teach and grow as a group."
good,"Prettige werkgever, vol met (internationale) uitdagingen, helaas soms lastig om daadwerkelijk veranderingen te bewerkstelligen. Veel veranderingsprocessen hebben een (te) lange doorlooptijd, waardoor de slagvaardigheid van het bedrijf mogelijk in gevaar gaat komen."
good,"As a college student, this job was extremely easy and was basically a lot of mindless tasks. Minimum wage isn't exactly an ideal pay, but it helped me through college. The people were always incredible, the managers were more than willing to help and work around school schedules. Never complained about my inability to work during finals or anything like that. Overall great experience."
good,Typical retail job.  The pay was decent but not great. The management always worked about my college schedule ever semester.
good,"es una empresa donde tiene un buen ambiente de trabajo hay una armonia al trabajar apoyo en las actividades diarias que se realiza, aprendes a manejar y convivir dia con dia. ahi aprendi que la atencion a los cliente es lo primero."
good,"A typical work day at Office Max would include helping customers, setting planograms, staying busy and leading by example for employers. I have learned to be patient with customers and employees because everyone is different and every problem is different. Managing things at work really starts with our team. The management crew that we have does a really great job. My co-workers show me respect and they work hard, they enjoy working with me because they know I'm there to fix anything and my effort cant be questioned. I don't really look at the job as hard. Some customers can be difficult but there is a solution to every problem. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the staff I'm on. We work hard but we also have a great time."
good,"Responsabile magazzino, scorte, inventario, data-entry, DDT, bolle...ecc.. sicuramente ho appreso un ottima capacità di lavoro in team e una forte autonomia nella gestione del personale in quanto   di varie etnie e vari i settori da gestire"
good,"typical day would be to call on 12 to 15 customers a day, with 80% confirmed appointments ranging from end user to high level calls and backed by a detailed business plan implemented to maximize account penetration. I learned to develop long lasting partnerships with customers to supply and manager their office products procurement. The most challenging thing would be to maintain a broader perspective in task-focused situations."
good,Working in the Print Center at OfficeMax/ Office Depot I learned so much from my supervisors and department manager. The department manager knew how to create a fun and productive work environment and is to this day one of the best managers I have ever had.
good,Excellent company to work for with great management and leadership.  They will most likely be acquired by Staples very soon.
good,"tareas multiples, y variadas desde cobro de cajas, trato con proveedores hasta envios de efectivo, buena empresa para aprender"
good,"Manage sales, be personable, innovative, responsible and friendly, understand software, computers, and sell office management product."
good,"Typical day at work is for me to come in to finish any computer services currently needed to be done. Help customers that come in with their computers and diagnose the problem. Set up new displays for computer, printers and tablets. The management works well together and get along. They push for business needs."
good,gained good experience in a fast paced environment. My  co-workers were really nice and they would help me out to learn new things.
good,Office Depot focused on development of bench management and a professional work environment.  The company always framed it's initiatives around customer service.
good,They have great food and a great drink list. it alsao has music and dj night on every other saturday which is great for adults not so much kids though
good,"A fun place to work, the people are decent, management is ok,benefits are good. Hardest part is being on my feet all day. Management doesn't harass you too much."
good,Working here for  two years was good for me. There were so many things that I learned that I now use at my current job. A  job to help you gain the experience.
good,"comienzas tu día en horarios rotados entre 6 am 10 am 12 pm o 2 pm y 8 horas después terminas tu turno tienes comedor y una hora para tus alimentos y descanso, capacitación constante incentivos vales y un salario justo, oportunidades de crecimiento, pero detenidas por el feudo personal del gerente donde crecía quien le agradara un que no tuviera ningún conocimiento, y bajo una pregunta directa, su respuesta fue "" nadie crece aquí si yo no lo digo hagas lo que hagas"" el trabajo con los colegas era muy bueno y cordial, diferencias donde quiera existen pero en general muy bien, dificil sobre llebar al gerente , me encanta los trabajos en general amo lo que ago para no tener que ir a trabajar."
good,"OfficeMax was a great place to work and with the merger involving Office Depot, things got more difficult as my areas were outsourced. The actions took a great deal of time and that wore on people in their day to day work."
good,"A pretty fun place to work at, mostly due to the awesome coworkers I had. The company is very flexible when it comes to the hours you work, but they are atrocious in compensating their employees. There were two years were the company didn't even bother giving anyone a raise."
good,loaded and unloaded trailers daily. scanning and receiving was very organized ran by great management. the job culture was also great.
good,"Working at Office Depot I learned so much about the retail industry, Office Depot helped me to become better at multitasking as I was cross trained in multiple departments. However the company does not provide much room for advancement as the company only offers very small pay raises once a year  and does not have many promotions."
good,"A typical day started with contacting vendors and field managers and customers to make sure everyone involved was on the page concerning production."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Office Depot but unfortunately my hours are at a minimum due to the amount of employees. Also, the pay is not where it should be and although job security is great, there are not many opportunities for advancement."
good,"OfficeMax was a good place to work."
good,"Working at Office Depot was not only a memorable experience, but a learning one. Although most of the training I was given was already attained through personal experience, I have a better understanding of the design and print business."
good,"Always something to do, busy days. Learn new procedures when they change. Management cares about store as well as employees. Hardest part of job is ensuring everything is done on time. Fun job, keep busy all day, helping customers"
good,dependiendo de el area en donde me tocara estar ya sea en cajas o en atenciona cliente. en cajas iniciar abriendo turno en tu caja y esperar a fuera de la terminal a los clientes ayudarles con su mercancia cobrarla empacarla agradecer su preferencia y su compra. en el area de atencion a cliente se realizaban las mismas actividades ya q tambien se cobraba mercancia en esa area y ademas de eso realizar las facturas cambios de mercancia y/o devoluciones atender el telefono conmutador transferir llamadas recibir paqueteria y atender a los clientes q llegaran con algun problema y darle la mejor solucion
good,I learned a lot from my manager. He was patient and very understanding. He taught me Microsoft Office and how to keep a good balance at work. Office Depot is a good place to work they really take time to appreciate their employees.
good,What I enjoyed the most about working with Office Max/Depot was the customers. A good customer can make a great day out what you thought was the worst day ever plus I worked with some pretty good associates as well. I will admit that I learned a lot from being there nearly 4 years that will help carry me to my next venture. One of harder parts of the job includes customer service that was dealing with returns because you could hear some of wildest stories when an item was being returned and being a cashier but that comes with the territory. Most of my store leaders were pretty understandable and would work with you to the best of their ability.
good,"As I plan to leave OfficeMax, my heart is heavy. The only reason that I have chosen to leave is due entirely to a necessity to earn more money. "
good,"Normal retail sales and logistics position. Learned how to approach and sell to customers in a professional manner. Depending on store, management can vary as far as effectiveness. Same can be said about fellow associates but overall good people."
good,Great place to help people find things they needed for their needs. A typical day was busy as a customer service rep and cashier. Got along well with coworkers understanding different workers quirks. Management was both good and lousy depending on the manager and his personality. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items. the most enjoyable part was the customer service end.
good,It is customer service which is self explanatory. We have an amazing team. I run the front of the store and am the top sales cashier. The company gives very few chances for advancement as well as chances to work more then 25 hours a week.
good,"Good place to work but definitely be ready for a never ending onslaught of changes, no two days are the same working for this company which can make things interesting and make for a good challenge and it can also make working there very stressful."
good,"No ping pong table, great benefits and Job Security Overall Compensation and the most enjoyable part of the job is when ever thing works out."
good,"It was a great environment with good people, but it is just another retail position. Compared to other retail stores they are maybe a little more lax, but only if tasks are being completed correctly and in a timely manner. Kept me busy while I worked, but also received lots of free drinks and snacks as rewards for doing my job well."
good,Assisted customers and explained products. Processed online orders. Queried stock for reorder. Restocked shelves. Answered a multi-phone line system.  Tendered sales and cashed out customers. Handled customer complaints and provided solutions to issues.
good,this was my first job. the hours were bad but i worked replenishment so they were to be expected. the pay was probably the worst part but the job its self and the people were great.
good,"I was expected to be prepared to act as a cashier, customer service specialist, or stocker. The management was very understandable of my occupations as a student. My co-workers were always willing to help me out and they worked together very well. Amazing customer service came naturally with the job."
good,"Company offers a stable position with opportunities to grow and a friendly work environment.  Company could benefit from provide employee's better benefits and with pending Staple's buyout, the energy is very down."
good,Great place to work. Needs improvement in processes and structure. On boarding for new hires is challenging due to most hiring happens in peak season.
good,"Empresa importante que se preocupa por las prestaciones del personal, sin embargo no se preocupa tanto por el crecimiento, pueden pasar años y sigue en el mismo puesto."
good,"This company provided me with a sound foundation to grow myself into a strong retail sales worker. The stores always had great managers with positive attitudes and a willingness to actually help their associates. The benefits and pay were a little too small and would rob any part time worker of their income. All coworkers were very happy to work with one another as a sound unit, and definitely made it the most enjoyable part of the job. The most difficult part of the job was having to tolerate the low payment for the increase demand that certain titles asked for. For example, a logistics worker who stocks the shelves and receives pallets from truck deliveries and reorganized the store only makes about 15 cents more over a sales associate of the same area."
good,"I actually love what I do.  I enjoy presenting to large groups, especially when my audience consists of CEO's and CFO's of major corporations.  The majority of my accounts are public sector, so I meet with cities, counties, colleges and universities, and also manage one of the nations largest hospice care providers (private sector).  Most importantly,  I have a fantastic working relationship with my district sales manager and team.   "
good,"I learned how to become a better salesman, give great customer service, etc. The pay isn't great, its mainly for people looking to work part time."
good,"A typical day at work would require greeting people, helping them find what they need while showing them friendly costumer service. As a sales consultant our job is to show excellent customer service to our customer as well as inform them on the product.  While informing the customer of the product of their need we also offer product protection plans(PPP) or insurance on all technology and furniture. The plan covers at least two years of insurance. "
good,"Making sure all customers are taken care of in a timely manner"
good,"I loved the challenge of learning new things. I developed long lasting friendships. Personal and professional. The fast paced days went by in no time. I drove extra hours through traffic, bad weather and construction just to be at this job. I loved seeing progress being made and interacting with customers. My favorite moments would have to be when customers would come in with a project to do and no clue how to do it. By the time they left we had a plan and materials to complete their needs. It's what brings them back and ask for me personally."
good,"Working at Office Depot for 20 years taught me that customer service is what makes a business stay in business. On an average day I interact with over 75 customers and up to 10 co-workers.  Being able to multitask is key to making the day run smooth and with low stress. As a manager I have worked each of the different departments and have transferred to 7 different stores. Each transfer was to better myself or help fix a store that needed help. My only complaint is the usual for retail, working weekends and holidays. For many years I used theses days as ways to keep me on my toes since that meant I would have days off in the middle of the week to get other life issues done.  I have enjoyed the job as a whole for the 20 years I have been working for Office Depot."
good,Freight is done first   in the morning from there  you would  check the tech log for work pending. Then work one tech jobs and call the customer  when you are finished.  The major thing you learn there is to take care of the customer they come first.
good,"Job is fun, but doesnt provide a regular schedual. Managament is strong and the culture is regular. I have been trained on a veriety of sales solutions and have been helped with the ins and out of management."
good,"with horrible management will come horrible work environment. I'd know, I worked at 4 different stores and seen it all. years invested but i'll still go back any day."
good,Very fast paced data entry/customer services position. Assisted contract customers with placing office supply orders. Position was outsourced due to company merger.
good,A typical day for me at this job would be going to the to workers lounge first in order to get my headset. Then we would tell the workers our target sale for the day and wish everybody a good day. Then I would get to work and help customers find the item that they came to the store for at the same time maintaining the isles. If they needed help at the cash register then I would have to go on the cash register and ring people out. At the end of the night I would help clean up the store and then head out and go home. The co workers there were cool but everyone was pretty much about getting their job done. The management there made us feel excited about working especially because we were in the busiest time of the month. Overall I learned how to serve the customer and to be optimistic about the job.
good,A typical day at Office Depot is very busy with maybe an hour of down time.
good,"A lo largo de mi carrera en Office Depot pude desarrollarme personal y profesionalmente."
good,Log in stating you're at work and really just give sales / customer support.
good,Loved working here. Met good people. Wish it was more room for advancement.
good,This was my very first job. This job helped me get on my feet. I met a lot of really good people by working here.
good,"OfficeMax and Office Depot are now Office Depot, Inc. So far the executive team have made lightning quick changes in our operating model. Hopefully, the new company will combine the best of each brand and create a more robust company. The greatest thing I've learned is to be agile as well as adaptable."
good,Copy and print led the way in revenue generation.  Great area to work at Office Depot! High margins and bonus potential.  M
good,busy with allot of good co workers. some of the lifting was heavy.management was good company ran great.
good,"Provided print solutions that ranged from curriculum, test assessements, flyers, workbooks, etc."
good,"llegar esperar a que lleguen los proveedores para poder descargar la mercancía y poder distribuirla y en pesar a organizar por pedidos."
good,"In my current position, I am in constant contact with commercial print customers that need to have their projects completed in a quick turnaround time.  We handle their needs from the analyzing/creation of their documents, to editing, production and finishing of their projects.  We coordinate with the customer the timely delivery of projects to accommodate their needs.  Our customer base ranges from small local businesses to major Fortune 500 companies.  We deliver projects nationwide."
good,"A typical day of work would start 5-6 am, a few hours before opening.  To start we unpacked and stocked several pallets of freight, placing the remainder in back-stock according to a numbered system, and then scanning and filling retail outs. These are timed processes, with time allotted based on the number of pallets of freight and the number of outs scanned. About mid-shift, these processes would ideally be completed, and the responsibilities would shift to assisting customers, working registers as needed, as well as assembling furniture and displays."
good,Equipment operator for Office Depot and put away pull orders to be load for the next delivers and replenish product for the day orders to be pulled.
good,"Good job"
good,I liked working for this company. I was the first of many to do many departments in the company. I enjoyed working in the copy center.
good,The company worked well as a team and provided a positive environment for learning.
good,Usually I was in the Copy and Print center running the printers and various machines for customers orders as well as using my experience in Microsoft Office Works and Photoshop. My managers were all professional and a joy to work for and they treated all employees equally and fairly. My co-workers all pulled their weight and treated customers professionally. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure the best way to complete jobs for customers.
good,"Oversaw delivery services provided by third party carriers throughout Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. Monitored day to day business which encompassed parcel & furniture delivery to individual customers,  retail store replenishment, LTL and line haul lanes from the distribution center to third party providers."
good,"In my current employment i have learned to manage time more effectively. I enjoy interfacing with customer providing the best solutions to their needs. With my co-workers we work as a team for i believe this is the only to accomplish the company""s goals. the enjoyable part of my job is customer service."
good,"A typical day would include: putting out freight, stocking shelves, sweeping and cleaning, assisting customers in Supplies and in Tech Departments, cash register, and assisting customers in Copy and Print Services."
good,"Manage the planning sales and profit goals of the store as established by the company, Manage and directs the operation and merch IMU to increase profits through Office Depot programs."
good,It wasn't so bad. If you are good with people you will be very good at this job. it was a good environment and a good workplace. the only bad thing is that you had no benefits.
good,"A typical day at work was people coming in need a lot of copies made or needing binding done. I learned how to multi task better"
good,"i guess you need the right crowd of employees, but my store was fantastic. we worked well as a team in and out of the work environment. i learned a lot and met a lot of good people"
good,a good company to work for just am looking for something full time due to a recent life change.
good,"I was normally the cashier on duty during the back to school season. I also was put in charge of the copy and print department a few times without being officially trained in, I wanted to help out where ever needed. The managers were awesome, especially the C&PD manager. I learned how to operate some new machines in the C&PD while trying to balance completely every task in a timely fashion. The hardest part of the job was being able to complete all the customers orders during such a busy season and with so many co-workers quitting their job due to the stress, it made it even more difficult."
good,"OfficeMax is an excellent place to work for the culture.  Emphasis is placed on teamwork, integrity and customer service.  There are several Associate Resource Groups in which one with like interests can interact.  I have the chance to work with all levels of management; Managers,Directors, Senior Directors, VP's, Senior VP's, and Executive VP's.  The greatest challenge I have faced is bringing the different departments together on contract negotiations.  My greatest satisfaction from working atOfficeMax is producing a product (a contract) that meets the needs of the business and providing the least risk to OfficeMax"
good,It was dank!  I really liked it. I learned a lot.  They use old systems.
good,Greeted customers as they walked through the doors. Processed transactions for products purchased. I helped customers find what they were looking for. I learned to be friendly and helpful with both coworkers ;and customers. I loved my coworkers. The most difficult part of the job was working late nights after store closing and having to return for an early morning shift. I enjoyed the interaction with different customers.
good,Store was ok. Co-workers got along.  Management team was great! Store manager was very flexible with scheduling employees.
good,Great place to work unitl merger made them change the way in which we operate anbd pay we receive
good,"I have established a lot of return customers who love my work. They're wonderful, and supportive. "
good,"I learned a lot from Office Depot, its a fun place to work I get to help others. I feel really bad when I left this job because I really like it there. The co-workers there are vary nice and friendly to each other and they help with each other."
good,It is a company that is very concerned with the values of customer service.  Office Depot sees that the customer is always right and tries to make sure every customer had a wonderful shopping experience before leaving the store.  The hardest part of the job is that the corporation changes the policies just about every six months so keeping up with this can sometimes be challenging.  The most enjoyable is meeting the new people from all walks of life.
good,"Answered questions for customers concerning laptop, desktop, tablets, printers, scanners and other office equipment."
good,"Every work day generally started with checking/ responding to emails, reviewing colleague notes from previous shifts to prioritize workload, answering phones,  responding to customer issues and request, receiving in orders, placing orders into production, assisting with finishing HOT orders, completing daily reports, among other duties upon request. I learned an array of information regarding copying and printing materials; out-sourcing to vendors and overall, the products and services provided by the company.  Management was great.  Really enjoyed the open-door policy and anytime I had an issue or concern, I can count on management and my co-workers to help trouble-shoot and think outside the box to come to a sound resolution.  The hardest part about the job was assisting other facilities with their workload because you would have to access their production schedules and be familiar with what their facility offered as all facilities do not offer the same products and services.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people- management and colleague.  They were friendly, energetic and took their jobs seriously. Just overall, about their business and having fun doing it."
good,"On a typical work day,we have a 5 minute pre-clock in time before clocking in. As soon as I clock in I immediately head to the sales floor and approach customers to see if they need assistance in location, information, or time it takes to get printing jobs completed. Each day we learn to work with customers as well as one another.  Management is always there for us when needed, and we are there for them as well.  My co-workers are easy to get along with, as are the customers we work for.  There is no hard part of the job there, and the most enjoyable part of the job, is meeting new faces."
good,Phenomenal training! Great people to work with! Beautiful office location and great work life balances.
good,"Typical day is helping customers. Doing planograms . Problem solving."
good,The day is ussually busy. I work in the Copy and Print Department. Most my customers will come when I am working because they like the way I helo them. 
good,"Overall, Office Depot is your relatively standard retail job.  Your day will be simple and easy, provided you don't get a customer who doesn't know how to properly treat other human beings, or doesn't know what they're doing.  Management at my store was always quite good, which made things better.  Your job is pretty safe as long as you're somewhat competent.  My only real criticism is the company doesn't seem to know what they want.  You can either have highly skilled employees and pay them well, or you can have a lot of replaceable employees paid dirt cheap.  You can't expect highly skilled employees who will multitask, and then pay them minimum wage.  Expecting minimum wage associates to push tech sales and work on computers is just naive."
good,"I've worked here for over seven years and throughout that time, a lot of things have changed without even me noticing it."
good,Didn't really like the fact that when store closed the company didn't make a good enough effort to relocate associates
good,Fortune 500 company what more to say. Family oriented company not a company that doesn't hire relatives.
good,A great place to work that has provided me with essential skills I can directly apply to my career going forward.
good,Answering phones and placing orders. Talking to friends on break. I learned how to talk to people on the phone. I had not done customer service work before. My co-workers were helpful and as training we usually sat with someone more experienced until we felt confident enough to proceed on our own. The hardest part was dealing with irate customers. They weren't an everyday thing but it required patience and understanding. The most enjoyable part of the job was the added bonus we received sometimes just because.
good,Non-stop work at a warehouse and I enjoyed that. It made the time past very quickly. I also enjoyed the overtime there because it was late night flowing into the end of my shift.
good,Office Depot is a wonderful company to work for. My only complaint was not enough hours. Management was great. All of the managers really care about their associates. It was pretty much an easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of the customers and the satisfaction of a job well done.
good,its a nice place to work at if u like hands on and dealing with people all the time.. the employees are great i love copy cente
good,"good job where you learn a good amount of skills. typical day consists of helping customers, stocking the shelves, and making sure the store is clean before you go home."
good,Typical Retail store nothing much to say but you do get commision so selling services.
good,"Responds to a variety of problem reported inputs including, phone, email, system generated messages, batch schedules"
good,The work is very easy. The worst part is pushing the extended protection program. Depending on the manager you end up under it could get ugly.
good,"En mis días laborales llego a la tienda, reviso mis pendientes asigno tareas a mis empleados. he aprendido a trabajar en equipo. Por parte de la gerencia no veo mucho apoyo para con los empleados. Cabe mencionar que no todos son así. La parte mas difícil seria el trato con los clientes que son un poco difíciles, pero e aprendido a tratar con ellos. Por lo que hoy en día eso lo manejo fácilmente. Y lo que mas me gusta es cuando me reconocen el trabajo que hago y cuando los clientes salen satisfechos."
good,"The office depot university is terrific. They have a great training and mentoring program. If you are willing to work hard, you will be rewarded."
good,A typical day of work would start at 9 AM and would end at 6PM.
good,Office Depot provides a comfortable work environment. Management is always available to help employees.
good,Great company to work for. Good opportunities to advance. Great salary. Decent support from corp.
good,"• Manage existing clientel of over 100 clients, while continually building relationships to grow the existing accounts. Generate revenue through new business through prospecting and referrals. Conduct solutions presentations to potentially obtain business."
good,Maximized company profits and efficiency by processing an average of 500 products per hour
good,46-50 hours a week normally. Two days off a week. Great management teams that you learn a lot from.
good,office depot was a great company to work for. Management is well.
good,"Empresa con grandes valores internos y con grandes proyectos en marcha, pero ajustándose a estos momentos de crisis."
good,"When I started there, the stor was under construction preparing for the soft rthen Grand Opening ot the store. Training was not difficult and mangement personnel were normaly willing to teach and show you what was needed for the day. When it came time to train for cashier, it was confusing while training and ultimately performing the job, but, after a while you catch on, if you already hadn't when you start. I was there a few months and was working there during the soft and Grand Opening. I left the company when I was hired by Internal Revenue Service Center. But overall I think left there on okay terms with the Store Owner. I rate Office Depot between 3 out of 4"
good,With the exception of back to school season closing up was fairly simple. The management was fair in most cases but did have some issues towards the end of my employment. Co-workers were mostly friendly and helpful. Good for learning about technical support and Sales.
good,I enjoy working with so many different people young and old. I meet new customer each day when I go to work. The work place does keep you busy on your feet a lot. Not much time to sit and relax. My bosses are all very strong characters to work with and they bring a lot to the table in job performance. I enjoy my job.
good,"Flexible hours, bonus incentives and good work ethic rewards."
good,I loved working here and I don't have anything to add to this review whether it is good or bad.
good,Great customers and atompshere and in the heart of business operations. Every business needs supplies and what better place than Office Depot. Knowledge about the products they sell these customer service employees know their stuff.
good,The company has a good work life balance with flexibility in scheduling when needed. Certain direct managers could use work as they are playing more a corporate game rather than doing the work needed in the store. This was an issue at the location I worked at for a short time and unfortunately that is the reason I left. Although it is resolved now and that particular person is not with the company no matter what company you work for you're always going to have some bad apples that ruin it for everyone.
good,I have enjoyed working at Office Depot. Good work environment and Great management. The growth on the other hand not so much. There are as little as room to move up the ladder. The work environment was great and the people I worked with became my family. I have Learned a lot from my team.
good,"Management is great! They are very understanding of my school and travel schedule. The workplace culture is amazing, you never have to be afraid to ask about anything!"
good,"There is a ceiling for people of color  which is bad for the company "
good,Very flexible hours and fun and motivating Crew to work around clean work environment with nice management and staff early shift hour's and decent pay
good,Tener criterio sobre las personas que tienen ganas de seguirse desarrollando
good,"I have enjoyed my time with the company and love relationships I have developed along with the team in my area of responsibility.  Try to live the 5C culture of the company:"
good,"Buenas prestaciones, el sueldo es bajo para las responsabilidades"
good,Its fast and they'er something new to do everyday. The management cares about your opinions. The workplace culture is competitive and they'er many ways to earn incentives.I don't believe that they're any hard parts of the job. The most enjoyable is meeting the customers needs and seeing them come and ask for you.
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar si eres paciente , apoyo en horarios de estudiante."
good,"Office Depot prioritizes finding or creating a complete business solution for all of its customers. We have a lot of power in the situation to do what is necessary to get the customer what they need, even if it means pushing the boundaries a bit. Most things that you need to do are organized in SOPs, but there is room for interpretation as well as a bit of ambiguity."
good,"Fun place to work but not enough hours or job advancements to make it into a career. If you need something slow-paced and just works with your schedule then this is the best place to work but for a long time job, it really depends on you."
good,"I loved working in the copy center, it was fun and face paced. The only con was having to cashier other customers while trying to assist copy center customers."
good,"I enjoyed the work environment a lot. The pay wasn't as good as I had hoped, but my co workers and management team made up for it. It was a ""close knit"" work family. Everyone had each other's support. It was goal oriented at the store I was employed with. Retail can be challenging due to customer related issues, but we all worked together to make it happen."
good,"The best part of this job was the people I worked with.  The company was a lot better before the merger, but it wasn't bad afterwards. I am sure it has settles down by now."
good,Good place to work. I liked working here. There are many good points about working at here. I was able to work mostly every other weekend. Alot of pressure to make the sales goals.
good,"It gets very busy during back to school season,  after that it slows down a little.                                    Overall it's a good environment"
good,"Office Depot/ Office Max is not a bad place to work.  I do not see a stable financial future for any Brick and Mortar.  However, the company does try to make the best of it."
good,Tuve la oportunidad de ser supervisora del área y aprendí muchas cosas pero en cuestión de salario pagan muy poco
good,"Un trabajo bien estructurado y remunerado conforme a la carga laboral, lamentablemente causa que los empleados entren en zona de confort"
good,Office Depot is not as exciting as it sounds. It is all office-related. Making the workplace enjoyable is with great management and that is what was provided during the time of my work there.
good,It's a good opportunity for a first job. You would live the experience. It's a good environment to network and advance in the company. That's all I can say at the moment.
good,Great company to work for. I would recommend Office Depot to anyone who enjoys working with customers & learning about new tech. If you value a company that truly values your ideas & opinions then Office Depot is the company to work for.
good,"The manager has always set expectations that were fair and attainable for employees. Often leading to rewards not just for an employee in question but for the entire team; leading to motivation for the whole store. "
good,"Do the job and you will make it. If you make a sale and sell the insurance to go with it you get a bonus. You will do prices changes, stocking of items, plan-o-grams. And help customers as needed."
good,"Customer"
good,Diferentes tareas dentro de un mi departamento. Algo que me encanta
good,"Work was hard worked long days but got paid overtime. Atmosphere was laid back but busy, co workers were okay boss was nice. Had rules and inventory was always good"
good,I liked woking days it's been good I've learned a lot I can work in almost all departments of the warehouse I've been there 15 years I'm ready for new opportunities
good,"I understand running a business empire is a lot of work, but it seems that corporate doesn't understand that certain things are beyond the local store's control. If they feel that we were doing poorly, perhaps they could provide the training that they think the local store needs directly while understanding that the workers are also human."
good,The job was great while I was in school. Flexible with my school schedule and my managers were fair and reasonable. It is a great part-time job and the only reason I am leaving is because I graduated and I am looking for something full-time.
good,"Great Place to work!  I got to work from my home office which was a huge plus for me.  "
good,"I had really nice managers that were nice and worked with my busy school schedule. Hours were very flexible. I felt like a job like that, the pay could have been a little better but the Job wasn't too bad."
good,"Working at Office Depot provides an excellent introduction to the sales environment. It provides the tools necessary to develop your skills as a salesperson. However, management at my store was great, but leaders of other stores visited and did not have kind remarks about me not related to my work ethic. Inappropriate."
good,"I was in Atasca office. very laid back work place and nice team. Managment support was outstanding and have worked with very kind people. The only bad thing is that you will not have any job security. They lay off employees at any time for no reason,"
good,"Really friendly environment to work, They take customer service seriously its very rare to have a customer complain and if they do its for good reason"
good,OfficeMax was a very helpful job in assisting the worker and training them on all the required fields. the culture was very friendly and not stressful at all.
good,"A company that knows what it wants to do and has a set plan to fulfill it, even if I feel it could pay its part time employees more for what it asks of them."
good,"The employees and or coworkers can make or break the job most of the time. Like any job or experience, you either like your coworkers or you don't. Same thing with the customers. They can either be sent straight from the Underworld or be all rainbows and sunshine."
good,"Los supervisores del almacén de capacitan ten enseñan el manejo del patín eléctrico, el manejo de la han hell y halcón el control de los inventarios y el acomodo de la mercancía el auditar las tarimas del embarque y en administración la captura de datos y el los archivos donde se guarda la documentación correspondiente tanto del personal como de proveedores el conteo de los inventarios y como verificar las diferencias"
good,I loved my job here. The only reason I left was my lack of ability to advance at the store that I was working in. Had I moved to another store I would have advanced.
good,It was a good job to learn new and useful skills. The hours I got were good and the management was great but I need a job I can further my life in. I have goals and need a job that can fulfill those goals
good,I enjoyed my job at OfficeMax.  There was opportunity to move between departments and up to management.   The pay was fair.  The atmosphere was usually fun and co-workers became great friends.
good,"compañerismo , junta mensual con festejo a cummpleañeros,buenas prestaciones."
good,"I unload the trucks to stock the merchandise, I do all the store fronts, I cashier, I help customers with purchases in store and online. I assist the operations manager."
good,Some days it went by really fast because you job and customers kept you busy but some days it felt like forever because there were no customers. My peers were all friendly and helpful whenever I needed a helping hand to do something or assist a customer out
good,"Flexible with schedule"
good,"Los cimientos son buenos, sin embargo no hay seguimiento para su ejecucucion."
good,"es un lugar donde te permiten sobrellevar tus actividades diarias con tu trabajo, ademas de que el compañerismos se hace notar de inmediato."
good,"I worked for Office Depot for a second job in the summer and it fulfilled that role well. The management I worked with had some issues, but the General Manager took my concerns seriously, even though I was only there for a few months. It's a good job for students, first-time employment, or a second job."
good,"At Office Depot it was very slow except for when it would get close to holidays, but other than that it was slow and I would just stock or clean or put up new price tags, it wasn't a very convenient job for me, but at the time it was my first job, not a very good first job by the way, but I learned a lot of things about technology and printing but definitely not a job for me."
good,"As far as B2B sales, it is a great gig.. easy sell, clients are relatively low-maintenance.  Lots of free samples, tons of opportunity to network and uncover new business.  Tons of autonomy"
good,"I was so grateful to be able to work at Office Max! It was such a short amount of time I had available to work, but they were so ready and willing to get me in and working! I learned a lot and owe a lot to them and their kindness!"
good,"When I started with Office Depot many years ago, most of the employee's were full-time and just a few part-time. Now, unless you were there for years, all staff on the floor is part-time, and only management is full-time."
good,It is a really fun and nice workplace and it is really nice and chill to work there. You don't work too hard and you can choose what you want to work and people will be willing to teach you how to do it.
good,Si pones todo tu empeño puedes crecer dentro de la empresa en mi caso estuve casi 16 años.
good,"Office depot is a great place to start working if you're interested in learning the in's and out's of a high paced selling business. I learned a lot in my time there including but not limited to: Computer IT skills, selling skills, Customer Service resolutions, and how to manage people, processes and behaviors. A typical day at work consisted of many different things everyday including; stocking shelves, setting planograms, diagnosing/fixing customers computer issues, print services, front end/counter, to helping associates learn and grow with the business. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to not only assist and help the customers with their needs and finding them a total solution but also helping the associates learn and grow to be better sales people. The management at Office Depot in Fort Oglethorpe was as good as it gets."
good,"I'll get the worst part of the job out of the way. You teach yourself and other employees will steal your sales. You get a little bit of money for selling square trades. I didn't know that at first and was selling monitors, laptops, printers, and everything else you can imagine and other employees would take them to the cash register and sell them on the protection plan and take my sale. Even my general manager did this to me. The people are great the only benefit while at work is free bottled water and a recognition reward program. I have 6 of 11 in this past month and did not receive it nor was I there when they choose. I feel it's fixed. Honestly I love the place and my assistant managers I've never had such great managers. Just some things I've employees did were immoral and greedy. Still it was one of my favorite jobs i've had in a long time."
good,The company is nice and the management is willing to work with your schedule and will always have open hours if you want to work.  The employee benefits are nice ans getting commission for on subscription sign ups are nice.
good,"You check in, greet customers and assist them throughout the day. "
good,"Working at Office Depot has been a good learning experience. It's a great place to begin in the working world, as a stepping stone for greater things."
good,"I work with a phenomenal team of high-spirited people who enjoy themselves while working hard. There is always work to be done and you rarely ever get bored, often having a lot of opportunities to work together with other departments."
good,"The hours are good and flexible, and the pay is pretty decent for the type of job, but some of the workplace culture is not particularly supportive. Interpersonal conflict makes its way into a lot of employee interactions, and this diminishes the happiness that can come with a good job."
good,I enjoyed working there. The staff was great. Everyone got along. Not a lot of stress. I would work there again. I have worked there twice. It was one of my first job. And not much had change but staff. But it was still a great place to work.  Hardest time working there is back to school and black Friday. Everything else was just a Pretty good day there.
good,Out of four managers only two were kind and able to work equally with all employees. A typical day was cashing out at the counter with customers and helping them find items throughout the store.
good,"Co-workers and 95% of the managers are great to work with. No typical days. They change daily along with job responsibilities. Learned to be more creative and engage with all sales teams. Enjoyed all the vendor fairs and tech events that were ongoing also the lunch n learns provided by vendors."
good,management here is open to hearing new ideas. they work close with you and care about on and off the clock . they are understanding of your everyday life and are willing to help you in most ways
good,"Nice people, good vibe and good work conditions."
good,I worked as a Technical advisor in an OfficeMax store. It was a good work environment. The down side was that they always pushed you to up-sell in order to meet weekly goals. Not much foot traffic.
good,"While I was there I was a Business Machines specialist, Lead Stocker, Furniture Lead, Front End Supervisor, Receiving associate, and Cashier. It was a job that keeps you moving"
good,I worked in customer service on the phone then became assistant manager of office supplies section of the store. Then I worked in shipping and receiving until leaving Office Depot to move to Texas
good,"I absolutely loved my manager. He was caring, and very supportive. I loved knowing that I could come into work, and work with him, and he automatically knew we were going to have a great day. He made sure I got what I needed every time."
good,"Debo admitir que lo poco o mucho que eh aprendido respecto a ventas y como saber manejar personas, es gracias a esta empresa, también se podría hacer énfasis en la vida personal y laboral, ya que en diversas coacciones la misma empresa sin pedirlo, pero, de alguna forma hace que estés días enteros en tienda."
good,"this was a good outfit to work at and staff was very good training at new things."
good,"While at Officemax received challenging projects, however, supported by management that understood limitations in systems and processes and always pushed and encouraged process improvement.  This allowed for a positive work culture overall.  I was able to build and cultivate long standing relationships with co-workers and vendors."
good,Management was good and easy to get along with. Easily flexible with your available work hours. Customers can get rude and in your face and often feel above you given the area.
good,"days vary which was good, as each day provides different challenges. Was involved in different tasks such as picking and packing orders in the warehouse, and also delivering orders to clients."
good,I follow up any pending issues from the day before. Worked on customer and sales reps quote requests. Would source items with vendors and provided quote.
good,"I saw a significant change in culture during my time at OD, initially it was very employee focused and values were highly ethical but as the business grew it became more target & profit driven, which affected morale and shifted culture. Still an excellent employer with good processes in place and opportunities for progression."
good,This job can be slow going but there is always something to do. I usually spend the day checking people out at the register and answering the phone. When closing I also re-shelf any returned items as well as make sure everything is in its proper place.
good,Great place to work.  A very engaging culture as the company embarks on a major  transformation from office products to office products and technology services.
good,They are very good with teaching and reminding you how to do tasks if you are uncertain. There will always be someone to help if you need it. They will encourage you to take on new tasks and get more experience. I have no complaints with this company.
good,I was a am. I usually closed the store down that I was in. I worked at three different store over my time there. My day would consist of coming in checking the store to see what type of shape it was in from the day. Making sure all the freight was out. Then meeting with my staff to see who was working with me. Giving assignments to each one for the projects we were working on for the day. Along with who was going to do what for recovery. While helping the consumer the whole time. Checking the registers to make sure they were not to full. Starting recovery getting that done. Close the draws down and closing the store.
good,"Worked in the Copy and Print department. Each day had a new challenge. For the most part we worked as a team. Was always quick to help customers, enjoyed my time employed."
good,"Good place to work if you need a flexible schedule. Management would always work with you on it and make sure your school or other important matters outside work were accounted for. Minimal pay, and sometimes more hours were required due to that reason but overall good place to work."
good,"It is a very challenging fast pace work environment.  You have to interact with various department in order to perform your duties, this allows exposure to various facet of the company.  "
good,"Good customer satisfaction of knowing, and being able to get items that are for your office needs from funiture to copy supplies and copy/fax machines."
good,Everyone is very welcoming and its easy to get the work done. Managers are understanding if you have to take a day. Will work with you to work the hours you want.
good,i enjoyed the traing that i received . There is alot of traveling when in oustsales. I loved meeting the new potential clients.I also liked setting up show events for the company with various  venders.
good,This place was a great stepping stone to learn and enhance customer service skills.  They have any levels of training available allowing a motivated individual to thrive.
good,"Muy buena, buen ambiente, companerismo, y buen sueldo"
good,"Generally Office Depot/Office Max was a decent company, from my experience they tended to change their marketing and look often enough. They really focused on trying create a kind of an ideal associate, but at times, this got in the way of things. Management differs from location to location."
good,"Es muy exigente en la puntualidad, el ambiente es muy tranquilo y la paga es buena"
good,"The management is really well rounded, the people are kind to work with, everyone does a little bit of everything. I learned more then what I was hired for and move positions."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new procedures that actually pertained to my field.
good,"The work is hectic but people work hard for a common goal.  Some of the executives are out of touch with their subordinates, but the company is making a positive change to a more inclusive culture."
good,"The store was only just opened a few days before I went to work there. There were some growing pains, but the managers were experienced and I think did well. However, I wasn't there for very long before I found a much better paying job."
good,exelente ambiente laboral muy buena atencion con el cliente buenos horarios y permisos
good,"I was a part of a four member team.  We always met our team goals at a 100% every month.  I had the ability to work with some major companies for example Social Security , Ford Dealerships, Major Academic Universities"
good,The job was easy.  A lot of work keeping up with customer needs and service failures.  I would recommend the company to anyone who applies.  Overall they have good people.
good,"Very customer orientated. The manager did a great job at having a strong communication with its employees. Enjoyed working there, shame I had to relocate."
good,When I walked into work I was always welcomed by co workers that were there.  A very friendly welcoming environment that was very supportive.  We worked hard but also played hard.  Very tight niche group where friends were made.
good,es un buen lugar de trabajo te enseñan muchas cosas y te ayudan a ser responsable.
good,Nice and relaxed place to work. can get a bit stressful at times but what job isn't. great starting pay and friendly co-workers. the hours are early in the morning.

good,Desarrollo laboral en diferentes areas administrativas y ventas
good,Good place to work. Management was exceptional. There was always something to do and kept us very busy. They worked with my school schedule as well and made it very easy for me to balance both
good,If you are looking for a good part-time job Officemax is a great choice. When I worked at Officemax they offered full-time positions but I do not think they do anymore. The year and a half that I spent  working at Officemax was amazing because I learned more about business than I ever did in a classroom. The managers were all great and always recognized their employees hard work and accomplishments.
good,I got hired at Office Max at the age of 17 and it was a rocky start. They didn't give up on me and I learned how to work in a retail environment. The skills I learned during my time at Office Max have been implemented in almost every job I've ever had.
good,"Office Max Stores have all closed due to being bought by office depot. The environment was mostly relaxed, yet in a professional manor. Many items to keep track of."
good,Learned a lot in the IT/HR world of a large organization.  Met a lot of great people and learned from many a great leaders.  Enjoyed my employment very much.
good,"I had fun working here at a part-time job during a summer. managers were friendly and I was able to have a good time while working here. While this is true, I would not make it into a career."
good,great working environment very high volume of work i love the attitude of the company and the growth they set out to have for each associates that walk through the door
good,"There is going to be many times you work here and something is not told to another manager and creates an issue, they like to text you and forget to tell the other managers that they made contact with you."
good,"Trabajo operativo administrativo diario en base a programas establecidos con tiempos determinados, atencion y servicio directo en sucursal y entrega de mercancia a domicilio."
good,The ideal workplace environment at Office Depot on a regular basis is engaging and competitive in a very friendly manner. Its a place where associates can have fun but also have a high level of professionalism when it comes to rush periods of the day.
good,"Pretty good, once you know what to do everything is pretty easy.  I like my coworkers and most of the managers and it's never too stressful.  It is more like a minimum wage type thing unless you become a manager which all my managers took them a couple of years at least."
good,"Un día en office es ayudar a los cajeros a cobrar, realizar arqueos a las cajas, llevar mercancía resguardada bajo llave para realizar cobros, firmas en devolución de mercancías exhibición de mercancía vendida, supervisión en retiros y depósitos a bóveda de valores, realizar el cierre de tienda junto a gerencia. A lo largo aprendía a realizar toma de inventarios manejo del sistema as400, manejar equipos de fotocopiado estar Al día para llegadas de auditoría "
good,"Very convenient and straight forward. Tasks are simple, but engaging and are always changing depending on what it needed. Work environment stays fresh and staff is very friendly."
good,"Loaded and unloaded containers. Sorted, labeled, and stacked orders. Easy work pace for a warehouse job. Hardest part of the job was being consistent with accuracy while maintaining productivity."
good,"I was younger and most of the work was physical, building sets, taking in good from truck and setting them onto the sales floor. Worked with a good team. Learned how to get a lot of work done fast and how to follow plans for sets."
good,management was super awesome. wish i could that manager with me everywhere i go. the work itself was slow and repetitive but not all that bad. i would recommend.
good,"fun workplace, made life long friends. Management was not nice, my location got around 6 different managers within a year and a half. no security, door got shot at."
good,"Not bad as far as retail goes. Days are fast paced and multitasking is a must, shifts fly by because you're busy from the time you walk in the door until you leave. Love my management team but the employees hired are usually high school or college kids so turnover is high and the ""ownership"" mentality is lacking in most employees."
good,"At Office Depot, I had my corner for copy and print. I usually worked by myself, which really had me moving around quickly. management loved me, and knew they could rely on me with any issues if needed. the hardest part of the job was trying to make it through the slow days, where customers were almost nowhere to be found and the day felt to drag on. and the most enjoyable part was the reactions the customers had to my work, as well as the free time i got and used to practice photoshop."
good,"Mi área era la de servicio al cliente en la cual mi función principal era el cobro de mercancía con diversos métodos de pago, realizar facturas, entregar garantías, checar cambios de precios, checar descuentos realizar arqueos a cajas y llevar papeleo correspondiente a cada actividad."
good,"From the pre-shift huddle to the end of the shift, everyone is on the same page and helps without complaints."
good,it was a great job great people to work with and the management was far and jobs you did was not hard very it was a very great environment the work in
good,"A Lot of times you are the only one holding a department trying to make sure the orders are done on time within the respective time that was given to the client.  The best part about this job is you learn how to create posters, stamps, business cards etc. You still get to be creative but not as much as you'd like to. Worst part about the job is when none of the orders that were taken in are not done or was done completely wrong. Once your shift starts and you have no clue why or when the order was taken in and they complain about how poorly you've done even if it's not your fault."
good,The place was very nice and so were the employees. The customers tended to be a little rude sometimes. They never really gave me the hours I wanted and toward the end I had to leave because they wouldn't work with my school schedule. The management was okay but some of them did;t do their job and relied on the cashiers too much. The hardest part of the job was trying to check people out and handle the floor at the same time. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,Ahí mucho favoritismo y sobre todo tardas mucho en acender
good,"Office Depot Inc. (NYSE: ODP) is a supplier of office products in US by Online/Stores. Office Depot, Inc. is a global supplier of office products and services. Sales are processed through multiple channels, consisting of office supply stores, a contract sales force, an outbound telephone account management sales force, internet sites, direct marketing catalogs and call centers, all supported by company’s network of supply chain facilities and delivery operations."
good,during the day steady until two hours before close. I'm usually working on computers after I file all my managerial paperwork. At the same time I'm directing customers and managing team effort to stock shelves whole making sure everyone is greeted right when they enter the store.
good,"the company overall is good, sometimes the people are what makes it or breaks it for me if it wasn't for the great coworkers I worked with I would have switched sooner looking for something more in my field of studies"
good,a typical day at work would be check the furniture sales set plannnograms downstock the store help customers clean up sellprotection plans close the drawers close the store
good,good job with good people and management. Great job when you are going to school. Only down side is hours and working weekends :) The hours were inconsistent week by week so you were unable to plan for things. Vacations were hard to take.
good,A very busy work day as the everyday business and others come inside looking for the stuff they need for their everyday needs.  I always loved learning new things involving electronics.  The management was very helpful and the workplace was a very cultural.  The hardest part of the job was difficult returns from a customer that didn't have a receipt.  The most enjoyable part was meeting many different people and learning about their company.
good,"Constantly busy, but good work/life balance. Not many learning opportunities. Casual dress code, work-from-home opportunities. Benefits are satisfactory but not extraordinary. Company outlook isn't very bright."
good,hard work but not alot of growth if you work on night shift you don't know what time you will be getting off other than that its not a bad company to work for
good,"Only a select few will end up making their way from the grunt level of work to management, this is based off the available positions and the desire to continue working there.  Some managers at stores are very good at what they do, some aren't it's luck of the draw."
good,"this is a good place to work but i haven't had  a raise in almost an entire year, i wanted to get a different position in order to advance but i couldn't because i was part time. though you are recognized at some timed."
good,"Very slow. If you're looking for something with repeatable tasks that get boring, then this its the job for you. Management is cooperative. After back-to-school season, hours are severely cut."
good,Solid Company with a desire to be a leader in the Office Supply and Service business. Merging companies created many system challenges which the fraud team was able to address and correct.
good,"Learned a lot about working at a warehouse such as using equipment like forklifts, pallet jacks, cherry pickers, hardest part of the job was when something in the system failed causing us to be there until 3 4 or 5 in the morning"
good,"The team members make every day worth it. It can either be very slow and relaxed or it can be fast paced and sometimes stressful (mainly in copy and print department). For me there were several times I felt unfairly paid because there are only two of us that can do any job, and some other employees didn’t get fully trained so they couldn’t help, so a lot of responsibility fell on me. Otherwise, it’s a great place to work. There will be good customers that make it fun, and there will be bad customers that make it hard. But that’s anywhere. Sometimes at the end of the quarter hours dropped around 10 hr a week for part time. So it was sometimes rough. Management was always great and flexible with their employees. Great place to work if you like sales or working with customers. Definitely recommend."
good,"Worked as a Remodel Manager, nights, then moved into Receiving Manager role. My store already had a Receiving Manager, but I was kept on & my job was never threatened. I was sent to other stores multiple times to help improve their work flow. I knew I was appreciated."
good,"My job was a learning experience every day. I will miss this store when it closes. The managers there was awesome! It was like a family, everyone was caring about one another."
good,Me gusta hacer bien mi trabajo y a su vez  que valoren el mismo m adapto fácil y siempre trato de ser mejor para satisfacer las necesidades de la empresa
good,My time at office depot was very enjoyable.  Our facility was the top rated facility in the country for three years straight.  We had a great culture and team.
good,"Un dia tipico es atender llamadas, realizar facturas, surtir mercancía, realizar reporte de ventas y ruta para las entregas del dia siguiente, realizar cotizaciones."
good,"Worked here for 3 years, no bad complaints. Work was fast paced at times which made the day go quick. Management was nice and understanding for the most part."
good,"It's a pretty good job especially how fast they hire you, but the recent manager had a mild issue with respecting employees that just aren't having a good day."
good,The Corp Office Depot Inside Sales Center in Austin is a great place to work.  Enjoy my direct management and colleagues. Atmosphere is excellent.  Work/Life Balance is exceptional.
good,"Office Depot is a good company. Typical day is working from home. 8am to 5pm, sometimes longer depending on an account you are working on. The hardest part is waiting on other departments to follow up. The enjoyable part is networking. The employees are very tenure. It is going through a transition period but I am confident it will do well."
good,"Typical day: fun and easy"
good,I enjoyed my time employed at Office Depot.  The perks were good and the training was top level.  Once you hit the floor the management team continued supporting and training the employees.
good,"Office Depot was a great place to work - good management, which is so rare. I regularly received feedback that allowed me to improve my skills at sales. Great work/life balance, great people."
good,Got the opportunity I was looking for at the Office Depot. Company has changed a bit over the years though.  Office Supplies in general has lost a lot of business to online competition.
good,"As a field rep, I visited customers for face to face meetings.  It was fun and rewarding.  I traveled across the state of Texas meeting people from all verticals and company sizes.  I learned every customer is different with different needs.  The hardest part for me was being away from my family."
good,"It was my first job. I worked about 8 hours every time I was scheduled. The managers were fair and were willing to work with me for my schedule. Unfortunately, I had to leave the company because of school, but it was a decent first job."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es bastante ameno y nada pesado, los compañeros son un gran apoyo y hay apoyo de parte del área de gerencia y RH, sin embargo los salarios son bajos con respecto a otras empresas del mismo giro"
good,lo bueno de trabajar en office depot es que ellos te pueden ayudar si cursas una carrera. hay mucha influencia de clientes como trabajo a presion servicio al cliente y muy buenos bonos y salario.
good,"Good place to work, however they started laying people off. I enjoyed the job. It was in a relaxed environment and management was great. I loved working here."
good,"i worked for office max for a month as a temp. the manager was a great guy really cool and understanding. the staff were generally nice people. the store i worked at was closing so i didn't get to do alot but they did try and find a position for me at another store but unfortunately could not. i really enjoyed my time there. at one point i got severely sick at work and the manager on shift went out of his way to get me a ride to go to the dr so i wouldn't drive in my condition and another co worker ended up taking me. they were even worried bout being short staffed they only cared that i made it to the dr safe."
good,Great place to start your career. Good benefits and pay. Office Depot is constantly going through change to try to survive in the retail place. You are always on the go.
good,"Pretty basic retail store... Mostly it depends on management. The Arkansas store was terrible, but the Colorado store has strong Management. Pay is ok."
good,"we were trained to be very proffessional. the hardest part of workday was dealing with angry customers. I did learn alot, mostly making customer feel that satisfying them is my goal"
good,"A typical working day at Office Depot was pretty smooth. It would always be a rush in the morning, shortly after the store opened up for the day and another around the time many people get off work between 4 and 5 o'clock. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with the customers and providing them with the best customer assistance possible, and doing it every time I was scheduled to come in."
good,"Día típico: Llegar a la tienda, checar entrada, ir a mi locker, guardar mis cosas, entrar al área de copymax, atender a los clientes, sentarme en la compu, revisar mis pendientes, hacer pendientes, hacer trabajos del día, si no hacía nada hacia limpieza del área."
good,"Typical day at work consist of standing in the front watching the door, greeting customers, and making sure they are helped and happily satisfied. I learned that when working in retail its several things you may experience. It's all about having the right attitude and altitude. Overall, management is moderate. The hardest part of the job is just remaining in one spot most of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the smiling faces of happy customers"
good,"My time at Office Depot was memorable. Everyone was very kind, and helped with teaching about procedures. The manager was FANTASTIC at what she did (being a manager)."
good,Loved working here. All the mangers were friendly and worked with you on illnesses or family emergencies. They worked with you on scheduling and gave you as much or as little hours as you needed. Also had a manager bring me a cake on my last day of work.
good,"I only worked there for a little while but the people i worked with were all very nice and there was zero drama...the pay was underwhelming....only made about $330 every two weeks which didn't work for me since i was living by myself and had a phone bill, rent, water, electric, rent and other living expenses...i worked as a logistics coordinator...it was an enjoyable job and i would definitely go back now that i have a roommate"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Office Depot. I made a lot of great friends and I hate to quit. I was promised to no longer be a cashier when another employee was hired. However, I was a better cashier than him so I was taken off of the sales floor at which I excelled and was put back on register on which I slowly went crazy. But other than that, I have had an amazing time there and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a job."
good,"I enjoy customer service jobs. This job can be demanding, but it is mostly relaxed. The management at this store is much better than the management at many stores I have worked at. The only part I dislike is the lack of hours available for employees. The company needs to fix this."
good,"Though the company doesn't do as well as when I worked there, I loved working here. I learned so much and had fun everyday. I was always taking on new projects and felt needed and wanted almost everyday there. At the time I was there, they had plenty of educational and advancement opportunities. My managers were kind and fair and I enjoyed the company of all my co-workers."
good,"If they start planning proactively instead of being reactive then it would be able to gain its job security back. However, overall I would recommend this company to friends and family since they are trying to get it together with a new CEO."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me working the cash register, putting back any items the customer did not want or had returned, for closing, restocking the ink and refreshment  and cleaning the bathroom, for closing."
good,Office Max was a great starting job in customer service. Coworkers were nice and knowledgeable and managers were helpful. Working in the print department really stretched my knowledge base of graphic design and printing.
good,When your schedule shifts due to home life or even college needs management is always willing to shift things for you. My life revolved around the needs of my family and school and my managers were very helpful. we became a close knit family
good,I enjoy working at Office Depot.  I've met a lot of nice people in the 16 years I have been here.  It's sad to see the company close but I have enjoyed my job and learning new things.
good,"It is mostly a comfortable place to work. Most associates get along well and management works very hard to help you and the store succeed. Most associates are in their late teens and early 20's. Being an older, more mature worker, I don't feel that I need to use the same greeting for every customer to convince them to buy the product. Every customer is different and every situation is different. The final concern I have about the job, it the schedule is very sporadic and you never know from one week to next what your schedule is going to be. They start you out at minimum wage and each year you get a raise of 10 to 15 cents an hour."
good,It was a good experience in customer service. Found it interesting to work in technology and I enjoyed helping people with problems with computers and cell phones.
good,"Overall a great place to work, the management is good although it could use some work, great co-workers. Job can be stressful at times due to the high turn around time and expectations."
good,"Good place to work but I think that they need to spend more time training their employees on floorsets and on shipment because there were a lot of ti,es where we needed more direction"
good,"I started this job when I was in high school and it was my first retail job. It taught me a lot about customer service, how to sell and persuade customers, and how to work with others. It was a good first job because I gained a lot of experience."
good,"Office Max was so amazing to work for. Unfortunate the  pay rate wasn't good. It didn't matter to me. Because I look at the job and my customers.  All of them mostly leave happy from the store. I was training to become a supervisor at the print center, but the store closed down. "
good,"My day at work begins early in the morning. We start with putting up stock. Once the shelves are restocked, we clean up and organize the sales floor. The store opens and we warmly greet our customers. I assist as needed any department. Some times I run copies. Next I'm ringing transactions. After that I'll be putting a luxury office chair together. A few moments later I loading a desk into a customer's vehicle. When I come back in, it's time to special order an item for a valued customer. You must be very flexible in my job. There is never a dull day and always a challenge !"
good,"Organisatie met veel veranderingen."
good,Es una empresa plana donde hay bajas probabilidades para ascender de cargo
good,"Empresa lider, gran ambiente de trabajo. pero un poco inhumanos en el aspecto de brindar oportunidades para continuar creciendo"
good,Retail job with room for growth. Great start for customer service skills. Flexible hours allowed with understanding from management
good,I really enjoyed working at Viking Office Depot. I learned everything related to the role of general operator. Managers are capable and qualified to do their job.
good,"The typical workday of a Designer, Media Production in the Retail Learning and Development team was different every week. Some weeks it would be full of meeting to discuss new training material. Other weeks I was sitting in the editing bay, shooting on a green screen or visiting a store. The workplace culture was intriguing everyone is passionate about what their role is wether it was analytics, or management. Overall a good experience, job security and advancement got a one star rating only because I was laid off due to restructuring. Other than that great company to work for."
good,I think this job is the best fit because I like helping people and learning new things  I fill this  position is going be a great start for me again and I have doubt that I can get the job done
good,"Office Depot was an easy going customer service job.  Most of the customers know what they wanted, they just needed help finding the particular item."
good,"Loved designing remodels and new 20,000+ square foot stores for OfficeMax and smaller stores for Grand and Toy in Canada. Learned alot about the Canadian culture of office supply stores and was an important part of the design process for the new prototype. Worked with a great bunch of people. Made lifetime friends."
good,"Good benefits with health, dental, vision, 401K etc..  Managers are helpful and respectful..   Large workload.  Good compensation.  Located in Boca of Military trail."
good,"Conducted the demand planning, ordering, tracking, and allocation to stores of 1/2 the non furniture/electric items.  this was fast pace and changing daily.  Learned a lot about forecasting systems"
good,"The store management team worked very well together and partnering was a daily necessity to achieve maximum productivity.  While resolving customer issues was a majority of my job, hiring and developing talent was also an important part.  Working with others and solving problems were the most rewarding components of the position.  As with any job, there was a lot to learn, and new skills were developed as a result of this."
good,When Office Depot was in Heath it was nice to work there. All employees got along well. Management was easy to get along with. The schedule was flexible. No job task was difficult.
good,"wonderful people great environment and great company to work for ,great pay and good hours and good breaks and wonderful chances to advance up in company."
good,Te ofrece muchos beneficios el sueldo es muy competitivo. Si bien como muchos empleos por temporadas la carga de trabajo si es excesiva. El único aspecto que deja mucho que deseas es el apoyo recibido por parte del Gerente Distrital y Recursos Humanos que nunca te apoyo y te preguntas entonces para que están si nunca pueden intervenir?
good,"Its a great job if you like to say on your feet. Great people, love to have fun but down to business when it comes to sealing. A lot of great people come in the store."
good,"It's a good company to work for downside is it's only 20 hours a week, or fortunately it's not an app to make a living on so you have to work two jobs. However management is nice and understanding the workers are friendly and helpful, no gossip no drama"
good,Fun and engaging work place where learning new skills was encouraged. Engaging with customers never felt like a chore or hassle. Teamwork was encouraged and celebrated when someone did a great job.
good,Working for the company was a great experience.  I was able to learn more then I ever thought I would and the people you get to know are more then colleagues they become your friends.
good,"Trabajar en esta empresa se requiere de mucho trabajo en equipo, suelo tener buena comunicación con los que me rodean, ya no pude continuar trabajando con ellos por mis horarios escolares."
good,"Typical day at work , make sure to be on time make sure you are at the register checking customers out , hardest part of my job wouldbe when there are small rushes and we are understaffed . Most ewnjoyable part of my job would be knowing im the most cashier at my job."
good,"aprendizaje rapido"
good,"My experience with the Covington branch has been very educational. This has been my first job and for the mist part enjoyable. There, however, has been no store manager there for quite some time. Just recently a manager was hired, and with his arrival, available hours have been cut drastically. I have only been able to get scheduled for four hours, and there is talk about another twenty being cut from the payroll. But other than the cut backs, the store has been a great place to work. The people there are reasonably kind about learning mistakes and are fun to work with."
good,"My day always included a 15 minute scrum team meeting usually early in the morning. The meeting detailed my previous days activities, my planned activities for that day, and any issues that might block my progress. Then I would begin my tasks for that day, working with the team to make sure that my task results fit the requirements for the project. Whenever I completed the task I was working on I would then go to the project backlog and select the next highest priority unassigned task, assign it to myself and then begin to work on the task."
good,Good company to work for over the past 15 years. I have learned so much from everyone I have worked with. I have built such wonderful relationships with some of my customers.
good,Amazing place to work if you're looking for consistence and stability. Management is not good. If injured they don't take care of you.
good,"Work was totally acceptable and the hours were good, they worked with you to find a good balance between off/on time. But after about a year there, it just became a numbers game with the corporate offices. Unreasonable expectations when it came to selling items, and plans, and addons. If you want to sell and just become a number in their game, then definitely work here."
good,"Belle entreprise avec une culture d'entreprise remarquable. "
good,Some of the managers are not helpful and do not listen to associates . Hardest part of the job is trying to express your problem of the task to the managers. Most enjoyable part of the job are the associates and being able to sell goods.
good,"It was a fun place to work, it was like family. You were able to work in different areas, so your days were always different."
good,"I would usually walk and get right to work, customers were always a pleasure to work with. The managers always made it a duty to work with the associate."
good,Una buena empresa con buenas prestaciones y ambiente laboral. Pude aprender a socializar mejor con los clientes y dar un mejor servicio. La gerencia muy accesible y al pendiente de nuestras labores en la tienda.
good,"Managers are nice and so are fellow employees.If you do your job correctly and efficiently, it's a basic clock in and do my part before I go home kind of job."
good,"The store was often not busy allowing for very personal customer interaction. All members of the team are motivated and efficient. Here I learned many skills such as task oriented time management, team leadership and motivation, and effective selling behaviors. The most difficult part of this job was moving very heavy furniture from the back of the store, and loading it in cars which could on occasion be too small. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping a customer get exactly what they needed and becoming a trusted adviser to them each time they returned."
good,"A typical day at Office Depot Office Max is busy but full of fun at the same time. The management team is great but has some weaknesses."
good,"Strong retail company, was advanced rather quickly. They do show appreciation as long as numbers are good. If numbers are wavering, upper level managers  put a huge amount of pressure on store managers rather then teaching and looking on the why of performance. Had 3 different district managers 2 of whom taught"
good,"Enjoyable place to work. Love the coworkers. Room for advancement isn't available, as I was told when hired. Im looking for employment with room for advancement and 40 hrs a week."
good,Office Depot is a great company with very smart and energetic leadership. The company is heading in a good directions and has a plan to take it into the future.
good,It was a good place to work. I learned a great deal in booklet and book production. Management was helpful. Coworkers were also very pleasant so that fostered a great  work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was in the production of books. There was nothing really hard about the job
good,Office Depot has a changing retail model that can be successful long term. My position has been transformed from a manger in waiting to a regional troubleshooter. It has been an exciting challenge but I wish it was a little more stable.
good,A typical day at Office Depot was pretty great. The customers were always nice people. I was always wanted and part of tasks on helping our company grow. The co-workers were all great people to me. Hardest part of the job was when a computer would always fight against me when I serviced it! Overall I was happy.
good,Delivering for Hopaco was fun since I got to meet the customers first hand. The difficult part was the time frames where demanding. Some days you would not be able to complete them and would stack up for the next day. The supervisors and fellow drivers was great to work with. They understood the difficulty and would not mind to come out to assist you with your load or vise versa.
good,"They do have nice compensation for it being a retail store, but I feel like they try to push you to compete too hard and I feel like they spread their employees too thin."
good,"Une journée type commence par de la prospection physique ou téléphone, de la visite client pour prise de commande, formation sur notre site de commande en ligne, gérer les litiges (retour, avoir, comptabilité etc) c'est aussi l'atteinte de mes objectifs, de mes challenges. J'aime le contact clients et les challenges. Une très bonne entente avec mon responsable est très importante et je fais tout pour que cela se passe au mieux. J'aime l'esprit d'équipe et n'hésite pas à faire profiter mes collègues de mes expériences."
good,"Being my first gig, Office Depot was at times difficult and stressful, but having caring/understanding people allowed me to overcome some difficult first steps and gain experience to further my career."
good,j'ai apprécier de travaillez pour office dépôt une très bonne société
good,This job taught me the most about Supply Chain/Distribution and 3PL locations. Constantly on the move seeing other facilities was very informative.
good,Good retail job. Get to learn a lot and plenty of chances to do so. I felt as though the pay could most definitely be better. Lots of moving around and plenty to do. Put up with a lot and especially with customers. Pay should match.
good,"Office Depot Business Solutions Division was a great place work. They allow an individual to be your own boss. I furthered my knowledge of sales while hitting goals and company objectives. I had a successful track record as a Territory Development Manager and as an Account Manager. My day to day activities would include cold calling, building my pipeline and selling all the variety of solutions Office Depot had to offer."
good,"Office Depot's talent acquisition department is filled with fantastic employees,  Management went through some changes while I was there and caused a bit of concern for the future.  Otherwise, it was a good place to work.  One strong disappointment was the lack of funding provided to talent acquisition, especially regarding job boards, LinkedIn recruiter, and their lacking of an ATS."
good,Ambiente laboral tranquilo y buena comunicación entre los compañeros
good,I had a great time working there. Ran the print center within 2 years of working there. There was a high turnover of employees so it was hard to get to know anyone you were working with. Just about anyone would get hired. Good or bad.
good,"Al llegar se siente un buen ambiente de trabajo, durante la realización de trabajo se siente el apoyo de los jefes del personal y compañeros mismos en apoyarte en algo que necesites"
good,"Cool place to work. The more you put in the more you get out. There is a sales pressure here to sell insurance plans on technology and if you have ever been offered it then you know most people really don't care for it. But if you have the talent management will see it and love it, if not effort is all that's needed."
good,Loved working there would work there after I graduate however due to complications at school there were conflicting schedules.
good,"Pro's: Management at the store is great. The other associates are great people and between the managers and associates it has  become a family. You learn how to sell and how to learn with difficult customers."
good,"I came to Office Max at a time when they had very few employees. I was overworked. The district manager was very lazy and pushed her employees way too hard and did not hesitate to dole out harsh words. The store manager however was extraordinary. He kept track of everything and everything. While the district manager sat in the office and ordered the employees around, the store manager was out on the floor helping customers."
good,Office Depot was my favorite place to work. The coworkers were friendly and managers were always working hard. The majority of costumers are usually the elderly and they are some times tough to deal with.
good,el unico probelma es que mientras mas aprendes mas te explotan.
good,DSC Logistics where it all started for me in management.  This role was very challenging managing distribution operations with a 3 PL for Phillip Morris.  To this day the most challenging role I have ever had but where I learned the most
good,I enjoy working at Office Depot. My Coworkers are knowledgable and we treat each other as a family. The customers which come in are usually friendly and with the excellent customer service i provide return with pleasure. the Management is respectful and assist when ever needed. A typical day is usually steady but not busy. I enjoy talking with many of the customers which come in regularly. The hardest part of my job is keeping organized with some of the employees which work in my department. Communication is key and not every employee has the same enthusiasm as i do.
good,"Office Depot was a good real first job for me. I learned many things that have helped me on other jobs, and continue to improve on other aspects of how I approach my job now as well as customers."
good,"Working for Office Depot was a great time in my life! During a typical day you had a variety of customers and situations. There is always something to do so not much low time. The management must be carefully chosen because every manager was great to work with! I had great co-workers that helped make working fun and have turned into great friends! The hardest part of the job was having those difficult customers, but that's in any customer service job out there. I enjoyed the job so much and would recommend it for a great entry level job."
good,"Buena empresa con un solido esquema de prioridades."
good,OfficeMax was a good company to work for because I learned so much in the time I spent there.A typical day at work included everything from unloading freight assembling furniture to working in the CopyMax printing department where customers had their business cards printed.Everyone worked together as a team.
good,"Rude customer tried to be rude with me and i explained him what was the situation is and he got able to understand and left from the place. We can learn how to deal with operating systems, hardware repairs, troubleshooting and fixing computers, customer service and many other things. Good management, good co-workers who are so helpful. The hardest part of the job would be nothing unless if you don't like the job. And you can enjoy working at the office depot because of less work but productive which can increase our knowledge."
good,Very competitive because it was mainly sales in the beginning before I got into management. Co workers were fun and my hardest part of the job was cold calling.
good,I learned effective customer service methods and skills while working at Office Depot/ OfficeMax. Management was always extremely helpful and professional. Management did an excellent job helping me grow and develop as a person as well as improve my interpersonal communication and customer service skills. This company also provided me with a variety of opportunities to move up in the company throughout my time there. The best part about this job was having the opportunity to work with the public and assist people with their projects.
good,"With any job in sales the effectiveness of the store depends on the staff of each location. Most stores in Kalamazoo have awesome managers, compassionate and helpful in the training and development of their employees. Corporate is revamping training techniques since the merger of office max and office depot to reduce the fluctuations from store to store.  "
good,"Love the culture in the office, very laid back and friendly. Management are very accommodating when it comes to attending to personal matters and you have to work from home."
good,As my first job this was an awesome place to be. It was a place where growth was promoted and if your a sales person Office Max is a great place to get a start. The staff is friendly and always has a team spirit.
good,"Office Depot is a great job to build your professionalism. Great loaction, great staff and a great way to learn new things."
good,I didn't mind working here. I got along with pretty much everyone I got to work with including management. Overall it was a good experience.
good,"Enjoyed working with my fellow employees and helping customers find  the products that fit their needs.Also, enjoyed organizing all products in the Store, and help assist my fellow employees to get the job done with safety in mind."
good,One of the best jobs I ever had. Started working with the company in 2010 in bayamon puerto rico and really like how the team worked.
good,"My days usually consisted of taking inventory, unloading trucks and organizing merchandise, stocking shelves, and making sure the store had an overall neat appearance.  The management was very accommodating in terms of scheduling.  However, we were often understaffed, which made things difficult at times."
good,"I enjoyed working at Office Max until it liquidated and closed here in Bullhead City."
good,"I really enjoyed my days working with the people at Office Depot. Management was nice and co-workers were fun. The job kept me busy and up beat. I loved stocking shelves, helping customers with their items. We were even given bonuses for selling protection plans on electronic items such as computers and TV's. They honored their workers with employee's of the month bulletin and snacks in the morning for when we came into work. We earned over time when volunteering for inventory day. Management was very kind to us and I miss working here."
good,I think the job was pretty good  and the manager was effective at letting us know what we need to do and how to be the most effective at our job in some situation
good,"Office Depot has a strong commitment to customer satisfaction. Every customer that walks through those doors is supposed to be greeted and offered assistance, barring unforeseen circumstances. This has taught me an extreme respect for the customer experience side of retail work, a lesson that I feel will follow me into whatever paths I may find myself."
good,"Working at Office depot was a fun experience, I got along really well with my co-workers and was pretty stress free. "
good,Office Depot is a great company that allows its workers to help customers both meet and exceed their workplace/office needs and wants.
good,"This was my first job following high school.  The starting pay was pretty good starting off.  A typical day involves helping several customers with a variety of print requests, laminations, design work, and other finishing services.  The hardest part of the job is the sheer number of customers during peak hours, often while working the department solo."
good,Office Depot/Max is a great place to work and I would recommend it.  Management and co-workers all work well together and get along.
good,"Office Depot is a great place to work for those who are going to school, or working another job. Its a simple, fun place to earn a little experience in the retail and sales industry. Management is usually understanding, and morale is always high because of the low stress environment. Pay could be higher, and there could be more opportunity, but overall if you come into it knowing that its a stepping stone type of job, you will be satisfied."
good,"Great Job Experience"
good,Overall Office Depot was a great place to work.  Management was great.  Co-workers were fun to work with.  Management always kept us motivated to sell by holding meeting to see who the top seller was and rewarding us with gift cards and other various surprises.
good,"Worked long hours as a manager"
good,"Supervised and trained all cashiers"
good,"Adquirí y aporte muchos conocimientos y experiencia durante los 23 años de carrera laboral en la empresa, viví muchos cambios y transformaciones positivas en la empresa"
good,"The best part of this job is the co-workers. The managers are smart, down to earth, and very calm. They're all willing to work with you if you're not succeeding in a certain area. OD/OM has taught me how to sell products in a way I never thought I would. They help you break out of your comfort zone. The hardest part of the job is just talking customers down. This is a place that sends out a multitude of coupons and deals all week, so there's always misinterpretations. Overall... It's a nice place to work."
good,"The environment  in office deppot is very professional."
good,"I have great co workers, and fun mangers. Everyone has a team mentality. Hours can be flexible if you have school or another job."
good,"Office Depot OfficeMax head quarters likes to treat their employees to regular celebratory onsite events, usually around holidays and major sporting events. Middle management is friendly and approachable."
good,Some co-workers of mine became more than co-workers. The customers were nice mostly and I enjoyed helping them with their daily needs and wants.
good,It's fun and its a good place to learn how to work. You learn how to work hard and how to deal with people related issues.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with a complaining or unsatisfied customer.
good,Excellent people to work with. OfficeMax management has an open door policy. What I've learned from this company is team-work goes a long way.
good,"I learned a lot on coaching and training associates on a day to day, basis. Also helping with hiring, and the most enjoyable part of the job is, knowing i impackted them to care in doing there job well."
good,"As a department manager, i was responsible for weekly reports, hiring, firing, and other staffing functions.  I was also responsible for making sure all equipment was fully functional and all supplies were on hand,"
good,"A typical day is steady for the most part. This job has taught me that helping a customer to your most potential leaves them knowing that you care about their experience. I also learned how customer's like to be treated and how they like to be approached, so that has helped me with my customer service skills. The Management is all very knowledgable at what they do and most of the time are a pleasure to work with. My co-workers are all pretty pleasant for the most part. The hardest part of the job is honestly dealing with an unpleasant customer. The most enjoyable part is when a customer has an issue and you help them, even if it takes a while. When they see that you're  putting in extra effort and solve the issue for them, for the most part I can sense that they appreciate it. When they're really satisfied I tell them to take our survey and then we both benefit from it."
good,"I Like the coworkers at this location some were helpful ,team players when u needed help ."
good,"Office Depot was a good company to work for.  Merged with Office Max which caused Office Depot policy out the window.  Store closures abundant across the country caused a lot of stress in the way we were used to doing business.  Even with these closures, employees continued to be very professional even though we were selected to close.  Typical day included going in processing inventory (receiving trucks, sorting inventory, getting inventory to sales floor; a process that took place every other day).  Everyone I worked with was pleasant to work for/with.  Hardest part as a manager was dealing with employee personal issues (babysitting coverage to spousal restraining orders).  Released after I became how much fellow employees depend on you as manager.  Dealing with customer issues was the hardest part of the job.  Especially issues concerning difficult customers.  Challenging yes, but part of the job I liked.  If you can make a person happy with an issue you can control, all the better.  Drawback to Retail job was the irradic hours and lack of schedule normalcy.  Ones schedule changed from week to week (employee or manager).  a person had to be very precise when schedule plans outside of work.  I am single so no problem, very flexible schedule.  If you were a parent (80% of our workforce) it was a nightmare.  Luckily, when I became the Operations Manager my schedule normalized.  My day would start around 6am or 5am."
good,I love working here because my co-workers are great but I don't receive enough hours. It is a fairly simple job and everyday is smooth. The managers are really nice and as titled I just can't work with the hours because of monthly expenses. I wouldn't say there is a hard part of my job because all the jobs I am assigned are reasonable and I enjoy doing them.
good,"office depot, is a very calm and very good company, we could help customers with them inquiries,, about all products offers"
good,Overall this is a fine company to work for.  I found my managers and VP's open and honest.
good,"Good music and nice clothes very entergetic employees, I learned alot about peoples fashion ,my co workers were very nice.The hardest part was picking up behind people but it was worth it and worked out wonderful, the most enjoyable part is enteracting with customers"
good,"co workers are great"
good,"I have enjoyed my years of working for office depot. The company has changed over the years. There are not many opportunities for advancement right now with the company. But I will say that the work environment is awesome. Some of my coworkers, I've worked with for many years. Overall, Office Depot is a great company to work for, the work environment is one that you would enjoy, and they value customer service significantly."
good,I like where I work. I just need to relocate. What is funny is we even have basketball  hoops in the office which we always enjoy after hours of coding. All-in-all I loved working here.
good,"good company values"
good,I enjoyed my job majority of the time as long as you follow task at hand you would be fine.
good,A great place to work where innovation and passion were key. Many opportunities to learn and get involved in key projects.
good,"atender al cliente y llenar estantes, aprendi funciones de oficina, me lleve muy bien con los gerentes y empleados."
good,Get to meet a lot of people on a regular basis and help them with their business needs. I learned a lot!
good,I was a good place for me to start because i was in school still.
good,"Typical day of work would include happy customers, mad customers and customers that just wanted to be left alone. I learned out to read peoples moods and help them accordingly. The management staff is pretty awesome I love working for them I'm just looking for something with a little more hours. Co-workers have come and gone, there have been good ones and bad ones but the crew that has been there the entire time I have is an awesome one, I love working with them. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers that want to blame you for whatever they can find to blame you for. The most enjoyable part of the day is always that one customer who has nothing but great things to say about how you helped them."
good,work was pretty simple working the sales floor taking care of customers needs upselling of products keeping products in order in neat on shelves I learned the importance of great  customer service also did cash handling to and from customers as a cashier. as far as my coworkers go they where fantastic
good,"The management was great, and the work was great. Co workers did their job and helped others. The most enjoyable part of the job was the management, customers, and associates."
good,Siempre el gerente nos pregunta si compramos tacos de barbacoa antes de la apertura
good,"Here's the deal: it's a retail job. If you enjoy retail, this is one of the best companies I've ever worked for. If you don't enjoy retail, you won't like Office Depot either."
good,"Fun, friendly work environment. Managers work well with schedule. "
good,Typical supply store with more emphasis on technology and copy and print services being the bread and butter of the store. The great thing to learn is sales techniques and how to not harass customers who may at times just want a peaceful shopping experience. Management in this store is no different than any other chain that stresses on additional baskets for technology purchased in store. Co-workers are usually happy unless work has been backed up due to late shipments and otherwise run a tight ship to provide ease of access to items on the sales floor. The hardest part is cleaning up after customers rummaging the shelves after big sales or events. The most enjoyable part in my personal experience is receiving gratitude for good consultation.
good,"Good Management"
good,Great Learning experience with great people who care. Very open environement.
good,"Get to work,review my invoices for the day and load my truck according to address.Make my deliveries ,then go home in a timely manner to enjoy my hobbies."
good,"Despite the fact that the pay is minimum and the hours are never that great, my managers and co-workers are amazing. I like my job doing computer technical support at Office Depot, but my co-workers and managers make it a place I enjoy spending time at. I have never had a job where everyone is such an outstanding person."
good,"easy to get promoted thru out the store,great learning experianvce"
good,A great place to work if you enjoy a fast pace working envirnment. With good benefits and an open door policy
good,customer service for orders for officemax delivery and answered questions about products
good,it is a great place to work if you have another job to support your self!
good,Fun place to work at and great team-work!   Was unfortunate that this was just a temp position :(
good,Set up store; help other departments set planograms; perform scheduled inventories; submit daily sales and financial reports.
good,"As with any multinational chain, there often felt like a large disconnect between the corporate office that told us what to do and the ""real world"", but on the whole it wasn't too bad. Most of the people I worked with were good to work with and knew what they were doing. Management tended to work with rather than rule their employees. Most of the customers were great to work with as well, it was just the occasional crazy that could make your entire day miserable seemingly without even trying."
good,"Na groep-intake gesprek de hele week dezelfde taak uitvoeren."
good,"Office Depot was a decent place to work at. I had no problems with the management there. The GM and AMs were really nice, helpful, and competitive. I worked my butt off to exceed quotas and sold more product protection plans and extended warranties than anybody else and even gave the managers a run for their money. We got competitive. I had to quit because I was getting shin splints and I've had two back surgeries and it became taxing on my back. It was minimum wage and took several years to advance. I wanted to advance, but my back wouldn't hold out on me."
good,"Customer Service are the must important !! Weston is unique city and customers are awesome."
good,"Supervise the front end, assist customers with online orders, process returns and exchanges. Management is great at OD, co workers are friendly and ease to get along with. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with coworkers and assisting customers"
good,"Come to work, catch up on what had taken place prior to my arrival, and begin the days work as customers arrived.  When nothing was happening, my co-workers and I had to Zone (straighten up every thing  on the shelves. Everyone working there tried to help everyone else whenever possible.  I enjoyed working with all of the customers and learned quickly how to handle demanding customers."
good,"Process furniture project quotes, orders. Follow up with vendor, installation co., customer. Coordination of installation. Process credits, returns on damaged or incorrect product. Ensure project gets invoiced in a timely manner. Control of records, reports, files on all projects. Learned in and outs of furniture purchasing. Good management support. Co-workers always willing to lend a hand. Hardest part was ensuring a project went smoothly from beginning to end. Enjoy customer interaction and customer appreciation of a seamless project from start to finish."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Office Depot, the main reason for this started with their excellent managers!  They made it enjoyable to come to work and always seemed appreciative, understanding, and genuinely interested in how you are doing both at work as well as in life. There were many employee incentive programs and customers could turn in Bravo cards for employees who demonstrated good customer service.  The co-workers were all so different in age, yet similar in personability and helpfulness.  This is definately a position I keep fondly stored in my memory bank, and may consider returning to."
good,"Great customer service, great standards, great company. Great development."
good,Great place to work and great staff.  Great shifts.  I run a department as a supervisor.
good,My typical day at Office Depot consisted of me coming in early in the morning and stocking the sales floor for the day. Then around noon we would change into our sales associate attire and walk around the sales floor to assist the customers with anything they need. I enjoyed the atmosphere the most at Office Depot. I disliked how early I had to start my shift everyday. 
good,"Myself along with each teammate or person I have interacted with while employed at Office Depot as showed immense integrity and accountability. I have had the privledge to learn from some great leaders and mentors which has made this the most enjoyable part of belonging to the company. Of course like any job/ career there are some challanges but with the help from a great team and also keeping my focus on the solution and not the problem, there was never a problem that went unsolved. As you will see in my resume, my responsibilites with the company ranged and were quite diverse so a typical day was most likely finishing up another successful project or beginning a new one ! "
good,"every day busy,I learned about merchandising which was amazing.  The management team were excellent, co-workers were helpful and didn't mind you helping them. the job its self was not hard but different and i enjoyed every part of the job."
good,"entrada 8 am. apoyo en la revision de mercacio en top. elaborasion de reporte de facturas a revision y pago. apoyo en piso de ventas. "
good,"good selection of products, knowledgeable people to help out and enough associates to ring on registers if it got backed up. "
good,"love learning new things, dealing with the computers and things that is out of my position. Free minded at learning. "
good,"un dia tipico es abordar jente ofreserle el producto osea la tarjeta los "
good,"Good place to work. Offers good benefits, the location is great and the facilities are amazing."
good,Unloaded trucks and loaded trucks. PIcked orders. Helped with inventory control.
good,"My time at Office Depot was a mostly positive experience. The store was very efficiently and effectively managed as well as the goals and store asking was always handled perfectly. I was not very challenged, as they zoned you and trained you in one specific area in which there was little to no room for advancement."
good,"My main focus at work is building lasting relationships with my customers. I do this by creating a memorable experience for each one of them. There are some operational tasks, such as floor sets/planograms, freight logistics, interviewing/hiring/training new associates, developing current associates, schedule planning and writing, cash management, and recovery each day as well. I strive to be a top performer and am very motivated to push my team for results. The hardest part of my job is having to commute. I would love to be closer to my home. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with every day. I do enjoy being the manager and being responsible for the entire store. I hold myself accountable to each of the goals in my store."
good,"Office Depot is a dynamic environment to work in. They provide plentiful training for new in demand products and services that are being released. They focus on the customer, which is a benefit to the profitability of the store but can also be a detriment to operational strategies if staffing issues occur."
good,This company is good to work for and are very flexible to suit the working mum.
good,I enjoyed my time here and was able to work inside the store and help generate sells as well as my normal function of making deliveries.
good,This is a great job for college students and people who live close in the area. This is a great part time job.
good,I enjoyed the different challenges daily that were presented.
good,"Management was great at the locale after it changed hands. I did learn a few great sales concepts as well as some tech training. Almost all of my coworkers were great friendly people. the hardest part of the job, has to be utilizing ARC-3 and staying on the radio."
good,Nice place to work. Always something going to keep employees motivated!
good,A typical day at work would be organizing the previous days deliveries to clear the receiving floor. Once accepted the items will be checked towards the receiving log for errors. Items then will be separated between departments and the overstock will be locked away.
good,"I am in retail because I love taking care of customers and I am good at it. Technology Sales Manager for Office Depot, but feel more like a part owner than just an operator of my department. I have a partial responsible for P&L driven annual sales of 8-10 million in a 32k sq ft store. My number #1 priority is Customer Service, as a Sales Manager I spend a great deal of my time on a daily basis on the sales floor taking care of customers and associates alike. I greet customers as they enter the store and say thanks to them as they leave. I assist in training of all new associates and managers. I train associates to perform as a team, and spend alot of time cross training for multiple positions within the store. I help train and develop assistant and department managers through the delegation and follow up process until they are prepared for the next level. The store is maintained by the team using training, coaching, counseling, follow up, feedback, etc. I am responsible for assisting my store manager to ensure all tasks are completed through the delegation process in a timely manner to include; merchandising, planograms, stocking, scheduling, inventory control, and cleaning. I also assist the store manager in aspects of safety, loss prevention, management recruiting, and the overall well being of our associates."
good,A typical day would consist of incoming freight distribution throughout the store. I would try to have a manager teach me something new such as taking care of destroyed inventory. There was only one really good manager which was the store manager because he led by example and was a conscientious worker. The other managers weren't consistent and were weak at the manager position from delegating tasks to taking care of the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job would be either two circumstances. One would be the feeling of success or achievement when a goal was reached or I finished a task. The second would be achieving satisfaction from a customer from finding an item or teaching.
good,"The company as a whole has done great things to its model, improving associates skills, and customer experience. All around I give it 4.5 Stars. The company has trained me to be a leader, as well as a passionate person. That it's not just about sales but how those sales are made, integrity."
good,"I was a warehouse production manager at the Distribution Center in Signal Hill, CA. It was a great job even though there was pressure to get the orders filled accurately as quickly as possible. It was also a great team environment with over 130 associates working in support of each other to accomplish the daily goals. There was a clear understanding of what was expected by senior management, and constant feedback of how we were doing. It was impressive to see how a business with a high volume could implement major operational changes improving their business metrics on short notice. They understood their business well."
good,"Technology representative, in charge of all technology. I have the ability to flex, I learned my way around the store and can do just about every department."
good,"i enjoyed working there the only problem was that was not my field of study, and i did not want to continue working some job i want a career. And some of the managers did not act professional when speaking to customers and employees they wouold use slang and deragatory words."
good,I absolutely loved this job . I was a picker and you use a voice automated rp scanner named jennifer and you had to address it as so she told you where to be to go and what to pick. a piece of cake if you ask me
good,A typical day started with making sure that the shelves were filled. The system we used told us which items were low or almost out. Throughout the day as customers came in we would be sure that they received excellent assistance and were able to find what they were looking for.
good,They taught you how to be a better retail seller. It will always there for you. If it was something personal they will make it work for you for your schedule. This very happy people to be around.
good,It was a great time working at Office Depot. I just needed more set hours  i would recommend working here especially if you are just starting to get a job for the first time.
good,"Supportive management, was given opportunities to expand knowledge base, encouraged to build connections with customer base, needs more full-time positions"
good,A typical day consists of going in at 6 am stocking helping customers selling technology and ringing people up at the cash register and making sure the store is clean and presentable
good,I worked mostly logistics receiving and floor inventory management. Working planograms was probably what I liked most about the job. I took pride in floor presentation.
good,Office Depot is a big company with long experience on the market. Good environment and automatized systems.
good,"My manager was great. A lot of times in retail, you'll here horror stories about terrible managers but this was certainly not the case. My manager was a great man who always tried to encourage his employees and always had their back in any conflict. Additionally the rest of the team at Office Depot was a pleasure to work with."
good,I learn to multitask around multiple departments making sure all goals are met. learned to handle orders to make sure inventory is stocked. also learned a lot about printer and computer upkeep
good,great place to work for the people are fun and the job was rewarding. company always made sure you were taken care of. great pay and benefits.always a great place work
good,Es un lugar muy amable con el personal y muy educados.
good,The pay is ok for the work you do and nothing about the place is to special. There is room for improvement but besides that it is an ok place to work for.
good,Customer service manager making sure every customer needs where meet. Making sure the store was in order before we close for the day to make sure the open manager was ready to open.
good,"Good place to work. Co workers were very nice and helpful with training me. The customers were farily nice at the location I work at. Overall, good place build job resume"
good,Great job with good managers and a great training program. I enjoyed the time I worked here. Very focused on the needs of their employees. Definitely felt like a team effort
good,"I loved all the managers and my coworkers at office depot. The work was very easy if you have at least an ounce of motivation, but honestly, the pay is not very good. It is the PERFECT place to work if you're a college student living with your parents or in a dorm, but if you need enough money to pay rent, then this probably isn't the best place to work unless you have another job on the side. I highly reccomend working here if you need experience."
good,Liked working there towards the ends of the 3 years they were asking for alot of add on sales with ink subscriptions computer repairs square trade add ons.
good,"Es un lugar excelente para laborar, los compañeros nos llevamos muy bien y los gerentes son personas flexibles y buen rollo, los horarios no están tan mal, comparado con los horarios de otros empleos hoy en día."
good,I really enjoyed working at Office Depot. It actually my fault for still not being there. Everyone working together as a team to get the customer service and store A Plus. I haven't had any complaints with management. They always will to work with you as alone as you doing what you are supposed to.
good,"Indeed is a fantastic employer to work for. The company culture is awesome, the office is incredible and the people are so welcoming from the first day."
good,I loved working here...I learned a lot and the people were great to work with.  Management was very down-to-earth and had no problem pitching in when needed
good,"I enjoyed my managers, customers, and coworkers . I learned a lot working here. I enjoyed helping configure computers for customers. My managers taught me a lot."
good,"Es una empresa que te ayuda a crecer, sino tienes experiencia te ayudan y te dan ánimo para aprender, rápido aprendi y me asignaron una caja de inmediato, el trato del personal es excelente al igual que el de la administración."
good,"chequeo de entrada puntual, presentarse con jefe inmediato y realizar tareas."
good,"The management in the store is great. The corporate management is completely removed from the reality of the stores. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers. The hardest part is "
good,I worked here for nearly 9 years started as a cashier and worked my way into management. It was a great stepping stone that allowed me to start a professional career without a degree. The experience was invaluable. I thought the pay was great at the time but now I realize It is minimal compared to an Office environment. Also the hours were every changing and taxing as retail tends to be.
good,"A very fun place to work if you enjoy time hands-on with customers. Most customers are unaware with what product they need most, so an ability to pitch and sell helps tremendously."
good,Great manager and fun to work at. The training was very helpful in teaching me the essentials needed to make sales. It boosted my career and added to my resume.
good,A typical day would be to check the jobs of what is done and what needed to be done within the print area. Help out customers at the counter and call over people who are cross-trained for print. Print orders were handled by at least three people and managers would help out when they could.
good,The hardest part about the job is the inability to assist all of the customers that walk through the front door. Retail is busy and sometimes I couldn't help everyone out.
good,"I do like working at Office Depot a lot, however, I get paid less than I did at my previous job. The people I work with are laid back and fun to work with. The customers that I get are a little slow when it comes to common tech knowledge and I hate explaining it constantly."
good,"Worked there 17 years.  Excellent company, tight ship, employee valued, but bad decisions to close down private fleet in Oregon. Paid holidays 2 weeks pto to start off with. Max pto was 186 hours per year."
good,Great work experience. Great management and overall culture. Employees are fairly compensated and there were plenty of hours to disperse among the staff.
good,The Austin sales center has standard inside sales / account management positions.  The number one priority is to grow the business.  Culture and work life balance is also a focus along with being a fun and competitive environment that pays for performance.
good,Love my job at Office Depot. Great Place to work for. Work a flexible schedule and have loved my job for over 14 years. Continually grow every day with new challenges and growth.
good,"A typical day at work is simple, it is just packing and shipping. I learned how to opperate a forklift and I also learned how to pick products and pack them at the warehouse."
good,"this is a nice place to work in general . It favors basic customer service skills , to management to their tech people . Nice place to excel in . I like it"
good,"Management was always willing to work with me and went above and beyond when I had family pass away. Days were either so busy they went by in the blink of an eye, or so slow that you could actually get to know your co-workers, customers, and managers. Some days were more stressful than others, but the flexible schedules, pay, and fulltime benefits made up for it. If you don't like retail hours, this might not be the job for you."
good,Sometimes I felt overworked but overall really cool place. to work for. Customers often had trouble or complaints and the management team provided with a fine example on how to deal with them and make them leave happy.
good,"Trabajo muy activo y estimulante, se puede subir de puesto y se reconoce el esfuerzo."
good,I looked forward to going to work every day because of my fun coworkers. I learned how to make stamps in the copy and print department and managment was on top of everything.
good,"For retail, it’s an easy going place to work. No high pressure sales. "
good,This was a great first job for me. I learned so much in the office industry and customer service. I helped fix and repair printers and moved up the ladder.
good,"A typical day of work could be very relaxed or extremely busy depending on the time of day. Management is pretty flexible and understanding depending on the situation, an overall good work culture with friendly associates. The hardest part of the job is dealing with multiple things going on at once, having to a various list of different things to do at different times is somewhat hard to do depending on what needs to be done first. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting cool customers and helping them with their problems/projects."
good,I liked working here the job is not difficult just fast paced but time goes by fast cause you are always doing something. The only down side i would say is that you have a start time but you leave when the works is done so you could have a 10 hour day or a 6 hour day it all depends on the work load.
good,This job requires heavy lifting ability and the ability to multitask well. As well as multitasking it is important that you are able to be flexible while working.
good,Retail can be challenging and fun. Office Depot has great employees and offered a great chance to advance my career.  While everyday we were focused on sales goals we were able to have some fun.
good,"Office Depot has helped me grow into one of the top sales people in the company, with numbers consistently in the top 10%.  Good oppurtunity for internal growth, and an open door policy when there are any indiscretions."
good,"Todos son amables, hay respeto, todos te aconsejan"
good,"My experience with the company was one that taught you new things. From computers, to fieling paper work, loading and unloading trucks, preparing the things to be ship by u. p. s. airborne, fed ex. And fright. You would also have to check in every thing that came in individually. Then you would make the pricing labels."
good,Very busy place. Lots of calls. Learn how to satisfy customer that are very mad. Fun people to work with always made my day goes fast. Learn how to coach.
good,As a Major Account Manager I worked with large and medium sized local companies as a liaison and support person.  My responsibilities were making sure the customer was happy and to grow their business by presenting various solutions available.  Performed quarterly business reviews and was lead on projects.  I learned about the office supplies industry and working with customers manage their needs.  My boss was supportive when needed but the culture there is focused on reps. independently using their skills to drive results.  The hardest part of the job was project coordination to get all resources lined up to provide a  solution the customer would find of value.  The part I liked most about this job was my relationship with my customers and being considered a valuable resource and trusted advisor.
good,Empresa con buenas prestaciones y alto de nivel de cultura organizacional.
good,"Normal Cashier, helper in print section, online ordering. I had fun the whole time I worked there, the only reason I quit because I felt like I was not getting paid enough."
good,"My work included reconciling the days cycle counts, root causing errors.  Providing support to the management staff.  Participate in several LEAN teams.  My work required a high degree of time management."
good,"Es una empresa con grandes estándares de calidad, le da a sus trabajadores todas las herramientas necesarias para que realicen su trabajo siempre dándoles incentivos y motivando e su activo mas importante que son su personal"
good,"Do office Depoit regional was a very challenging and involved posi tion requiring knowledge  of various print process and the finishing aspects as well. Time management, customer service, shipping ,inter-departmental relations, and project management  skills were of essence in this position."
good,"Pretty average retail experience. Employees are great to work with and help you through each shift. Managers are friendly and supportive especially when assisting a ""Karen"" of a customer."
good,"The people are nice, it is not too hard of a job, usually kind of relaxed but gets busy during the afternoon. Management is pretty good, although sometimes they can stress you out. All in all, great place to work"
good,"Overall it was a good experience. Started of as a cashier and then went to every department they had helping threw out the day, learned a lot in the time I was there. Would of stayed if the pay was better"
good,"They should upgrade the employee benefits. If the employees are happy, they will enjoy coming to work. The managements will work with your schedule. The stores are smaller."
good,"Great place to work, low pay, but very great place to work, very flexible with your schedule, I just had to leave for better pay! But i highly recommend this place"
good,"Great place to learn and a great team from management to fellow co workers. Management treated employees with respect no matter of ethnicity, religion, sexuality, etc."
good,"It is a decent company but it could use some more common sense. The senior management is fixated on improving individual productivity so they stress on the floor supervisors on this issue. This focus causes lack of team work because every one is only focused on improving their scanning productivity. The management does not realize that a good team is more than the sum of its parts. If people were allowed to help other team members, it would increase overall productivity and help process merchandise faster, but the top tier management does not have common sense to see that. There is high attrition rate in the receiving department due to this."
good,"I feel the location I am at I got lucky great staff and great location, I just wish I got a few more hours and was able to get full time.  and the pay is lower than I would like."
good,"Some of the best leaders/staff I've worked with, ready with praise when earned and reprimands when necessary. Great work environment and a lot of variety in warehouse positions."
good,"Receiving and delivering office supplies via our drivers or couriers. Organizing the merchandise thoroughly using pallets and shelves according to the system entry."
good,"This was a customer service job. I enjoyed working with office depot because I loved to work out problems. When customers called in with discrepancies, it was my job to figure them out and correct them. Management was great and working there was pleasant. The hardest part of the job was when there were no resolutions and I couldn't satisfy the customers with their orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer recognized that I tried my best."
good,The manager at my location does everything he can to build up his team as if they were his own. Working in the print department is great and fun work if you are smart enough and can manage time well enough to get in a good work flow. Overall Grady job but could stand to pay better for the amount of mental work and stress from the job.
good,"Fue buena lamentablemente yo quería ser supervisor pero no se dio la oportunidad me ofrecieron otro trabajo donde me daban la posibilidad de ganar mas, tuve que aceptar la oferta."
good,"Office Depot does offer a great environment for one to feel comfortable and succeed at any level if they choose."
good,"I learned quite a bit in the, almost, one year i worked there. From electronics to paper and pencils, to anything school or work related that you would need to get the job done."
good,"I was initially hired as a part time employee.  Within 6 months, I was promoted to department manager, and 3 years later, I was asked to help open a new store as the Operations Manager."
good,"From working at officemax I learned that helping someone is better than a sale, because a happy person is more likely to come back and shop. I also enjoyed my time on the sales floor, setting people up for their office needs whether it is a large office or a new business feels satisfying."
good,"It is a good starter job. The managers are great and so are the other employees. It is a relaxing job, not too much demand. Easy going, nice customers."
good,"Buen clima laboral, buenas prestaciones en general buena empresa."
good,"filing, printing, copying, complete invoice for the next shift in the morning, i work the evening shifts, and it was a slow pace job and email invoice to manager"
good,Help customers find what they need and make sure you bring good customer service. Hardworking team who strives to achieve their goals for the day and excellent management.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Office Depot and have worked there, on and off, for approximately 20 years.  While on the job, I learned job tools like DreamWeaver, Flash and Captivate. I was also given the opportunity to be the editor of different internal newsletters, interviewing different VPs and the CEO.  I found that they promoted me again and again.  The only negative is that about half of the workers at corporate are contractors - so no benefits and often low pay per hour.  I've experienced both - being a well-paid F/T employee and being a poorly compensated contractor."
good,Very educational. Equal opportunity work place. Fair and good pay. Honest and helping staff. Very understanding and answered all training questions well.
good,typical day of work would be fast paced with demanding customers. I learned how to give great customer service to any customer. management is very demanding but they always help out.
good,"Would of loved to stay on but company merged with Office Depot and they closed the Naperville, IL corporate HQ. The people were great and management was solid."
good,Did not want to relocate to Florida post OfficeMax/Office Depot merger. Management has a solid plan and give solid direction. The people are awesome and the culture is as well.
good,"During the slow season, work isn't too bad and can sometimes be a slow and easy day, but once summer hits and back to school season starts, the days get long and the work gets hard. Its not for the feint of heart. (This applies to the Fremont location I worked in doing outbound)"
good,"ambiente tranquillo e formativo, colleghi collaborativi"
good,"I worked there for five years. I worked in the copy center which made the job interesting. I loved doing most of the projects with the machines. We were busy all the time but it made the day go by faster. Eventually you build a loyal customer base. You also get to know the vendors as well as the technicians that come in to work on the copiers. "
good,"a typical day is pretty mundane, nothing really to do because there isn't a lot of traffic in the stores these days. Management was nice and so were co-workers."
good,I enjoyed assisting businesses w/their orders as well as individuals placing order. There were problems/issues that has to be handled and I would do it with a smile. I issued credits and did what was necessary to resolve issues.
good,"Good job to start and gain experience. "
good,"This company expand my learning ability and growth. Each day I was assist with a job coach and together we were an asset to Office Max. "
good,"The culture at Office Depot OfficeMax was mainly focused on customer service."
good,"Very good for a carrer start up.The schedule is flexible and you have a balance between work/life."
good,the company in general is very organized and very customer service oriented. a daily shift consisted of stocking the shelves and running the new shipment
good,"cashier, worked with customers with their supplies like, business cards/ stationary and envelopes, posters, files, printing, scanning, etc.  It takes a lot to run a business. The management worked a long side of us as we needed them to. it had a peaceful atmosphere. "
good,I worked here while I was in college. I learned a lot about people management and inventory management while working here. I'd recommend this as a great first job.
good,"learned how to delegate and follow up to ensure the job was done."
good,"Office Depot isn't a terrible place to work, Flexible scheduling, half way decent healthcare, fairly casual dress code. The dress code is jeans and a red polo. You're suppose to wear black socks and black shoes, but almost no one cared about that when I worked there. Don't expect your district manager to talk to you, know your name, or even know what area you work in, because they don't care about anyone except the store manager. I use to see my DM come in all the time, and I don't actually think he ever could be bothered to know who I was, even though I was one of the managers in a high performing store. Best part of the job is always the people you work with, not the people you work FOR. Corporate doesn't care about the people. They push loyalty sign ups, but don't offer any real incentives to draw people in. Buildings are literally falling apart and corporate doesn't want to pay to fix them. They'd rather allow customers to get hurt because insulation is falling, than deal with the problems. Registers don't work properly and rather than invest in new technology, corporate would rather just keep doing ""software updates"" that make the problem worse. Corporate is more interested in starting stupid contests, than paying their employees better and improving working conditions."
good,I enjoyed learning new technological skills. My management team was phenomenal and made the tough days of being a retail worker so much better by continued encouragement and providing a fun work environment.
good,It was a good place to work huge management and ASM turnover I liked it better when the district manager told me to run it like my own business.  Lots of returning customers from my never say no attitude.
good,"all and all a very nice place to work, they care about your safety and value as an employee, typical day get orders out to stores, constantly learning new ways to improve, bounce ideas around for efficiency, Management is overall pretty good, culture is diverse, staying focused on numbers consistantly, co-workers care and are willing to chip in and help if you need it"
good,"the company is changing its direction, going from customer centered to money centered. It is all about a bottom line dollar and squeezing every out every penny"
good,"I worked as a floor sales and service representative. I helped maintain the products on the floor, shipping and receiving, customer service, and stock."
good,"You're constantly driven to do several tasks, but none of them are back breaking. It's just basic retail with decent pay and a great job to get while in high school."
good,"receptionist"
good,My work experience was overall good and good experience. The people I work with made it enjoyable while at work.  The at time could be fast paced depending on time of year.
good,me dejo muchas enseñanzas el trabajar en el área de copymax
good,"El ambiente es muy bueno, generalmente trabajan personas jóvenes y dinámicas, es muy entretenido, lo único malo es que estas todo el día de pie."
good,"Very productive work place, people and co-workers are extremely friendly . I honestly enjoyed my time there. I expanded my people skills and picked up a lot of knowledge along the way. I enjoy going to work and helping people. Seeing pther people smile makes me smile."
good,"Since I worked for Office Depot/Office Max when they were competitors, they are two different companies.  Office Depot was a way better company.  I advanced from part time stocker to full time customer service manager.  At Office Max, I started as a full time stocker to a store manager in 5 years."
good,"When I was hired into OfficeMax print department I felt very welcomed and they appreciated my skills as a graphic designer."
good,Enjoyed my store immensely - good relationship between managers and staff. Run like a neighborhood store. Left just after the Office Depot/Office Max merger - so no information on how that affected employee relations.
good,Management is really good and is very flexible with people going to school would really recommend it if your a college student looking for part time job
good,I was the lead cashier. I worked the return and exchange desk. I had to take care of customer on phone and in person.  I had to lead the other employees.
good,"This job was fufilling, just very stressful. There was very little staffing so many times I felt like the customers had to wait too long to be helped. I will definitely say that management seemed to jump right in and help behind the counter whenever possible. I did receive benefits which was an incentive, but I had to leave due to family issues and health problems. I did enjoy the job and was sad to leave."
good,"For the price the customer is paying, the products are a bit expensive. The employees are great, but recently quality was low. Overall it helped build my experience in work and I recommend for entry level."
good,"unload truck in the morning, sort product, reload into delivery trucks. Attend meeting in morning, load scanner. Inspect vehicle and set out on route to deliveries. return to warehouse complete drivers log and unload truck and clean,"
good,Me paresce una buena empresa para trabajar lo malo es que todo te cobran las instalaciones no están muy bien que digamos
good,EXcelente empresa bastante comprometida con sus empleadores y por tener un clima laboral excelente
good,"OfficeMax had a positive collaborative culture where all worked towards a common goal. Once merged with Office Depot, things changed 180 degrees. Culture was one of finding people to blame first, rather than focus on improving problems. This created a risk averse atmosphere."
good,Office Max was a good part time job.  It was a good environment and the people were friendly.  The print associate job was challenging at times but most often very rewarding.  Previous management was very willing to work with you regarding schedules and gave the opportunity for advancement whenever possible.
good,Precionan demasiado a las personas y no tienen una buena comunicación los supervisores con los ayudantes
good,There is a lot to learn from Office Depot. It is great to network with business professionals that are coming in to pick up office supplies. Office Depot also provides information and training to help you have a growing mindset. The hardest part of the job is continuous training new employees and motivation training to young employees.
good,Very competitive and fast pace place to work. My skills were regularly challenged and most of the time it was fun. I learned what I was really capable of while working here..
good,"Great company to work for, especially when it was Boise.  It was focus on it's mission.  Had good management.  Allowed a person to succeeded and make a as much money as the compensation plan allowed."
good,"During the start of the school year it is really busy, but then dies down as the semesters end. You help customers and try to sell office depot office max services."
good,"I've worked at Office Depot for a year and a half and my experience has been good so far. I've learned however, that one's experience depends on which department you work in. I work in the Copy and PRrint department, which can get very busy and a little overwhelming a decent amount of the time. But I have enjoyed the experience. I've gotten the opportunity to fine tune and learn various computer skills that are definitely transferable to jobs elsewhere."
good,"Typical retail work, needed for college. No reall comment except that its normal retail work. Don't know what else to say. Its retail work. Only a clerk for a year."
good,"Was working for Office Depot before the merger with Office Max.  Fair place to work, and very fun, but still required better marketing and advertising for the north east."
good,"Had great managers and co-workers. We got all the job done on time and made it fun.Learned alot from the job and about the business. Made our numbers every month, competing with others to see who sell the most during the week."
good,First job and everyone was very helpful at training. Worked with my school schedule and room to advance in the company. Training modules help with customer service and knowledge about job skills.
good,Office Depot was a great place to work however the PMO has change over the years and became a decline as they hire new managers. The environment is very friendly amongst colleague
good,"It was a great place to work with friendly coworkers. There was room for promotions and never really a time where there wasn't something to do. Overall, two thumbs up."
good,"It was a great job to start in, really helped me learn the basica of customer service as well as got to meet really great people. YOu really advance in jobs at the store, but no real room for advancement unless you are already trained or have managerial classes."
good,A typical work day consisted of managing employees while balancing out providing excellent customer service to the public.
good,"While my time at Office Depot has been short, the work environment has mostly been a pleasant experience. The company's focus on metrics, while a bit difficult in the location I am in, is not unreasonable to accomplish. It has beneficial in teaching new skills to better my operations in computer services and product knowledge."
good,"Dealing with technology issues and the general public can be a challenge at Office Depot. You have to be able to identify customer's problems with their devices, and be able to be knowledgeable in new and current technology for new buying customers."
good,"I am able to work with the schedule I am given, express my concerns with management, and work well with other employees. There are many changes that happen in the store through out the year but learning everything is easy and training is understandable."
good,Worked with company for 5 years. I worked with all kinds of personalities. Enjoyed every minute of it. I would defiantly recommend this place of business to someone looking for a great work environment
good,Team building experience great opportunity to work with office supply.The Taught me a lot and gave me lots of opportunities to learn new things with the company .
good,A typical day at work was usually chill although it would be fast paced. Co-workers were always friendly helping make it a good environment. The hardest part of the job was probably staying busy honestly. The most enjoyable part was likely dealing with the costumers.
good,OfficeMax was a good company and I enjoyed working there.  A typical day was time spent with customers via the phone.  My fellow associates enjoyed their work as well and my manager was excellent.  The most difficult part of the job was dealing with the sales people at the stores.  I was not physically present inside the store and understanding the needs took time to learn.
good,Great environment and good co-workers to work with. Really enjoyed working there and gaining the experience. The only issue was management but manager is no longer there.
good,Typical Day open store put tills out have a team meeting in morning assigning tasks and goals for the day. When store opens help customers find product or by actually walking them to item. Making sure handle any customer complaints finding the best solution or answering any such questions. Follow up with team and goals for the day. receiving truck and inventory scans twice a week working variance reports as needed. End of day count the tills prepare deposit slips and file nightly numbers.

good,"Environment was casual and personal. All training was ongoing, and cross training was encouraged to gain more knowledge. Overall it was a good place to wrk."
good,"Work on an average day, is helping customers who want me to help them find their ink, check their PC for viruses, or have questions about printers and routers. I come into work, and give them a suggestion on what printers or computers they should buy. I get congratulations from management on my sales, and have a great relationship with them all. The hardest part of the job, is slow times and willing yourself to pull furniture at two minutes before closing. "
good,Provided a large amount of opportunity for a college age student to be able to work long hours but managers were nice and the coworkers for the most part wanted to help
good,Part-time position worked well in work life balance. Enjoyed interacting with all customers types in daily problem solving activities.  Path to management is very quick and rewarding.
good,"Working for Office Max I learned that it can get pretty busy and you have to work quickly but carefully. The management is really helpful when needed. The hardest part of the job is when the customers come in and we're all pretty busy with other customers, its hard to go back and forth assisting customers. But in the end when we are finally able to help our customers get exactly what they needed, and to see the satisfaction in their faces is so much joy."
good,"Crecimiento dentro de la empresa"
good,"Office max was a great job experience. When things went left, everyone worked as one to figure things out. Though sales was not a job I had before, the management and supervisors prepared me properly for what was to come in my work field."
good,Great for people that like a fast-paced environment. Good for quick learners and an awesome part-time job. This place is a good place to work. I would work here again
good,"Responsibilities:"
good,"This position was great for gaining a knowledge base about some technology and repairs, it was also a good place for a college student to work as they were flexible with my schedule as needed."

good,"Always had different objectives during the day and given opportunity to learn new areas of the job and free to roam around and make sure all areas were covered."
good,"The company itself has terrible management and overworks their employees. I for one was a PT Print Associate and I pulled 43 hours every week, but the environment made it worth while. I worked at a location that treated its employees like family... and thats my favorite type of work environment."
good,"A variety of tasks may be done in a single shift. Whether it be stocking shelves, organizing the store, working the cash register, or helping out customers, there is always something to do. However, if it is slow, it can be a bit underwhelming."
good,"It was a good company to work for. The benefits could have been a whole lot better. It was a laid back job, not so stressful, but really a competitive retail job market. And they did base advancement opportunities off your job performance."
good,make sure your hard working person if not don't apply I start there wrapping pallets and stacking the trucks for delivery sometimes labeling products such as printing papers etc.

good,une bonne periode  de travail beaucoup de comunication et aussi tres physiques  comme travail
good,Stressful but can be worth while if given the time. The employees and managers make the experience so much better and hours where flexible and easy to work with.
good,It was pretty good working here! Pretty relaxed environment and I enjoyed making sales! The only reason I left was because management changed for the worse and I ended up doing other peoples jobs. If you need a summer job or just a part time job I'd highly recommend working here.
good,"Exciting, productive culture in a fast-paced environment.  Gain experience of the retail world and giving exceptional customer service.  Hardest part of job is meeting stocking deadlines while attending to customers."

good,This company was all about giving back to their employees and showing appreciation. We had family picnic days and they were always options for training to improve your skills or learn new things.
good,This is a good place to work if you need somewhere to put your OCD energy on.  This place is very easy going for the most part except for back-to-school type seasons.  Pay raises are very fair and consistent.
good,The Retail Sales Associate/Sales Consultant is responsible for engaging and providing an exceptional customer service experience. The associate must quickly build ongoing customer relationships and become a trusted advisor by utilizing advanced selling skills and knowledge (including cross-selling of products and services) to meet the customer’s needs.
good,great money kinda shady management but its was contract work didnt directly work for them. overall not bad work your own hours nobody watching over your shoulder
good,"Over the time that I worked here, I found that I was supported fully with a great management team and overall a very relaxed workplace. At times, a lot of tasks had to be done, and it could be fast paced, but overall I saw that it wasn't a stressful position to be in. Although, I appreciated all the great people whom I worked with, this job isn't without its criticisms. I do feel that this workplace had poor compensation and benefits compared to similar retail environments."
good,"Typical day at work, we get there an hour early (two on sundays). Do the fill report, get the Ad out, and finish whatever truck is left. It really is your normal retail job."
good,Great place to work. Maangement is fair. very easy to learn when you have a question they help. very friendly staff. everbody is like a big family. they are very caring for each customer

good,I liked to work in Depot OfficeMax because I had a very good relationship with co-workers and it  wasn't a stressful place to work at. I liked that we had a 15 minutes meeting everyday to discuss work issues of the day before.
good,Working for a  nonprofit is a enlightening experience.  You are doing good work for the community at large and sometimes get a one on one with someone that you just click with that needs a hand up.  Our mission was to teach them to fish and that is what we did.
good,"It is a good place to work, especially as a part time job. They were flexible in their scheduling and tried to accommodate students. The managers that I had were (for the most part) fair and attempted to help employees grow and develop."
good,"Very hectic, sometimes stressful.  Technology support could be a whole lot better.  Business partners knowledgeable - make your work easier and more meaningful."
good,"During the time that I worked , I made many connections, and learned many things from the people working there. My workday would usually start off on the floor, helping customers and moving items around so that they can be sold."
good,"This was a very quiet place to work, no one really interacts with one another. A typical day was one of emailing Office depot employees and scheduling a time to migrate their Windows XP Pro system to Windows 7 Pro. Since about 25% of the people at corp are OD employees the other 75% are al contractors."
good,A typical day at work would be a customer that needs some prints done. I would helped them by telling them send it to the store email. They would be help they came in to get the prints done with us.
good,"A typical day at Office Depot as a manager would be starting with a meeting with the associates about what i want to accomplish that day. We start with going over the previous days numbers and accomplishments.Then get into how many rewards customers we are going to try to sign up per person for that day, and what we can do to reach our sales goal. We would vote on an item to try to attach to each sale that day to drive our numbers."

good,Very nice atmosphere. It is certainly a place to intern in and gain knowledge about the industry. Get familiarized with various office furniture and materials.
good,"Not a lot to say on this review, as I was part of the layoff once the transition to Depot occurred.  My position was eliminated due to relocation of services to the Depot home corporate office."
good,Simple job if you're used to working. Copy and Print Center can get stressful at times with the overwhelming amount of jobs that need to get done and with customers walking in at the same time. Customers can be bit annoying and not know what they want so you need a lot of patience.

good,The hardest part of the job was at times the demand of the customers and fulfilling big orders. The easiest part of the job was completing copy and print jobs.
good,This was a good entry level retail sales job. I learned how to educate myself on various products and also learned how to tailor a sales pitch to a customers needs.
good,layout store interior as per template and architectural constraints. Meet with construction department to go over conflicts with design specs.

good,"A typical day at office depot  is hard work until you get your brake."
good,"I started as a Cashier 6 years ago and since then have done a few different jobs. I have learned quite a lot of skills working at OfficeMax that I would not have on my own, especially working in the Printing Department. I work with a lot of different types of people in the print department, which gives me the opportunity to meet a lot of new people, find out about new businesses/types of work, events going on locally, and so on. I have learned a lot of customer service skills doing this job since all the customers are different and most are looking for something custom and different from the last person. It is very interesting. This job allows you to be creative and gives you a feeling of accomplishment after being able to help so many different customers in so many different situations."
good,"Greeting customers and taking in large printing orders, stocked shelves, provided customer service, and made sure overall appearance of the store was pleasant for customers."

good,"Enjoyed doing planograms, pulling and processing customer/company orders for delivery. Management was pretty flexible and let you do things at your own pace as long as they got done."
good,Office Max is great for someone straight of of high school. I have been out of school for five years and just now going to college. In this company there isn't really much to move up in the company unless you've already had experience in management before that position.
good,The thing I enjoy the most about this job is the my coworkers and its really a friendly workplace. The job is nothing to hard if you have experience in customer service.
good,i been working for office depot for over two years and one thing i really like about working here was how willing they were to accommodate my schedule because i was a student and was not able to work the full time shift i was in so they were able to keep me in the same shift as a part time worker
good,This place is a very good starter place for a college kid to work at or someone trying to get some job experience under their belt. They are very willing to train you up especially if you are a hard worker.
good,very relaxed and at times quick paced. very fun and and great management. i really enjoyed working here as a high school student. i got great pay and was around great co workers.
good,Lots of restocking and knowledge of the Point Of Sales system on the register. Very quiet. Its easy to get distracted at night but during the day you get pretty busy and it keeps you on your toes. You have to learn about all different types of technologies and other office supplies. I worked here for a short amount of time due to bed rest for preterm labor.
good,"- Slow paced work environment"
good,"Being the supervisor here, it's crazy the amount they want you to make and produce, but they usually have only one person in the department at all times. It's utterly stressful, and almost too much to handle at times. Plus, some of the computers and equipment are completely out of date and are in dire need of an upgrade. People in this department are underpaid and overwhelmed."
good,I enjoyed working here and the people I worked with. Great management and many new things to learn. Overall a great company to work for. Definitely a place you enjoy showing up to.
good,"El trabajo aunque era demandante era muy interesante, el servir a los clientes dejarlos satisfechos, el personal que  maneje con un  excelente actitud de servicio, tuve muchas cosas buenas y aprendí muchas otras que en lo personal me ayudaron a madurar  y en lo laboral tener muchas más herramientas para desempeñar una mejor labor día a dia"

good,Arrive early in the morning and complete all opening procedures.  Monitor the Logistics team in getting several pallets of product merchandised to the sales floor.  Evaluate all store standards and resolve any issues. Open store and continue to drive and develop a culture of delivering premiere customer service with a high performance team.  Most challenging part of being a Store Manager was keeping the our store's standards where they needed to be throughout the day with a high volume of customer traffic.  The most enjoyable part of the day was building customer loyalty by providing premier service and seeing highly satisfied customers.
good,"With all the big stores out there Walmart and Target, even some of the bulk stores such as Sams Club. Officemax can be a bit slow at times. Most of the time customers that are there are there because of the service, and the staff that are there.

good,"Though Office Depot is going through executive changes, it is still a good place to work.  We are moving in the right direction for growth, though there can always be improvements.  There is respect for employees, pay is good, but could be better.  They have recently taken away some extra benefits, but I suppose it happens when a company is trying to grow."
good,"If in school or pursuing something part time, this is a good place to be. Offers benefits for students that other companies do not offer. It's possible to work up into management and build skills in regard to management and sales."

good,Office Depot was a fun and fast paced work environment.  The work life balance was in place. When the merger happened between Office Depot and Office Max the time was stressful not knowing if you were going to keep your job or not.  When Staples wanted to buy us out - it added to that fear.  After the buyout was turned down - people wound up getting laid off anyway.

good,"Une entreprise avec une gestion du personnel simple et cadrée, ouverte à l'évolution d'un collaborateur."
good,"From a local stand-point, if you have a store with a good manager (like mine) then the team he or she will build works well together with minimal issues. This could be said for any company, though. From a corporate level; however, the well-being of  employees is rarely considered with any discernible aptitude for running a business in which people are the key element. Payroll is squeezed every quarter to a laughable extent (or would be, should most hourly employees not be living paycheck to paycheck), and the company-wide scheduling system has been fully automated and randomized to ensure we have as little schedule stability as possible."
good,"Positive environment, great culture and wonder family benefits. it is hardworking environment with plenty of team work across the company. It is a joy coming into work everyday"

good,Management works with their team members to execute issues whenever needed. Salary was fair and suitable for all positions worked at the time of employment.
good,"Good company to work for, DM was nice and supportive. Very old school sales tactics which turn customers off. Upgrade to a more tech savvy company because that's where times are going. Learned a lot in my 2 years there and would go back if need be."
good,A great place to work at but unfortunately it closed down. I learned a lot from my managers and other employees. The most enjoyable part was making planograms and merchandising.

I kept learning about my job and new opportunities keep coming up to learn more. My boss keep me on my toes but also let me take the lead so that i would be able to take over.

Restocking items and recovery of isles were also a daily routine. I learned sales and customer service techniques essential to advancing my career and running a business. The co-workers are a bit strange but for the most part positive and hard working people. Management was nice, hard working, and passionate about their job but also passionate to a fault. Management made violations of federal work law and ethics due to this passion. After a steady amount of assertion the issues were resolved however.

I was promoted to Sales Manager, then expanded into the print portion. I learned to become a great manager.  I managed a team of up to 10 people and managed a high volume print center.  Staying on top of deadlines was definitely the hardest portion of my job.  Working with an amazing and dependable team was the best part.

good,I worked for two stores and the first store I was at for over a year and I loved it. My manager was kind yet strict. He helped all of the employees learn their strong points and put them in positions where we would succeed. He would often buy the staff lunch or other treats when we performed well. The second store was a complete circus. The manger made it very clear that he didn't care who did what when and it caused nothing to get done. Unfortunately that made me leave the company.

good,"Great staff, formal employer pushed us above what was needed to make sure we were successful in our daily goals.Really busy days were very stressful in copy in print, especially during the the morning- day shift which I think would of had a better outcome if there were more staff in that area during the day, one for attending walk in and express lane customers to continue good customer service and another focusing on due printing projects and in-coming projects. But my overall experience was great, I loved all my co-workers, and the smile and appreciations glowing off a satisfied customer's face is so worth it! I think all Copy and Print associates took a lot of pride in their work and that's what made the difference."

good,"Customer Oriented. Fun work place and supportive management."
good,"I enjoy working at Officemax but it truly is a dead end. Advancement is backwards. You can be the hardest worker and not get a promotion because your not the top seller. It's all number based, and they could care less how well you lead."
good,"I was blessed to work under such a great store manager for my first year as a new manager. She was great at showing me everything i needed to know, and we become a very two man management crew. I loved working with my crew at this location, and enjoyed seeing them blossom into hard workers/salesman under my watch. Seeing them make sales and delight customers with my training and tutelage always put a smile on my face. Unfortunately the job had its drawbacks as all jobs do. The year i worked there, we went through about 5 different managers, leaving me and my boss two-manning the show. There were weeks me and her had to work seven days straight, and were left in the wind. Our boss that was supposed to be helping us out during the tough times, told us to just figure it out and went on vacation multiple times while we were working over 100 hours a week between the two of us. It was the company leadership that made me stay early on, and it was the company leadership that made me leave at the end."

I also learned how to save and scan documents into pdf and jpeg files as well as convert files. I was able to use email to save files. I also made a large quantity of copies, sent fax and shipped packages for my customer.  How ever, my job in the copy and print department was extremely stressful and hectic. The customer demand was over bearing and seriously fast paced. On a typical day of work there was only one person per shift to satisfy over 400 customer. I really was fond of all of the managers there and really felt like we were all apart of a working family."

I was welcome to transition from the call center to the advertising department as a copywriter, then advanced to senior, team lead and ultimately a supervisor of copy, graphics and coordination. I only left because I was offered a more lucrative opportunity, but I think I would have continued to have advanced had I stayed. There's no telling. They've had several RIFs since, and nothing lasts forever. But it was a tremendous foundation from which to develop my marketing career, and some of the people I worked with will remain my friends for life."

The Edmonton Centre is a great place to work and the Management Team is easy to work for - and they make it fun.  There are some company wide decisions that they have no control over but in the end the Monday to Friday position is better than most Call Centres.
good,being the last person the customer talks to before they walk out the doors is a very important job. I have to make sure we did everything we could to get them what they needed.

Loved the guys i worked with, my supervisor was awesome and so down to earth. too bad he got fired and never called me to go back to work. If i could get a job with the warehouse team again i would in a heart beat."
good,Everyone that I worked there were friendly and very helpful. They all made me feel apart of the team since day one. Everyone helps each other out as much as they can.
good,"I liked the work here. A lot of the customers were small business owners, and I liked the challenged of finding affordable solutions for them."

good,"Great place to work, very challenging and rewarding.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the associates and customers on a daily basis."
good,A typical day at work was usually somewhat busy constantly which made you always productive. I learned a lot about copying and printing working in the copy & print department and also learned more knowledge on customer service and the cash register. Management were beyond helpful and hardworking. Got along with mostly all of my coworkers and was glad to work with such good people. I wouldn't really say there was a part of the job that was the hardest but I will say the most enjoyable part was helping customers and satisfying their needs.
good,Left company to further experience in a different retail environment and further my management some were else.
good,"Review daily sales goals and recap from prior day. "
good,"It was very busy. I loved every moment of it though. I learned so many things about customers, employees, and the managers. To keep the managers happy just make sure you did what you were asked. Som co-workers were lazy but as long as I motivated them to do what they were suppose to do the day went smooth. Most of the employees would come to me first instead of the managers because I knew how to talk to them. I loved making business card because it seemed like I was helping someone get with there business or start a business. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers, but if you know how to calm a person down and make them feel right you'll have a better chance getting through to them."
good,"A typical day at work includes a diverse selection of customers as well a variety of jobs and making sure you are able to service customers quickly and with a smile.  You learn how to work with a variety of managers as each manager has different strengths and weaknesses.  Working with coworkers is always an interesting experience as each coworker works in a variety of departments and can provide a wide variety of knowledge about work and the company.  The hardest part of the job is having to leave before you finish a task because the day is done.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the look on a customer's face when you produce work that they approve of, or are able to complete a job before the estimated time."
good,"I enjoy satisfying customers with a memorable customer experience. I enjoy that my co-workers and I work as a team. I enjoy surprising my customers with perfection when it comes to creating invitations for parties, graduations, weddings, obituaries, banners, and etc. Although I am a full-time manager, payroll hours often get cut therefore, I have to use my vacation or sick time to make up for the hours I was cut."
good,Good room for growth and advancement for all.  Benefits and bonus options were good.
good,Office Depot has to be the best job I've had since my workstudy job I had while I was employed at the University of Louisiana Monroe. My store manager worked with my school schedule and I still received enough hours a week. Office Depot helped me to read into what the customer wants when I ask them do they need help. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the older customers and hearing their stories of wisdom. The hardest part is to deal with a customer that feels they are superior to you and doesn't want to listen to your advice on products even when they ask.
good,The company is struggling to stay a float. Years ago the company was a good company to work for.
good,"Lead cashier. Checking out all customers and making sure they found everything they were looking for. "
good,A great company to work for - selling office supply products and services to mid to large companies.  A team approach in sharing best practices to help overcome obstacles selling in a very competitive industry.

good,"Perform all opening and closing duties, cash management, some logistic and receiving duties, keeping up on sales goals and other figures that drive the company, training new employees or current employees on new processes, and leading by example to provide the highest level of customer service."
good,"I was with Office Depot for over 12 yrs.  As an ASM, the job had challenges and rewards.  After 5 stores and 7 Store managers, I have learned quite a bit about diversity, and management styles and have incorporated the best of all into my management style.  The best part of my job were its challenges in everyday work life.  The hardest part were those same challenges.  Office Depot was a great company to work for.  You always had the tools and resources to help you succeed regardless of what you are working on.  Office Depot was transparent in what it wanted from you, from your store, and from the company overall.  "
good, Days always started with a gathering of employees being motivated to carry out their day. Learned that people depended on us to have product knowledge.  Programs were designed so that that culture was carried out and continued.  Management was very friendly and never afraid to pitch in.  Co-workers were very accommodating. The hardest part of the job was worried whether you had handled a situation properly.  It was enjoyable knowing that your hard work was going to be rewarded.    
good,"Working at Office Depot is a different experience. You get to work so many different customers and eventually they can become your client. Being apart of the business gives you a joy of importance not just a typical job. The management are more than co-workers they become family and actually help you out. The job can become very demanding with my position as Copy and print specialist. Completing huge orders and having them done on time is a big responsibility, but its exciting at the same time. The accomplishment at the end of the day is mind blowing looking at all the things you have accomplished in only the amount of hours you worked. "
good,"Started as a cashier for the holidays and within months had advanced to a sales floor specialist."
good,Transported pallets from dock to staging area.  Management assisted and allowed for advancement.  Co-workers were from different countries and made for an exciting work environment.
good,Every day at work was a learning experience. There are many opportunites to interact with other departments and divisions at the company. It requires a high development of soft skills. Your academic and technical expertise guide your decisions in the day to day operations but your willingness and teamwork abilities are key to complete the projects. There is a widerange of projects therefore time management is essential. 
good,Enjoyed the hours as well as the work at Office depot! Great upper mgmt as well as an awesome work environment. Enjoyed a decent salary with an outstanding comm plan for selling tech add on items!
good,"nice please to work ,always learned something new and best pleas   to meet so many different peoples all around word .  "
good,"Typical day of work is sitting in your cube designing items that will get thrown away or changed due to incorrect information or change in direction. This is not always preventable, obviously, but does get tiresome when the same information is incorrect repeatedly. You will also make mock-ups and present your work. No hard feelings on changes/revisions. Truly a group effort. Everyone has their strengths and doesn't always design the best content every time."
good,"Typically when I arrive at Office Depot, the first thing I check is what the daily goal sales are for the evening; I see where we are at, how much we need, and what we can do to improve this. We have a time frame what we call 'Depot time' which essentially is from 12-4, all the associates do nothing but customer service. We don't do any tasks or inventory during these hours because it is dedicated to 100% customer service. I enjoy doing this because it gives the customer a sense of belonging and importance. Every job has those associates who slack or are there to collect the pay check, but by reminding that this is a team work effort, we are able to work as a team and provide the best customer service experiences. The hardest part of my job; due to our location, volume is typically slow/low, and when we have 'Depot time' it is difficult for me to stand around and wait for customers to show up, so I usually find myself organizing the store or doing small tasks to keep myself occupied and when someone does enter the store, I assist them. Even though I don't have the title, managers usually come to me for advice and what they can do to help better the work environment or the store. I really enjoy that I feel a part of the team there and will hopefully continue my hard work and grow in the company. It's nice not feeling like a number and more of an important asset in a company."
good,customers that constantly challenge you.   there is not much more to say about the company.   its a good job
good,Very easy going job with good opportunity to advance. Management was great and ran by a great guy. I learned how to properly address customers who come into a retail store. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting lots of people and helping solve their technical problems.
good,"A typical day is me helping customers. following up with employs making sure they have done all of there tasks. Making sales for our store. I help the management with tasks at hand such as business machine logs. reports and other tasks. One of the most enjoyable parts of my job is the customers. I love to listen to there needs and get a solution for what ever problem they may have, i also just the conversation that goes along with it."

good,It is a great company to work at.Very Great environment and atmosphere.
good,"A typical day at Office Depot, with regard to my job capacity as an in-store technician, includes assisting customers with computer-related problems and shopping for technology-oriented products. My specialization as a technician allows me to analyze and troubleshoot any concerns and issues that a customer might have with their computers (laptop/desktop). Over the past couple of weeks of employment, I have learned that technology is an ever-shifting field that requires vigilant observation in order to maintain up-to-date information. The management of Office Depot mirrors that of any retail-based corporation: high priority on maintaining positive profit margins on a consistent basis to ensure increasing cash flow and satisfied creditors and investors. The personalities of my co-workers vary quite greatly as their backgrounds are very different from one another, respectfully. The hardest part of my job includes handling irrational customer complaints founded upon misconceptions derived from false opinions and beliefs. In these instances, the stubbornness of the customer presents such an obstacle that rationality and logic are difficult to convey to him/her. The most enjoyable part of my job is the troubleshooting factor of my position that allows me to discover new things every day regarding computers and technology."
good,"Cash Office managing front end employees, handling customer complaints Loved working at this company, but was laid off due to the recession"

good,Customer service in helping people find the product that they need. Management was good to work with.
good,"You have to learn how to multitask with minimal error. It is a fast paced job, especially during back to school time. I worked in the copy center, so their was always something to do. Customers send projects through email and come to the store in person with work for you to complete, most of the time, same day. I did from business cards all the way to making 1000 copies for a teacher. Then at the end of the day you are expected to reorganize the store for the next day. It was no walk in the park, but I did learn from the experience."
good,my day would start off by cleaning products and inventory control. I learned what I know today from what office depot had provided me
good,"When I worked at Office Depot, it was really great! The people I worked with were pleasant and we had a lot of fun. I got some really good sales experience with them. Selling computers and printers really boosted my confidence in myself and my sales."

good,Overall a great place to work for no complaints. They treat their employees well. I would have remain there if they hadn't did away with their delivery service.
good,"el ambiente laboral es casi perfecto, difiere entre los diferentes departamento, las oportunidades de crecimiento son pocas ya que existe poca rotación de personal, y cuando las hay son muy exigentes para ascender dentro de la empresa, en algunos departamentos son muy cerrados para compartir los conocimientos, como compañeros de trabajo son amables, pero cuando quieres aprender y vas con el jefe a cargo, pone muchos peros para enseñarte, es más fácil decirle a un compañero de menor rango que te enseñe"
good,Opportunity for growth and advancement.  Fast paced.  Customer service. Retail operations. Flexible schedule.  Training. Services and selling skills. Mission oriented.
good,"Office Depot is a great place to work as a teen looking for a job and to gain some experience. You get paid decently, the management is good, depending on the location you work at. My manager was very kind and caring. He truly did care about his employees. He did his best to resolve conflicts, and really tries to help you advance. This company does promote within, as my managers have been working for the company for a long time, and they usually start as average associates. The job at times can be tedious and stuff can break a lot, and when I say a lot, I mean a lot. In the summer, corporate does not let anyone change the temperatures of the thermostat so you have to deal with temperatures at about 75 degrees while constantly moving in long pants, so it gets pretty toasty. The working conditions do vary by store so don't take my word for everything. I believe at a corporate level the company is heading in a negative direction because it keeps changing its direction towards things."

Office Depot was very understanding and worked with me. With great training I was able to become one of our top sales assoicates well enough to train  others and become an example for other disabled people like my."
good,"The work environment was amazing, The company does a great job working with schedules and often gives more hours then requested. This was great because you could always count on having a shift and they would make sure you are well taken care of when it comes to hours. I was Part-Time and i was working about 25 or more hours each week which was perfect."
good,They may have been slow from time to time but they were always trying to make sure that the employees were okay. If you had nothing to do and wanted to do something they would give you the opportunity to learn something new like their copying department or how to restock or even working on the computers.
good,The management is fantastic here! Everyone is working hard every day and management makes sure everyone gets their breaks in as well as resolving any issues that may arise (which is few and far between). Highly recommend working here!

good,"In a typical day I make about 20 out bounds. I put opportunities into Salesforce.com, disposition lattice plays, and answer e-mails. It’s all very entry-level. I’ve learned a lot. Working for an office supply company has really enabled me to learn more about the contracts side of our business. I’ve learned about logistics; we don’t make anything we sell, but we have to be masters at getting product(s) to move. A lot of managers came from my previous employer so I was a little worried about coming over to Office Depot, but there is enough outside talent from other companies so that the corporate culture from my previous employer hasn't spilled over into Office Depot. Our workplace culture is okay, some of the managers really try to come up with new and exciting contests to increase rep activity. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with metrics all the while having consultative phone calls that run longer and make it harder to have a lot of dials. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I speak to a new contact and get them login access to our business site and they actually start buying from Office Depot."

good,"Gran importancia al capital humano, siempre trabajando por metas y objetivos. Líder en su ramo."
good,My typical day consisted of helping the opening manager prepare the store so that all the products were stock properly before the store was opened. After the store opened I would greet customers while completing any other tasks that my manager had for me to do. The culture was laid back but effective. The hardest part of the job was making sure all the customers were greeted when the entered the store. The most enjoyable part was organizing the products on the shelves.
good,Working here was my very first job so they were very lenient when it came down to how many hours and what days i can and cannot work. I only left because the store I worked at was closing. I recommend this job to anyone looking to make a little extra money. Pay is minimum wage.
good,This was my first job and I really enjoyed being in an environment that was willing to teach me how to assists customers effectively. I learned amazing customer service skills here.
good,This is a great company to work. It offers excellent benefits as well as great pay. I enjoyed working at Office Depot cause it kept me in shape by all the physical work that its done on a daily basis.

good,"Learned people skills and how to deal with difficult customers, especially during back to school, which is why I was hired, to be seasonal help during the summer."
good,"As operations manager there is a lot to do, which could be stressful for some. You will get a lot of experience with operations and logistics systems. The other management is hit or miss, my first SM was great, my current one could get over his ego and be good. The job isn't bad, but it doesn't pay enough to become a permanent source of income."
good,Buena empresa para laborar  con oportunidades de crecimiento y de desarrollo profesional y personal
good,"Liked this as my first job. They worked around my school schedule. Customers can get upset sometimes, but managers are able to help. They taught me compassion for customers."
good,"Excelente para iniciar, pero muy corto para progresar"

good,"This company is a great stepping stone for those who are just starting out on there careers. When I was hired on, I started as cashier and was able to move up in the chain to a Operations Manager. Like I said before, this a great place to begin if your looking for your first job. Pay is decent and they are willing to work with availability, weather you have a second job or go to college or high school."
good,"The job encompassed a variety of different tasks involving customer assistance, product placement & recovery, product sales and front checkout. The job taught me skills such as organization, multitasking, task management and communication with customers."
good,Es buen trabajo por el ambiente que tienen siempre apoyando cuando se necesita
good,"Great people, teams, and improving operations working in the business service division of the company.   The hardest part of the job is closing business.  Easiest part is deciding which cool client you will expense lunch!  Good support from management."
good,"I only really worked with one group and managers, and they were really good. It's hard for me to say what working there would be like if you don't like your managers because I fortunately didn't have that experience. I only left because I was transferring schools and moving across the state. There wasn't exactly a lot of room for advancement unless you were willing to be full time and be trained for a higher position, however that is the case for most occupations."
good,A normal day is few customer coming in and asking for help. A fun day is everyone is running around assisting customer while chatting with the team while helping customers and giving us feedback on who they help and was they able to pleased the customer.
good,I started working at Office Depot thinking I was only going to be here for a month or two. I really enjoy working here so I decided to stay permanently. All management and associates are friendly. Store manager was understanding of the type of schedule that I could work. I am not only at the register all day. I have several duties and everyday I learn something new. I Started here without any experience of office supplies but as time passes you learn that there is all kinds of supplies. I think that the only bad thing is that sometimes my shift are for 3 hours.
good,This was a fun place to work. I was able to take advantage of learning different aspects of the job. There was also a printing department that I was able to go back to and learn new skills.
good,"Fue mi primer trabajo, buen ambiente laboral, facilidad de asenso."
good,"It's been a pretty good company to work for.  It's a positive environment, but there have been several waves of layoffs in the last year.  Doesn't seem like there's any room for advancement."
good,Office Max was a place where they train thoroughly through OMAX U.  This prepares you for the sales floor.  They also have a good policy on how to properly greet customers and ask open ended questions.  The pay is slightly above minimum wage but there are increases for those who have worked long enough for the company.
good,Love working for them. But like every company they are down sizing. I would recommend this job to anyone. The managers are fair and everyone works hard.
good,"Everyone there is a team member, at least at my store. The team mentality made working there fun and I made a lot of life long acquaintances. I would live to go back but school is a priority. The managers even understood that."
good,It was a slow paced job. Not as fast paced as I would have liked. They expected more than what was worth the pay but an overall okay job not much opportunity to advance
good,"It is a great place to work,but sometimes hours were cut so save money. You didn't know if you were going work a full 40hrs or 30hrs. It can be hard to work because of because of hour cuts."
good,Great place. Managers work well with employees. Balanced paste and friend coworkers. Breaks are fair. Bathrooms aren’t the cleanest. Coworkers are easy to get along with. Free coffee
good,"Due to the shift to online purchasing of office supplies store will continue to close. Sale have been sluggish causing store to close."
good,"typical day at work loading all trucks for daily deliveries"
good,Nothing but good to say about the company great work environment. Great management team. Environment was wonderful. Job was fast past and quick decision making. Lots of training and learning of new things.
good,"Overall good company to work for. Learned a lot.  Good managers."
good,"Working at Office Depot is very enjoyable. A typical day for a sales associate consists of greeting and assisting every customer, fixing items in stock and recovering, helping customers carry out heavy items, and occasionally working the cash register. As an associate, especially a strong person, you will be getting down chairs from the top racks for customers on your own or with the assistance of another associate. There are goals to meet for every employee, but the managers don't scold you if you don't meet them, especially if there weren't as many customers coming in as usual. Management is great and makes you feel like family in this store. The only complaint I've heard from the other employees is that we were required to wash and stock the restrooms for customers. I didn't find it that bad, but you'd probably be bothered if you were a germaphobe. Besides that, Office Depot is a great place to work at. If you work part time, you will get your 20+ hours a week if you're available. I would definitely recommend working at this location. Of course, speaking Spanish is extremely helpful."
good,The people make this place a good place to work. Management and other employees are very personable and willing to help in the learning process. Wonderful temperaments in a rather boring workplace.
good,"I liked my job here at Office Max, it was not too stressful......but store was pretty busy and time flew by. I was able to work around my husbands schedule with a mix of hours, allowing me to take part in company benefits,"
good,creces mucho como persona y y aprendes a ser muy eficaz.
good,"Buena empresa, en  cuanto a sueldo es bueno y tiene  buenas prestaciones."
good,"I did multiple jobs in the copy center, faxes, binding books, business cards, laminating, UPS shipping and handling, taking multiple calls for upcoming jobs. Another busy job i enjoyed although this one was more independent which i am flexible either way."
good,"The job was very fun but could sometimes get stressful. The management is very good, they work around your schedule and everyone gets treated equal. Good staff"
good,"Loved OMX....saw company through a lot of merges. Worked there total, about, 11 years....Departments worked in, Customer Service, Credit and Collections, HR benefits, Project Coordinator in furniture."
good,"There are of course your normal complaints that you have about any minimum wage jobs, but overall this company was my favorite to work for, even over my career job now. The management was nice and professional, and did their best to boost moral whenever possible. Benefits were decent, work was steady and multiple opportunities for extra hours and advancement."
good,I've been working here for a couple of months and the people here are great. It's kind of hectic but they are very flexible with you and your schedule. The only thing is that they give you little hours sometimes.
good,"Managers can be very good and understanding, very fast-paced, recommend copy center more than anywhere else in the store. Some people get paid fairly, other people don't due to gender gap and race gap."
good,"I've learned a lot about sales within the 2 years I've been working at Office Depot. With prices higher than most major competitors, it's nearly impossible to sell a product when the usual response is ""it's cheaper at Walmart"". However with a driven team of sales associates and highly trained/experienced management, anything is possible."
good,"It was never stressful, busy at times but that made it fun, working with the public is an adventure and enjoying going to work everyday makes it so much more rewarding"
good,"Really enjoyed myself here, management and everything was great but the only thing there is no time for advancing there. But if you need partime I would work there"
good,"As an Associate I checked out customers and helped them find what they were looking for. Cross & up selling is very important. Managers observe and train you pretty much every week. Always had to ask if the customer wanted to sign up for the rewards program. Recognition is great! Employee of the month had $50 added to paycheck. Most coworkers were very friendly."
good,"I have always enjoyed working with customers and helping to get them what they need. I was hired into the technology department, was trained as a cashier and now I work full time in the copy and print department. The managers here are very accommodating to your availability and you have to realize they do the best they can with what you give them. They are always willing to teach you more if you ask and are willing to learn. There is more than enough room for personal and professional growth. The environment is very friendly as well as professional. It is truly a pleasure to work with Office Depot."
good,Efficient work place with great co-workers that are willing to help you out if you're ever in a bind. over all great sense of community. the only downside is that customer traffic is a bit slow so don't expect many hours.
good,Since this is my first job I learned that you really have to be patient with customers. Understand what the customers needs. Office depot has a lot of hard worker and friendly people working there. The most enjoyable part of the job is when they give prices every time we hit our goal.
good,"Even with everything that goes on at the Office Depot I work, I like what I do there, along with the people I work with.I enjoy working with customers, ensuring that I not only find what they are looking for, but that I also create a positive atmosphere for their shopping experience as well."
good,"Clean and adjust products,Provide excellent customer service,Maintain and organize shelving, Unload heavy merchandise off trucks, Inventory stock in shipping and receiving, Team player"
good,"El trabajo era bueno y entretenido, gente amigable y buen ambiente, lo unico malo era la paga, era un tanto baja."
good,Working at the Office Max/Office Depot copy department can be a handful. It is essential to constantly be on top of what you are doing with hardly any between time. Time management is crucial. They will work with your schedule if you are are still in school. Overall fun experience with lots of experience to gain from this company.
good,Office Depot has been a place that I can learn and grow as a manager. The leadership has been attentive and encourages personal and professional growth.
good,"This is my favorite job that I have had, and the difference is the team. There is a strong team mentality there, and everyone is not only committed to working better together, but they are happy to do it."
good,OfficeMax was a great company to work for. They really cared about their employees and there were great benefits for full time employees. If I had the chance I would work there again.
good,"Office depot is a great place to work, there is always something new to learn about your job, management is great, job overall is not hard and is enjoyable."
good,"Great place to work, relaxed culture and friendly team."
good,"A typical day at work was pulling orders from a database and processing them. Also looking at A/P holds for an hour a day and figure out accounting issues. "
good,"Una muy buena empresa para trabajar, es muy relajado y con los horarios adecuados. Te permite trabajar y hace que aprendas a como hacer tu trabajo asignado. No hay cosas dificiles, solo tienes que ser atento y servicial. La gerencia es muy accesible y cuando tienes un problema ellos tratan de ayudarte."
good,You spend a lot of time one on one with customers. The job is great on keeping up with new product. There is a lot to learn and benefit from this job.
good,Los de alto.mando solo se fijan en lo que ven por fuera pero no se preocupan por lo que realmente pasa adentro
good,"When I first worked at office depot,I was welcomed by every employee, I worked very well as a team player  getting along with everyone andworking hard"
good,"At OfficeMax, your job is to help customers make sure they find the products they need. I learned basic cashiering duties here and a little bit of sales, but I did not feel I was adequately trained in this area. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is making sure the store was clean and orderly at the end of the day, it was a fairly large store and there were not very many of us there to close it, making it a hefty amount of work after store hours. However, with friendly coworkers, it made it easier."
good,La empresa ah sido amable hasta el momento con un poco de flexibilidad en cuanto al uniforme
good,"Very tedious during the holidays, but an overall enjoyable place to work with great career building qualities that will help you prepare for a future in any setting."
good,Unfortunately my position was just eliminated. Office Max/Office Depot was a great place to work. Management culture in the store was awesome. Worked with sales team to develop a selling culture.Observed behaviors with positive/ developmental feedback to better the individual. Opened and closed the store. Responsible for hiring and staffing. Responsible for sales forecast and payroll.
good,the management are great people and the employees are great people also. I would go back to work for these companies if i need to
good,"A typical day at work consisted of many checklists of small task but spread out throughout the day. The main focus however was the customers and just saying ""yes"". The staff and management were awesome and made the work environment nice. The scheduling was very accommodating. The worst parts of the job were the pay, constant changes, and additional work added. Policy over the past few years has changed a lot and many things expected at the associate level were being raised higher with no compensation or extra pay. Payroll has gotten tighter and key positions are being taken, also stores in my area are closing. It seems like you never catch up and for advancement, this company is not a good fit, at least not right now."
good,"A day at work was nothing out of the ordinary. It was a great way to experience retail, and how to deal with people, It made me appreciate my life a little more, just being a casual citizen. Every time I walk into a store now and see something out of place, there's just this gut feeling, telling me to put it where it belongs. Working retail at Office Max was an experience like no other. Everyone there was my friend, and I always enjoyed what I was doing, and who I was doing it with. The worst part about the job may have been my hours, ranging anywhere from 4-10:30 on a school night, or 7-11 on a Sunday morning in the middle of summer. Either way, I had a great time."
good,"Although it was just working at retail store I learned many valuable skills from my higher ups."
good,"Working at Office Depot Max was interesting. The range of people met while working there was a span I never could have imagined. The success of the day always depended on who the manager on duty was as well as which associates were working. This location had very few hard-working, reliable associates which was quite disappointing, but the management team did what they could to help out. The most enjoyable part was some of the regular customers. Working back in the print department my last month or so allowed me to gain closer connections with some of the customers, which is not as typical in other locations in the store."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, en ocasiones hay mucha presion, pero es normal debido a la temporada escolar en la que se incrementa el tener los sistemas apunto para tal hecho. La dirección esta en un continuo contacto con los empleados, cada mes hay una junta general en la que el director anuncia los logros mas importantes y tambien los retos que siguen, Se aprende bastante en cuestión de empresas que se dedican a la distribución masiva de productos, en este caso, de papelería y úitles escolares."
good,"I really appreciate my coworkers and the management of OfficeMax. My coworkers provide a healthy team environment, good communication, ongoing support, and affirmation. I learned a lot about customer service, retail, graphic design, and now I oversee the printing department. The hardest part of my job is the the lack of full-time employment and hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is the work culture that includes teamwork, supportive colleges, ongoing support, and encouragement. A typical day at work involves customer service, responding to online and walk in orders, design and layout, printing services, and services through FedEx."
good,"Supervisors and coworkers are fun and friendly. Customer's are usually nice. However, it is retail and occasionally a disagreeable individual will pop up. Very seldom though."
good,"Doing settlements with vendors was very time consuming,but very exciting doing the research/troubleshooting of issues and seeing the outcome of saving the company money.  Working with the store locations, buyers, accounts payable, traffic department, and vendors to come up with a final outcome was dynamic. Hard work,but very rewarding. Some cases I would actually have to call a vendor meeting to get action done in resolving to the final step.  My co-workers were assigned to other vendors.  They were great to work with."
good,"I have fun with the team I work with "
good,"El trabajo en equipo siempre ha sido primordial en todas las areas de la tienda donde desempeÑo mi trabajo "
good,"Aprendi a usar el sistema en cajas, cortes, atencion al cliente, administrar documentos"
good,"This is a insides sales job, with commission.  I love working with the customers, but not working with metrics.  I don't feel I give my customers enough time to assist them better."
good,Good management and fun co-workers. The benefits are a little weak but that is ok. If the managers willing to work with you. You can perfect the schedule you want.
good,"Fun and fast paced retail environment. Back to school season was the busiest. Management worked well with everyone and scheduling was focused on employee work/life balance."
good,"Well organized,fast paced work environment.Team spirit among co-workers.Treat employees with respect.Fun place to work."
good,"I loved working for Office Max before they merged with Office Depot, I left right at the merger."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo agradable, actividades repartidas equitativamente que permiten un equilibrio entre el trabajo y la vida diaria."
good,"Lively environment with supportive team members and diplomatic management structure.  Daily responsibilities include a healthy variety of basic tasks necessary for overall efficiency, as well as specific duties carried out according to the priority of the team's goals. Red tape and politics present but treated with professionalism and respect. Plenty of opportunities for advancement and personal growth, which are attended to with a great system of encouragement.  The most challenging aspect of my position was being one step ahead of the briskly changing order of priority and efficiently relaying this to the team while maintaining a constant quality of excellent customer service. I was rewarded with a valuable knowledge of high-stress multi-tasking and fine-tuning my ability for meticulous organizational skills."
good,"Reporting to both the District and Store Manager, I was responsible for a retail and logistics team of twenty five employees and a retail sales volume in excess of six million US dollars. My duties included recruiting, training & development of employees."
good,"Only negative was the continuous pressure to make the daily numbers ( as with any sales / retail job)."
good,"I have worked at Office Depot for 6 almost 7 months. At first it was a good place to work at, and it still is if you have the patience for it. Office Depot can get pretty hectic at times, but you have to stick through it.The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my coworkers"
good,"In my six years at Office Depot corporate, I served in five different positions.  Each step was a move up and a move toward a more interesting position.  This is what I liked most about Office Depot - you were rewarded for your work and well-compensated for your work. I also liked the culture, which included an on-campus Toastmasters Club, an on-campus Weight Watchers group and a tennis team, as well as other activities."
good,Working at Office Depot was the best starter job. A great way to learn new skills and meet new people. The skills I have learned there have helped me greatly over the years at home and at work.
good,great place to work for. co workers are very up going and motivated. if you have a boss that doesn't like to work with your schedule it can be very hectic
good,Great variety for products.  Customers always finds something different and something new.  Great merchandising skills.
good,"Your typical day at work would be swift and fluent as long as you continue to operate. I picked up a few skills in copy & print services also, where I picked up my customer service skills. Learned a lot about office supplies, office furniture and electronics. Management isn't perfect but nothing to complain about. The co-workers there are great! Everyone has a different mind-set but seems to be on the same game plan. Hardest part of the job would be selling protection plans with most purchase but the most enjoyable would be meeting new companies and business owners & closing up the store for the night."
good,"I worked at Office Max for about 7 months and i enjoyed the job, managers were nice and helpful. Most of the customers were extremely nice and i enjoyed going to work every day."
good,"Easy going and a lot of people are friendly. As long as you come in and be friendly and positive, it is not a hard job. Costumers make the job easier because they are very understanding and positive."
good,"A typical day working here would be to come in the evening and work overnight, stocking the new items. Making sure I was paying attention to where each item must be displayed."
good,Office Depot/ Max is an average company to work for. They are excellent at working around your schedule if you are in school or have another job. The pay rate is amongst the bare minimum. Most employees start around minimum wage. Benefits are not very good either and very expensive.
good,"I started working here after Christmas. It was fun to learn how to do what was needed of me. However, there wasn't much to do  as a cashier except check out the occasional pen or pack of paper. After a couple months, I was moved to the print center. this was better because there is more to do and I can interact with the customers more, but most shifts I work have little to nothing to do for hours on end.  The only other downside was that I didn't really get very informative training. It was a watch this once or twice then be expected to do it. I still don't know how to work some things in the print center or on the register, but the managers are great with explaining and helping you on the job. "
good,"I enjoy working at Office Depot. I am looking for more hours. The managment is very tentative and efficient. I would love to stay with the company, unfortunately they just don't offer enough compensation and hours."
good,"A typical day includes all store operations from sales, to stocking, to warehouse duties. From the high expectations to broadly set sales goals, I learned how to continually improve and grow in this workplace setting. As a part of the management team I can speak to the interpersonal connections that separate OMX from other retailers. Co-workers from this job have commonly become some of the truest friends I have. The hardest part of this job is developing a sales technique that allows you to meet goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie among all employees."
good,"I do enjoy working there at OfficeMax, but it is more because I love the people I work with. You have duties throughout the day that involve being a cashier to helping customers out on the floor, but that can get boring an tiring. But if you have a team like mines your day goes by pretty fast."
good,"A typical day at work would a really productive day. From the moment that we start working we got blasted with item orders that would come at you at none stop. You work under great amounts of pressure but you tend to work around it as you become more comfortable in each designated area. While working for this company there was a lack of employees spots that needed to be filled up. This made everything harshly more difficult since one person missing could change the entire flow of the job productivity. "
good,"Una empresa en la que realmente aprendí mucho y me se me otorgo la oportunidad de crecer de manera interna gracias a mi trabajo, una empresa con estándares muy altos que no cualquiera puede mantener, pero gracias a eso logre desarrollarme y conocer mis fortalezas y nunca estar en una zona de confort."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my job and management team.  I have the freedom to do my job and support to get things done."
good,"Customer service is valued above all else in this company and I learned a lot about it. My general manager, Olman, was the fairest most professional manager I've ever had and I honestly miss working for such an integritous person."
good,"Office Depot has a great work/life balance. I have moved up through multiple positions with them over the years and learned many new skills. A typical day is making sure that all customers are taken care of in a friendly and inviting way. I have enjoyed working with all of my coworkers and managers over the years, they make it very enjoyable. Office Depot is still a great place work at even through the trying times."
good,"All of management worked with my schedule, all were very kind and helpful not just with customers but also employees."
good,"Tend to give actual raises to everyone. Good culture, nice people to work with. Corporate is not the best but store to store it is a great company."
good,I would have stayed there if the pay was higher. I just didn't see breaking my back for 13.50 hr. Great place to work for. The benifits were ok the cost from us a bit high but you need them.
good,"Average job, learned how to communicate with customers more effectively, the management was superior, co-workers were friendly, hardest part is when there is a mass amount of customers in the store, and the most enjoyable part is making customers happy."
good,"Dealing with customer was hard, but it always became to be easy at the end of the day. The management was great she was very straight forward and what she wanted or expected to be done at work. The co-workers where very nice and easy to get alone with and straight forward if their was a problem."
good,"Answering calls to place/query orders/deliveries. "
good,Office Depot provided a great opportunity for career development. Top performers were rewarded through compensation and promotional opportunities.
good,"If you are looking to pick up a part time or second job, this place is not bad.  The hours are flexible and the management is friendly and nice.  The overall store is a good place to work, but the downside is the corporate over hang on a lot of in store decisions.  I understand that a store needs to save money.  The other workers are nice and fun to work with as well."
good,Great company to work for! Office Depot is an Employee centric environment that values their associates and their contributions.
good,"Show up at your assigned time in your uniform sign on ready to help customers and with a smile on your face. I learned how to work with Xerox, Windows 8, Customers, different selling technics, how to use diffent machines and how to build certain documents in copy and print. I learned how to be responsible for my drawer and to give the right amount of change back and to adapt to the new programs implemented by managment. The hardest part of this job was to please a customer and to make the document he or she wanted exactly like he wanted and not over charge them or break the machines in the process. The enjoyable part was learning how to operate the machines and getting to know the customer and meeting new people."
good,I liked working for office depot. They are all about the latest and greatest technology that an employee can have. The job really taught me about being efficient while still doing my best.
good,"Just as the title of this review suggests, Office Depot is the premier job for any student whether its high school or college. The managers will work with your school schedule and allow you to work a suitable amount of hours, although if you're trying to live on your own you will need a second job because current wages leave must desired."
good,I advised those looking for a job to apply because te atmospher is great
good,"Office Depot takes a great approach to the business, personal and customer aspects. As a business they are all about selling what the customer would need. Listening to the suggestions from customers. They value the opinion of their customers.As an employee they see the importance in a Worklife balance so that we as employees are not overwhelmed. As far as the customer side they are always  making sure that a customer is taken care of and walks away having had a great experience wanting to return."
good,"I start by helping  Induction to make boxes, then put the pick ticket inside (order with the bar code), give break or luch to my co-workes, then cover the second shitf batching of orders(printing and sort by size of boxes), unsorting e-mails (canceling orders priority to bacth, change route, print and reprint labels), some times find a order ready batch, make reports at closing time and send e-mail to the managers.  "
good,Pleasant co-workers and management. Everyone was treated fairly.
good,"Cool place to work, just wish the pay was better. For all the different tasks an Office Depot employee is required to do, compensation should equal the work."
good,Stayed on the floor for the most part to help custmers. Once the truck would come i would break that down and stock shelvs. And when needed i would work in copy and print.
good,Great Company to work for.  Could have a better Compensation plan but overall I love my experience here.
good,Office Depot is a great company to work for. There all about helping and letting everyone have a shot at growth.
good,Great atmosphere the managers were all friendly never showed favoritism would work for them again in a heart beat
good,"Great company culture, great place. The office location is good too."
good,Working here has taught me a lot and I've made some great acquaintances along the way. A great place of employment.
good,"A typical day involved standing at the cash register for long hours taking care of customers. There would always be a couple customers who would buy expensive equipment with the option of extended warranties and that would be my chance to work on my skills in sales to sell extended warranties and receive healthy commission. At Office Depot i learned how to multitask, run a cash register, stay happy and motivated, and sell warranties to customers. Management was great. Supervisor and managers were always very supportive and understanding. My co-workers were always very helpful and knew how to have a good time but stay professional at the same time. The hardest part of the job was probably rush hour when the lines were long and i had multiple responsibilities to attend to. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably selling extended warranties because it was commission but more importantly i felt like a real salesman and as if i was contributing to the company as a whole."
good,"Working at office depot had me working with a lot of equipment such as the ""pick the voice system"". It was a really nice experience serving a customer that way. The environment was really great . A group of dedicated co-workers made it very easy to conduct our daily work roles. Effective and responsible managers made sure the needs of the customers were met."
good,"A typical day at Office Depot is to get the daily tasks completed by assigned time in morning. As a cashier my duties if I worked the morning shift was to, clean the counters of the 3 main registers near the doors of the store, answer the phone, put away any product that was not returned to shelf from previous shift. Assisted in Inventory control when needed, assisted in sorting, and setting prices of product in store. Stop all tasks when customer enters store to ensure the customer is able to find what they need to solve business needs."
good,The co-workers are friendly and the managers are strict yet flexible. Overall the environment is fun and the customers enjoy shopping here.
good,I loved working here! My coworkers and management was great to work with! 
good,"A typical day at work has slow moments where everyone is striving to find something productive to do and there are fast moments where there aren't enough employees to handle it. Depending on the manager they are overbearing and harsh. They tend to show a small level of disrespect to their associates. However, there have been the helpful and enjoyable managers as well. Co-workers come in all different types but they are friendly and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is to take down orders accurately and complete it according to the customers expectations for the Copy and Print center. So many print jobs can turn out just the opposite of what the customer wants. Taking down exact information and making sure it is easy to understand in case the next associate has to take over is vital. I love the people and helping them with orders or just finding what they are searching for."
good,"Learnt about supply chain management, logistics, complete branch operations and key account management."
good,"My daily duties while working at office depot were to ring customers items out of the store while keeping my work area clean. I learned alot about operating the cash register, and about the store policies. This job was never really difficult, just sometimes during busy hours i was required to work at a fast pace but also diligently. I loved the older age group that visited the store because it allowed me to learn as i worked."
good,This was one of my first jobs. I learned alot and met alot of great people. I love working with the public and helping people.
good,"we dealt with inventory control on a daily basis, customer however were always our number one. We took any complaints or compliments seriously. Huge option for advancement as well as bonus. Great benefits and vacation package. Wonderful incentives. Fair work environment. As employees we were all held to the same level of responsabilities in sales and held accountable for the good or bad. I loved making a sale and meeting my goals--it meant a nice bonus."
good,i work mornings and evenings sometimes and everyday i would go to work prepared. i didn't have any problems with any co-workers. everyone got alone. and management is really helpful when it comes to making your own schedule.
good,Office Depot Warehouse was the BEST job that I ever had.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Ofice Depot. I found to company to be people-oriented. They had a solid plan for staff development that included training and mentoring.
good,I personally enjoyed my time at Office Depot. Very customer and employee oriented and provides pretty versatile training. Also a great way to be exposed to a wide variety of people.
good,Company sent you out for training in other department in other states all exp paid. Constant room for growth
good,I would schedule associates to load trucks according to the amount of merchandise picked for shipment that day. Follow up on proper loading. Create and verify bill of ladeings. Seal trucks and send drivers on their way.
good,"I would always hours to work and good pay for minimal wage, but no room for advancement in computers"
good,"Office Depot has a slow-paced environment most of the time. I learned from working there that I enjoyed a face-paced environment over slow-paced. My coworkers were the best part of the job. Everyone was kind and great. The hardest part of the job was working the register for over 6 hours. It became dull. Making new friends in that environment was the most enjoyable part. If my coworkers weren't the people they were, I may have had a terrible time working there."
good,I loved working for a company that allowed room to grow. The hours were great and the pay good for a full time student.
good,"Great job for someone who likes a very fast paced, challenging job. Very productive days."
good,"Don't ask a lot out of employees, goals are not unreasonable."
good,"If found this employer to have a pleasant and professional atmosphere. They keep employees updated on upcoming products and services to offer their customers. They offered excellent training and job opportunities. Overall, this was a great team of people to work with and made the job pleasant and enjoyable. I appreciated working for such a family based company."
good,I enjoyed working with the people that worked there and the customers.
good,"The workplace at Office Depot was different than regular retail. It was an experience unlike any other. Greeting customers, helping them find what they need, and recommending a product based on customer needs. The managers are friendly, coordinated, and well trained. They help out both employee and customers no matter the situation. The company in itself is well organized, proficient, and maintained."
good,Office Depot was a great place to work. I enjoyed working with all management. You will have opportunities to work other departments and learn alot more. This is a great company to grow with.
good,Office Max has an incredible work environment with a friendly attitude. Management is very helpful and always on your side. The toughest part of the the job is customer service but most people are understandable.
good,"Very simple tasks. Depending on your position, but everyone is determined to giving the customer a great experience inside the store. Although, knowing your position and product knowledge is a must for work to be easy."
good,Not all stores are the same but mine is family and my customers become family. Every corporation has their faults somewhere but I was lucky to find the better spoils. I laughed at work and sometimes wanted to angry there too but with a smile. Managers train with you and work with your schedule. They worked to make both the associates and the customers happy.
good,Office Depot was a very good job.  It taught me a lot about sales and customer service. I also enjoyed the flexible hours and they were willing to work with my other schedule.
good,"A typical day at work is working your pipeline, while continuing to hunt for opportunities within your account set.  In team on my accounts, I have been able to ground and pound on many the many different sites within my accounts in order to have the high level conversations with my customer.  Upon building that relationship, you can then continue to build your pipeline for success."
good,"A good place to work as long as you stay on top of the tasks set for you by management. Everybody you work with including your management is under the scope at all times so you got to be prepared to work when you come in. While on the floor there is no real down time as the stores always need to be re-stocked or cleaned but if you keep up with it on a regular basis it will never get too out of hand. The best advice I could give anyone is to go with the flow, don’t oppose your management team (because again like you they too are under the scope) , and if your not looking to move up to be a part of management it may be best to look at other job offers that will get you to where you want to be."
good,I went into a Costco and observed the rows of ink jet printers and ink cartridge.  I knew then the big box stores would fall to the internet and need smaller foot prints.  I started looking at options and decided to pursue a franchise with Chick-fil-A
good,"Typically the work day includes checking out customers and zoning products for most of the shift. The best part of this job was by far the management, the best managers you'll ever see work at Office Depot. The hardest part of the job is working the logistics shift in the morning, but the easiest part of the job is the closing shift."

Certain days were not busy and not too many Customers of certain weekdays; plus, striving to push items to better the Store Sales. Also, helped with assembling of certain chairs and load of them and Office Furniture to Customer's vehicles. Very well handling of all skills as a Cashier too."
good,"bonne entreprise qui te pousse vers l'avant , ambiance agréable"
good,I advanced from a part time cashier in high school to administrative assist. Also because loss prevention manager. Then advanced to part time customer service supervisor & part time manager all while doing all the jobs listed above. I maintained the highest score during audits & traveled to a few locations to train the admin positions.
good,"I have been very kindly received at Office Depot. All the Co-Associates are very helpful and encouraging, and the managers are really helpful and kind ! My co-workers are very kind when I make mistakes (Which I have several times :) ), and  overall I would definitely recommend it as a great place to work."
good,"In my experience, it is a good retail job. The company cares about family life when it comes down to holidays. The store is either closed or the hours are reduced. There is work to be done but it can be done with a smile."
good,"if you need a start with work experience this will be the place to go. great staff "
good,"Management knew what they were doing and had a grip on the store as a whole. Directions were clear and duties were simple and easy to complete. Breaks were guaranteed at proper times, including two paid 15 minutes and an unpaid 30 minute lunch."
good,"Learned a lot from both the Sales side of things as well as the management side. After the merge, things changed tremendously.  Your workday or atmosphere depends on your mngr and team."
good,"My pros outweigh my cons. Great advancement, PTO and Sick leave. Very Sales driven and there's always training and development. Cross training is encouraged."
good,"Out of all the jobs I have Office Max is the least stressful and the most boring. It's simple work, that isn't very mentally demanding therefore you do not get as much anxiety as other jobs in customer service."
good,"Office Depot has a very diverse culture, which encourages teamwork.  You are given the ability to learn new programs and processes. You are able to work with some of the most gifted people in the retail Office products world."
good,"I miss working with my ""Uncles"" since I was the only girl in the warehouse. It was an awesome face paced experience, and learning how to drive a forklift and also a picker. I left because I moved to the mainline, but I'd work there again if I had the opportunity."
good,"A typical day in Office Max would be working the register and/or stocking shelves and organizing aisles. I learned customer service experience and i also learned every item in every aisle, which is good to know when someone walks in and asks where something is and you know exactly where and what they are talking about for better customer experience. The hardest part of the job would be standing at the register when we were very slow or no one was in the store and there was nothing to do but wait. The most enjoyable thing was having a little work family and very welcoming and helpful environment to work in everyday."
good,"Days working for Office Depot OfficeMax were very regular, you are taught a schedule that outside of customer service you will find yourself performing within comfortably, the most strenuous part of most employee's days is having to lift an office desk/chair, and price changing labels."
good,Production was the key goal at Office Depot. They checks your production daily. So u gotta be on point with working at Office Depot. But it's a very learning and educated experience.

good,"The company in going through significant changes that are for the betterment of the company. With that however, are less workers and more work load due to trimming of employees and work transfer to who's left. We are fairly secure in my position however, there no advancement opportunities in my position. Overall a really good transition job into something better."
good,"Great part time job. Decent pay, good work environment, excellent Co-workers and manager. Very flexible schedule that works around my full time job. The manager is great. Rewarded for work. We never leave a shift without a thank you. I feel appreciated by management, coworkers and customers."
good,"Being a cashier was fun, but being on your feet for so many hours can be tiresome. I recommend getting trained for the Tech department or the Printing department if you want to advance. There's a lot of things to remember to do, to ask customers, and upsell. Sign up for rewards."
good,"In my 10 months of working here so far, I find it way better than my previous job. This place actually cares about you and your family.  They are willing to work around the schedule you need. I can be slow sometimes especially after holidays. But it does pick back up. Customers can sometimes be rude. I would recommend this for someone to work at."
good,"Really great experience, greta team, great management and above all they are really good at making a working schedule adequate for a student and working person."
good,The job was very challenging but the manager was extremely fair and understanding when it came to any issues. They paid for everything you did after work hrs and yearly pay raises.
good,"A typical day in office depot includes helping customers with various products as well as upselling certain products. For example, if a customer wants to purchase a printer you will also be trained to upsell paper for the printer or ink."
good,"Answering telephone calls, back to back, from businesses all over the United States. Taking orders for office supplies and resolving issues of the customer including defective items, lost items and driver issues. I learned to be punctual and on time for work and only taking allotted time given for breaks and lunch. I learned several programs the company had set up in their computer system. The job was somewhat stressful because calls  were given stats that an employee must meet daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with most customers who were quite enjoyable and the employees that I worked with."
good,"You’re going to have those days where you’re going to want to rip your hair out and others where you can just relax, just like almost every other workplace. It’s a good company, it just lacks benefits for part time associates."
good,"Computer skills, customer service skills, customer experience management, competetive pricing, working with schools and businesses, home schoolings...."
good,I was hired to work part time until I was able to find full time employment. The manager gave me morning cashier duties (which I've had experience in) so that I could schedule interviews and do job searching in the afternoons. The staff worked well together.
good,"fixing, updating, cleaning printers and mail equipment for clients were exciting as a first job in the field. They gave me the confidence to learn more in order to advance thru education with skills to obtain a job with great future."
good,"The job was a fun one to have and gain experience from as any experience is great. However it is retail so the stores get slow at times so but there is always plenty to clean such as shelves. However, I loved the managers and they tried to make it as fun as possible which made the day better."
good,"As an inside sales rep, you worked 40 hours per week, no more.  I learned to work well with distribution partners to help get the best pricing for customers.  Management was relaxed as long as you stayed active and on the phones."
good,At my warehouse is a nice pace working place no one to bug you the supervisor his really awesome I can say it's a pleasure working for him.i just wish we had more order pickers when we have heavy days.
good,"I started when this place first opened, so there were employment advancement opportunities.  I mostly enjoyed working here, the cons were the drive was so far for me for the little bit of pay."
good,The management team is very willing to work with student schedules and all requests of employees! The environment of the company allows sales consultants to develop their own style of selling. This allows employees to feel comfortable when learning the items in the store and on-line. Flexibility is always a good option when learning sales and customer service.
good,"Office Depot was a great place to work for,with great focused and open minded staff.Great benefits and employee package and a chance for advancement.Saddly the company moved to Newville P.A"
good,"Muy buena empresa,horarios flexibles,buena convivencia.Servicio de comedor vía nomina.Cursos,desde la integración grupal laboral,hasta académicos y más."
good,"cuando no avía muchos clientes, era muy tranquilo."
good,I had a blast working here. The employees are all very encouraging and actually care how you are doing. They want to see you succeed and they help you set and achieve goals. They make things fun and working there fun.
good,"I very much enjoyed my job, I became a supervisor at 18 years old, and trained several employees to become associates. I had regular customers that would return because of my high quality standards and positive attitude."
good,"great people, great projects - industry is shifting so very challenging times ahead which can be really exciting but leadership is struggling to convey the overall vision of the future."
good,"Office Max was a good company to work for and had excellent benefits. Things had changed from back when it was Boise which is when I originally started. Lots of jobs were lost with the Office Depot merger and jobs sent over seas. Most people who worked there had been veterans for 10+ years, most with no college degree who started at minimum wage and worked up to a decent pay that you will not find in the area where the office I worked in is at. Put a lot of people in a tough spot."
good,"I am a hardworking, adaptable and enthusiastic receptionist with over 13 years’ worth of experience working within a fast paced multinational company. I am very adaptable at dealing with visitors and employees alike, I work equally effective within a team environment or under my own initiative, I am highly motivated and passionate towards my role and thrive on any challenges/issue that may arise whilst maintaining a very high standard of professionalism at all times. I am very adept at dealing with sensitive information and situations which require a high level of integrity. My skills sets have grown from working with the various departments within the business and enjoying the opportunity and variety this has given me."
good,"Día lleno de actividades, aprendí a manejar varios trabajos al mismo tiempo así como dedicarle su tiempo a cada uno cuando es necesario. Buen ambiente de trabajo. No se me dificultó ningún trabajo, era pesado pero no imposible. Me gustó el servicio al cliente y ayudar en lo que se pueda."
good,Office Depot is a great place to work. They are all about developing the associates to build confidence is selling technology and meeting customer needs.
good,Es una empresa grande en donde se te da una actividad estable en la cual trabajar
good,"I really loved working here, it was an awesome experience. The up's of this position would really outway the down's. I loved who I worked with and who I would help as far for customers. If given opportunity again I would gladly go back."
good,"It was good place to work, my work was very reasonable. I enjoyed working in the print department on creative projects. The people were nice and worked well together."
good,Worked for a great DM who instilled a sales friendly culture while putting the needs of the associates first. Unfortunately Office Depot and Office Max merged which caused the closing of lots of stores.
good,"A typical day at work it was amazing, I've learned that is always good to help others. My co-workers were like my family everyone helped each other. Their wasn't a hard part at this job, what I enjoyed the most was that I would always make customers happy with my service."
good,Office Depot is a nice place to work with benefits and salaries consistent with the industry. The local and regional management are truly caring and realize that there must be a work-life balance. The only negative with Office Depot is that it is prime for a takeover and that makes employees uncertain of their respective futures and morale low at times.
good,A typical day at work would be working retail and sales. What I've learned from working retail that it is always about the customer. Management at Office Depot was excellent and very accountable. Working with great leaders is always good. Co-workers was very reliable and could always count on them to get the job done. The hardest part of work was difficult trying to keep the machines running. It was imperative that the machines always work properly in order for us to complete our job duties. The most enjoyable part at work was building a friendship with co-workers. Working with a great team makes the workplace effortless to work at.
good,I enjoyed my time working for OfficeMax. My bosses were very nice and also very understanding. Most enjoyable part was learning to do graphic design. My co-worker was very helpful and patient. She taught me a lot and soon I was able to work on my own. The hardest part? There was no hard parts. One of my favorite companies to work for.
good,"Manage book of business everyday"
good,"Great coworkers, unlimited projects to get involved in, working with experts in their field. Good work life balance. Pending Staples acquisition is the only negative at this time."
good,"I enjoy being productive and alarm on what im doing. Generally I rather be doing something than doing nothing at all. When i was hired at my first job, Office Depot, i grew my costumer service and money managing. I had wonder staff members to partake the experience i had working with them. The hardest part was extracting furniture from the warehouse. And the most i enjoyed was talking and having conversations with costumers, just trying to have a decent conversation."
good,The management and employees made a great team. Very high energy with a lot of great learning business opportunities. Great moral of the team.
good,"This is the first job I've had where I love my superiors. They speak with you about what needs to be done, and don't threaten you. I have learned to better manage my time to meet deadlines through my time here. I have had customers ask for wild and unrealistic requests that have challenged me as a designer."
good,"do daily meetings to go over the plan for the day."
good,"Productive fun place to work,with a great team of managers. Customer focused,empathy,problem solving.Co-workers got along well.Very good team players.Flexible to take on multiple task asap when needed.Company gathering was fun."
good,"Working at office depot has tremenzlously improved my computer knowledge. It has also impacted my work ethic for the better. a typical day at work I am non stopped greeting and  gladly assisting customers with their needs and giving them great customer service to assure them coming again. my managers and co-workers are great their very patient and have a great attitude always during work. In my opinion the only hard part about working in office depot would having to be working in the copy and print department and it isn't the job that's hard but having so many customers at once and trying to keep them all happy, cause now a days people have low patient and don't like to wait for their turn. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able  to assist my customers and once in a while joke around and make them laugh."
good,"Daily interacting with business, teachers, and very successful in IT field and learn about new upcoming software or technologies."
good,"desarrollo en areas ajenas a el departamente a cargo."
good,Everyone is well-informed and are willing to take the initiative when the job needs to.
good,A typical day at Office Depot was stressful no lie. Some customers would come in and they knew exactly they needed or wanted. Others came in very curious asking billion of questions. I learned that with every customer it is a different need and there is always a solution to there problems. The customers never wanted anything that would break there pockets they either wanted to know what was on sale or where the clearance area were. The management at Office Depot wasn't bad people at all they had very strong and encouraging saling routes. They was smiled and moved as fast as they could. My co-workers at OD are very different I must all of them had different stories we never talked liked that but when we did it was either a joke or some type of humor to make you or the customer laugh. The hardest part of the job was upselling no matter what was on sale it could be a 13 cent folder some customers didn't want to spend that extra to increase the sales per person or the average ticket item. The most enjoyable part of the job was either a tech depot service or helping someone with furniture and ordering items for people to help them save money when the order was over fifty dollars.
good,"It was a big warehouse in Ashton-under-lyne and was very busy, I learnt how to work in a warehouse environment, we had a health and safety and tour of the workplace on the registration day. I learnt how to pack away goods and how to organize equipment into the boxed areas. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the warehouse in a small group to create a good image for visitors/inspectors. The most enjoyable part of the job was on 'split case' working on packing the boxes and shifting them onto the converbelt to be inspected on the correct size and that the goods packed are the right goods. I enjoyed this because it was on a busy area of the warehouse and I met new people and it was the easiest part of the job in my opinion."
good,it was one of my favorite place to work. but when i moved to Orlando i was not happy with the store manager. the store in west palm beach is much better.
good,"-All day in the field visiting new and existing customer, my work area are: caguas,juncos,cidra,san lorenzo, gurabo, las piedras, humacao,guayama, naguabo, naguabo, yabucoa, salinas.  "
good,"lots to do and plenty more projects received throughout the day. answering multiple lines, meanwhile handling in-store customers."
good,Love the job and the associates I work with. Office Depot is a great company.
good,"Fun workplace, productive, and flexible. fairly busy depending on the customers' flow of traffic. I have learned so much between cashiering, saling products and copy and print center."
good,"Everyday is always a learning experience.  I enjoy the challenges that I face everyday.  This makes me a better person, knowing I can brighten someone else's day.  Managing day to day activities with employee's and consumer's is a new experience and I have stepped up to take the responsibilities and empower the position.  Learning new tasks with managing has been very rewarding.  The employees I work with are motivated to follow as I lead by example and build relationships with each one.  I re-direct with patience and guide them towards policies and goals set by the organization. The hardest part of my job is customer satisfaction.  When a customer is unsatisfied, I am unsatisfied.  I will go out of my way to try to alleviate the situation.  I enjoy the challenge and set out to do my best to resolve conflicts.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer smile.  I also enjoy employees getting along and laughing.  I feel that a happy atmosphere, brings happy customers, and great results."
good,"Working at Office Depot has taught me about Printing, Paper styles and weight, good customer service and how to treat other workers. Working here helped me expand my artistic deign by helping customers bring their business to life. Making business cards, flyers, designs, logos, menus and more. The management was nice and the co-workers were always there to help."
good,"Office Depot was an amazing career, with many challenges that made me stronger.  I had many managers and employees that not only kept me busy learning daily, but also became career friends."
good,"Resloved issues with customers and employees. Assisted other managers. Scheduling, evaluations, auditing product, and the registers. Everyone got along for the most part. The general manager was not always available. Mornings were very fast paced. Did not always have enough help. Always restructering, which caused some employees to be laid off. Enjoyed friendships made,and being up to date with technology, by working with the product."
good,"Office Depot is a safety driven company that wants to insure all associates work in a accident free environment. A typical day for me would start with a team huddle to discuss the days priorities, then to manage to achieve all production goals. I enjoy this job because you instantly see the positive result of what we have accomplished. The position I hold isn't hard the associates always respond to being treated with respect and dignity."
good,Really enjoyed working here. Great company culture. The brand spanking new office space in Highbrook is truly awesome.
good,"A full day would consist of approaching customers with open-ended questions that pertain to their needs or what they currently have their eyes on. The next step would be to recommend at least three qualifying products that would allow them to meet and/or exceed their needs and then to close the sale and cross-sell anything else the customer may need with their primary item. The sales team uses the walkies to communicate every customer that comes into the store their description and what direction they are headed. The walkies are a good way to communicate with one another as a team to help one another very quickly. The management gives us insight as to what our goals are and every hour they update us the progress the store is making. The walkies are a good way to play games to help learn about the promotions that are going on within the ad paper. The co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with as long as you do your part to keep the workload to a minimum. Everyone works as a team to get the job done quick and easy as well as to take good care of what's most important, the customer. The most difficult is during the busy hours when the store is flooded with customers and there are not enough associates on the floor to take care of everyone simultaneously. The most enjoyable part of the day is during down time when everyone is able to recover the store and prepare it for the night crew to get ready for the next day."
good,"Family type of environment"
good,I Learned About Different Updates In Technically While Working. 
good,I liked working with the people and learning new jobs and ways on doing things
good,"research any invoice discrepancies and work with the vendors to resolve the issue, work on a report. Liaison between vendor, manager, vendor program department."
good,i work and communicate well with others. my main duties and enjoyable part will be working effectively and achieve targets set by the team leader.
good,"A typical day at Office Depot was very productive slow pace, I learned a great deal about management, copy center,technology. Managementwas good very hard working and supportive of the staff. the most enjoyable part of the job was the training, co-workers, management and interacting with the customers"
good,"j'ai bien été accueilli dans l'entreprise. le fait le plus marquant durant mon passage chez office depot c'est le management participatif car on peut pas faire une distinction entre le patron et les autres employés, aussi l'esprit d'équipe."
good,"i worked on a graveyard shift, i have learned to manage my time, makes new friends, i became flexible with my fellow workers and clients. There are free foods and parties is what i like on this kind of job"
good,Good to work for. Co-Workers were nice . Benefits are good for the family.
good,This is a corporately structured company where advancement is all up to the individual. I took high initiative during my time there and was rewarded for that with advancement and raises. The work can be tedious at times and an individual that is self-motivated will succeed.
good,"I have taken both calls & live chats for Office Depot, assisting customers with general customer service needs and inquiries. I always try my best to keep up with our large call volumes."
good,"My time there was very beneficial to the improvement of my character: It helped me learn to do things in a timely manner, and to strengthen my communication skills. To continue, my managers and I were able to negotiate a flexible work schedule for me."
good,This job teaches you a lot about printing and formatting. I would definitely recommend this job to any graphic designers looking to learn more about printing operations.
good,"Managers were helpful in learning and answering questions, teaching you what you needed to know and anything you asked about. Every store works with team effort."
good,Even though results are a priority.  Taking care of the people on the front lines is a focus always. Benefits are good.  There is a lot of employee referrals because people enjoy working there.
good,Great place to work and great people to work with. The building is always changing and trying new things to try to be more productive every day. Plenty job opportunities to move around within the company. Overall great place to work.
good,"This job is great for someone starting out or is in school and wanting to gain experience. Worked in copy center and was a bit mundane and stressful at times, especially when its something that you're constantly doing every day. The amount of work and having to put up with clients that can be very picky and inconsiderate towards your work was not worth the amount of pay. However some clients were very appreciative and very rewarding. Learned many new skills about how to handle and approach customers, build multi-tasking skills and work efficiently well with others. However there was very little room for advancement, was promoted into the copy center and not much happened after that. Management was great, very understanding as were the coworkers. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Office Depot. "
good,"Se creo un ambiente muy bueno, eramos como una familia, mucha confianza y buena organizacion, facilidad de trabajo en equipo."
good,This was my first job. Management I felt could have been better but while working there I got great work experience. This is where I was able to apply my out going personality to a job.
good,Overall a good company to work for. Great experience and learning opportunities. Always room to grow with the company and be promoted. All employees and management made you feel like family.
good,"As a part-time employee at Office Depot, I have, overall, had a very positive experience. The management there is very professional and supportive and their is a lot of recognition for doing a good job. My main criticism is the time its takes to be cross-trained or promoted. I have currently worked there a little over a year and no hints of this have come up. Not sure if this is simply my experience or if this is a store-wide thing. However, if looking for part-time employment there is a lot to like here. Black Friday is a relative breeze and we are having Secret Santa this year!"
good,"Days typically start with doing the daily inventory checks, followed by putting out freight(or products) from recent shipments. Along my time there i learned of ways to interact with the plethora of differing individuals coming in, and meeting their needs. Management tended to make the days fun and interesting while staying laser focused on the goals laid out by corporate. The hardest part of the job in my opinion is taking on more than one role, due to a coworker calling on or being unable to make it in due to another emergency, or them being tied up with other customers/engagements. Though at the same time it was also the most enjoyable part of it, being able to satisfy multiple customers in different areas of the store alongside learning more and more in that particular section(i.e technology, copy and print, etc.)."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of ringing up customers, recovering the aisles, assisting customers by answering any questions they might have. I would also bring furniture from the stock room to customers vehicles and help them get the furniture in the car. I learned a lot working at Office Depot."
good,I had a fantastic experience at Office Depot. I learned more than I would have ever thought possible in such a short program. The entire team at Office Depot is eager to teach and train and develop.
good,"The environment of the store is always friendly and the co workers you get to work with will never leave you with a  bad taste in your mouth. You end up enjoying the fact that you get to work in such an environment. The bosses are always cool, calm and collective also."
good,"The company has to meet production daily so the job is a"
good,"teniamos 8 horarios diferentes "
good,"Allowed to partake in functions outside of finance department."
good,Supervisors to briefers about what are goals are and how will we do for the week how great was our expectation for the week in to help out and other departments if needed and to be very safe in the facility then briefest about how many hours we are doing stay positive and safe and be very productive.
good,Normally my days were easy and I was able to get a lot work done. I learned many things about technology. The hardest part of the job was just remembering all the computer and technology. I liked talking to customers and having interactions with them.
good,"I didn't hate my time at Office Depot. There's a lot of things I like, but some things I hate."
good,Muy buena empresa para aprender procesos y ser multifuncional
good,"Office Depot is a great place to work at. I have worked in most of the business units. One con was that the pay is not competitive but other than that, I am pleased with the workplace. The new CEO is doing great things for the company and showing that Office Depot  Office Max is not only office supplies."
good,"Ambiente regular, mucha venta, mucho cliente, apoyo en diversas areas"
good,Considero que esta empresa Office Max es buena siempre y cuando busques un trabajo de medio tiempo y necesites dinero prácticamente rapido ya que no tiene quincena fondo.
good,Learn alot from the very experience workers. I was taught how to perform every job. It was a lot of fun and I would work there again in a heartbeat if I could
good,"La cultura organizacional siempre esta enfocada al cliente"
good,Es un buen trabajo. El equipo de trabajo es bueno.
good,Tienen amplios beneficios para los empleados ..y motivación laboral
good,Office Depot was a place where multi cultures came together and worked as teams. work was always carried out in a timely manner. Many opportunities were available within this co.
good,"*movimiento fluido de personal y no da tiempo de aburrimiento"
good,"i was in charge of management and it  was great every one would get along ,  there was always team work and help if you needed it and  my days would be very busy but was an enjoyable job !"
good,A typical day at work would start off fine being that there were 3 shifts in which I worked the second. The warehouse would some days be overloaded with products some days/weeks wouldn't. that's when the shortage of hours would come in and you're not for sure if you'd have a workday for that day. The management was ok they could've been more professional with the scheduling and knowledgeable of what the work days would have been consisted of. The job wasn't hard at all if you're a hands on person and understood the use of a ring imager. Overall was a laid back type ordeal being able to communicate and get along well others while working.
good,"I enjoyed my employment at office Depot as a lower lever manager. I had all shift responsibilities including opening and closing the store, scheduling, leading a team and customer service."
good,As this company has gone out of business in Canada writing a review will not benefit any perspective employees. Staples is the equivalent place of employment
good,"I enjoyed working at Office Depot . People I worked with are awesome and team excellence . Unity and fun environment . I transferred once . Because I had to relocate, and at both stores I had a good working experience."
good,"I had this job in high school and honestly it was one of the funniest jobs ever, I had a really good  management staff, that was really chill yet could keep others in line. The employees that worked there really knew their stuff and taught me alot of technical lessons. I learned how to choose the right toner, and printer ink. How to work a cash register, as well as how to correctly sell products. When i worked there, my store and district manager kept me on the right path, let me do my homework when it was slow, and pretty much congratulated me on a good sale, they always made sure that you knew what you were doing. What i took from there i put towards college, and eventually graduated. I learned to never give up on my dreams, to always work hard so i can play hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was late at night when i had to count the drawers out, with a manager present, i got to know these guys so we would talk when i counted all the cash out."
good,"Working at Office Depot was a fun experience over all. I was a part-timer gaining 8$ per hour. I was a cashier , however ended up exceeding my daily task efficiently. My manager was patient and clear therefore the working environment remained professional."
good,it was a great workplace the people there are really helpful and they work as a team. They take time out to teach you how the store works and find ways to motivate you to work harder
good,"What can I say? It's retail work. You'll have moments when it's slow, so you start to work on tasks, and then, out of nowhere, everyone comes in to buy everything.  But I really enjoyed working there. Great people."
good,I learned new skills and a day working would always be busy because of the things going on and trying to satisfy the customers. The atmosphere working was nice was shown how to do task that i picked up fast to do then could do it on my own.
good,Es un buen lugar para trabajar sin problemas volvería a laborar para Office depot
good,"Everyday was about helping the customers, and that taught me the value of customer service"
good,"A typical day for me at work consists of taking print orders. Some of which I do on the spot and others we do over the period of the day if not a few days depending on the type of job. I also assist customers on the sales floor with technology, supplies, or furniture needs. My co-workers are great to work with and make the job all the better throughout the day. My managers are great at what they do and are great at teaching new skills. I have learned how to hone my multitasking skills while managing our copy and print center."
good,"Friendly office environment to work. Management is supportive and listen to your ideas and give you space to work towards that. However, company is going through a downfall and you would see lot of layoffs recently."
good,"As a cashier and copy and print specialist I mostly help customers with checkouts and help them make and customize their own stamps or business cards. The hardest part of working here is to fix and organize the store as it can be very messy at the end of day. But I learned that if you enjoyed helping others, working with great people and the job position that you are in then no matter how difficult sometimes it can be, in the end it is all worth it. I love working here and the part that I enjoy the most is working with my co-employees. They are wonderful hard working people who was always there to support and give me great advice."

good,OfficeMax was a very productvie and learning place for me. I enjoyed working with the people and also the management and staff
good,"Had a great flow of business customers looking for products for their home office or work office."
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar, solo que se sacrifica demasiado tiempo, en general buena empresa."
good,I work in on of the busiest areas in the store. Anytime I need help my fellow co-workers would be there to help me. I have made life-long friendships with people I have come to know. The only negative I have about this place is that the corporate part of the company is not the best. It seems like things they have us do is chosen by someone who has not worked a day in their life at an actual store.
good,"Es un muy buen lugar para laborar, brinda prestaciones superiores a las de la ley. El ambiente laboral es agradable. Buena distribución de las cargas de trabajo. Capacitación y aprendizaje constante para llevar a cabo sus metas."
good,"Unless you are a school supply geek/ computer geek i wouldnt recommend working here, job was pretty dull.. managment was very nice and understanding."
good,"Agradable todos los días de trabajo, aprendí a trabajar bajo presión pues durante la temporada de regreso a clases hay demasiados clientes, así que hay que atender a todos de forma rápida y eficiente para lograr un buen servicio, las personas que se encuentran laborando ahí son muy agradables."
good,"All the coworkers here are friendly people, simple and enjoyable retail work with hilarious managment, it was a job i looked forward to going to regardless of what time it was."
good,"You will learn a lot in this job. Copy and print, stocking and so on! The environment was always a good, happy place. The managers were great! The coworkers were all always so nice and easy to get along with! It was like a family working together. Most of all the customers were very nice as well!"
good,"Office Max was a fast pace team based culture. Time went by fast and you could depend on each other. We worked nights picking,sorting and loading trucks. It was healthy work"
good,It has been a good working experience working at OfficeMax. It has provided great opportunity to work with customers and make them highly satisfied. Often it gets busy but teamwork is great. Not the best staff when it comes to punctuality but overall good.
good,"When I started with Office Depot, the closest thing I ever had to a job was a Party City seasonal worker...but the manager gave me a chance right off the bat."
good,The atmosphere is nice to work in and the co-workers are good people. The management is understanding of other obligations outside of the company. I myself am an enrolled college student and the management works around my schedule very well to make sure I still get the hours I need.
good,Loved working here before the OfficeDepot Merger. The company has gone downhill and it's sad to see. I have been working here for four years.
good,The staff is fantastic and very motivational. The spiff program is also a very nice bonus to add to your paycheck every 2 weeks!

good,"I had the opportunity to manage and train our team. I had alot of responsibility and challenges. I LOVED that. I was the go to guy when things had to get done. I have alot of respect for the entire team that we all built. We faced challenges that were difficult. It challenged my management style, and gave me alot of freedom to make tough decisions. I like the responsibility and pressure. I have a ton of respect for all of them. When I left Shopko to go to work for Office Depot, I had some employees follow me, It was humbling. Treat your team like family, and you get awesome results."
good,"Depending on your department, the responsibilities vary, but for the most part it's easy register duty and helping customers in a polite manner. For a starting job, it's not bad. You will learn to handle money, use a register and assist customers every day. The work hours are flexible and the managers are understanding, along with the associates that enjoy their jobs. I would say the hardest part of the job is keeping up with the amount of customers that will need help. But good communication and team work is essential in the job."
good,"-Assisted co-workers"
good,"I've been an IT engineer working with tech and computers for several years and am extremely overqualified to work here, so I was hired within a few days after applying online. The interview went extremely quick and I was asked very few questions. The management was extremely good about working around my other job schedule and had no problems giving me days off if I need them. On my first two days of work I had to watch 8 hours of training videos that didn't apply to anything I would be doing, but they were mandatory so I didn't complain. I'll watch boring 10 year old videos and get paid, sure. After the video training was complete I had to shadow a sales consultant for a couple days and learn everything. After that I was on my own doing tech services and selling computers and anything in the tech area."
good,"Aprendi a convivir, con compañeros de trabajo aprendi a trabajar en equipo pues en realidad no me habia tocado estar en ninguna empresa como estas, la verdad me encanto lo que aprendi y me gustaria en algun momemto encontrar un equipo de trabajo parecido a este."

But also had ten years experience in the retail store so would be Manager on duty as needed. Trained new associates when required, helped open and close new stores, Trained New outside sales people for the sales force. When they closed in Canada I had 881 active ordering customers who had remained as such for over 18 years in some cases."
good,I am a manager and I mostly deal with customer issues. I've only worked there for 7 months and was promoted from logistics to Customer Experience Manager. I've learned so much since being hired. Everyone I work with is friendly. The hardest part of my job is satisfying a customer that has had a bad shopping experience. I like to make people happy and every now and then it's just not possible. But it is very rewarding when I can put a smile on a customer's face and know that they will come back to see me again.
good,fast paced work with ability to meet new challenges. Co-workers are dedicated and excellent people.

good,"Everyone helps each other. Great environment to work at. Management don't have a problem with training people and that's a plus. Using the conveyor belt to load, makes it easy."
good,"Freight and logistics process in the morning."
good,"Due to issues with the corporate decision to close my store, I am sad to have to leave a great family at Office Depot.  The management and the fellow co-workers have been a wonderful family to get to know.  "

good,My work involves listening to the customer's needs and what they are trying to accomplish. Then helping them find what satisfies those needs and go above their expectations while creating their individual solution
good,"A typical day at work would involve the employees making sure that the customers who walked in were greeted and that they found exactly what they were looking for by the helping of friendly associates. I learned how to sell items to customers by showing them the difference in price and quality of the product they were seeking. The job was not a difficult one, so I would say the hardest part of the job was during back to school season, when the store would be very packed with a lot of customers to attend to. The management was great and my co-workers were awesome!"
good,"I really like my job. Its a very fast paced work place with a lot of deadlines. You work with a team and as long as the communication between you and other workers are good then everything will be fine. "
good,Diligently supervised daily review of warehouse operation with two assistants.
good,On a typical day at work i would clock in and get as much of the price changes as I can before opening the store. When the store opened I would jump on the register until it was my time to go home.

good,I enjoyed the customer service experience I gained from Office Depot
good,A typical day of work at Office Depot is normally busy and fast pace. you learn a lot about technical items great customer service and hard work ethic. The co-workers are very open and accepting and willing to work with you on anything you need help on. The hardest part of the day is the shift change when workers would not come in on time and making up for lost time. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with the friendly customer and assisting them with their needs.
good,"I worked in the back mostly re-stocking, confirming, and maintaining inventory. Management was well informed, and a visual part of the team. My co-workers were constantly helping customers or assisting each other in any/all tasks for the day. I enjoyed helping everyone and accomplishing the goals I and my team lead had set for myself that day."
good,If anything it ante up my technology skills. It was alright I guess. I am just being honest
good,aprendes a ser servicial con los cliente por que el lema de office depot es sin el cliete office depot no es nada

The hr person  dose not like men you can find her in a gentlemen's club on her days off and she is not pro family she will only help out women this women is a sexist and has screwed me out of pay and a job No one likes her in the whole company pass out a survey you will found out fire her!
good,temp job; work every day on a assembly line; great hours; great place to work; i enjoyed working there as a temp; i would go back if they would hire me permanent;
good,OfficeMax alone was great! They cared about the employees and the customers! Great place to work. Together with Office Depot. the company is going in the wrong direction! they do not care about employees. Its every employee for them selves.
good,"Working the floor mostly.  Greeting customers, and stocking shelves.  The co-workers were very friendly and management was as well.  The hardest part of the job was leaving.  I did enjoy this workplace"
good,"This postion I liked, There was no room for advancement. I enjoyed our customers here alot. This was a fun position."
good,"It was a good company for working with college students. The busiest times are the summer. They also worked with my availability changes each term. Lots of management turnover, 5 in 2.5 years. The last manager did not like me from the get go and informed me as such. So terminated short time after they began."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, sin embargo el seguimiento o capacitación por parte del regional de servicios empresariales es pésimo, prepotente y capataz. Deja a sus ejecutivos a la autocapacitacion, se molesta cuando se le hacen preguntas para el obvias.  La empresa es noble y da muchos beneficios, desafortunadamente algunos mandos carecen de la sensibilidad y responsabilidad que representa la empresa."
good,"Management isn't the best here. I do enjoy doing what I do. But after being with the company so many years on and off, I don't feel I am appreciated at all. And I don't get the benefits I deserve. I have spoken on and off with all different mangers that have come through here about this situation. None have followed through. I haven't even gotten a pay raise that we are suppose to get yearly."
good,"Keeping track of inventory"
good,Great management and employees always had a smile onthere face everyday at work everyone got along and had a good day
good,taking phone orders for companies and making sure the order is processed the next day for delivery
good,"Pagos a tiempo en via nomina, prestaciones, comedor y vales"
good,It was a decent job. I was able to learn costumer services and ti=o grow as a sales person. It was nice to organize the products how I wanted to organize it. It was a little bit brutal to wake up in the mornings to put all the products out on the shelves and I hated with all my passion inventory.
good,"Job is easy to do, management team doesn't communicate with their peers. its a good culture but no one follows it. hardest part of the job are the hours."
good,"I would start my morning at 7am.Open the delivery put all the products on their places. Make a place for the products that are for put-away after that 12 o'clock the Office Depot time. We would go to all the customers and ask them what can we do for them sometimes we will help them find a product sometimes we will give information about the products and all the benefits that they can get in order to buy the products for example sometime I will be in laptops department so I would sell laptops, Protected Plans, Batteries, Anti-virus and all the laptop related staff. Once a week i would also work in fixing department where we would fix Laptops, PC and Printers we also had a UPS service and Printing department. We would also sell all the office equipment and furniture. Twice a week i would work as a cashier and we would also set goals and work hard on achieving them. In free time we would move furniture, put the deliveries in their places, Help customers with their furniture moving"
good,The daily task to assist a customer with their concerns on a face to face basis crated a trust with you and the customer that keeps them as a repetitive client. Building a business relationship with customers from all walks; day to day customers to small/franchase business owners.
good,"Great place to work, good management and great schedules, awesome place to work part time with commission opportunity. Wish they didn't close their NE store would still work for them."
good,I assist many customers in the Copy & Print Department a day. My typical work day is very busy with customer jobs and just upkeep of the department. Eventhough it may be busy other managers are willing to come over and give a helping hand.

I learned about computers from the tech supervisor, I learned how to make a beautiful print from the print center supervisor, I learned how to run the registers, printers, build furniture and more from the store manager. I absolutely loved my time here. The management team was always extremely helpful and were always extremely pleasant. There was a lot of cross-training which was great as that is how you get promoted. The hardest part of the job was selling computers and services, and up-selling services and warranties on both technology and furniture. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team. Everyone got along great, even if they had a disagreement. The team was always extremely pleasant no matter what the situation was. Everyone was trained very well, so there was very rarely a time when anyone could say ""I don't know how to do this."""
good,"It took adjusting but for a first job they trained well, were very understanding, and the supervisors were pretty cool. When i worked there(which was before the merge) they did not allow me many hours and the schedule was never consistent but those would be my only complaints. The schedule almost always was on time when it was posted."
good,opportunity for learning. Customer interaction. playing with new products. hardest part of the job is that there is not enough training and that makes it hard for one that has been there long because there is hardly time to train new people. co-workers are nice and fun to work with. management is harder on females.
good,"as a matter of fact ,they still want me back. it started with me coming in and filling in for whoever called in sick.management were new so they depended on me but nobody wanted me full time.my co workers respected the fact that they all went through me and i trained them.."

good,"Pros:  Good benefits, opportunity for advancement, work environment promotes teamwork.  There is a chance for associates to make commission."
good,"I enjoyed working in the impress department of Office Max, but felt that the employees in that department were expected to learn too much about the technology side of the store when our focus should have been more on the production and promotion of our own department. We had very few employees in our department compared to the other side of the store that was much more well capable of  handling that side of the store."

I was always on time and early for my shift and didn't take long on the commute. The employee discount was pretty good on the products that we carried in the store.  Didn't like the only way that you qualified for the benefits were if you Full Time and there , you either had to be Supervisory or Management, I thought that was unfair . I also think that the way the assessments were created is too complex and too complicated. I think other things need to be factored in like loyalty and punctuality and not let the major factor it is based on is knowlege and experience."

Management encourages direct dialog and takes the time for individual weekly meetings to reset and redirect to best support the organizations requirements.

It can get a little hectic if you are short handed or working alone during heavy traffic periods, but all in all I really love working in this department.  The management team we have at my store is phenomenal!  I worked here over a year and a half, before working my way up to print supervisor, and joining the management staff.

good,I get along with everyone at my store the boss is very chill and can work with your schedule which I like as a college student. I worked cashier but wished there were more cashiers as usually it is only me and i'm dealing with more than i can handle and other associates will be too busy to help.
good,I had this job while I was a student at the local college. I learned so much from working in the copy and print department. I loved the coworkers and customers.
good,Los supervisores y gerentes muy bien capacitados con un buen trato a sus empleados colaborando como un buen equipo.

There was very little overtime and no weekend work.
good,I worked cashier and inventory stock. Though you can gain some clerical and secretarial skills working the print desk. Customer service skills is a must have.

good,"Call center with a diverse group, I enjoyed our group meetings and we had great management.  This company was ahead of its time with tools and resources to provide great customer service."
good,muy buena empresa recomendable para trabajar buen sueldo buenas prestaciones
good,position varied day to day and hour to hour.  Be extremely busy one minute and completely dead the next minute. But allowed me to use my artistic skills and my computer skills at the same time.
good,Being a packer at Office Depot was productive. Time did go by fast because we were always busy but you will definitely get slammed with work because packing is the last step but with good coworkers and a good pace everything will be fine and you will enjoy your job there.
good,I have enjoyed my time with this company. This is the best company that I have worked for so far. I would definitely recommend that any individual should apply here.
good,There is a lack of work life balance. Days run an average of 12 hours. Culture is great and we have a great Team. I have learned about Lean and process improvement. Manage a Tea of 30 direct reports and several indirect reports.
good,Great place for an entry level job. Given a lot of opportunities for independent work. Good way to grow your confidence in the work place. Management gave great feedback and support.
good,With continual contraction by mega sellers such as Amazon Office Depot with struggle to maintain marketshare and this pressue will be placed upon the selling assets
good,"Es un ambiente bueno de trabajo, pero lo recomendaría mas para estudiantes que para personas mayores, ya que no dan muchas horas de trabajo."
good,I help customers with electronic and office needs. I repaired computers and learned diagnostics.  The management had your back and the culture was that of family.  Hardest part of job was getting customers to explain what it was they really needed. Best part of my job was my Customers and my associates
good,"Awesome place to work at , zero stress environment with the nicest customers on earth , every minute are enjoyable time with only one goal in mind : take care of customers"
good,"Always gotta finished what you start from, most of the associate jumps around looking for the easy stuff to do it will always come back at you, always communicate with your team if you need help, that will be TEAMWORK"

good,"A typical day would consist of, customer service, cashier & copy and print associate. I learned a lot about different stock items, furniture, school supplies etc. When it came down to management, they were great at times, other times were a little challenging but still got thru it. What i enjoyed most about this job was dealing with the customers, and the hardest part of the job was probably back to school season."

good,My co workers were great and work atmosphere was incredible. Under different management now I've heard so I'm not sure how it is now. Overall it was a good place to work
good,"As an associate it is a slow environment. The pay is minimum wage ergo not the best. This is a good job for a high school person who does not need a great income. Even for a retiree it is not sufficient. The management team is great, very friendly, easy going. Not stressful at all. There is nothing hard about working here. The best part are the people. However for a retail job the benefits after a year are good."
good,"I liked the interaction i experienced with customers, while I assisted them with their prints and graphic design edits."
good,The job for office depot was outstanding working enviorment. We basically worked on a steady driven work force line. I had experience with wrapping and load also with a pallet jack.
good,My work experience with this company was exceptional.  The supervisors really were helpful and wanted you to succeed.  Showed appreciation for the employees.  Workers were given an opportunity for advancement.
good,"Great place to work. The only reason why I left was that my schedule had changed, and I could no longer work nights or weekends, and the remaining openings all called for weekend availability. Hy-vee only promotes from within, meaning that if you want to move up into a corporate position, they have programs available to teach you what you need TO MOVE UP."
good,I had to pick cases on a pallet jack using a pallet and staging it in a lane to be processed and wrapped. it was physical work but they showed how to work smart rather than hard.
good,"Office depot is laid back and a good place to work. If you are a college student, often times they will work with your school schedule. I would work for office depot again in a heartbeat."
good,"I work part time, so I get the bulk of my hours on weekends. My typical workday consist of putting out the sales tags and then assisting with unloading freight. I flex up on that register and copy and print when needed also. I've learned team work from a different perspective."
good,I didn't have a bad time working with OfficeMax. This store job is more for teenagers that's trying to save a little money . The atmosphere is pretty much laid back.
good,aprendi mucho sobre el servicio al cliente y a balancear el trabajo y la vida personal.
good,"The job changed on a regular basis, which I really enjoyed.  The most important thing I learned here and was able to continue to develop was relationships."
good,"While working with Office Depot I got to work on computers and fix them for viruses. Also got to do some front end cleaning and cashiering, also got to work in the photo lab."
good,I help with the remodeling of the store. Worked 3rd shift and overnight stocking. Was able to use a forklift and help customers find product and assist with putting the customer purchase in the car.
good,"Store Management gets paid a great rate, but is required to work long hours and there is different standards for every manager. If you thrive on being the best you are held too a higher standard then your peer who doesn't like their job and wants to barely get by with the minimum. In my 11 year tenure with the company I saw maybe 5 store managers let go due too poor performance, while there are still an abundant of managers who fail to meet goals or keep standards too the minimum expectations. Having the corporate headquarters in our backyard as well also proved too be subjective too what a manager had too do compared to other managers in the company who were the same title and pay. Little advancement as the company doesn't hold too one expectation and keeps the bad managers, while the good managers leave for better opportunities and they keep getting looked over for job promotions due to the fact the company can't replace them in their current position."
good,"At office max i would be behind the register to check people out with the items they need, often times i would be on the sales floor selling people and informing them of the items they were looking foor."
good,I worked different shifts that either ended with me leaving before closing or me leaving 30 minutes after closing. I was a cashier there and would ring people out when they were ready. I answered the phone when no one was available to answer it. I either answered their questions or transferred them to print services or the tech bench depending on what information they were looking for. usually it was busy during 12 in the afternoon as well as around 4 in the afternoon. Other than that it would be very slow with no customers or very little amount of customers. The coworkers were nice and easy to get along with. There wasn't any tension between coworkers. I didn't exactly like closing the store because it's a big store and I would have to go through every section and make sure it was spotless and products were in the right spot. I usually liked the morning shift where I opened.
good,"gente joven"

On a regular day we would all help eachother out to get something done so it was pretty cool. We was well organized and kept everything neat. The most enjoyable part of my day would be helping the customers because most of them were always nice and they would be even happier when i help them find what they need. I have learned how to communicate and make a customer's day by showing them how my attitude is and that i cared, i was always happy and greeted the customers with a big smile. By far the hardest part was dealing with customers that were impatient. But i've learned how to manage that."
good,"I didn't work here long, but I enjoyed the time and experience that is used for later jobs. For a retail job, I learned a great deal about technology and how it can make our lives better."

good,A typical day working there was kind of like working for a customer care center because I was working on the register. What I've learned is how to take care of a customer over the phone and face the items on the shelves. The management was pretty hands on when it came to training and so were my co-workers.

good,"Always making sure everything is being done, or making sure there is always something to do, and great place to meet new people, more of a family than just co workers."
good,"Well you start off saying area you will be in and what your sales goal for the day is. Then you step on the floor and assist costumers on what items would work best for them or things you would recommend to go with an item (up-sale) to make the item more pleasurable to use. After that we go ahead and announce on radios that we carry what we have sold and then we hear feed back from our managers seeing if we did well approaching and handling the customer. As each day goes by you learn more and more about items in the store, so knowing location of very small items is probably the hardest part, especially when you're closing the store and don't work in the department you're putting the item in, but the best part of it is that you work together as a team and create a family."

good,"Ive learned how to engage more with different personalities while working for Office Depot. The management is great. I love my co workers because everyone has their own personality.The hardest part of working for OD is dealing with Irate customers, but when youve been trained or posess the talent to communicate with others in a stressful environment it becomes very easy.

I have to manage, coach, train, concil and mentor the members of my team to ensure they are accomplishing everything we need to do to provide the best customer service. The hardest part of the job is not always having enough time to accomplish everything that needs to be done and figuring out ways to accomplish those goals while trying to maintain the level of customer service expected from Office Depot.

good,"great place to work, with great benefits but need more than one person to handle workload"
good,"Employees enjoyed coming to work, we all got along very well and tasks were delegated. My store manager worked very well with my school schedule and gave me around 25-30 hours a week while also attending classes at Texas Tech University. If we ever had any questions or needed anything specific it was very easy for us to talk with one of the managers."
good,"Identify new prospects, sell and implement office supply products and solutions to small and medium size businesses"
good,I held a couple of positions with OfficeMax back before the merge of OfficeMax and Office Depot. I trained and managed many good people and had fantastic training and benefits myself while attending college. It may be stressful but it had given me the skills to succeed now.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time with Office Max. We became very understaffed right before I left and a lot more work than usual was dumped upon me, so I became irritated and left."
good,"Dejaban trabajar libre si ya se sabia que hacer, aprendí desde administrar, garantías, pedidos, inventarios, cíclicos, conteos rápidos, evaluar personal."
good,Its a good job. Not much else to say except that.  Management is all guys though even though the rest of the staff is mainly females. I went for the open position and they hired an outside guy.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, buen aprendizaje pero pocas posibilidades de subir de puesto"
good,buena empresa para laborar excelente trato de parte de los trabajadores
good,Good place to work was fun to work here and learn valuable skills for my future job role. 
good,"Processing Orders, Loading/Unloading Trucks."
good,"I have no reserves about working for Office Depot; it was educational, and enriching work.  It was an opportunity to build and network with every business in the community.  As retail is, the work as a Store Manager was plentiful, but with the right management team, that work is balanced."
good,Great place to work at. Location is great spot for very one to shop at but parking is kind of hard to find for customers. Since we are located downtown boise.
good,Great place to work. Not too fast paced of a job but also not slow and boring. Good people and environment. Flexible hours. Management could us a tune up but overall a steady job with decent pay.

I liked everyone,got along well, I will miss it very much."
good,"Volvo is the best. Iearned how to spread my knowledge on selling parts. "
good,"Plenty would happen and things were always getting done, from filing project folders we did with customers to helping out the cashiers when the line got full. My department Copy&Print did plenty to provide and assist customers in finding the ideal purchase for them. Just because my tittle was Copy&Print associate did not mean I only managed to do one thing, there was plenty of multitasking and going back on forth. While the experience was good it becomes exhausting to take so many tasks at hand with little assistance due to my store being understaffed. Office Depot was good but I crave for a more stable workplace! I learned how to make business cards, file out orders online, edit on photoshop, learn how to use the cashier, and keep inventory check on the supplies we used."
good,"I was a cashier at Office Max, always trying to encourage more sales items to each customer. I helped on the customer service desk and helped customers find the merchandise they came into the store for. Responsible for all cash, credit card receipts, checks and travelers checks and always gave the correct change back to the customers when they paid in cash."
good,Ea una buena empresa pero lastimosamente sus administrativos no estan preparados al cien porciento para ejercer sus labores.
good,although my time was limited with the company - I would still say this was a great learning experience and certainly teaches you how to be a part of an outside sales team.
good,"Es un lugar bueno para laborar, conoces y aprendes de una variedad de cosas y libros, el trabajo en equipo es muy fomentado, la parte mas dificil del trabajo son los dias de inventrio pues como es una tienda de articulos de papeleria es algo complicado."
good,On a normal day of work all there was to do is help and check out customers. We would also keep the store clean and straight.

good,"Office Depot is a perfect place to begin learning basic working skills and essential social skills.

I developed and maintained a pipeline report with global accounts, national accounts and purchasing plans. I provided leadership and assisted in training and development of new and other sales associates."

good,"I love working at Office Depot. Each day bring new challenges and contact with new people. I am in charge of making copies, ordering business forms/office paperwork, assisting customers in any printing and cashing out customers. I enjoy my coworkers. Everyone gets along well. The hardest part might be not having full time employment. The best part is the people I work with everyday. They make the job enjoyable."

good,"Es una muy buena empresa,cuenta con muy buenas prestaciones, un sueldo atractivo."
good,"I had great managers and a good core team where everyone worked together to provide customers with a great experience. I was a customer service manager which is one below a assistant manager and was preparing to train to move up to that level when a emergency forced me to move away to another state. I was unable to transfer due to the next Office Depot being five hours away.  "
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Office Depot and am sad to have to go, the people I worked with have been some of the best and supportive people I could have wished to spend the last 16 years with."
good,"It was a very slow paced job with not a lot of room to advance, but the managers are wonderful.I would only get about 20 hours per week and that is simply not enough."
good,Love my manager and my job.  He is very flexible with life when it happens.   I have never had a job where I actually look. Forward to going every evening.
good,"Much of the job focused on up-selling customers. You will learn overtime how to convince everyone that they need a warranty. Full Time positions require you to work 5 days a week, making a work/life balance hard to achieve."
good,The managers are all amazing. The training is very extensive and beneficial. They are willing to work around your schedule and its easy to get time off approved.
good,You were able to work in different departments in the store and learn many different job skills. Store manager was very easy to get along with and would teach you different skills .

good,"good job for students or part timers"
good,I learned a lot about office supplies during my employment at OfficeMax.  Small office business to large or organizations need supplies as well as ordered products.
good,"Now closed down but it was a good store. definitely old, but management was good. Got very busy near the end of the store's life due to sales for closing down."
good,"Everyone was a team player. Management very helpful at times. i en"
good,I was a customer service rep here for 2 years. I needed to get a full time job closer to my education major. It was a wonderful enviornment to be in! I would not mind going back for a part time job
good,"There is so much work to do in that corporate, which ends up becoming an excellent labor school, here I learned about general finance, purchases, sales, marketing, advertising, telemarketing and even management of business and management, is a fairly comprehensive company that was pleased to let me study and apply my knowledge without limitations."
good,Fast paced and always had regulars. Co workers made it fun when there was free time. Managers were amazing to work with as they always had open door policy
good,"Working as a sales associate has taught me so much about how we sell as a department and how we handle with care. As for being a cashier I have advanced my abilities with multi-tasking, and opening and closing the register."
good,You must be comfortable with people if you want to be successful in this type of environment. Can be a good place to work but you just have to apply yourself and do the work.
good,"I had the greatest experience at Office Depot. I started as a cashier and worked my way into the copy and print department. I learned how to work with people in the most difficult times. Having to finalize multiple orders within time frames taught me how to be patient not just with customers but also with my co-workers and myself. If any of us were short on time, we always lend a helping hand; rather risking the customer being angry at any of us or the company. Our manager seemed to take their job personal. What I mean by that is she made sure no matter what we were equipped and knowledgeable to take care of each customer. The hardest part of my job was accepting the fact that their was no hard part. The most enjoyable part of my job was basically just doing my job to the fullest."
good,"Working at Office Depot was a fun and enjoyable place to work. I was able to learn about many of the products that the store had to offer, learn about the latest Microsoft Software programs and interact with customers on a daily basis."
good,"really good place to work, lovely staff members, i learned how to sell and train, and teaching new skills to the customer service department was extremely satisfying"
good,"Love this place.  "
good,"There was never a day that went by where the job was slow.  Great hours, Monday through Friday.  Management, co-workers, and customers friendly and respectful."
good,"Great job for young students trying to get through school. Flexible schedules. Very friendly staff and atmosphere. Implementing far too many changes at once . Micromanagement with DSM visits monthly, unannounced"
good,"Good entry level job although not all employees have the same skills so work can be tough to manage by yourself. 401k, managers bend over backwards to make your schedule the way you want it. "
good,"I enjoyed this job for the open solitude. You're never truly alone, always able to gain assistance and able to mute the call and breathe on disgruntled customers."
good,if you move up within the company the pay for mangers isn't worth all the work. The boss I work for is great but if the District Manager comes in he bowls everyone over by telling them they are doing their jobs wrong even though we follow our jobs to the letter.
good,"It was tough but, my co-workers where amazing and helped a lot when I needed help. Manager and supervisors included. Great job opportunity. I learned about customer service and how to work with some of the machines and products used in the store. A typical day would be opening store at 8 people already waiting outside, Checking the registry for any jobs to be done and or finished, taking messages, turning on the machines and helping customers on the floor if they needed help. I enjoy helping them, its fun and you make new friends, or regulars. I had many, some still ask me for help and I no longer work in there and I always recommend an ex coworker I know will take good care of them. Other customers turned into good friends and they still refer people to me. haha it's great. It was a really good experience."
good,"The opening crew I worked with were very cohesive. It was not a specific roster, but the attitude was adopted by any coming into the unit. Positive energy, smiles, and a willingness to take a hand and help anyone with any task was a requirement. This was very contagious. I learned how easy it was to teach this by example without having to say a word. Those that isolated themselves were often spoken to by others in the crew and I never needed to use my position to correct behavior. Management came to rely on decisions I made and the organizational skills used to keep the stock under control in the backroom. My co-workers were usually younger and viewed me as a fatherly figure. This was a bit funny at first, but I got used to it. It became the best part of the job. The hardest was watching the young make the mistakes they must make in life sometimes to learn. However, you can't step outside of work and step into a parent's role."
good,"Great company, lots of integrity in there processes and promote hard work and a customer service centered sales culture."
good,I was responsible for keeping merchandise on shelves.  I enjoyed all the new technology and people I worked with.  The extreme lack of advancement is what caused me to leave.
good,"Hourly Managers, they support unrealistic staff expectations, restructured have actually harmed the company. Overall they are ok for a new person trying to make it in retail."
good,Office Depot is not for the slow and weary. You have to continue to flow with the changes that occur each week and be adaptable to the services needed for customers.
good,Learned many business concepts in practice. The co-workers are friendly and caring. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers selling PCs and tablets as well as repairing their old PCs.
good,"I gained valuable experience in team work by working alongside a variety of co-workers. I was able to learn how to assist in managing a store whenever the store manager needed assistance, and someone to take the mantle. Amazing experience was cultivated when I was working in the business services department where a co-worker and I would create and help manage portfolios for business's that needed them made with information that they provided. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet  continuously walking/running for 9 to 11 hours with only a 30 minute break where I could sit down. The most wonderful times though were being able to network and gain new knowledge every single day."
good,It's great. I love my job and the people that work there. They're very flexible being that I'm in college. We receive a yearly raise. The co-workers make the day go by so much faster. It's a complete joy to work there
good,A typical day of work consist of provided good customer service to guest in the store. while their I learned Basic computer tech skills and knowledge of computers and tablet. Management was real nice always willing to help. Got along great with co-workers. The hardest part of my job was trying to solve a computer problem. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning about computers and working with customers.
good,"J'ai eu l'occasion de me familiariser avec la culture francaise,"
good,Great place to work if the management is all on one page. Co workers become good friends and the job load isnt too over bearing.
good,"In the department I worked in my senior co workers would help in training along with my manager."
good,"A typical day at work includes, greeting and assisting customers, and floor supervision."
good,"I like the way it works, it works so dynamic and have learned many things and I've grown as a person in the area of work and personal"
good,"Great staff and customers, great opportunity to learn interesting positions."
good,"Lot of training, very understanding, great work enviroment."
good,I enjoy working at Office Depot it has been a great learning experience to learn more about technology and other office items as well. The managers are very understanding and cool people to work with and it's a very friendly and productive company to work for I love how their is alot of team work involved to get the job done. 
good,Great job with mediocre benefits. Has a great staff always willing to help each other in a team oriented atmosphere
good,"Office Depot is like most other retail jobs. Everyday is a different day, things are never the same when it comes to working with the public."
good,This is a somewhat busy place to work and there is opportunity to cross train in other departments to be able to maintain hours promised. The pay was not the greatest but the environment more than compensated for it.
good,"Fun enviroment, great people, excellent ethics and foundation to work for."
good,I enjoyed this place. I had great coworkers and managers. Going to work everyday just didn't seem like work
good,"Strenuous, fast paced work , nice co workers, management was okay, best past of the job was the pay, worse was not being able to get all 40 hours"
good,Part-time job I had while in school for drafting and design. Worked as a computer tech and learned alot about sales.
good,"Key to success is listening, listen to customers and managers"
good,When I worked for the company everyone was so happy fun to be around especially with it being my first job when I move to the area customer and co workers were very welcoming
good,"Great getting to know others, workplace and location are decent. Management were not so bad could have had more balance with work and family. Would like to have had a shorter end time."
good,Fast fun workplace with little supervision of your job .safe environment with Friendly coworkers and customers. Requires strength and knowledge of handling furniture.
good,"I have enjoyed my time working for Office Depot, it has been difficult but definitely a good skill i have mastered working there. I would recommend this job to anyone competent enough and looking."
good,I worked here as a student. Management was flexible with my schedule. I was lucky enough to really enjoy working with my coworkers and managers. Not too difficult of a job just tedious and repetitive just like working at any other store.
good,"Management work as intended. "
good,I loved my job but eventually I needed a more stable financially secure career path and I was not sure if that was it. I enjoyed the customers and working stock.
good,Great job but wages need to be raised as well as opportunity to grow. I'd like to stay with the company if I had room to advance on my position. I like the 401k plan as well.
good,I enjoyed both working for and with the company to be one of the best in the Nation.  My work day was busy and diverse.  The are very Team oriented and management is very supportive and offers great feedback on your performance and how you handle customer's issues.  Helping customers is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,A fun laid back place to work. It has a technology department where they do minor repairs to computer hardware and software. They're also sales incentives and bonuses. A great place for someone seeking a degree in a computer science.
good,"Overall, it was a fun and great place to work. Management was great. Employees had the opportunity to advance in the company. It’s unfortunate the office closed out because it was an awesome place of employment."
good,"Picking orders from the list placing it in the box."
good,Fun environment. Love to make a connection with the client to make sure they have the right product. Everyone is friendly and respectful.  I feel welcome whenever I walk in.
good,"This company is called Office Depot Ltd and is in Tanzania (East Africa)"
good,"Great people to work with at store level but could be hard work if you don't have a good work ethic or great customer services! You spend your days competing with up and coming new companies, price matching and convincing customers why their products/stores are still good!. Yes this is typical in retail but harder when you work in a office supply store that seems to be more and more of a dying breed, for a stand alone office supply only type of store."
good,only thing bad that i can see so far is the closing of alot of stores in the jersey and new york area. that stops growth with the employees. the management team in the stores though do try to put as much money as they can in our pockets
good,"Great place to work but challenging environment and the company diversifies into a lot of different areas away from office supplies. "
good,"Typical day at work includes readying team for delivery through efficient dispatch and pre delivery requirements."
good,Oits a nice occupation/environment to work part-time or temporary at if you go to high school of college during school. Great start for anyone who wants to get into the retail industry and pick up some quick retail business lessons.
good,"I picked up a part time job to afford a new desktop computer over the summer and it was a ""part time"" job that I was working 39 hours a week. That sounds like a full time job to me. If you want the hours, this is for you. I'm a college graduate and my time is worth way more than 8.50/hr I just wanted some side money not a huge commitment and they would not cut my hours back."
good,"Loved working for OD/OM not sure if it was the company or the location I was at, but if the money matched the amount of work we do in the print center, I would have stayed! FAMILY AND FUN ENVIRONMENT, AMAZING PEOPLE TO WORK WITH AS WELL!"
good,"It was my first job, so to be honest I really can't complain and don't have much to compare it to. It was a pretty laid back, but fast paced job, I loved my coworkers - well, at least most (; But it was an awesome first job."
good,I learned a lot from working at OD. The people I worked with made my job exciting and fun.  Most of my negative experiences there were from customers.
good,"Everyone is responsible for everything so expect to be cross trained. Most of the work day is either stocking, helping customers, or on the register. Everyday is routine and is predictable. You have to take initiative, their wont be a babysitter unless your work ethic calls for one. Really good job for any technology fans or graphic designers. The busiest positions are either working in the print department or stock associate. Otherwise the co-workers are sweet and understanding folk."
good,setting up skids for sorting boxes to go to their locations i learned about sorting products for different companies management was pretty fair and outgoing. the culture of the workplace was fair but different than i had ever been around but nice.the hardest part of the job was nothing.i really enjoyed everything about the job.
good,"i loved working at office max. however, if i didnt smile while on shift my managers would harrass me about it. this job is best for bubbley people. otherwise a great job."
good,If you enjoy a fun atmosphere revolved around a common work ethic then Office Depot is the place for you. All employees made sure their job was done and customers satisfied while also knowing how to enjoy the work.
good,"i just  go to work to take care of my family, and to secure to well being of my children. i feel office depot has helped me in a way to solidify my relevence in society by giving me a chance to interact with people of all walks of life. honestly its no hard parts about a job if you're not afraid to ask for help."
good,stressful with the supervisor that we have at the moment . Lack of cooperation with one of my teammates. The job is really easy but the supervisor make it hard for us
good,The job was a all around good job. Just could have been a better pay with what the employees had to deal with on a regular basis......................
good,The workplace culture was very friendly.  We all worked together as a team to help customers and keep the store clean and stocked.  Even during stressful times working together kept the store running smoothly.
good,great company with opportunities for advancement.  Management was hands on and corporate was always supportive. Great benefits and wonderful corporate team.
good,me agrada el ambiente de trabajo mas tube prioridades que no me dejaban cumplir con tal

good,"I would truly approve of this job to young people , just starting off after high school, I wouldn't suggest that people who have children and have very serious bills to make this job their main source of income."
good,"Pues la empresa como tal esta bien horarios flexibles, pero en cuestion de bonos fallaron."
good,"a typical day at work was fun and productive, i learned the proper way to pack and pick items. The hardest part of my job was when i first started because i didn't know anything about picking and packing. The most enjoyable part about the job was the enviroment it was very friendly"

good,It was a very fun place to work at alot of great co workers that helped me while I was in training management was unstable though worked for office Max for almost a year and I had three managers in the span of 7 months
good,Office depot is a good job for teens who are coming in to to the summer looking for a seasonal position or for young adults coming straight out of high school. Its unique and gives each person there own way to find themselves.
good,Pues una empresa 100% confiable para trabajar ya que es algo nuevo

good,"I learned so much stuff that I still use today. Formatting and printing are the unsung backbone of graphic design. I would have never set down my paintbrush and pens, and started doing graphic work, if id never worked at office max."
good,"Una de las empresas que para mi gusto es de las mas enfocadas a a la atención del cliente desde que llega a la sucursal se te atiende con un cordial saludo y asistiendo de forma personalizada a cada uno de los clientes, tomando en cuenta que tiene departamento de ventas empresariales se trata de tomar sus pedidos con rapidez y con la misma calidad como si estuvieran en tienda y del mismo modo para su entrega."

I learned a lot of things working there in sales and print services. Management is great they are always understanding and don't put you down. Enjoyable part of the job is you don't feel like you're working and you feel like part of a family.
good,"Working here was amazing. I got along with everyone and management was understanding and approachable. My location was short on staff so my hours were crazy did not have much time for myself, but I am not complaining. Management and employees got along. Management at this location taught me everything i can learn to exceed and move up from my starting position, unfortunately corporate shut down our location. Overall, working here was incredible, but in every job you will run into rude and despicable customers."

good,"After being laid off several years ago, DP was the first company to hire me as a contractor, sending me out on a 5-month assignment at an office products company.

good,"Working at Office Depot has taught me a lot about myself and helped me become comfortable with speaking to other people. It has taught me how to manage customers and my job tasks extremely well. The only issue I have with the company is, they don't acknowledge the worth of the people within their company. The raises happen once a year (the day you were hired) and they give you a nickel, sometimes a dime. It's not even worth it in the long run because the taxes taken out from your check negate the raise. They should invest in their employees more."
good,I became a Customer Service Supervisor at the age of 17. They  gave me a chance to grow and learn different responsibility. the management team was very helpful and friendly.
good,"Typical 9-5, hours are flexible, management works with you and there is a family atmosphere."

The culture is laid back and they really do not stress out on the small things, they just want you to find a way to help the customer."
good,le travail d’équipe est agréable et surtout la préparation de commande

good,"It was a great place to work and enjoyed every bit of it. People are friendly  and great work environment  . "
good,"This is a great company that can offer a LOT of good benefits to someone that is a solid worker. If you produce, you will be rewarded handsomely. On the other hand, if you think you will ""go through the motions"" and get a free check, think again. I enjoyed working here and (mostly) regret that I left. The work-life balance can be a challenge at times, but if you earn the respect of management, you will get what ever you need. The hardest part of the job can be actually getting to do the sales part of the job. There is a lot of non-sales tasks that are required. The best part of this job is the flexibility and the benefits."

The hardest part of the job was getting the customer to explain what their needs were for their project. Many times they did not have a clue and needed help getting started, and that made it the most enjoyable part of the day. It is always a good day when you can do a job for a customer who can't do it for themselves."
good,With one of the highest awards for ethical treatment its hard to beat a company like OfficeMax. Since the merger things are odd but all in all a good company.

good,Nice job had good times working here because they paid 12 a hour.
good,"Very lax environment. Good for someone looking for a short term place to work. Not a lot of stress. Most of the day consists of asking customers if they need help and front facing during slack time. Management is nice, however, there is little to no training. There is no type of orientation system in place if you are seeking to learn more. Your learning will be based on whether or not you ask a fellow employee how something works, and it will be up to them whether or not they feel like teaching you."
good,"Cool People, but they are more worried about what customers think than the truth"
good,"Un dia tipico en mi trabajo era llegar, checar la hora de entrada y asistir a las juntas de las mañanas en las cuales se trataban los temas relacionados con la tienda como las ventas. Lo que aprendi en este empleo es la ""pasion por el servicio"" de esta tienda, es admirable y aprendí a hacerlo con gusto. La gerencia estaba bien solo que en esos momentos el gerente que estaba tenia algunas consideraciones con ciertas personas y no daba oportunidad a personas con más tiempo y aptitudes para desempeñar los cargos  en la empresa, por lo que ahi surgia el desanimo de los compañeros, eso era la parte mas dificil de la empresa.Lo que mas me gusto fue casi todo."

good,"Durante los 9 años que estuve en la compañía estuve muy a gusto , aprendí , me desarrolle , crecí profesionalmente"
good,"Office Depot on the corporate side seems to be struggling to find it's place in the modern era of business. Of-which a lot of responsibilities (sometimes new and ever changing) will fall on it's employees to carry it into a new age as things shift. This isn't a bad thing, as Office Depot is due for an overhaul to keep up with competition, it may just need to realize that ""typical business"" for them will consist of more than just relying on employees and newer strategies could do them wonders when they get around to planning how things should look moving forward. However negative as that may sound workplace culture and attitude is great and you will genuinely feel like part of a team! This is as long as you hold up your end of duties to perform and a normal working day will always go smoothly."
good,"A typical day at work for me is usually the cash register. Sometimes and occasionally on the floor and/or doing truck when I worked on those days. I've learned a lot where I've learned to request time off far in advance rather than trying to adjust my scheduling last minute. I've also learned how to find something shown by a manager I've worked with."
good,"I think I got lucky, my location has a great GM and good people to work with. My managers always make sure I get a lunch break or to sit down for 15 minutes and they seem to really care. The only downside of working there is that your hours get cut quite a bit to satisfy corporate."
good,Good Managers all around. Good leadership. Its where I learned a lot of what I know about the workplace today. Good opportunities to advance. Working there showed me the ins and outs of what a successful store looks like and what it takes to get there.

good,"Loved all the years I worked here, everyone is so connected and working towards the same goal of customer satisfaction. The work was all over the place so I never had a exact job which I loved!"
good,When I worked there I really enjoyed everything I did. There was nothing that I couldn't do. Everything was doable and easy to understand. Mostly everything was pretty fast paced but controllable. Customer were really nice and so were the employees.
good,I always had at least a few things to do. My plate was never empty so to speak. I enjoyed this because it seemed like the work day would go by quickly instead of dragging on. I was given a lot of unsupervised time which I used to organize the back room
good,"Loved working here. Customers and employees were always friendly and I had fun in the process. I was a customer service cashier and I would help customers with purchases, returns and exchanges. The people I worked with were always available if I needed help for a customer or if I could help with the departments."
good,"Buen ambiente, pero a la vez pésimo, se puede trabajar"
good,"Loved the fast pace as well as the competitiveness in sales, no day was same as another and something was always needing to be done.  I love continued work."

good,"Excelente lugar para trabajar, no por nada tienen un reconocimiento de Great Place To Work México. "
good,Is very great working there and a very great place to buy  Office and school supplies !  The techs  and the people on the floor working at Office Depot really help out customers who need help.   Copy and print department  also has a very helpful employees that help costumers.
good,"I enjoyed my work days at Office Depot. Management was encouraging of a job well done and training was on the spot. Pay was less than sufficient at $9.50 per hour, but scheduling always gave me sufficient hours"
good,You get to move around the whole store to learn every position available. Fun and a very lax environment. A lot of opportunities to grow. Management is okay.
good,"Principalmente fue mucho de mi agrado , aprendi a desembolverme mas en un ambiente asi, de igual forma me gusta atender a las diversas personas de acuerdo a mis conocimientos y habilidades, nunca tuve ningun problema con atenciones al contrario el gerente Martin me felicitaba previamente por ese empeño mencionado"
good,"I worked with them all through college. Absolutely no complaints. This company allowed me to get my foot in the door for management in other retailers. Upon leaving, I maintained a great relationship with everyone and even plan on using services myself."
good,cash office and sales floor helping customers assisting management and promoting the company guideline sand sales incentives.  A good company to earn evert day on new products.  A safe environment
good,I worked in a really good store where everyone got along and did their job smoothly. It was operated really well and though my department was always chaotic I could count on my manager and co-workers to help handle it.
good,This job was when I was attending UH Manoa and it helped me paid bills and experience living on my own. The pay was good and they accommodated my school time with work hours. I was trained with customer service programs and this made it easy for me to be courteous and accountable in future jobs.
good,"I was very happy there, I met really amazing people and we always took care of the customer. Sometimes it was very busy but on chill days it was nice getting to know the new employees and having a good time with them."
good,"The management for this OfficeMax (Griffin) is beyond phenomenal. They are very open to cross training, there are many ways to move to the department you prefer, I have only worked there for a short time and I have already been trained and moved to logistics which is the department that I showed an interest in."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with this company. I had started working right after I was cleared medically and unfortunately had to leave because of relocation. The shift staff and all management was fantastic and very welcoming. Any time I had a question or was confused about something I was helped right away and taught how to correct myself for future reference instead of having it done for me. If I was still living in the area, i would be working there. I truly miss that environment."
good,"Years ago, the company was purchased by Office Depot.  It has been far too many years for me to give any valid feedback on the viability of this employer."
good,laid back rung up customers and helped assist in their copy and print needs stocked shelves and helped customers decide which services best fit their needs. Short lunches was difficult but it was a laid back place which was great
good,"I love working at office do not give me the amount of hours I desire, some weeks I only get 10 hours and it does not help pay bills. A typical day at office depot for me is ringing up costumers and asking do they want to sign up for rewards."
good,"I enjoyed working at office depot, It was another great learning experience that taught me better peoples and communication skills and how to deal with a customer or any individual that needed assistance taken care of."

good,Company was very diversified and had a lot of different product training and employee team work .regular meetings and gatherings with employee interaction with a good work environment including offers of bonus and other monetary incentives .
good,On a normal day you're always getting trained on new stuff. The store is easy to memorize its the stuff in the store thats hard. Management is always there to help you but they sometimes get overwhelmed with all the customers they aren't always able to come running
good,Just make sure you always stay positive in the work environment work hard and be MOTIVATED get plenty of rest and sleep at all times eat something good
good,"I enjoy working for the company as they are about a great work/life balance. The job is very challenging, yet also very rewarding. The culture is relaxed and everyone works well as a team."
good,Its an amazing work environment and everyone there including the management  we're amazing to work with. Everyone was so welcoming and they helped with a lot.
good,"Have worked here almost 4 years as a part-time associate in the copy print center and greatly enjoy the camaraderie and work ethics of all associates. Have learned much from other associates willing to share their printing services expertise. The manager and his supervisory staff are hard working. I believe he treats everyone fairly and is flexible when accommodating those who work two jobs (coordinating work schedules can be crazy!).  All supervisory staff are fair in their efforts to apply corporate guidelines, which can be a rather daunting task!  Our district manager is also a hardworking man whose support encourages all associates to be the best they can be in their areas of service in the store. There is much employee turnover for different reasons (college students, associates in need of higher salaries or more hours) making it challenging for our store manager to provide available staff for exceptional customer service; however, he is very diligent and does strive to hire staff that will stay! It is my hope to remain as a dedicated copy print associate until my retirement in a few years.  I really enjoy my job and enjoy serving the customers who rely on our print services."
good,"I did not leave OfficeMax, it left me and moved to Boca Raton, Florida after the merger between OfficeMax and Office Depot.  We had a great team, everyone worked hard, I learned a lot and management was great."
good,una vez siguiendo los estándares de trabajo todo lo demás se hace solo
good,Was my first job started at $8 ended four years later at $8.20 so no real advancement. Moved to different parts of the store and never got a real raise at one point i got my yer review and ended up with .04 cent raise was insulting.
good,Great place to work with great people! Always lots of fun events but departments tend to be siloed. In a great location right off the 95 and by the trirail so easy commuting!
good,Great jon. Had no complaints. Good job if you are in school or needing a part time just to put some money in your pockets. The company overall is great.
good,"Although there where times the store was way understaffed, the employees that would show up were the best.  They were some of the hardest working and honest people I know.  Even years later I still keep in contact with them.  Don't let a few bad eggs ruin your day."
good,It was awesome when it was boise - not sure with all the changes how much of the old culture and skills survived.  There has been a near 100% turnover in management so not fair to evaluate
good,Es una buena empresa en la cual te puedes desempeñar en diversos puestos cuando eres aux. general desde cobro de mercancias hasta sacar copias e impresiones; el unico inconveniente que le veo es que hay muchas preferencias en cuestion de gerencia.
good,Every day is different you may do the same thing but it was different for example one day may be on the register the next one on the floor or helping costumers even help at the copy and print section always be busy.
good,Office Depot Distribution is a great place to work if you need the money and most supervisors are nice and if you work hard with the team they'll buy everybody lunch or cooked hamburgers and hot dogs.
good,"the hardest part of my job was doing a return. and the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers, I love helping people. management was good."

good,"I was working as a customer service executive for the past 2 years in HCL for the client called OfficeMax and for the team called sourcing, which includes sourcing,logistics,procurement,vendor maintanance."
good,"Good working environment "
good,"I worked for OfficeMax, before they merged with Office Depot, in my early 20's. I loved my co-workers, and that includes the management. The atmosphere in the store was light and friendly. The management felt more like friends than bosses. Easily approachable with any concerns or problems. The job was and still is retail. The customers were typically nice. But there is always that some who are not very friendly. "
good,I was able to choose my own hours as a student intern. The management that I worked with were very flexible with my schedule and accommodated meetings around it. The pay was very nice as well especially for a full time student.
good,"It was my first job, I was a cashier and I had to make sure the front of the store was always restocked. I also had to put the returned and left items back in their places."
good,"Office Depot can be stressful but it depends on who is in your building that is actually trained.  There are so many services offered in that building that one could get simply get lost.  Its also compounded by changing planograms, so learning the operations is definitely challenging."
good,"I enjoyed working there as a Seasonal Associate - didn't work there long enough to be able to speak about employee benefits, plus as I was underage (16yro)... very strict clothing policies, friendly and helpful staff, awesome boss... "
good,"Good job if you are just starting off in the work force or in retail. Not the most exciting job out there but it pays the bills. Management is very flexible around your schedule and is very willing to work around school, other jobs and/or other commitments. Hardest part of the job is keeping the excitement up so you don't get tired of having to do the same boring things every day. Another extremely hard part of the job is having to deal with disruptive and disgruntled customers. The most enjoyable part of the job includes getting to help people find what they're looking for and being able to develop good communication skills for both in and outside of the workplace."
good,I had the pleasure of being employed by Boise Cascade Office Products / OfficeMax / Office Depot for almost 18 years. The workplace culture could not have been more professional. The most enjoyable part of working there were the people I got to interact with on a daily basis.
good,Working at Office Max has shown me that working together as a team and family gets you further than anything in retail and customer service. Respecting the people around you and helping each other out with projects makes life much easier. The only thing about Office Max is not getting enough hours when needed.
good,I enjoyed working there. Until they deleted my title. Then they let me go.  Then later on it became office/office depot. I got along with everyone. We got hour lunch.
good,The job was enjoyable learning more about the culture of retail. I worked on customer projects and graphic design programs. Overall experience was very grateful for the opportunity to work under a strong management system.

good,Been here 28 years. I like the job. The management is good. People come and go often. I make a lot now but starting out today you wouldn't make much. I get a raise just about every year. I get bonuses as a team.
good,"Opened and closed store, counted drawers for cashiers, called customers for product inquiry. Ran the front end of store, filled in for cashiers if they called out. Made schedules, covered breaks."
good,"Arqueos de cajas y cortes de cajas."
good,"Overall a great place to work but sometimes hours get cut back.  I would stay but need steady hours. Great people, management, and nice place to work.  Training and interesting place to work.  Company changes created more cuts in hours.  That is the only bad thing."
good,"It was a nice place to work. Friendly people, decent management, work incentives. Gift cards were given often. Family oriented. Flexible hours. Locker space."
good,Very easy to advance in if you are willing to put forward the effort. I got promoted in three months and was sad to leave. Wish there was some changes though.

good,Office Depot is a very fast paced environment where we care fully about the customers needs. At some points the employees get carried away and it gets hard to reach the customers. It seems as if the employees are just so serious and just want to get the day over with and then go home.
good,I like working here. I enjoy my job. I learn something new everyday. management is wonderful. everyday is a challenge. I like the tech department
good,"Most of the managers are rude, even to customers. They aren't very helpful to their employees, and on occasion, have been known to do things that go far beyond corporate policy."

I have learned that you can not rely on everyone to get the work done for you, but the hardest part is taking responsibility for other peoples fault. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting along with my coworkers."
good,Office Depot works in teams so you feel part of a family. Managers are very nice and upbeat and they are very helpful in moving you up in the Company.
good,This was a great place for anyone with the desire to be with customers in a team environment.
good,"Es una buena empresa para laborar, tienen un buen nivel de salario, prestaciones. Buen ambiente de trabajo."

good,Very nice place to work. i had to scan documents and sort mail everyday.
good,very professional and nice people to work with and a very excellent grocery store
good,"A typical day at work was usually running around in circles, literally, operating multiple machines at once. There was always multi-tasking, working online and on the floor, and something not working hahaha. I loved it here, and learned a lot about a variety of softwares and different office equipment. The management was awesome and we loved helping each other out, as we were very short-handed, there was one manager that we all could've done without, but hey there's always ...that guy. The co-workers were easy to be around, mostly dealt with management, though. The hardest part of the job was not being able to solve a problem when nobody else was proficient in the copy & print department or knew how to fix some of the technology, as well as having to keep up with rushes averaging 15 people, alone. In turn, that was also part of the most enjoyable part because those were the times I really ended up learning more and advancing my employment skills. The absolute most enjoyable part of the job, though, was the independence in having my own part of the store with my own impact on the company."
good,"Corporate can be a struggle with all the policies and what not.  And they really expect to much of you, with the amount they allow you to work and get paid.  But I had a great time with the people I worked with and learned a lot."
good,"I have been working at Office Depot for four years. I would hate to leave the company, but the merger with OfficeMax will inevitably limit opportunities.  I had worked for other retailers, and this is by far the best situation.  All management bonus quarterly and Assistant Store Managers are hourly with a 46 hour work week where they are paid time and a half for anything over 40.  I have had horrible District Managers in my 10 years in retail, but I must say that my current boss is the best.  He cares about the bottom line in many core categories, but he let's us run our stores. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing what they tell us.  There is so much communication that I really don't have to worry about what's next or even execute.  I was able to get an MBA with the tuition reimbursement program and run a store at the same time (unthinking in retail)!  However, you are asked to do a lot with little payroll.  You are your own HR as well.  Have I worked 11 hours in a day? Some.  Have I worked on my day off? Rarely.  But this is because I want to succeed in a company that is worth working for.  A majority of the time, I have worked 8-9 hour days and I always take an hour lunch.  Retail is a tough industry, but Office Depot has made it easy with Holidays off, closing at 9 pm, and opening later on the weekends.  All in all, I wish that I did not have to start looking for another company, but the merger has got me worried.   "
good,"I only worked for Office Depot for three months, but I had a wonderful time while I was there.  The store was located only five minutes off of a Military base, so our customers mainly consisted of Military personnel, soccer moms, and local business owners.  The only hostile customer I ever came in contact with was a club owner who expected hundreds of promotional cards to be printed and cut within the hour.  My coworkers were pleasant to work with.  Everyone did a wonderful job, and there wasn't anyone who was not willing to do their part.  My manager was not a fan of me, not because of my work ethic, but because I have a big personality, which can sometimes seem obnoxious.  She was still very professional despite her dislike for me. The pay was not very good, nor were the hours.  They will start you at minimum wage, and you will be lucky to work more than 25 hours per week, unless it is Back To School season.  The hardest part of the job is getting all orders finished by the time the customers are expecting them.  It is a great job for college students or maybe a mom who wants to get out of the house."
good,Working at Office Depot develops a strong connection with your customers. You're able to take care of the customers job. I learned how to use Photoshop network and all Microsoft networks. The company is focused of Taking Care of Customers Business so all associates work together to meet their needs. I've never came across a situation with my co-workers. 
good,De dag begint met het uitladen van vracht .die gesplitst moet worden
good,"A typical day at work was educational and very provided information that I can use in my future career. I learned that the single most important aspect of customer service is the relationship with the customer. Without a relationship, one on one interactions are more challenging and useless. The hardest part of the job was coming out of my shell and learning to communicate clearly but as time progressed, I caught on to it quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. My co-workers were hard workers and were very helpful during my training."
good,Store Associate/Cashier / Sales Associate
good,Realizar las labores asignadas por auditorias desde la entrada con una hora de comida y hasta la salida.
good,"Normal retail environment centered around office products. Management is very easy going but responsible and care about the associates. Hardest part of this job is getting good customer feedback, if any, when you spend about 2 mins with each customer at the register. Most enjoyable part of this job is the coworkers and relaxed but ""get the job done"" vibe."
good,The hours are fairly good.
good,Great place to work for. Many opportunities for advancement and compensation. Flexible schedules and great people.
good,It was a afun and flexible place to work at. The Employees and managers were all hard workers and everyone repected on another.
good,"The staff is a wonderful group of people! No one holds grudges or talks about other employees behind their backs. Everyone is very friendly and they are the type of people that you can talk to if you have problems(the store in Calhoun, GA is like that) and no one criticizes you about anything. Truly an amazing store!"
good,Good pay not enough hours to survive on I didd like working there it is too few hours to survive on great people to work with however I would work there with more hours
good,I learned a lot of great things & I accomplish a lot goals there... Also I got training in job description that I thought I’ll never be able to complete..

good,Had a great job experience with the company. My managers were really flexible with my schedule and my coworkers help create a peaceful and cooperative environment.
good,"The job was very nice I liked working there very much  I didn’t like how we got a new store manager and He messes up a few things , Like he would pass the pay roll a lot and he had to cut our hours which I didn’t like ... but other then that working there was good"
good,This is a great company with an excellent environment to work in. Everyone is a team player. Management was outstanding. I enjoyed working with this company.
good,"Management cares, safety oriented long hours sometimes. But worth it. People are fun to work with and I look forward to going to work. Best decision I ever made."
good,Great environment to develop and learn. Management were focused and clear on the goals set before the organization. General Managers were given great freedom to build and grow business. A great place for any dynamic leader.
good,"Todas las mañanas comienza con la junta de operaciones en donde se analiza la produccion por area del dia anterior y trazar los objetivos del día en curso."
good,Gran empresa para aprender el retail
good,We all enjoy working and growing together.  Everyone is very helpful and will answer any questions you might have. I learned the register in a very short period of time.

good,"It is a medium pace job where you get to talk to many people and help them with their needs, i would recommend it as a part time job, but will look for something better if possible."
good,"Office Max on a daily typically consists of diligently working with customers to take care of their needs. Along with doing so, one also has the opportunit to gain commission from making additional sales. (i.e. Ink, Protection plans etc). The most enjoyable part of Office Max is being able to make a customer smile."
good,"I was hired into the management team at Office Depot - I saw the potential and growth from the company. My only issue, I was unable to transfer due to the closing of Office Max locations and those people had to get transfer into Office Depot.

good,The current leadership is strong with great vision. The company is good to work for and the work life balance given the business needs is good as well.
good,"Na 40 jaar en 3 maanden dienstverband denk ik dat wel een inhoudelijke review kan geven. Office Depot is een zeer fijne werkgever waar een ieder de ruimte krijgt om door te groeien. Prima arbeidsvoorwaarden en een mooie lokatie om te werken. De bedrijfscultuur is zeer open, ethiek staat hoog in het vaandel. Discriminatie wordt absoluut niet getolereerd."
good,I can say this was one of my best jobs. My manager was understanding and fun. He worked with us as far as life problems. over time was always given out.
good,"Great workplace with flexible hours to balance work and personal life perfectly. Mission oriented, knows what they’re doing and how to make customers happy."
good,The Copy & Print department always kept me busy in different projects for different customers. Each customer had different wants and needs for the projects that they brought in and it was our job to  make sure and find ways to work with each customer to get it done.
good,"Jefes excelentes, motivación, beneficios trabajo em equipo"
good,All the workers are fun to work with and talk to. The pay is great if you don't have very many expenses in LA. I am not sure about the health benefits as I am only a part time employee.
good,"Management cared about employees, knew most of the positions, and were helpful to us.  I expressed interest in moving to the Copy/Print center and was moved within a month.  By the time I left I knew every position in the store and could do everything there."
good,Productive place to work at and get the understanding how to get around in the city and surrounding areas of Houston. Great employees to work with. Great opportunity to learn how driver a 24 foot bob tail truck.

good,The typical work day usually has you running around the store doing different jobs and helping customers find the items they need. The management were always able to help if you had a question on the location of a certain item. The hardest part of the job has to be that for the full 8 hour shift you only get time to take a step back when you go on break.
good,"J'ai appris énormément de chose dans cette entreprise ou l'on ma fait confiance malgré mon manque de diplôme."
good,"Really nice company. They don't stress you out with daily reprimands about sky high metric goals like other retailers. Since I worked with other companies that not only reprimanded associates, but wrote them up or let them go based on metric performance, Office Depot goals are very attainable and easy to fulfill. You actually get nice recompense for meeting those goals either in the form of additional dollars to your paycheck, drawings for prizes both in-store and national levels, gift cards to the cinema, or smaller ones like candy. The levels of stress induced by the job is incredibly minimal, only have to worry about the volume of guests checking out or asking questions. They work with your schedule."

I can't say any part of working their was hard, cause I don't recall anything being hard to do, cause everyone helped each other."

I worked in the Copy, Print and Shipping dept and loved every minute of it.  I got to learn how to a lot of new things and use prior skills and really hone those new skills.

However, i wish the company offered more full time opportunities. there are those of us that love our job but have families to raise. some of us are even working 2 jobs just to be able to make ends meet. it would be easier for those that are willing to work, to have and enjoy the luxury of having one job and spend more quality time with our families. a great job with 40 plus hours a week would help a lot of people out."
good,Its a great company to work for. Very professional work ethics. Managers and Co-Workers are very nice and easy going. We have weekly meetings and everything is always brought up. If any concerns they will speak to you privately. I had a great experience working for this company.

good,Office Max is a wonderful company to work for. The associates are polite and the managers are leaders rather than bosses. A typical day at work would be to work the register and help customers find what they need in the store and online. Selling is also part of the job and I have learned how to do that well. The hardest part of the job would be to sell tech services because many customers that come in already have someone fixing their computer for them.

good,Office depot is a great company to work for. The managers at my location are amazing the always get things done and never cause any tension in the work environment. the only thing that I can say that is a negative is they pay you are hired at is really low and they don't give a lot of hours to make up for it. one year I would do amazingly in sales the next I wouldn't and so there is little room for consistent paychecks. Over all the environment is great the customers are great and the store is one of the easiest to navigate.

My time at the Foundation gave me a sense of selflessness, working charity organization was the best thing that could happen to me. I worked directly under the Foundation's President which makes a big difference rather than having a manager or supervisor. It was a blast."

They are demanding, but realistic. My co-workers have become friends; most that I have known for years.  We are a cohesive team with a strong work ethic.  One of the hardest parts of my job is receiving short notice to schedule meetings or events because they are limiting what I can do for them to have a successful experience.  I enjoy helping people, and in this role I get to do this daily."

Management works with my schedule and still provides the hours I need. Everyone that works at my location is a team player and they're all a joy to work with. The day goes by SO fast! As the tech adviser I show customers all the latest in technology and recommend our fantastic tech depot services as well as our wonderful performance protection plans. It really helps to sell a product that one believes in, and with Office Depots services, I believe they are worth it. Office Depot provides commission, but they make it a fun challenge/goal to achieve it. The whole store much sell a certain amount of our services/warranties in order to achieve a commission and they have 10, 15 or even 20% of your personal sales depending on how well the store does. "

good,I liked the interaction I had with our customers.  It made my day to be able to help out different companies find the things they needed.
good,"Making outbound calls to existing and new customers."
good,I have worked at OfficeMax for a little over a year and I have really enjoyed it. I am a big technology buff and working here is right up my alley. The only down fall to it is that it is a corporation and at the end of the year the big wigs from corporate will cut hours in order to make their numbers look better. Not that they are they only company to do this but it does but a strain on the customer experience that we are suppose to uphold.
good,"A typical nite at the job started with my gettig the trucks loaded in my area and then going and help out with any doors that were short handed or needed help,"
good,"Aprendes mucho, buen ambiente laboral,atención al cliente buena."
good,"Frankly, it was one of the best jobs I worked in. In a typical day i could do any number of things, from regular retail work, to specialty tasks. I started in the print center and they wanted to move me up so I was trained in sales, and as it turned out both of those were incredibly diverse experiences that I really appreciated. Sadly, life happened so I wasn't able to pursue the career with them, but I would definitely recommend it to someone else seeking a job."
good,Journée de travaille agréable a l ecoute de mes collaborateur(rice) en tant  que préparatrice de commandes
good,"Working at Office Depot is a job that you do the same thing everyday, however, it's always different everyday. There are new customers with new needs and wants. It was always interesting to help a customer figure out a solution to a work place need."
good,this is the business model a company should have.  i honestly cant recall a time being unhappy working under the managers that i did. if only their company was in the top fortune 500

good,Great management and very liniment work schedules. A good work place that gives you good benefits and has a lot to offer. Very taken care of and clean work environment.
good,"A day at OfficeMax Office Depot would consist of answers about 9 calls per hour assisting customers and Account Managers with placing and tracking orders, finding items and what pricing/availability is, and answering emails in between calls dealing with the same situation.

good,"Work place was very busy. Working as a cashier was really stressful at times because of standing up for long hours. However, the pay was pretty decent and management was exceptional as well."
good,Great place to work. Many cross functional opportunities with peers and ability to gain experience. Staples acquisition announcement is stressful for many and cast a shadow over the culture.
good,"At Office Depot the customer came first no matter what. As a manager with Office Depot each and every customer that walked through our doors we strived to deliver a personalized shopping experiance with knowledgable staff and friendly faces. If any of my staff, or myself, were working on a task we would drop everything we were working on to make sure the customer was assisted quickly. When I say quickly I do not mean point to an aisle and say ""Its on aisle 20."" We would walk them to the product and ask questions about their purchase to make sure that they were getting everything they needed in one trip. This way the customer not only feels that they were taked well care of, but avoids unessesary trips to the store. The staff mesh well together with a solid understanding of all areas of the store, and in the event that someone does not have the answer a fellow associate is usually near by to lend a hand to the customer or associate. The hardest part of the day, as in most retail establishments, would be staffing during peak hours of the day. There are just not enough associates per customer to accomidate the traffic flow, but with good communication and a knowledge of the store and product it is well managed."
good,My time at OfficeMax was great. Awesome leadership! I could have seen me spending my career there but due to the merger it was no longer a good fit.

good,"Management was very nice and created a good work environment. The best part of the job is interacting with people, while the worst is the possibility of a mundane day."
good,The management in the store I worked was amazing and always there for me. Looked to help me succeed. A very good store to work for and always looking to help me further my career. The team worked as a team and not as an individual looking for a paycheck.
good,"Multitasking is a necessity in this position.  The main highlights of the job requirements are to assist customers in selecting the appropriate technology item to meet their needs, creating an order for that item, special ordering the item from a 3rd party vendor to have it shipped to the customer, tracking orders, processing returns, creating volume bids for bulk contract-related orders, fulfilling orders through 3rd party vendors for back ordered items, and occasionally handing general customer service calls."
good,nice place to work if you can multitask on a daily basis and work at a fast pace.
good,This is a great place to learn and grow in different fields/majors. From Graphic Designers to Business Majors. It's also great to be cross trained here as well.
good,"good people to work for. Learned a lot from my peers and at the ""University"" they created to teach all software programs."
good,"Plenty to do different department, When dealing with the product you still can learn something about your customer."

good,"En la empresa se premia al personal por buen trato  a clientes, realizar metas, en el comedor se rrealizaban juntas cada mes y era importante ir ya que en dicha junta hablabamos de logros, asy como diferencias que teniamos en cada junta se daba un pequeño almuerzo y a los empleados con buen resultado se les daba un pink por conduscta trato o ventas por parte de el gerente y cada que se hacia inventario en tienda se tomaban en cuanta cada uno de empleados y participaban para ser mejor en zona, el personal era muy amable y uno como nuevo tenias el apoyo por parte de los que tenian experiencia no te dejaban sola, lo que aprendi en ese lapso laboral fue la honradez y responsabilidad."
good,"buen lugar donde trabajar si se empeña, disciplina ante todo, un gran ambiente laboral"
good,"A typical day as lead logistics specialist."
good,"Pues había días en los que había mucha gente, o se nos juntaban créditos, facturas, y eran momentos algo estresantes, Aveces pedíamos ayuda de gerencia o nos apoyaban compañeros que estaban capacitados para realizar cualquier operación."
good,pues la verdad megusto mucho por que aprendi todo el desarrolo de una muy buena empresa y yevarme muy bien con mi subgerente y de recursos humanos la parte mas dificil para mi fue el separame de la empresa pues mi esposa estaba por aliviarse y no vivia conmigo si no en otro estado vecino donde la deje y pues tuve que dejar este trabajo que para mi fue uno de los mas grandes que e tenido me encanto la verdad

good,"stock shelves and help customers "
good,"A day at Office Depot is always busy. I learned to multi-task from department to department. We have the copy center, postal shipping center, customer service front end, and the technology department. Management is very friendly throughout the store. Co-workers are friends you make for life. The hardest part of the job aside from multi-tasking is learning all departments all at once. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the team, co-workers and management worked together at all times."
good,Office Depot has treated me well over the years.  I am looking for a new line of work as I believe I have reached my full potential with the company without being able to relocate.
good,"My typical Day was taking care of my customers."
good,"A typical day working in the copy and print department of Office Depot consists of a variety of print and design orders from trusting customers. I've learned how to multi-task and print with mass production as well as large format printers. I've also learned more about different paper qualities and production finishing. Dealing with busy customers who have a short approaching dead line can be a challenge, but I enjoy overcoming obstacles."
good,"The other associates I work with are very enjoyable to work with.  We work well with as a team, and the time flys during the day, due to the production being completed."

good,"I have worked at Office Depot for two years now and I have enjoyed it immensely.  As with any retail store you get a few customers who are difficult but most customers are happy that you can help them.

good,"From being cashier to department manager position my journey was very challenging but enjoyable.I love challenges in life.My background is education and teaching and being a technology only lady expert in the company is a great feeling.I have learnt a lot from this company and its great to be now managing it.I feel a person should think out of the box to grow and develop and God gave me this opportunity to grow.Managing is totally different aspect to look at.I learned how to be more creative and decision maker,how to solve the problem in seconds and think in the policy of the company.How to bind the crew in one energetic string and still maintain the healthy atmosphere where the crew members can grow.As a department manager its not only about managing one department but the whole store and the crew.Typically every day is different in retail.Some days are so challenging that to maintain your energy is difficult but that what manager is all about.you are like a Sailor who is responsible for the ship's safety and journey.Sailor has to be strong and decisive and optimistic."
good,"*apoyo a cajas y área de piso."
good,"A typical day at work would be answering multi phone calls placing orders for business on daily bases correcting the orders of error, giving customer care with a smile over the phone. I learn no challenge can be over come a smile threw the phone can make a person on the other end their day and comfortable to them. Management was fair helpful to your needs for you to be successful in your job. The hardest part be sales at times on the phone because you had 3 min to all of the call needs. The most enjoyable part of this job was feeling you accomplish the goal of helping someone make their job easier with my team workers. "
good,"As a manager for Office Depot, the company is solid with good fundamentals when it comes to treating employees right.

good,"A typical day at work is refreshing. There's always something new to learn everyday. Since I've been there I've learned how to give better customer service, to be confident and knowledgeable of the information I give to the customers, and how to be a team player. My co-workers are the best team that I have ever worked with since I have been eligible to work. Everyone gets along and help each other with things the next person may not be that great at. The hardest part of my job is getting customers to buy protection plans on a laptop bag.

I have learned many different ways to communicate with a diverse group of people/customers both internal and external. My co-workers make all the difference in the world! All of them are a partner for me and are a support when the time comes. The hardest part can be managing time with the morning processes. I find it easier if I make myself (and others) a ""to do"" list; complete with most important to least important. The most enjoyable part of my job is making a customer happy and finding a total solution for his/her project, concern of otherwise."

In my position I was able to seek guidance when needed, but for the most part I was able to create and adjust what was needed, to ensure it was executed without errors.

Sales go out on the floor and approach every customer and help them out with any questions, while also trying to provide the best customer service.

The management was amazing and I did enjoy having the managers I did up there.    It was a team effort up there.    The hardest part of the job was when I couldn't help a customer find what they were looking for.    The most enjoyable part of the job was a sense of accomplishment to assist the customers with their purchases and when they looked me up to have me assist them.

Being supervisor I trained new employees. I was asked to work overnights. Before overnights came I would go to other stores out of town and set up the stores whether new or remodeled stores. I would stay for weeks on end. Once at home I went to overnights and was a key holder. I managed three to four individuals in the process of nightly work. I extremely enjoyed that job. I would do anything from work the forklift, planograms, items in lock up, new sets, pricing, returns, cashier, and customer service before the store closes. I like challenging and a fast pace environment. I like to work with a good team ( co-workers)."

good,Most days working I spent on the sales floor helping customers find what they needed. This would include office or school supplies as well as help customers find new desks or chairs for there home or office.
good,"I honestly loved all my coworkers at OfficeMax. Everyone was friendly and good-natured when interacting with each other, and I saw them not only as coworkers but as friends. People would help you and support you if you were having a rough time, and the expectations were fair and not overbearing - obviously you were required to give your best, but it was never too much or too stressful. The environment was calm and helping the customers was fun because a lot of the time you got to help them design things such as business cards or posters, so you got to let a bit of your creativity flow and help create something the customer will enjoy. The only con I can think of is that sometimes things in Copy & Print would be a bit dull and repetitive, such as putting huge stacks of papers through a folding machine for hours on end, but I think in the grand scheme of things the pros outweigh the cons and I would recommend OfficeMax as a great place to work."
good,over all it was a great company to work they gave me the ability to work and go to school also. I became the number one in sales  in the district when i was a part time worker
good,"The location I was at had a great environment, everyone was friendly and easy to get along with. Everyone helped each other whenever it was needed, and we all just worked hard to have a good day. Doesn't take long to learn the basic day-to-day tasks, the most complicated thing would probably be putting in orders for furniture. All in all, a great experience!"

good,Buen trato por parte de los encargados  trabajo muy activo y entretenido

good,I love working at Office Max. My coworkers and managers are great to work with. Very understanding management that works with your schedule. A typical day includes assisting customers and finding solutions to best suit their needs. I have learned how to serve even unhappy customers and find solutions for them.  The best part of my job is working with so many different staff and customers. t
good,Nothing but customer service all day long. Stocking shelves to locating online items for customers. Day starts with counting all tills for registers then bringing them to the floor.

good,My experience with Office Depot was as a seasonal associate. They had an excellent and knowledgeable staff and management. The hours were flexible and it was a wonderful working environment.
good,"A typical day at the register was more so of boring, but once you get to the point where you are experienced enough to cross train into different departments; it's like a whole other ball game! I learned how to sell, how to take little information that a customer could give you and turn it into the exact match that they were looking for, and how to really learn how to talk to a customer one-on-one. The hardest part of the job was easily standing around on the slow days. The most enjoyable would be seeing your customer leave happily because you know you've succeeded in what they came to you for."
good,En office max es una empesa con un buen ambiente de trabajo para cualquier persona que quiera trabajar  tambien muy buenos compañeros que trabajan en esta empresa te dan oportunidad de crecimiento a aun corto plazo segun tus conosimientos y tus responsabilidades tambien te dan oprtunidad de estudiar y trabajar  te acomodan tus horarios para tus estudios
good,"This was my first job and learned from this company the importance of service. The staff was supportive and patient as I went through training.

good,The company as a whole knows who their customer base is and base the products they sell on that.  The training that I was provided was top notch.  I would recommend this company to anyone who would like to get some very useful experience.
good,I'm only leaving because my job title was taken away.  The corporation went from a co-management tier to only a store management tier.  Also if you want to learn something you need to do it on your own and on your own time.  But you can work that into your daily routine.  And the only negative I would say is that you have to pull teeth to move up the ladder.  It won't happen otherwise.  I'm sorry.  It's the only negative.
good,"A typical day at work is usually pretty busy and fast-paced. I enjoy it because there is never a dull moment, I'm always working and completing assignments. My coworkers are very easy to get along with and have no problems working as a team. My manager is very understanding and friendly. The hardest part of my job is lifting the heavy boxes but I've found over the several weeks I've been working at Office Depot, it's beginning to get easier. My favorite part of the job is all of the fantastic people I get to work with and the kind customers I get to meet every day. I definitely enjoy working for this company."

I would recommend this job to friends and family."

My position was always unique from the other reps in the market, only because I worked directly onsite at my customers location each day. So my customers were more like coworkers and really took me under their wing. Overall, I feel like this territory in New England struggles as a whole, only because we have much more competition here than our other territories throughout the country."
good,It was really good culture and work environment to work with. I have really enjoyed to work on this company.They also provide 2 paid breaks as well as lunch.
good,"I started off as a sandwich maker, but I quickly moved up to a cashier. It didn't take long for me to be the head drive-thru cashier. I usually trained the new co-workers."

good,"Was very different each day on the job. Went from cashiering, to freight, to fill and out reports, to being on the sales floor. I learned like said above, good closing sale skills and how to operate a register at a good pace.

The being rushed to do certain things constantly was the hardest part of the job, but I loved the out going and positive atmosphere which was the most enjoyable part."
good,A typical day was like any other job and the co-workers and I got along well and we always worked together as a team.  I learned how to use a handheld device that only took debit and credit.  I honestly can't say there was a hard part to that job.  The atmosphere was great.
good,"I had more fun and good times there than anywhere I ever worked. I still believe that had we opened a store in Hixson vs the Cleveland  location, I would still be with them today. When we closed that store down, I had 8 hourly associates of the 16 left that actually helped me open that store in 1992 help me close it down. Closing that store was the hardest thing I have ever done in my professional career and I hope that I never have it to do again. The thing that I miss most was the camaraderie that we had as a team and even when the work got hard, we still had fun doing it. The pride and the loyalty that that team had was like no other."

good,"""For the period I have been employed at Office Depot, I can say that the training techniques and strategies have helped improved my overall sales and approach in customer service. Not only that, but, also in general, life. The way in which we speak to people on a daily basis can definitely tell whether or not we can win their trust or have them remain a 50/50 customer or acquaintance. So I can confidently conclude, that, with all I have learnt and continue to improve upon, I can take it with me to any level of advancement and succeed with it in the future."""
