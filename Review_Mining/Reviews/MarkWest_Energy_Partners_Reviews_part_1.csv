bad,Holy  Wow cause I can't say -hit Do Not work for this company  management is a joke.  So much drama. If you like working for a company (boss) where everything changes from day to day this job is for you. If you want a good normal job with a boss that isn't a syco Look Elsewhere. Plus they pay -hit
bad,"Absolutely the worst job place experience I have ever had the displeasure of enduring. If you are thinking of a job with company, be warned that the work atmosphere is one that will make you want to eat raw meat and rat poison. The management at the Cadiz location has no clue about the actual process of operations and continue to micro manage without any knowledge or experience of the job they are supposed to be doing. In short, I'd rather wake up every morning and take a beating than have to go to work with those people ever again."
bad,"Horrible place to work, the men were bigger babies then the women. Just a very shady place to work. Good money but not worth the BS. No one in the company takes any accountability. It all about who you know to get in, very easy to weed you out."
bad,Worst management possible if your not a cousin or a buddy your the odd man out you life will be miserable if you cross them you will be made an example
bad,"I worked for this company as a contractor for a year and was promised to be brought into the company. "
bad,I'm a say one of the most prejudice companies I ever have her work for .  A lot of people  with no gas industry experience telling you what to do   A lot of arrogant people to good luck if you go there  must say they pay you very well go  though  management is horrible
bad,"The main problem was that the position was contract to hire, and the hire never happened. i was only one of many contractors with this problem here. Markwest does not have a policy (in practice) of hiring contractors."
good,This company was great until they merged with Marathon and then everything went pretty bad. The new management had no respect for the people who were there and they started treating everyone poorly and firing people.
good,"none at this time,  nothing to say about them.  Enjoyed my co-workers. company vehicle. They need more experienced staff and management."
good,"MarkWest is a good company, they offer a great vacation package, yearly bonus, and great end of year Holiday Party. My department doesn't offer much room for advancement and there is not a lot of variety with the job, so if you like mostly data entry and not really looking for advancement this is a good fit."
good,This has been a good company to work for.  The job is challenging and there is a lot to learn.  Individual departments can be dysfunctional and training is spotty.  Impossible to move up in the current department and finding qualified outside candidates is difficult resulting in overworked employees.
good,This is a good paying job and a great place to start a career. I would highly recommend it to someone interested in the energy industry.
good,"routine maintenance and site checks"
good,"An Operator at MarkWest is compensated well with pay and benefits. The work schedule screws with your sleep/wake cycle a lot. But it did allow a week off every rotation which was nice. However when I left, there was always a lot of overtime that had to be picked up because of empty positions. They are also now owned by Marathon, so I'm sure a lot has changed since I left."
good,"Great guys to to work with and be around. stressful but exciting work. Mangement was weak and an ""ole boys club"" with inexperienced friends getting promotions and deserving people getting nothing. That changed with the Maratheon takeover"
good,Markwest is a great place to work as an operations accountant.  It is specialized accounting work that is not for everyone as it is fairly complex and ever-changing.
good,This is a good place to work. Good leaders and safety is the highest  priority. There is a lot of training given. Online training is also given. They are always looking to improve on the way things are done.
good,"It can be super busy and demanding at times, but that's just the Oil & Gas Industry. I am trying to relocate, but wish there was a way I could continue with MW."
good,"As a relatively  young company MarkWest is fairly efficient. In the past five years the company has grown significantly, in fact doubling in work size. As with any company going through these phases there are growing pains."
good,"As an intern, this was a great learning experience for me.  MarkWest was always willing to work with my schedule and was very generous with pay as well.  The experience itself was wonderful, as the other workers were always willing to talk and help out where they could.  Safety was a top priority and the entire workplace was very aware of themselves and what they were doing.  My only complaint is that there seemed to be more down time than I was expecting and some of the work I did felt like secretarial work, not an engineer's work.  I was told that this was due to the speed at which I completed tasks, so often times I finished up all the work that had been allocated to me before new tasks were available.  Overall, I very much enjoyed my experience at MarkWest."
good,"I took an internship for the summer to complete a degree requirement.  I wasn't expecting to be doing accounting work, I was expecting to be a typical intern.  I thought I'd be on coffee runs, filing, and shadowing the department.  Instead I was tasked with daily, weekly, and monthly responsibilities in addition to special projects, making for a fantastic internship experience."
good,Great benefits are offered. Enjoyed working with great people. Great place for career growth and advancement within the company.  Plenty of training opportunities.
good,"Responsible for monthly close and settlement activities.  Worked closely with Business Development, Operations, Contract Administration and the Senior Management team."
good,MarkWest is a well structured company that has a defined chain of command. everyone is willing to work with you to assist in finding solutions to get the job completed.
good,Great place to wrk... Awesome people very talented but safety always comes first. Management works with staff to insure a safe and efficient plant is operated 24/7
