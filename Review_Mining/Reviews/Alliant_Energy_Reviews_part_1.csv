rating,review
bad,"Total lack of training available for new employees.  If you want to be thrown to the wolves, this is the place. Everyone is paranoid about losing their jobs.  Company is totally insecure. They believe they are big players in the industry and don't even come close.  Very poor management."
bad,"Unless you are a female and non white you will not be promoted at Alliant Energy. Heavy reverse discrimination.  In addition,  reviews are based on forced  distribution.  If someone does well somebody else must be rated poorly."
bad,Worst work environment.  Culture is horrible despite what they preach. Executives unfairly make rash decisions and lead by intimidation.  Policies are not consistently applied.  Pay is good but the leadership is a good ole boy mentality and it is hard to fit in regardless of skill. don't provide opportunity to improve..if you make a mistake they hold against you.
bad,Micro managed to the point of being ridiculous. Call centers are treated totally different than the rest of the company.  Nothing enjoyable about going to work. Other departments treat customer service employees like they are less than and get away with it. Same management that has been there for years and years and years. No one on one meetings with team leads on a regular basis due to call volume and lack of help.
bad,"The pay is great but management/culture/ job is horrible. People who have been here 20+ years are looking to get out. The stress is so bad people cry DAILY, management just tells them, and I quote ""shut up""."
bad,did not seem to fit in well with other employees and management.  Felt as if no help was provided to me once issues were raised regarding company wide problems with management and fellow employees.
bad,"You are not important, just the company's numbers. Management do not care about the well-being of the meter-readers at this company. A typical day at work involves fighting off dogs and battling the elements of mother of nature. If you get hurt or bit, you're fired! If you have an accident, you're fired! Management create exigent circumstances by demanding a set quota of meters read (500) and every meter read, even if there are hazards present."
bad,"Current AE employee, but not in legal department. High turnover in legal department makes it difficult for us get work done. Recently lost 3 top lawyers in group for total of 6 or 7 in past year. Dishonest and bizarre leadership in this group. Apply at own risk - not a good place to work."
bad,shoot first ask questions later with no thought of individual happenings or care about responsibilities outside of the workplace.  people throwing others under the bus to try and help elevate their own career
bad,"Alliant Energy has gone down hill fast in the last seven years. Unqualified. inexperienced mid-level managers have ravaged the company. Poor business and hiring/firing decisions have left this place a shadow of what it used to be. There are people without college degrees managing people with masters degrees. Pay isn't competitive. Benefits are mediocre. "
bad,"Its a call center job. Management is terrible, zero culture and you are so stressed from getting yelled at by customers but nobody cares. I was having high anxiety. As were most of my fellow coworkers. There is mandatory overtime because nobody wants to be there. You get screamed at by customers for unrealistic payment terms, you are not able to actually help. You are just a butt in a chair."
bad,Extremely challenging place to work.  Management is not willing to work with employees.  Very deadline driven.  Very limited opportunity for advancement.
bad,"There really wasn't a typical day with all the changes that took place. The work environment was stressful because the company was implementing many changes to keep up with the time, all at once."
bad,"Evaluate present practices and implement processes, concepts, training and tools to prevent, detect and correct human errors that may adversely impact the safe, reliable operation of the electric transmission and distribution system."
bad,"Was a great company when I started but now it is loaded with people only interested in their personal advancement. Use to be a place where you started low and learned multiple avenues of the business thus making you very knowledgeable of ALL aspects of the utility. Not the case anymore, who you know not what you know."
bad,"Cut throat organization. Greed with leadership is stifling. Bonuses were decent however, , in access of $20k for lower level salaried staff, goes up from there, thanks to rate payers."
bad,"Small room for advancement, it is a union, and there is no consistency in management - one manager will say one thing while another one will say another.  Policy is extremely strict."
bad,"They want you to speak your mind, but truly you can't.  If you do then you will be watched until they can get ride of you.  Used to be a wonderful place and I was proud to work there."
bad,"I enjoyed my short time at Alliant Energy. Many great people work for this company. However in my capacity there is little to no dedication to business continuity and the desire for a robust program is not among the executives."
bad,"beware in Burlington location older workers will sell out anyone that doesn't back stab and spread rumors it was a bunch of people in their 50s acting like kids in junior high or high school.  on top of that if there was a complaint it was always the accuser or complainer who was right without even hearing the other side and management was too stupid to realize they were getting played for chumps.  I've never worked at a place that so many games were played, it was totally ridiculous.  i felt like i had to walk on egg shells anytime i was working, it was bad enough that fellow meter readers would lie to management on my location just to elevate themselves.  i worked there for 1 1/2 years with no problems then after there was a management change i was gone within 6 months.  one example is that i was 5 min late one time and got wrote up for it when the day before he gave me a verbal warning on it,  the manager of the meter readers is clueless.  he's never done the job he just goes off of what the head meter reader says, and she's one of the ones to watch out for.  i was even told i was one of if not the best reader we had, it didn't matter once i got a target on me i was toast."
bad,Run from this place. You dont want to work here as a contractor or a permanent hire. High turnover for a reason. Management problems at all levels starting at the top.
bad,"I was provided many opportunities to take part in training and classes to develop my professional abilities which I greatly enjoyed and appreciated.  Alliant does not hesitate to invest in the development of its employees.  However, advancement and opportunity are highly dependent upon your supervisor and where they feel they need you to be rather than what is in the best interest of your desired career path."
bad,"All the bosses review your calls differently, and all they care about is if you got off the call quickly and hit every sales pitch imaginable. It was ridiculous. Those people work hard and the customer is not able to be taken care of on a timer!"
bad,"Alliant is a good company to work for depending on the department you work in.  My advice to those coming in the organization, get as much as you can initially.  Don't count on any raises or bonuses to make up for lost ground because that is simply a pipe dream.  Also donâ€™t count on any raises when you take on additional responsibilities or obtain certifications.  Expect no more than annual inflationary increases at best."
bad,"There are good intentions to move with the times, but lack of strong leadership and direction in certain areas are hindering this initiative.  Fortunately/unfortunately the company has many long term employees who are unwilling to embrace change and seem to have a free pass to get away with their behaviors which creates a huge challenge for those people on board. They obviously treat employees well to keep many there for years.   The need for system updates and move away from manual processes and work around system fixes will only continue to burn out and frustrate dedicated employees.  Great benefits with mostly enjoyable people."
bad,"Unfortunately became a typical call center environment with cattiness, back-stabbing and overall drama between employees and even management. Lost focus on customer service in favor of getting back all the money they've lost over the years by not being more aggressive with people who don't pay. This became a detriment to good-paying customers who fell on hard times. Emotionally draining position to be in because you're having to hear people's stories of why they can't afford to pay while coming up with a solution limited to the inflexibility of the system. If you are the type of person who can show up every day, do the job and not get involved AT ALL with management, question authority or the decisions upper management makes, or your coworkers then this is a place where you'll thrive."
good,"Sit in shack for 10 hrs a day, pushed and pulled rail road crossing arm up and down all day to control access to plant. The site manager for the area, didn't want to do his job. He was 2 hrs away, was suppose to come down once every 2 weeks. Instead I saw him twice and he could never get my check to me on time."
good,Great place to work if you don't mind feeling like a number and don't hold job security as being very important. Corporate executives/management continue to make mind boggling decisions that ultimately result in reorganization after reorganization after reorganization. 
good,Changing directions and compliance rules constantly making it challenging to get work done. Internal messaging bears little resemblance to actions taken.
good,"we have a lot of meetings.  It is expected to advance to work at kast 48 hours a wek,  Not too long ago I was working 8 to 5 and then again from 8 to 12(miidnight)."
good,Great culture but executive leadership is too often pennywise and pound foolish.  Managers are respectful and in the trenches with you every day.   Good challenging work.
good,Very company oriented.  Employees are just employees.  Days didn't go by very quickly unless you could find things to do which is probably why they re-organized and eliminated positions.
good,"Being able to work with all different types of users in the field."
good,Management does not appear to have trust in their employees. Very controlling environment. I have learned a lot about the utility industry. The co-workers all have a general consensus of the management style but it is one of the few places to work in the community that pays a decent wage and has good benefits.
good,"Working at Alliant was a really enjoyable job most of the time as the incoming calls were just enough to keep you busy, sometimes there were enough calls to actually keep you on your feet and give you some excitement as well.  The independence in this job was great as well.  Pay and benefits were a plus.  The company unfortunately did not take pride in the way the employees were treated though and expected work over family, to a point of extremity.  A typical day consisted of making sure you were available to take any incoming call that would pop in, including two breaks and a lunch time.  Co workers were in a different cubicle and generally you were left alone to work but able to converse with them as well."
good,I enjoyed the work and found it interesting however work life balance was poor. I worked in the accounting department which had frequent turn over so spent a lot of time onboarding new people.
good,"No two days were every the same.  Relationships will make or break your career within the company."
good,"I processed monthly billing for large general service customers.  This was a manual priocess as each customer's billing was unique for their operations.  "
good,Work hours 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM interact with employees on daily work schedule and regulatory work schedule. Customer and employee safety and knowing that my crews worked hard to go home everyday in the same shape they came to work everyday.
good,"The Location was at the corporate office, very nice work areas."
good,Prepared Federal and State Regulatory reporting for the Utility Accounting department. Analyzed previous working files to prepare current period reporting. Created well documented audit trails to ensure accuracy and completeness.
good,I have worked here a long time and have taken advantage of the tuition reimbursement.  I have take a temp position and have gained experience to be promoted into a permanent position.
good,"I worked for Alliant Energy for 14 years and was well compensated for my efforts.  I really enjoyed working with my assigned customers, helping to save them money by conserving energy.  Please be aware that Alliant Energy is a shrinking company (my job was recently eliminated) as you consider your options."
good,"This was a temporary position. Performed document control duties for 6 month period. Established document library at $400M power plant in Mason City, Iowa.  Management was great.  Gave you the freedom to perform duties of the position and allowed suggestions and free flowing ideas to be submitted and took ideas for process improvement into consideration. Hardest part of the job was working outdoors in sub-zero temperatures. I had to go out to outside storage lockers in the middle of winter to retrieve documents for the library."
good,I was first excited to work here because of the wage and benefits; along with potential to move up. Every other week the were new changes implemented that you had to learn right away and figure out on your own sometimes. I liked that we can choose when to take our breaks. Mandatory overtime was life sucking. While my hire class was still in training we had to do mandatory OT for pretty much 5 months; rarely time at home. It's emotionally draining.
good,"Alliant Energy is a good place to work. Benefits are comparable to others in the market place. The hardest part about working here are the limited growth opportunities. It is difficult to find opportunities in new work areas. A lot of contractors are hired in place of employees, limiting opportunities to gain knowledge about other aspects of the utility. Parking is an ongoing issue, and the cost is relatively high. The company does provide a small stipend to help cover the some of the cost, but the process of receiving the stipend can be a nuance."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  Was not on a warning and when some personal issues came up they weren't willing to accommodate and I was terminated. Co workers cared about you, great pay for the cost of living"
good,Job can be fun and challenging at time but boring and frustrating most of the time. Little to no promotion. lack of training funds but other departments seem to have limitless amount of budget. lack of management support. Management doesn't seem to care about the issues or concerns their direct reports are bringing up.
good,My job was the best.  There was so much going on there wasn't time to get bored.  My day consisted of a multitude of duties requiring shifting gears multiple times throughout the day.  The hardest part of the job was prioritizing tasks.  The best part of working for Alliant Energy was their flexibility.
good,"The typical day starts with logging into the phone system and answering questions from customers ranging from billing inquiries, and address changes to angry compliments about service."
good,"Good pay and benefits overall."
good,Salary was good pay for Customer Service work.  Parking downtown is awful.  Walked 5 blocks to get to work.  Health benefits average.  Poor direct management...no one on one interaction.
good,"busy in the summer time due to customer getting higher bills. option for overtime, has mandatory overtime. multitasking and fast speed environment........"
good,"Good Place. Wanted a permanent job, not temporary. Good training program. flexible hours and time off. Laid back casual environment. Would recommend to others."
good,"On a typical day, you'll be taking phone calls from a number of customers, internal and external, and making a variety of engineering  decisions."
good,"Small company feel with strong ethics and leadership.  Stable marketplace.  Main building in Madison, WI and smaller location in Cedar Rapids, IA."
good,"For me was an exciting and fast-paced environment especially when non-regulated, international work to do.  After selling those pieces of business, the regulated utility became a little stale and bloated as they absorbed a lot of good people."
good,"Alliant Energy is a good utility that provides an opportunity for its employees to learn and advance. "
good,Nice place to work. Good benefits and ability to move up within the company if desired. Most enjoyable part of this job is working with the technicians. Toughest part of the job is dealing with unruly customers and long hours at times.
good,A very good place to work and grow. I have happily worked there for 23 years. I've been able to try new things and expand my career. There are many opportunities for people open to change.
good,Good company. Good benefits.  Need to work hard and have thick skin if you work in a field environment.  Training is an ongoing process both online and on the job.
good,"Wide variety of employees tenure and backgrounds.  Company strongly supports diversity and volunteering.  Due to market conditions, company is moving towards a more shareholder vs employee focus."
good,As with most utilities you will have stable employment that can last a career. Ok benefits. Management is very inconsistent with management styles and expectations. Better get trained outside of this org because technical training is scarce ... even tho its a technical workplace.
good,Allaint Energy was a great company to work for.  I was provided exceptional ongoing training.  Their benefit package was a huge part of my compensation.
good,Given lots of opportunity to learn new things.  Bonuses paid when company did well.  Lots of diversity in the work I did.  Great employees and co-workers. Encourages and pays you to be healthy.    Big focus on safety at work and at home.

The goals of the project were to establish one IT process for all Legacy Application currently used at Alliant Energy.

As a BSA, I was responsible to define the system and business functionality that was available with in Planning IT.

good,"Worked in Substation and Engineering department in energy distribution. Projects included design new and retrofit distributions substation. Designed and programmed fault protection and sensor indication, communication to substation and distribution transformer in addition metering."
good,If you get along with the upper management they would hirer you on. Otherwise you get the seasonal position and stay there with little to no help on ways to stay
good,Looking to change with the changing energy landscape. In a major rebuilding mode as well as keeping up with the renewable arena.  The people are great!
good,"For the most part, they value their employees. The culture is very diverse. Alliant Energy has a solid track record for business performance. They tend to get top heavy when it comes to executive management and should learn from past behavior. The people working there are friendly and helpful."

good,"I had a great experience working at Alliant Energy, the management and co-workers are always ready to help you learn and grow."

good,"Learned many new skills that will help me pursue my career in IT. People are very nice and always seem to be in a good mood. Management is very helpful, especially when you have questions."
good,Partial autonomy to prioritize my days in accordance to what needs to be done. A bit of micromanaging from my direct higher up. Great bonus and personal days given almost right away.
good,Alliant Energy is a good company to work for.  Management has always treated me with consideration and a willingness to accommodate whenever possible.  Most of my experiences associated with Alliant are pleasant ones.  Made many new friends while there and learned much.  There is plenty of room to grow with that company provided your willing of learn.
good,During the internship I was able to learn what it meant to be in the field of project management. Training and help from supervisors were always available.
good,"Like all call center jobs if you've ever had one. there is a lot of office drama, but if you can look past that this is a great job with many different career options. management (actual management) is very supportive and goes out of their way to help you. lower management (entry level - coaches etc) are very in your face for what ever reason."

good,Have a energetic routine to encourage the CSR's to be positive and inviting to customers.  Train reps to handle difficult situations and bring a good outcome to every situation.  Handle multiple emergency situations that are life threatening under a controlled stressful environment.

good,"During my time at Alliant Energy, I learned many new skills and had a chance to work on some of the industry leading tools. I had no experience working with utilities before joining Alliant but the team was very helpful and supportive to me and they used my skills and knowledge in betterment of both. I had an oppertunity to learn Workforce management tools, GIS, ArcFm and many other tools. I got to learn optimization of ClickSchedule, worked with their system architect, working effectively and efficiently in fast moving and target oriented environment. The hardest past was to satisfy everyone on the project team with their needs but everyone did a great job and both of the projects went live and had great responce from Field techs and CSRs and that was most enjoyable part."
good,"Great company to work for, my position was eliminated after 26 years of service otherwise I would have stayed with Alliant Energy until I retired."
good,"Overall, AE is a great employer. They're extremely organized, with highly effective communication across departments. Work is done collectively and deadlines are also known company wide. Managers are considerate of family life and offer flexibility. Benefits are good and pay is good - they just tend to hold back on promoting."

I have learned how to use different interfaces and design software. I have learned how to prioritize and refine my organizational skills. The work culture is a lot of fun, and well managed. The mot enjoyable part of the job is learning new things and working with others to accomplish goals. the hardest part of the job is learning so many things in a short period of time."
good,"The job has the tendency to be very stressful and long. However the company has created a great culture for employees and offers a lot of support and resources for employees to fall back on.
