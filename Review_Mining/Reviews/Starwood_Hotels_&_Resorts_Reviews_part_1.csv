rating,review
bad,They tell you one thing then when your hired all other things come into affect and the things you were told goes out the door. They go off seniority and if your not one of the old workers you don’t get took serious or they don’t care to help the have their pickd and it’s sad horrible place to work
bad,"This company cuts your hours so that you are not eligible for the health insurance.  They work you like crazy and do not appreciate you. Also, they blame front desk staff for not filling the hotel and want you to multitask, pulling you away from the desk.  Work the housekeepers like slaves."
bad,"The worst managers ever and the worst work environment, compensation and the worst coworkers that you’ll ever have on this planet! I DON’T RECOMMEND Marriott International Inc!!!"
bad,"Management sucks the HR"
bad,It's not the Marriott family it's the general manager and housekeeping boss ...you do 17 rooms they want you done in 5 hours ..they are terrible boss's no lunch no break's please don't ever work at the one in Fairfield Marriott in Pittsburg pa please there only 4 employee everyone keep quitting
bad,The management team was evolving every 3 months which did not provide any clarity or support for the restaurant staff. We were not encouraged to make decisions to support the ultimate customer.
bad,I refuse to answer this survey simply bcim being forced to fill it out. Sharing my experience should be voluntary and I’m choosing not to answer truthfully.
bad,I enjoyed being around a diversity of people and some lovely events and people.  I liked being dressed everyday and greeting the customers and hotel patrons.
bad,I’ve had a bad experience over the last year co workers are very judgmental and bias if the  managers actually took the time and figure out what is wrong maybe issues like that can be resolved.
bad,Work/life balance is horrible. You’re too tired to do anything except sleep and try to prepare yourself for work. I recently had a baby and I felt like I was punished for having my daughter. HR doesn’t care about you as a human being. Terrible company.
bad,"There are no blacks working in regional management. None. Marriott prides themselves on being the most diverse company amongst other Fortune 500 companies and they are, only for hiring lower level positions. Cleaning rooms and repairing and upkeep but as for growth into regional positions, they won’t even blink and consider you if you don’t look like “them”."
bad,"My Marriott was managed by Crestline, which made it a horribly horrendous place to work.  Managers are uneducated, and do not understand how to run a business.  Crestline as a company is absolutely horrible."
bad,There were to many  I think if there was better management maybe the employee  would stay with the company  an get ride of teenagers who doesn't know anything about there jobs I think if they don't have any problems  there  ot going   no further in there emplyme t
bad,It is a toxic work environment...more people leave than stay...top 5% of management is all for itself...always had to be watching my back with supervisors.
bad,"No work life balance, "
bad,Management needs a course on how to treat employees  with respect . Human resource too. Marriott hotels are a great place to work but when you put incompetent people in charge you get a ticking time bomb. Work at the San Juan Marriott in Puerto Rico.
bad,No consistency or trust among co-workers or management. No communication! I worked St. Louis west locations. Very disappointed with management at both locations. Always a revolving door with employees.
bad,"MARRIOTT claims to have an open door and no retaliation policy, but they protect the wrongdoing and punish the etchical employees."
bad,"Had a new boss no one would have quit in 2019,,she is mean to all her housekeeper,don't care about you even as a person,talks about her housekeeper,,not a good place to work with some boss like that,"
bad,"Sobrecarga de trabajo, malos compañeros, habladurías por doquier, caras falsas y todo en malísimas condiciones desde ropa de cama y limpieza en general de las habitaciones, un asco!!."
bad,"this company sucks . they provide a bad insurance for employees which you pay but does not cover anything at all. "
bad,This was one of the worst places I’ve worked in my 30 year career. The male managers never did anything but criticize. Worked 80 hour weeks without any thanks at all. The “management “ didn’t know what they were doing. Too many events never enough people or managers. Never recommend this place ever to anyone.
bad,"No room for any mistakes. They will terminate you if guests wrongfully accuse or complain about you. They don’t look out for their employees. They are guest driven and will let you know it every time with a write up if a guest complains about you. Lookout - If you are suspended, consider it a termination, because they won’t bring you back! Couldn’t work in such a plantation like organization!"
bad,At first the company was a good place to work for and didn't have any issues up until my 5 month of employment. Pay checks have been short and payroll claims their fixing the errors. Employees shouldn't stress over not being paid and monitoring hours every day because of system errors. Being told this has happened numerous of times you would think they would find a way to correct the issue so that you wouldn't have this issue again. Better benefits especially for pregnant women and pay employees for holiday pay. Management seems to have it easy and just relax and not worry about anything. Communication can be improved big time especially when you are contacting payroll about your paycheck. You shouldn't be punished because other agents aren't meeting goal to work from home or any other role.
bad,Worst job ever managers are nasty or young and don’t have any clue or experience at all they just got the job by being friends with the boss the pay is only good for a high school kid and they don’t give u insurance only vision and dental I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy
bad,Honestly did not relay like the hotel. Bosses were never available if I had a issue. There was a high turnover rate. It was very uncomfortable working there
bad,it was horrible dirty work enviroment wit no care for workers. a lot of nonsense and hate no one held true to Mr. Marriots core values ran down and horri
bad,"Too many rooms to clean in expected time, not enough lunchbreak, bullying management... the list goes on. Do not listen to employees concerns or complaints. Employs alot of foreign non English speaking workers so communicatio"
bad,"Pas d encouragement "
bad,It's a nice place to work at if you're first starting  out no. Not this season the housekeepers hourly it's something that's very important 40 hours is something that is needed
bad,"Warning don’t work at Marriott.  You will be very sorry if you do. What a messed up company. The HR directors and senior manager are corrupt, to include the internal investigation staff"
bad,Be prepared to enter into your juvenile years again. This is a very non inclusive environment where management place favoritism and if reported will retaliate. The job at hand is easy if you do not mind physical activity. Housekeepers are treated like second-rate citizens and the pay reflects this as well.
bad,"This place is a huge insult to the industry. 1 management sucks really bad "
bad,"I’ve worked for the Marriott brand for two years before accepting a position at Tulsa southern hills location. I will have to say that it was THE most unprofessional place I’ve ever worked. One shift supervisor ask me if I knew of any where to get opiates. Like for real? Other managers just yell out threats like cutting throats, or cutting fingers off. Hardly saw the GM. The Management here sucks. Ever wonder why this hotel has a high employee turnover?"
bad,"They expect everything, give nothing. Cliques, rumors and favoritism.  Snitches and uneducated a** grabbing perverts is the only kind of advancement they offer."
bad,"The culture at this Marriott was horrible. It was so poorly managed. Personal issues and spitefulness drove the management team. Attitude reflects leadership, and that was evident with this manager. "
bad,"I was fired from the Marriott because a girl said that I did something did they called gross misconduct. She said that I spit in her drink, but nobody saw me do this and they had no proof of this because it was a lie. I was not able to defend myself whatsoever, and this person harassed me from day one but I was fired. Everything was swept under the rug did she did to me, but when she brought up Ally that she couldn't defend"
bad,Was treated poorly and like I was easily replaced. I was pregnant while working here and was treated tearable because I couldn't keep up. Worst job ever.
bad,Very unfair. No breaks even 8 or more hour shifts. GM looks for any petty things to call you in office so he can show his authority. No appreciation or thank your whatsoever.
bad,"Everywhere you go, you're going to find managers who just don't care about their employees. And nowhere was that more evident than at the San Francisco Airport Marriott Waterfront. The managers did not want to assist and stayed in the back. They only appeared when their managers or high profile guests were present. The back of the house is absolutely filthy. Fruit flies and garbage everywhere."
bad,"Horrible management, the place is a dump smells like a bathroom everywhere you go and it is out of date. The staff are also u bothered by the horrible conditions and have attitude to match the smell. Take your money to the new home2suites right on the corner."
bad,The managers are never there. Always calling in. They blame you for work that doesn't get done that is there responsibility. Barely train you before they just throw you to the wolves my friend was fired for calling in 3 mins to late....one time no prior warnings poorly ran establishment....
bad,"This place is the worst hotel to work for. The housekeeping manger and supervisors were beyond rude. They over work you and under pay you. They can never keep a PM housekeeping aid. I would not recommend no one working here, you would regret it."
bad,"This company claims to offer full time hours and a positive environment but they offer up minimal hours, require you to use any pto you (eventually) earn to make up for the shortfall, and they are abusive, demeaning and play favorites. Awful company. Hands down the worst job I’ve ever had."
bad,Owners of this hotel and others are doing bussiness and getting richer by building other hotels off the hard work of the housekeepers paying 7.75 an hour while at very busy times they charge up to 199.00 a room would never recommend this job to anybody owners are out for themselves and could care less about their workers
bad,"General Manager was not professional at all. To get in contact with her you had to constantly email/call. She never responds, but the day to day manager is awesome! Just the general manager makes it very hard for people to enjoy working there."
bad,"Marriott International makes so much money on the back of their employees. However, I felt like I was slave working for Marriott plantation. Most people who keep working for Marriott are people who don't have any other option."
bad,"I would not recommend this company, they don’t have compassion, they let people with little experience work over people with many years under their belt"
bad,This company was very stressful and there was no support from management. The General Manager was not active with his staff and would not speak or acknowledge his staff.
bad,"Marriott has a lot of great things when it comes to ability to move up, but there is a lot of corporate backstabbing and games that make it difficult to feel the ability to trust many.  It would be much better if people were transparent and didn’t always have hidden motives."
bad,the  rooms have mold and mildew in them in hammond la i should be getting paid 11 dollars a hour they are very unprofessional even the ones that sits in the office they not no equal emoyee oppurtunity they dont let us eat for free the housekeepers are the only ones that always have to go the extra miles to make sure we get our job done the supervisor and inspectors leave for hours
bad,The Austin ccc is an absolute horror to work at. The management pick favorites and if they don’t like you for a petty reason they will do everything in their power to make your job miserable. The HR staff do not care about your problems only their friends problems. And everyone there is a moron. Literally some of the managers only are there because they slept their way up or brown nosed. Everyone only cares about themselves. It’s a super toxic work environment
bad,They basically try to trap you by keeping you working the same position at the same property forever. To make a long story short I ended up unemployed for three weeks because they played games when I moved and requested a transfer. Had to find another job and work for another company. EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL
bad,"this place is horrible, the management is terrible, they force you to stay past your end time or even close without asking, you will get yelled at about the smallest thing if you are a closer, you’re not allowed to take off certain days because apparently there isn’t someone to close for you, the director of food and beverage tells you you look miserable and will make you feel terrible all the time and treats employees with no respect, many other reasons there is so much wrong with this place! You will also get yelled at about going into overtime"
bad,Horrible leadership and work culture. They act like they care but just keep adding more to your job and less to theirs. The only thing upper level management cares about is where they are going for happy hour. Wayyyyyy more better companies to work for. DONT DRINK THE RENAISSANCE KOOLAID!!!
bad,I hated working here. People were rude. You were expected to meet unrealistic goals. It just wasn't a fun place to work. And the hours were awful. And you didn't have a say in your schedule.
bad,"Not the best place to work. I would not recommend getting a job there. you will be over worked , undervalued, and not appreciated. If you have restrictions for a temporary basis, they will ignore your doctors request push you to your limits until it is borderline a lawsuit."
bad,"this hotel used to be called 4 points in Melville."
bad,Constant harassment.   11 minutes per day for your bathroom break.   Management very condescending and rude.   No chance for advancement and no matter how many bookings you get out of one call ... nothing comes of it re $$ because you took too long completing the sale?  But the management gets the commission.
bad,"They treat their housekeeping staff, like something to find on the street. management, really had no idea what they were doing,and when i was out sick they wanted my personal information from the hospital, i went to.."
bad,Very poor management. Lots of favoritism and lack of sufficient pay for employees. Hours are reduced certain months. The time they give you to work is not the time you are finished.
bad,Definitely had its ups and downs . Not the kind of job I prefer but pays fair I guess . Hope who ever sees this enjoys their stay at the hotel it’s really beautiful inside and out
bad,"Poor management no regards for your family or life outside of work. "
bad,"Constant harassment and ridicule by department head in sales. Sales department head has a ""Hazing-like"" work environment for employees who coincidentally are minorities / LGBT. The hotel is run by a third party which means a lot of the conduct executed by management is not officially approved by Marriott International, Inc. During my employment I was victim and witnessed colleagues being belittled and bullied by the department head. I could not respect or work for such a small minded management group. Praying that the rest of the sales team makes it out OK."
bad,"I am starting and leaving with this... you have no room to breath and not one person inside of that building can be trusted. In one ear out the other. They don't care about your lives, every man for himself. Hispanic lady's think they own the place and they get paid allot more even if they don't even understand a vowel of English. Worst working experience I have ever had so far and I will never ever go back to work for this place."
bad,"Unfair/poor management unless you're involved with your manager on a personal level  "
bad,The Marriott in Vincennes will not treat you fair if your an outsider. They will not allow you to grow within the company. Housekeeping Supervisors are beyond poor professionalisms.
bad,"Company that tells you how great it is, every day. But uses people for their volunteer experience and promotes it as it's own volunteerism. Drink the Kool-Aid and you will do ok. Low pay."
bad,"If you like being under a microscope and never advancing, apply there, they have had the same GM FOR 35years,same management in place for 20 PLUS years ...and their events person thinks she runs the place! Some of the staff members are okay ,but in general the MGT SUCKED BIG TIME...no advance, no moving up ,and definitely no career levels to see at all! Sad sad sad sad place to work ,it’s where souls go to die! Housekeepers have that place in tip top shape though! Glad I gave my"
bad,I do not wish to disclose any information as it may lead to the discovery of my identity and subsequent retaliation by management on property. although it is considered anonymous I do not trust the validity of that statement.
bad,"The manager always had me doing her work. I worked 40-48 hours a week, even though I was classified as part time, and I didn't get paid as much as I should have."
bad,A typical day would have a front office meeting with staff at 9am. Communicate with all the head departments about issues and/or potential issues with the property or guest.
bad,"Even if you are a supervisor/middle manager you will be treated poorly, I left after 3 months of hostile treatment. The management is poor and unsupportive. If you have an issue with a manager calling you an offensive and discriminative name then expect nothing to be done and expect constructive dismissal. I was so depressed by the time I left I had to go on anti-depressants and take a year off work."
bad,"Horrible place to work!! Management is very poor"
bad,I found the Marriott culture to be very GOOD OLE BOY.  Minorities are under utilized.  There is a lot of favoritism.  They are not open to really and sincerely promoting minority talent.
bad,"Management keeps on changing, no job stability, no proper training, they do not even provide induction, and even after the bad training you try your best they just blame everything on you even if it is not your fault. if their was below 1 star I will give it to them."
bad,"Everyone was weary of eachother, did not work with eachother, dog eat dog world, fend for yourself, watch your back, bad work environment all the way around no matter what department you worked in."
bad,"A lot of discrimination I have been working for the company for seven years.I was terminated due to my health condition, and I was coming to work late, and I still was doing my job. After I got terminated, I did not get any unemployment, and I was broke and almost homeless.And it is hard to get a position after you work hard after all these years because I am African- American."
bad,"Don’t work here. It was a horrible experience, understaffed, customers on hold for 30-40 min at a time. Management was terrible, they ruined my hours. Underpaid me on 2 pay checks in a row."
bad,I didn't get paid at all for working. I had people keep watching me while I was working. I knew how to do my work on my own and I was still being watched
bad,Worked in West Des Moines as a shuttle driver measly $9 an hr. Also never got a paycheck. Avoid the Marriott Jordan Creek Parkway. Thieves.  Plus they’ll make you pick up cigarette butts out front too making you look criminal. Not worth the hassle.
bad,"Lied about wage I'd receive. Lied about days i would be scheduled. Frequently left with no backup. Forced to work through unpaid lunch every day. I was guaranteed 16/hr. I was also promised day shift and to be off weekends. After the first week, when I can not return to unemployment, I was put on nights and weekends. My pay was also 14/hr. When complaints were mentioned to management,  was told that I should have gotten the agreement in writing. I was also told flat out that I am not to receive pay while being forced to work through unpaid lunch. I reported the company to the labor board. Every individual on night shift received a few grand from unpaid work thanks to me. They instilled a culture of fear where everyone was too scared to report them in case they'd lose their jobs. This was the least productive 6 months of my life. I was making 400 a week on unemployment and 300 a week from bouncing on the weekend. That's to these people I was reduced to 560 before taxes."
bad,Very poor place to work. Poor management. Housekeeping and laundry understaffed and expected to do a 2 person job alone. Management is very cheap. Would recommend to not waste your time applying.
bad,"Is a good company to work for it helps in trying to developed your skill, it allowed you to growth with the company and assist you in relocating, great benefits."
bad,I loved the position. I loved the idea of actually working in the housekeeping industry and working there was very stressful. Management was terrible no employees and that was hard because I wound up working for little pay at both locations. It was slavery there.
bad,Poorly managed job. I'd rather work somewhere better than this place. They don't care about anyone but themselves. If they had better pay and management then it'll be worth our working time.
bad,would not recommend anyone to work here unless they want to get a dollar and 50 cent raise after 5 years of work smells like chlorine and maintenance  doesn't want to drive back to the property
bad,"while working at the Marriott I had fun, I was able to meet many different kinds of people, and I loved my manager, she was very kind and understanding and very relatable."
bad,Do not work here unless you want to be emotionally abused frequently. Make sure you don’t have a life before starting the job because you will not have one.
bad,Job descriptions don't cover actual duties and managers are extremely two faced. Black mold in ceilings in employee only areas such as the parking office and poor safety conditions.
bad,"Management is absolutely horrible. They will hire you for front desk, but have you working in the bistro everyday. I guarantee if you work here you will find yourself waking up before 5am just to make it on time to open the bistro. They’ll tell you that you’ll only work bistro once MAYBE twice a week to cover off days. Do not believe it. The Courtyard Acadian Centre location has extremely high turnover for this exact issue. Individuals applying front desk find themselves stuck making Starbucks drinks and cooking food at the wee hours of the morning. And like I said management is horrible, specifically the AGM. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT apply here. I guarantee you will regret it."
bad,"I never worked for the Marriot company. I worked for a company that leased out the casino area. It was Cannery Casino resorts. I don't really know of their core values, I only knew of ours. We worked well together, however their costs were a little high."
bad,"the management has no clue what they r doing or how to even run a hotel. they don't care about how clean you get the room, they don't care about the employees, or their laundry attendance or the guest's. THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT HOW FAST YOU GET A ROOM TURNED OVER AND THEIR YEARLY BONUSES. The housekeeping and laundry team are not part of the front desk team and the GM makes that very clear that the front desk is the only reason the hotel business is still going.  housekeeping and laundry always run out of supplies and it usually takes a month till they get what they need. Every 6months to a year their is a new supervisor in housekeeping, the schedules are made and it goes by who the supervisor or GM likes then they get their schedule set and it never changes. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WORK OVERTIME AT ALL. The schedule is set for only a start time not an end time cause anything over the end time would mean overtime and the upper managers makes it clear that is for the management bonuses. I really feel sorry for the guests that stay their now cause nobody even knows if the sheets are getting changed on every checkout or even on the full services"
bad,"unprofessional work environment, no work/life balance, with low pay. The quality of the product that you are presenting on a  daily basis isn't really representing the brand."
bad,"I worked as a room attendant for the luxury W Hotel on Leicester Street in the center of London. Was treated like a slave in an extremely stressful environment for a lowest salary of 7.83. I was so busy that could hardly find time to have meals or go to the toilet. Poor training provided in a hurry by other room attendants. "
bad,"worked there since 2012, the situation after the strike is not good at all, "
bad,Not the best place to work. Always changing your schedule last minute and never wanted you to work where you were comfortable or enjoyed. Not the best hours.
bad,"I worked at the reservations center on Bainbridge for 8 years."
bad,"Nightmare metrics and slow prehistoric apps created for third world countries.  Possibly because they are soon going to be completely outsourced to India."
bad,"I currently work for Marriott as a sales rep and was hired as a reservation specialist."
bad,"Management is corrupt unethical and cruel. Very long days, ranging from 15-17 hours per day on property with no time in lieu, nor support or recognition. You will be worked to death at this property. There are two types of people that leave the Westin Bayshore, those that are completely broken or those that never return to hospitality again."
bad,Nama saya gusdinar apa bisa ikut bergabung sebagai teknisi di perusahaan yang bapak /ibu pimpin
bad,"This place is a joke, the company does not care, the management is shady. Stay away from Marriott anything at all cost, espeically if your going to sleep in a hotel, ask for fresh cleaned sheets."
bad,"Poor management, favoritism from bosses. Very bad training if any at all. The entire security staff was a joke little or no communication between shifts."
bad,"The merger between Marriott & Starwood was rushed. The system does not work correctly, There was little to no training on the new booking system. Both customers & employees are frustrated. It is now basically impossible to meet the new bonus set up which means a drastic cut in pay. I loved my job at Starwood, I do not like Marriott nor can I afford to pay my bills on my pay. The majority of benefits we had with Starwood have been either decreased or cut"
bad,"We were used and abused to train a workforce of 6000+ associates on a new reservation system that was untested.  We flexed hours working extremely early or extremely late, weekends, random hours throughout the week.  I loved the work i do and I expected to be rewarded for my dedication and loyalty. Instead I was kicked to the curb and the ""clique"" associates were retained.  They even disregarded my ethics complaint. It was a great job under Starwood hotels and resorts.  i've never experienced such poor management and leadership as I have in the 2+ years since Marriott bought us out."
bad,"marriott corp are thieves and slave drivers they drive you crazy demand you wiork like a machine you have to put up with ignorant callers who believe thaatyoure a mind reader it sucked,, Worst job in my life!!!"
bad,Dont no what they are doing and there lead housekeeper is very unprofessional and does nothing besides barks ordereds and takes away other employees hours
bad,"Terrible experience, I wouldn't tell anyone this is a good place to work, managers don't ever listen to request and think they're always right , and theres a lot of employee drama. Bad place to work."
bad,i worked here for almost a year and during that time as a chef whom takes pride in his work was continually hazed and abused by my own team. if there was ever a problem it was because my boss did that issue. quick reference i went to the back of the kitchen during service and when i came back the chef had scraped my salmon off the grill and ripped it apart because he had an attitude and it reflected on me not him. this was one of many incidents that led me to leave.
bad,this job was too stressful at this work and they was always making you hurry up and more times they would not let you have a break or more time they will give you have 15 to 20 rooms to do by urself
bad,Their pay isn't enough to live on and employees are treated like they're garbage. Belittled by management without any encouragement of what is done well and right they constantly focus on the negative like being tongue whipped. And denied of the10 minute breaks being reprimanded or made to feel guilty if you dare ask for one.
bad,"I loved work when the company was Starwood, now with the merge with marriott, it's a mess. New system that nobody knows work with. There no support for that system. all associates are in big level of stress at this moment."
bad,"I never felt like a part of any kind of ""work family"" there. Even though the management said everyone there is like one big family. that didn't really exist. But the job itself was very easy!"
bad,"Maybe this was just the hotel I was in, but I would very strongly discourage anyone from working in food service with this company. Those in the kitchen are completely forgotten unless they want to lecture you about what you're doing wrong. Management is nonexistent, you can only request a raise once a year, your availability schedule is ignored, and several front desk workers are extremely rude and think they're better than you."
bad,you work long hours..mangers are not understandable...I feel the hotel business is for those without families and or children because the manager want you to fulfill your shift even if you're sick or even if your children are sick so that they dont have to work
bad,People I worked with were extremely careless. The managers had no idea what he was doing. He did not respond to any of my concerns. Co-workers were rude and only cared about themselves. People will blame you for their mistakes.
bad,It didn't have a team feel. Most people didn't like each other. The manager is terrible at communication and the scheduled days are random. One of the housekeepers refuses to do their ob making it harder to tend to guests.
bad,"Starwood was amazing. Marriott is a basket full of lies. They're policies are terrible. Their care for the little people in the company stinks. I hate having broken tools so I can't help my associates. I want to care but I can't because corporate is a bad word. They are a *insert foul language here* company and they are running everything Starwood stood for into the ground. They only care about money, not their guests."
bad,The managers are emotional and the assistant managers are basically yes men. As well there are a lot of bias rules that aren’t followed by all staff members.
bad,"doesn’t retain their employees due to poor management and overworks staff. Inventory necessary never arrive on time for use, workers always lacked the tools to complete efficient work. Poor management, always mishandled budget and unable to hire additional employees for help."
bad,"THE MANAGERS ONLY LIKE MOSLEM,"
bad,"First when I started I thought that the place was really organized and everyone there gets along there but boy was I wrong, these people are very rude and ignorant and treat the employees like they don’t have a life of their own. And the only way they’ll put you on permanent you would have to know your coffee really good, they don’t care if you are very hard working and very dependable meaning never late for work and always on time and do what you are always told no matter what and even coming in when the other employees would call off. I had to put up with rude employees and other people attitude on this job only to try to stay permanent. This place was really a waist of my time and I wish I would have left when I saw others leave and never return."
bad,They had me work Labor Day 30 checkouts I’m the only housekeeper @ housekeepers with holiday pay we’re off so I left work early on that day the following work day she called me told me not to return unless I had a doctor note luckily I had my doctors note but I called the General manager explained to her how Unfairly I was treated by the head of housekeeper & told her I would not be returning I have 4 years experience im a good worker I’ll get another Job but u Gone Respect me & treat me fair ....Now she is another housekeeper down Good day Marriot!
bad,"Never again ...they don’t value there’s staff ...irrespective how long you have been in service ...company value targets for profit ...I would not recommend this company to anyone ....they treat you like a lemon ,they squeeze you like a lemon and then get rid of you."
bad,Managers don't know the job that they hired you for. You are required to make them look good and get nothing in return for hard hours spent doing so...
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone it's so much favoritism here and management isn't the best. The turnover rate here is so high due to management.
bad,"Management is not there to help you."
bad,There was no room for growth. I learned a lot from fellow co-workers but getting actual certifications was not allowed. HR is terrible and very absent. There was plenty of appreciation from other co-workers but their turn over rate was abismal.
bad,"A terrible company to work for. Be ready to give up your life for the hotel, you will work back to back shift (get of at 11:00pm and have to be back to work by 6:00am) management does not care about its employees"
bad,"I worked there with 5 different General Management "
bad,They do not have their employees back they are racially biased against blacks the manager show favoritism towards the people that they like ones that are in the ethnic background
bad,"Not Enough training, terrible work experience, management was not great. Company had favorites. Not much of a personal life, was all about work, Not enough pay for the amount of work that was given."
bad,"Bad management, bad owner, the worst place I have ever worked in. They know nothing of customer service. I do not recommend this place for employment."
bad,"Marriott is a great place for the guests, but not for the employees because they hire cheap labor. They just use them to the maximum. The management at the World center Marriott sucks because they are all corrupted while I was there. I would never go back again."
bad,"Sheraton Hotel was a great place to work at the time, but overall it was not a very good place to work. Everyone was overworked and the managers were not the best to deal with. "
bad,"The job was super cool and so were the guys I worked with. I didn't care for the GM or any of his direct staff, they were just a bunch of pencil pushers."
bad,"Not a good company to work for they don't care for their employees."
bad,Enjoyed when I first started. got worse year after year. Never will work in hotel again at least not Marriott. Not enough to encourage employees. Always quick to knock you down
bad,You work hard and there is the lack of pay and there is no incentives and forget about being promoted. They promoted people with no experience and that haven't been with the company that long
bad,"Benefits are ridiculously overpriced, manager was a nightmare to work with along with never being property onboarded into the position and expected to book and maintain accounts"
bad,Management here stinks in so many ways. Had to work in the AYS with dirty dirty nasty carpets....lots of roaches in employee break room....the food for the employees nasty...
bad,"Horrible experience. Management completely inadequate. No consideration for the staff whatsoever. Very high turnover. Worked there for 1 year and so many staff came and left. Well except the one guy who was willing to screw everyone over to please management and 'get ahead'. If thats the kind of employee you aspire to be, then you could be quite miserable there :)"
bad,The night auditor is a bully and the upper manager doesn’t do anything about it. The housekeepers are all great. Very dead end job. Lots of gossip. Bad morale. You get treated horribly if you work front desk.
bad,treat you like idiots they are not nice they are not polite they look down on anyone who is not a front desk service worker they did however play games and give prized away
bad,"-Can't provide proper working equipment for employees  "
bad,manager was not very friendly and she treated me differently nevr got a lunch break and I had applied for part time but was workin 40+ hrs a week was never offered health insurance because I wasn't fulltime but still working 40+ hrs
bad,no benefits no direct deposit nothing is offered they pay less then most and dont do raises wouldnt recommend this place if you value yourself mckncvdkvncdkls
bad,The Marriotts  management and organization sucks they run all over in the housekeeping department. They don’t make sure the rooms are clean the managers just punch them in
bad,"entertaining, keeps me busy and concentrated. great atmosphere. offers great customer service and career opportunity. friendly environment, free meals and free gym."
bad,The work at Fairfield in Ponca City was a horrible place to work. The General Manager is the brother of the owner. There was not enough time to clean the rooms.
bad,"This company overall is a big disappointment. They love to hire from outside the company instead of from with in so if you apply expect to stay in the same position forever or even get demoted if they decide they don't like you or you can't do the position. The company also does not provide the proper training all of the employees need to do their jobs properly. They expect to train for two days to a week and expect you to know everything.  Also they have whats called the management team which is the general manager, HR, Controller, and Maintenance so personally I did not feel comfortable expressing any of my concerns because they would tell things to each other and it would only make your job more unbearable.  They also preach in there mission statement that there employees is one of there major concerns but in my opinion its the last all this company cares about is its profits hence why high turnover. So in conclusion if you plan to work here expect high turnover, no training, and little job satisfaction."
bad,"It's a hotel, which means lazy management, terrible customers, horrible coworkers, and suffering from every corner. It's a miserable place with greedy managers that hide in their office all day, doing nothing of any appreciable value."
bad,A uneasy work environment starts at the top. The attitudes and nasty comments trickle down because managers see the general manager speak to others that way and believe it is acceptable
bad,"If you work at this place and especially at this position I promise you will hate it. The housekeeping department is overworked and underpaid. As a PM Housekeeping Aide, you will have to do a ton of work for barely more than minimum wage. You will have to do the work of multiple positions and the supervisors constantly give you more to make sure that they have less work to do. This chews people up and spits them out, I worked there for a year and a half and saw over 25 people either quit or get fired. They can never keep a general manager. In the short time I was there, there were FIVE GM changes. Also the culture there is just weird. For some reason everyone tries to get each other fired. Like people literally spy on each other to to tell on them to get them in trouble. Everyone pretends to be friends, but they secretly hate each other."
bad,"good company management needs work, pay could have been much better.Liked the staff a lot. Work days were fast pace sometimes it seems as if there was not enough staff to cover the rooms"
bad,"the typical day world be having laundry basket over filling, days behind no team work effort. I applied for housekeeping job they one day just stuck me in laundry when person left . Noone to help get caught up."
bad,Call in time is standby time. Never paid. 4 hour lunches without pay for being on standby. 2 hours per shift if your lucky 2 to 3 days a week. 14% commission is robbing me. They force you to sell products to move up in commission percentage. You cannot consistently sell products to move up in commission if your hardly at work. Management doesn't care about you. Look for another employment opportunities.
bad,The training sucked at the Sheraton tysons. Management was terrible. There was alot of turn around. The management never came to you if they had a concern. The falsely accuse you. I recommend you look else where for a hotel job.
bad,"I worked for the Hotel chain not vacations worldwide. "
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with. But I had 5 different managers within a few months and I wasnt treated fair when I asked to be paid more even though more responsibility had been placed upon me.
bad,"Across the board, I have heard that the hotel lifestyle has zero work/life balance. You end up only have a life with those who work next to you. I was not willing to give up those important things to work in this type of industry."
bad,"As a supervisor my responsibility was to assure that the department ran smoothly. I would keep my staff busy with work, and made sure that they served their guest in a prompt and gracious manner. However, the incompetent management that supervised me was lazy and made a lot of extra work for me. I found myself working 6-7 day weeks frequently, while also doing jobs that were originally responsibilities above my pay grade; such as making schedules and ordering supplies."
bad,Decisions are made solely from a financial stand point.  They do not care who the crush or let go in pursuit of their ultimate goal of profit regardless of how small.
bad,"A typical day at Marriott was to get signed into my station and then read my emails. Then I would take calls on the phone for about 2 and a half to 3 hours. Then I would get a 15 minute break and go back to work. About 2 and a half hours later, I would sign out for lunch for a half an hour. Then back to work for another 2 hours, followed by a second 15 minute break. After my last break, I would work for another hour and then go home."
bad,"Lack of knowledge from stuff, poor management skills, not friendly atmosphere what effects employees mental health. Change of employees monthly thru lack of communication with management about finding solutions for problems with customer care."
bad,"This propert was at least run slightly better than their sister property, the Doubletree by Hilton Cincinnati airport. I say ""slightly"" because they are always understaffed as well, but they at least pay better & doesn't have an alcoholic Sales Director like the Doubletree by Hilton."
bad,"Absolutely the worst place I've ever worked. 18-20 rooms a day, sometimes more. You get days off but they call for OT all the time. Once you're done your rooms you have to help the same slow people every day. Management/supervisors don't care and are RUDE. Pay is not even close to being enough for the work you do. Don't bother working here, you'll regret it!"
bad,"You take upwards of 100 calls a day back to back with no break in between to even swallow. People are people so you get what you get. You are marked on your calls by metrics and you better get them or you are out. Supervisors are brutal they got to where they are before Marriott took over and they do nothing but brown nose hoping they will get further ahead. There are no advancements. You get 7 minutes a day of ""personal"" time to catch your breath between calls or go to the bathroom. This job doesn't care about you at all, they only want you to make sales and get off the phone to take the other 99 waiting for you. This is a last resort job."
bad,"Hotels are notoriously terrible at paying staff a fair wage.  Get paid more as a mall cop than you do being part of a 6 person team trying to cook for 2000 people (in one meal... they might have 6000 covers in one day)."
bad,I would recommend that the hotel needs to clean up mold in rooms.
bad,Management does not work on the weekends.  We have no supervision while working on the weekends which is our busiest time of the work week.  Management does not help out the employees whatsoever.  Lack of appreciation.
bad,The pay was commissioned based so it was very unpredictable.  The quality of employees hired was generally poor causing the few good employees to leave.
bad,"was accused of steeling several times when we were told to take our own trash out in black trash bags. had to clean 23 plus rooms before 3pm by yourself while each room is required to take 30mins or less to clean, not including doing all the refreshes before you were allowed to leave for the day on top of the 23 plus rooms. There is no room for advancement. This place has had multiple cases of bed bugs."
bad,"Not the greatest place to work due to politics but a good stepping stone job for a careers later in life. travel benefits are cool to, discounts on rooms."
bad,"work place culture is aggressive. Marriott corporate does not care about their managers only the bottom line. "
bad,great owners who hired wrong middle management time after time that scared off good contractors to maintain business. great location bad compensation for the therapist who is doing all the work.
bad,"ever.  Richmond, CA"
bad,"Hated coming to work in this miserable place.  Lousy culture and pay, management awful, and those are their good points! Will send ICE there to clean out all those illegals working there!"
bad,"The only Goal is the pass QA's once a year. The rest of the time, the want to do more with less and don't care how it is done. No professional management environment. No real experience there at all. History showed that since the establishment opened turnover has been horrific.  They run off people every single day.  Franchise locations are the worst. And it runs deep. Use to be a avid Marriott user, but no more. After working for them I have all respect for the brand. Only went to work for them for the price breaks on the hotels and because I respected them at one point. Use to be a Platinum member and thought they treated all of their customers the same but don't be fooled. They don't and they do not care at all about you."
bad,"I was a former employee of the courtyard by Marriott in Rock Hill, SC. It was very stressful, no communication, poor management, no teamwork and very unorganized. Lots of negativity from the first day that I started."
bad,Completely stressful work place. Management are the worst non professional Operation supervisor is a complete crook along with the GM will never listen to any complaints and is a  racist the operation supervisor was a complete and total petty bully  if she’s not friends with you she’ll treat you like trash  cancel either of them anything because they will talk about you behind your back today if you make a complaint they’ll tell the person that you complain about what you said when you said it and how you say it Mess that work environment not a good place to work made everybody feel as if there were in adequate and was worthless the housekeeping staff kept up the hotel but they treated all housekeepers like slaves
bad,hated the job because no matter what you did it was never enough.  Hours were never consistent.  Hired for a certain schedule never was.  Front desk manger was difficult to work with.
bad,I was labaled as a part time employee that worked one hour less a week to meet the requirments of full time for benefits. long hours that would only pay off through the tips and compliments you recieved.
bad,Low Wages and the management is not dependable.They treat their employees bad and the managers feel like they should not work. They don't make u feel appreciated..
bad,"The typical day was difficult with a short staff. I learned how to take care of staff. I was lacking guidance from the GM. We had to communicate with other leaders. The hardest part of the job was not havng a  GM. We could not get approval for change that was needed. The best pat of the job was dealing with customer. I loved dealing with my team, also."
bad,It used to be a a fun experience to work at but it went downhill really quick and it has stayed like that for months now. Every time that i attend work it is just to stressful no one seems to care about your work. I am over working there because of the lack of profession that the managers have.
bad,Very ghetto and dangerous area. There was plenty of outbreaks and fights around it. I worked there and seen a lot of guest coming or going injured from there. Tons of rats and do nothing about it. Not worth it nor to stay.
bad,"Worked for Starwood Hotels prior to the takeover. Everything enjoyable including atmosphere, workplace culture and management changed for the worse. I would not recommend Marriott. They do not care about their employees, you are simply a number. They prefer to have as little people as possible doing as many jobs as they can and cannot handle. They are more concerned with quantity versus quality of work."
bad,"Keine Bewertung,da ich nie in diesem Unternehmen tätig wahr."
bad,"The owners would talk down to, curse at, belittle and make fun of employees. Very cheap, wouldn't spend money on necessary products. They didn't want to pay employees a fair wage and refused to hire for much needed positions even if it meant they were putting current employees at risk. Nepotism everywhere."
bad,"Management is terrible, I was hired on front desk and since I have a lot of housekeeping experience they just make me do that. Which I do love housekeeping but I tried to help them out and told them what the girls were not cleaning. I get yelled at and then they almost failed BSA because of the lack of work they are doing.Housekeepers have to fold their own towels and they do not put the pillow cases in the sheet packs, which makes the day last longer, but then they tell us we have to be done on time. They do not let people go even when they do not do their job correctly because there is a lot of favoritism. Their Supervisors in housekeeping don't do their job correctly, they talk bad about their employees which is a no go in my book. They have 3 and only one of them does their job and helps out when needed.  We are always getting complaints on the rooms. There are bed bugs and I really don't want them to come to my house due to lack of taking care of the problem. I do my best and my best doesn't seem good enough to move up in this hotel, it is not Marriott's fault it is just this specific hotel."
bad,"Sales calls,  meetings, contracts speaking with clients performing site visits promoting the hotel and working closely with coworkers and directors to achieve a sales goal every quarter"
bad,"This job absolutely sucks. The management is poor, the job is just a waste. There's nothing to do, but stand around. Some of the worker are very unprofessional (managers to be exact). I wouldn't recommend anyone working there."
bad,"The location I worked at was very poorly ran. The management had zero interest in any employee, unless they directly benefited from them. They will yell, micro-manage, tamper with your hours to under-pay you. The hard working employees/supervisors get scolded and belittled on a daily basis. Unprofessional to say the least. The top management tells everyone’s personal secrets to everyone. It’s no wonder this place is like a revolving door. Everyone quits. High, intense stress levels with very VERY little pay."
bad,The hotel and guest were great... it's the management that is not the best and caused the hotel property to have a not so great reputation in the community. Which made my former job a hard sell to clients and organizations.
bad,My manager was nice at all and would not help with things I was struggling on. I did learn to be able to talk to customers without having to just sit in silence
bad,"So if you plan on being a manger get ready to do everyone job because if you do not and ask them"
bad,Horrible and i will not re command no one to work there. they do not give break and when you ask for days off they do not work with you. management horrible. manage no where to be found
bad,"General Manager treated all her employees with contempt and over worked everyone. Always cutting hours and expecting more work to be completed"
bad,"Was terminated from position for having an inappropriate relationship with my manager, who managed to keep her job in all the commotion. Torrid affair of the early 20's"
bad,"It’s all on how close you are to the management staff, tell other employees your personal business. 80% of management is family. Up to the district manager"
bad,La oferta laboral es Buena pero las personas encargadas de las contrataciones piden requisitos ridiculamente altos que casi nadie tiene y los que lo tienen ya tienen gerencias en todos lados. El sueldo no es lo suficientemente alto Como para lo que piden que un empleado tenga
bad,"Management wast good, Assistant Manager was awesome though! The abuse and slave labor expected of the employees is sickening! I would often do night shifts not getting off till 11pm and then expected to come in the next morning at 5am, which isn't even the legal requirement of 8 hours between shifts! We wouldn't get lunch breaks, forced to work a straight 8 hour shift without any break at all (which is also illegal) Don't work here if you value your sanity!"
bad,Terrible company to work for the culture is very fake and everyone has a crab mentality rather than helping one another. The pay is based solely on performance.
bad,"There is an atmosphere of disorganization, lack of training, benefits are not afffordable, no PTO, no vacation, no sick time no 401K"
bad,Totally new concept in hospitality by Marriott. We were the first to open one in the US. Coming from traditional hospitality i was unable to grasp the concept of associates being nonchalant and even borderline rude to the guest's needs.  I agreed to stay and get the F&B department open with all its permits and inspections and then I graciously left.
bad,Management is either passing the blame onto you or just not responsive to important issues. everyday was a fight to get work done because ur GM will have you do illegal business practices
bad,"I worked with lovely people:  all my co-workers and some managers, but never I felt they recognized my skills. And some of manager two of them gave me hard time and it was enough for me to loose my job. Lies and very unfairs situations until at the last moment I was working in Marriott."
bad,You show up at a specific Rock Quarry if you get a load great if not well that sucks for you because you don't make any money if your sittin still....
bad,"management is very bad there they work u hard for the little paid they paid u for and if u don,t do the job they fire you and if you want over time they would tell you no and work you like a slave for little for nothing"
bad,"As a professional cleaner I went to springhill hoping to help the team. What I was presented with was absolute mayhem. I have cleaned boards of over 30 rooms, almost daily. My first day the housekeeping director quit and it wasn't much better after that to be honest. Very upsetting. The supervisor was immensely toxic and spent most of her day hiding so she could smoke. I'm not sure about elsewhere but the one in Denton, TX is probably not the best place to work."
bad,"The management is uneducated , everything there is backwards. Unfair work environment. Inconsistent with practices, no one wants to take the blame. The place is filthy!"
bad,"This place is poorly managed. When the bartenders make more than you there's an issue. The staff don't resect management because of the high turnover. The staff told me"" don't worry you would be gone in a year"""
bad,Workplaced was way to serious! When the owner walked in everyone were on pins in needles. I was always taught if you are doing your job it doesnt matter who walks im becasue your ready. A very intense enviorment.
bad,"Worse place I ever worked, the mgt was dumb as a rock front desk staff at night was full of morons that would do anything the boss said to do and throw you under the bus in a heart beat! Stay away! Go work at Burger King!"
bad,"Job security poor,very hard day,nothing,the manger was hard to get alone with,too much work load on one person.Very nasty attitude.Having laundry done late at night"
bad,"i like to meet people and learn more form other people ."
bad,Working there was Horrible all they do is Gossip Gossip and Gossip management just sits on their butt all day or just walk the hotel the pay is POOR and they expect you to bust your Butt. Even the guest complained about how they treated us so you know that's a big issue .
bad,"Answer inbound calls to get the customer the best Hotel rates and book them for future travels,  and answer questions about Hotels and Resorts to get the best fit for that customer."
bad,"Maintenance was horrible in a lot of the hotel due to overuse of certain areas and rooms.  Poor planning did not allow for preventative maintenance and so problems would arise frequently.  The hotel is beautiful, but service wasn't as focused on as it should have been."
bad,"Stay away. They're robotic, insensitive, cold and calculated to employees as well as guests. Stress is created with no concern or consideration for staff or patrons."
bad,Working at the call center in San Antonio was a dream come true but transferring to a hotel was the worst. I was not paid the audit differential. I was lied to by the manager of the springhill in addison tx. Left a bad taste in my mouth that someone that had no management experience but only meeting rooms and groups got a job as a GM. No training of the hotel or dealing with employees. We dont keep secrets and lie just to get someone to work for you.
bad,"I had enjoyed so much working in Le Meridien, my manager is cool, co-workers treating each other as family.I learned so many things thru ups and downs"
bad,"While in training at Starwood they make it seem like the perfect job."
bad,"It's a franchised hotel, management is in the business of making money, but does not give raises or show appreciation to their employees. They look at it as if you need a job so you're going to take whatever they give you. The GM is not a nice person."
bad,"I have extensive experience in hospitality having worked at some of the most beautiful, prestigious hotels in New York City. First of all, I can't wrap my head around why the front desk has to handle duties such as preparing breakfast for guests, taking out garbage and picking up left behind items at the pool area. Based on my experience, these are not front desk duties, these are housekeeping duties. Also, I don't understand why there is always one agent per shift. Management never gives the employees praise but yet they complain about EVERYTHING. I feel like praise builds morale and make the employees WANT to be there. The break room at this property is DISGUSTING and they have a serious bug problem. Overall this place is a dump and I'm embarrassed to say that I ever worked here. They want you to do way too much for 10-11 dollars an hour."
bad,This was the worst job I ever held and I felt nothing but relief when I finally departed this hotel. No communication and the management here thinks it normal practice to take advance of their employees on a daily basis. The turn over at this property is the highest I have ever seen and if you accept a job here expect to take a the work load of two or three different positions that this hotel seems to roll into one for very low compensation. You have been warned!!
bad,"During the time I worked at this spa I was very disappointed in management.  There were responsibilities that I was given that weren't clear when I was first hired.  The supervisor was very disrespectful towards employees, dishonest and unprofessional."
bad,"They play favorites, hours are very scattered, unprofessional supervisors constantly on their phones and talking about other employees while sitting in the housekeeping office, selfish not a team based work environment girls constantly arguing about housekeeping carts if I could give this place a 0star rating I would."
bad,"It wasn't bad working they're at all but housekeepers do not get nearly as much credit as they should for the amount of work they put in!!!! Residence Inn was extremely short staffed at all times. Which left double the responsibility on the other housekeepers who actually decided to show up for work that day, it was very unfair. There were several employees from the same department all out on week long vacations at the same time..."
bad,Horrible place of business unprofessional managers customers that call are very rude benefits are not good pay is very low the company does not look out for the agents at all
bad,"Chef and Sous stay away you have no control in your position and do not want to pay!! No good "
bad,"As accounting manager, I work as general cashier, as income auditor and as accounts receivable, all at the same time. working long hours to get the job done. Highgate company"
bad,Not a very good experience for me others will think different they treat you as if they are doing you a favor the training program is really outrageous
bad,"Everyone is replaceable. Management cares less about the people that they manage.  Can't  get time off when you need, and management only cares about how many calls you take per hour."
bad,"Employees who have been there for many years think they are managers. Managers are afraid of these employees therefore given responsibility, scheduling preference and perks. Some managers don't care much about their employees. No team work. Many unproductive staff and managers that turn a blind eye. "
bad,did not feel valued as an employee also did not feel like i/we were a given the tools we needed to be successful. spent way too much time working under stressful conditions.
bad,"This business is no longer valid. They had a lot of favoritism and didn't offer much room for growth. They did however, have a lot of guests who were loyal to the brand."
bad,"The job itself was great but it was managed by people who could not manage a ""tic tac toe"" game.  Lost a lot of good talent including myself for that very reason.  Hospitality is a different industry and although the line workers know what they are doing, the managers don't.  They do not practice what they preach.  I would find a job making more money with less idiocracy above me in no time."
bad,extremely unprofessional and aggressive management.  No progression capability. Unreasonable working hours. Over worked. Under paid. Under appreciated.
bad,This is not a good company to work for. They set you up to fail. You are just a number. They will squeeze everything out of you for almost minimum wage. It is very difficult to get any bonus in sales and service. The people in leadership are cliquey. They promote their're own girlfriend/boyfriend.  You don't get an assigned cubicle so sometimes it's hard to get a seat. The computers are very slow and they tend to freeze in the middle of a call. Some of the guests are rude. Their scoring of calls are ridiculous. They are not flexible with schedules. Get ready to work a horrible schedule. Working hard and doing what your supposed to will not get you anywhere here.
bad,The General Manager at the Spring Hill is a racist and should never be allowed to work in that type of environment He is unethical and racist to the highest degree.
bad,"Not recommended, bad management, very usless HR deparment, the staff in general is not prepared and is very lazy, not ethic and profesional managers"
bad,"This company is NOT run by Policy..It is ran by each individual per dept. They do not respect each other and lots of major drama...Unorganized, Dirty, Unhealthy work place."
bad,"Frequent Management changes are hard to deal with. You must be friendly with the groups or you will not make it. Residence Inn in Memphis,Tn was the worst job I had."
bad,Nothing good about it. They don't care about you.All they care about is the job getting done. I don't have anything good to said about this company. The pay is the only reason why as anyone would either try.But the best advice is you don't have patience.Dont waste your time applying.
bad,"This hotel just made a year and is already on it's third GM and Third AGM. The company has too many people trying to be boss instead of doing their job. Rumors, lies, and gossip spread quickly around a small hotel, because of the unprofessional workers that are employed there."
bad,"Although management is fairly laid back and allows a bit of autonomy, their corner cutting and penny-pinching takes away from giving incredible service to guests. They are undeniably a decent group of people to work for, but some of the team members and leaders have selfish motives that can leave entry-level employees in disarray."
bad,First they do not even tell you that it is not a real Marriott but instead a franchise. Which makes a world of difference. They only need to meet certain standards. They treat their employees horribly and when they do good they do not even recognize it. Also the manager in training is anything but that. You are only seen as a supervisor and barely do any managerial work.
bad,They will treat you like a # or backstab you there is a ton of favoritism and if they don't like you they will make your life a living heartache
bad,"I have been working there for almost 5 year, and this is the time to move and find new job for me to show what I've learned in my previous job."
bad,Overall the employees were cool but occasionally stole from each other purses whenever they turned their backs. Hard work for the low pay. Never want to work here again.
bad,"my typical day at work is organizing and setting up the kitchen, making sure everything is ready and all equipment and supplies are in a good working order."
bad,No job security what so ever they hire to fire thats their motto this place needs to be reported to the better business bureau fgor fraud
bad,this could be a great place to work if management was better. Love the guest the issue is just management and i hope that it gets better.
bad,you are only a number and metrics at this place. your well being family health or emergencies are of no concern to this job!!!! this is not a good place to work. the managers aren't even accessible because they typically work from home out of state!!!!! awful place no windows terrible people no room for advancement.
bad,"I love Working at Residence Inn Marriott , Is fun we all work together and every Thursday we get together and have fun. the hardest part of the Job is the order every Tuesday and Friday I have to put them away. The most enjoyable part we don't   pay for breakfast."
bad,"mangament dont give you a chance to show qhat you can bring to the job."
bad,"The management at this place of employment is a joke. Noone seems to know what they are supposed to be doing. The turn over rate is high in mangement is high. The person that hired me was gone before my first week of training was over. The training was a joke, there is no set way that they train, they stick you in front of a computer program and at the end of every segment they state that the rules and procedures will be different at your property. The managment talk about employees in front of other employees and guests. They trash talk everyone. The compensation for the work that they want you to do is nowhere reasonable. I didn't have a health card and they were having me work in the kitchen,"
bad,"This is a Franchise location and it is the worst job and company I have ever worked for. The management was terrible there was no communication ever, and they would make employees responsible for 3 positions at one time. It was horrible."
bad,"When you join your asked to go on indeed and other recommendation sites to give them 5 stars and coach you on what to write."
bad,"This is one of the worst companies I've worked for, and I've worked a few jobs.   They don't pay much and work you half to death.   When you ask for Management to help, they don't.  They are useless.  They go through so many employees and management.  They're now started to lose their longtime faithful dedicated employees,  that should tell you something.  Director of Human Resources is terrible, she has NO clue as to what she's doing.  Stay as far a way from this one as you possibly can, you have been warned!"
bad,I worked here and it was bad... they test their lady employees like they aren't anything... they are supposed to make you feel safe but they failed at that
bad,"Manager never liked to work"
bad,"I find working in a hotel as a housemaid very demanding. I like working as a housemaid, and the feeling when I am finish with a room, when I look back at it, when it smells nice and is tidy, is very pleasant. But a kitchen porter is very stressful, especially when the hotel is full of people. "
bad,working for a franchised hotel has it perks. Only downfall is that your the only one working on the shift and you have no back up.
bad,"i hated working here"
bad,Management company is not supportive of workers advancements and concerns.  Employees concerns are not taken seriously.
bad,managers micro manage and the employees get no recognition for hard work. they think giving gift cards is supposed to make us happy for being  treated like second rate people.
bad,"I felt like I was managing my own managers, my other coworkers &managers were extremely rude & taunted each other daily, everyday someone is cussing someone else out, there were drug deals going on in the workplace with guests and employees, I got bit up by bed bugs during our renovation (bugs problem still there & I was told they came from my own place), sexuall harassment case was never taken seriously (he was also a scam artist & stole from other employees & went to jail while being employed & is allowed to come back to work), I also faced discrimination by management and other co-workers because of my alternative lifestyle, front desk associate charges alcohol to guests rooms and drinks it on the job (the scam artist), management steals from the budget, they will lie to u about full time positions that were never there, they messed up on my payroll & also took a couple hours away from me that I worked  so I would not get my overtime. We do not have the materials to do our jobs, and they expect us to perform miracles working in these type of conditions, Half the staff is high or drunk while they are working. The don't have enough pillows for the guests and we have to hand out blankets for guests to rest their heads on. We also do not have enough linen in case an emergency happens and we need extra linen. half the linen is old and has stains on it. I can keep going on..............  DO NOT WORK FOR RESIDENCE INN BY MARRIOTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It failed its last 3 expectations & they are close to getting their Marriott name taken away from them. This hotel is a dump and the worst"
bad,"They say you can  move up but it took almost a year to move from sales and service to spg."
bad,Management is so unstable or unprofessional.  The owners are untrusting and money hungry.  Staff is usually unhappy and looking for new jobs. I would not even bother.  All the good employees have left on their own...that's why they are always hiring.
bad,"Nothing in this hotel works. Always have problems with the elevators. No hot water, music super loud from the club across the street, you have to pay for parking,and the manager lady there is horrible how she became a manager, only God knows she's definitely not people friendly or employee friendly"
bad,"If you don't care about having your shift changed whenever the company feels necessary, this would be a great job for you. They gave my three days notice that my shift was changing from 10am-6:30pm to 3:30pm-midnight. Highly suggest thinking of another place to work."
bad,I have been employed for Marriott international for over six years now. This company is definitely a who you know kind of place and consumes your life for sure. The schedules are all over the place not consistent what so ever. Monday you may work a 2pm shift Tuesday a 6am shift and possibly three other times to complete your work week. The pay and benefits are good but at what cost...
bad,"Poor management, they have the culture but don't applied it, no respect towards employees, no support to employees who try to exceed our 5 most important clients.  Management don't believe in Marriott culture, they talk a lot, but nothing is done. SpringHill Suites Milford, Ct is a extremely disappointing place to work."
bad,"They encourage employees to work sick by not accepting doctor's notes and they require 100% attendance. I have been getting sick more here at Starwood then any other job i have had, and I've been there six months. For fear of loosing their jobs people are going to work with serious sickness, viruses, and flues. Starwood promotes an UNHEALTHY work environment."
bad,Challenges aren't being met and or addressed. Front line staff are THE driving force of this hotel's success. Management team is disconnected and unavailable.
bad,Night management position that lacked any sort of support from the day management staff and upper management.  Typical hours were 11pm to 7am.
bad,"Marriott is a wonderful company to work for.  I take on a lot of jobs within Marriott.  "
bad,"The manager made me do everything, work longer hours, would not work with me on school hours, or work with me because I had a Young child. I worked in the kitchen. I was the first to come in and the last to leave. The pay sucked. 9.50/hour plus tips but you got tax taken out of your check for the tips. splitting tips between 3 people didn't give you much to take home also. Supervisor did not care much about anything the employees had to say, assistant manager was very lazy, and the manager had a bad attitude problem."
bad,"Terrible Place to work, they pretend that they care about there people when really...not so much HORRIBLE people that call in for a free rewards program"
bad,"London county hall marriott - long hours, poor pay, poor upper management - GM. weak management, no career advancement. poor or no work ethic. old style management, no support from managers. confused human resource - not able to hire the right people. very dull work environment, strict, high work politics. poor customer service."
bad,Muy mala gestión y sueldos lamentable para un hotel de 5* que necesita 8 horas  de trabajó  para que este impecable y lo quieren en 5
bad,Managers have no back bone . Don't appreciate what workers do to make the hotel function poorly. Good coworkers relaxed environment to relaxed sometimes like said before
bad,"I loved the people I worked with, but the management was terrible.  They would join together and have each others back.  In effect the lower management and hourly employees would have to suffer injustices constantly."
bad,it wasnt worth working there and there were no benifits. ill have to work 10am to 9pm 6 days a week. management was horrible to the max. i would get yelled @ by customers trying to recruit them to college.
bad,you can not move up in this place they will tell you its room for growth but they are steady hire from outside and its not working out.
bad,"I usually don't write reviews but wanted to tell others about my experience working with this company.  I worked there a few months answering calls from guests.  Everyday I would deal with customers who had issues with vacation packages.  I ended up leaving because I hated my job."
bad,"More turnover than the Cleveland Browns ! 2 GMS, 5 HR coordinators, @ F&B MGRS, all in a year. Gained great experience through poor training and no accountability for upper MGMNT."
bad,At one point we had no manager. And employees did whatever they wanted. disrespected customers. Pay was low. Food would be dropped on the floor ad picked up and served to guests.
bad,"If you enjoy working in a call center and calling customers to sell expensive timeshares then this would be the ideal environment for you.  It is your typical cut throat sales environment that is extremely competitive and employees do what ever it takes to make a sale.  "
bad,"Not even close to be good place to work for. All fake and not actually care about the employers."
bad,"The Residence Inn in West Springfield was very unprofessional. I did not have the proper training for this job. Whenever I had questions, the Assistant Manager would yell at me and belittle me in front of customers. Because of this, I never fully learned the job I was hired to do. When I work for a company, I want to know my job inside and out so I can provide nothing but excellent customer service. If I do not know a job well, I am not able to provide excellent customer service. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
bad,"Not a place for advancement, seniority, very unprofessional environment. "
bad,"I got hired immediately as a front desk and a night auditor.  I was promised full-time hours (35 hours a week.)  When I was hired, there was one other person hired also and another person who was recently hired but already in the training process.  I was in training for two plus months.  I noticed that they had me in training that long because there was no where to put me.  The person who got hired with me quit.  I also wasn't getting the hours as promised.  The main reason they hired me was they had a horrible employee that I was supposed to replace and they were hoping she would quit, but she never did.  The Fairfield Inn I worked at had the worst organizational skills and didn't know how to efficiently run their business.  The only great thing about the job was the pay, and the hotel isn't worth the prices that they try to sell the rooms for."
bad,was in the hospital sick and i was fired even with documentation that i  was in a hospital bed and it is was ridiculous and needs to be a little more conciderate
bad,employees work together as a team to set up banquette rooms for 300+ guest serving three course meals in a timely manner cleaning polishing all  silverware and equipment
bad,I had good time checking people in and out at hotel meeting guests.  Helping guest find places to eat and visit. The benefits where good free stays.
bad,"Supervision was poor, they committed fraud & charged guest for baggage handling that no one ever touched a guest baggage then the supervisors lied about it, they also treated employees poorly & demanded respect at a very low level of professional conduct."
bad,"I didn't like working there. Hard work and little pay. No raises, worked hard yet was not appreciated or acknowledged. No room to grow in company."
bad,it is a great temp job. virtually no respect and one of the most uninspired work place culture ever. I beleive they try for temporary workers and slaves?
bad,"I am a very optimistic and happy person and while working here I've become the most miserable I've ever been.  I will say that the employees, non management, are some of the sweetest people I've ever met and the guest adored them.  If half of them were not in college I HIGHLY doubt that these beautiful people would stay there.  Management is a joke.  Even the guests would notice.  The General Manager is a snake, the Front Office Manager is always condescending, I've witnessed him make many of his front office associates cry.  The rest of the directors are the laziest most incompetent people I've ever encountered.  If you go to human resources with your issues, you will feel as though they are getting resolved but you will soon see that HR will make your life worse.  I would come home everyday in tears.  When their franchise management company  would come to visit the property, management would make their associate pretend and hide so much bs.  That place honestly felt like a concentration camp.  I developed so much anxiety while working there and my home life would suffer.  So much of my stress is gone now that I have left.  I am now happy to have a career where I am nurtured and I can be the best employee.  Work here and you will soon regret it!!  You've been warned!!!"
bad,"productive learned to repair hotel rooms,co-worker were very helpful,job was very demanding enjoyed working outdoors ,enjoyed helping customers"
bad,Guests are awesome. Responsible for acting in a support role to housekeepers and supervisors. Responsible for cleaning hallways and removing trash while providing great customer service. You can't always have the days you request off because of the very little staff.
bad,Since White Lodging took over the hotel has never been the same. do not work here. do not work here do not work here. this place could be better with new management. They do not respect the Vets
bad,This company ruined my life - I had the bad experience to have had a work injury here that required me to fight over 2 years with CSST after they fired me.
bad,"Dosent give hours"
bad,"Bad moral, poor business decisions, lack of professionalism, building falling apart"
bad,"working in the guest services, was a good field but the compensation was not good"
bad,Great organized and professional environment. Passionate management that create customer and employee friendly culture. Very hands on and personable.
bad,the list is too long. just do yourself a favor-take the job if you need one but never stop looking for a better one
bad,The management was very messy when it came to certain employees.  invading of employees privacy and information
bad,I loved the residents but they did not allow you to interact with them that much or you would get into trouble. I was let go by a supervisor over a speaker phone where all of the other caregivers could hear. The management staff was very unprofessional.
bad,lovely place. Great staff. willing to teach anything I need to know.
bad,"This hotel is poorly managed."
bad,"c'était l'usine, pas d'échange et toujours etre rentable, travail a la chaine"
bad,"Poor management with disrespectful clients."
bad,"I work front desk as a guest service agent, checking guests in and out of the hotel, dealing with guest requests and complaints. I have learned how to ensure guest satisfaction by dealing with and resolving guest issues by myself. The hotel has many employees and tends to retain them for a long time. They are like a second family to me. The hardest part of my job also happens to be the most rewarding, dealing with upset guests and ensuring they leave the hotel happy."
bad,Underpay.  Management don't give the employee a chance.  They believe everything the supervisor says.  The supervisor need to be trained on how to treat their employees.  Some employees work harder for the same pay than other.  Supervisors have their favorite picks.  You can't take vacations when you want.  No place to advance.
bad,"Great co workers, but horrible management. However It is awesome meeting guest from all over the globe!"
bad,The pay is rubbish for the amount of donkey work you have to do. Not an enjoyable company to work for AT ALL.
bad,I enjoyed working with the guest and making people happy. Bay Point Marriott was a very beautiful place to work.
bad,"Call Center"
bad,Management is horrible in that they do not address employee problems. The unionization is a joke. Pay is low. Demands of work due to severe understaffing are ridiculous. Front Office manager gossips about her staff and is extremely rude and unprofessional.
bad,"A typical day of work I would walk in turn on my computer and review all emails, I would answer all emails, telephone calls building blocks, I learned that staying on top of things would get you ahead on things, the hardest part of my job was people not doing there jobs so that I can do mine, I would have to wait on my work so that would delay me in doing my job, the most enjoyable is working with staff that really cared in your department."
bad,"It was a summer job, that I had before  I went to college; and it was not a good of experince."
bad,"terrible people to work for. horrible experience . insensitive.  a few coworkers ended up being lifelong friends, but overall, NO MA'AM."
bad,within 90 days of working there i came to work everyday on time  i even did extra work and helped others out i called off 2 times because of car trouble that they were aware of before the new schedule came out and on the second day of calling off i was supposed to be at work at 9 am and at 10 am they called and fired me didn't even give me the chance to call and let them know i just got my car fixed and i was on my way in its sad that im the only one the didn't give a chance to but plenty of others called off way more times than me within their 90 day period and for no good reasons but i am the only one fired and i can only speak for the one in novi i believe they are racist
bad,"If you want to do the job of 3 people, have absolutely no help from anyone and be constantly overwhelmed by trying to accomplish your tasks while management looks on without pitching in then this is the job for you. Poor wages for the work you do, absolutely insane management as they berate you for not being able to do the impossible and no guarantee of hours makes this one of the worst employers in Halifax. Look elsewhere. Even fast food would be better then this place."
bad,"This has to be the worst ever company I have ever worked for!!!! I was bullied and treated less than a human being. I have a learning disability and refused to helped me. My supervisor often said to me if you do not like it here leave."
bad,"clean rooms daily, wash laudry, assist guest with check in/ check out"
bad,help expand population of marriott.i love my exco-workers
bad,Starwood Hotel is a conglomerate of nine hotel chains that are known worldwide.
bad,"Worst job ever! I hated my life! Customer service was not the key! The key was to lie to the guest on the phone about availabily, almost being sold out, that they were talking to the hotel even though they were not. And also on top of that you had to transfer people a lot because you couldn't help them with a simple issue. Transferring makes the customer even more upset."
bad,"I would cherish a demanding position that makes effective use of my background and provides good career growth, personality development where performance is rewarded with new responsibilities, and where teamwork is the accepted norm, putting in the best to the maximum benefit of organization."
bad,"Horrible managment team, very unprofessional has multiple lawsuits filed with EEOC."
bad,In this property you co-workers are like family. Great opportunities to be promoted.
bad,I did not like working for this company.  The managers were not helpful if you were not one of their pets.  I would work long hours with little pay.
bad," Create functional or decorative objects by hand using a variety of methods and"
bad,"The management cares nothing for its associates. It's run by a franchise company that doesn't care about Marriott standards, it's only about their pockets. They work employees like dogs and don't care if the moral is low. They work you for hours at minimal wages. Beware! Marriott needs to investigate this property. If I could give less than 1 star on each I would."
bad,Stay away. There's plenty of better jobs out there that pay. Benefits are great but don't make up for pay.
bad,"Enjoyed helping employees achieve their career goals."
bad,I have noting nice to sy about this company. Thus i will not be adding any information.
bad,The Marriott was a great place to work and it help me better my working skills just wasn't allowed a lot of hours and a lot of unethical things going on there management need help.
bad,"I worked at a Fairfield Inn owned by Marriott. Marriott isnt the issue, Fairfield Inn and Hospitality Ventures is the issue. Our old manager was fired and they brought another manager in from a different state and she ran that hotel into the ground. She is fake, disrespectful and a  spoiled brat. I was demoted, my hours were cut and I was fired because she couldnt give me a straight answer as to why I was demoted. Good thing I spoke to department of labor about her. Hopefully Hospitality Ventures opens their eyes."
bad,Production to meet my goal and a little trouble shooting.. Management was great and very supportive. Learning new skills was my most enjoyable time at work.
bad,Lack of IT and proper data make easy tasks overly time consuming.
bad,A typical day at work was fun working with all the customers.  This is what I enjoyed the most.
bad,"The benefits are terrible so is the condition of the hotel. hey change managers every 12 months, this s bad!!!"
bad,"workplace is dominated with politics, people promoted based on skin color or ethnicity. there are no improvement for actual skillful employees. general manager walk around the property like he is god but he has no clue as to what is going on in departments under his management. general manager constantly fill job postings with his daughter's high school friends. director of event management only hire pretty females or Caucasian people. upper management show little to no appreciation for employees who uplift the place except if you are white or black. if you are a minority from another country you don't exists in this place no matter how hard you work. upper management only care about getting their quarterly bonus by cutting hours of hardworking employees. employees who are close to managers constantly talking bad about other employees, supervisors, and managers. i would not advise to work here, there are lot more places which values skillful foreign employees."
bad,I worked very hard at Marriott for over 5 years and was given an insignificant raise over that period. I felt mistreated by some managers and hotel staff. I did make some good friends by working there and am thankful for that. Because of the way the company and management treated me I will never work for them again.
bad,I hated it not enough money and you work your but off for nothing
bad,"I did not like this job, I an not good at selling products to people.  The hours I worked were hard for my family."
bad,"Marriott preaches that they are not a call center, but they are. Typical call center life, low pay, high stress, high expectations and no adequate compensation. You can be in their top sales, and still the management will brow beat you because it is not enough. "
bad,Not in to hiring minorities despite claim of being an EOE company
bad,"it was quit nice,i can be togather with my friends, communication among the staff is good."
bad,"I was here for 4 years, and how I survived as long as I did, I will never know. You will take over 80 calls a day, and very repetitious. You will never talk to your supervisor, never time for one on ones. They benefits are horrible. Be ready to test your stress levels and have some xanax available. You don't get to breathe between calls, as soon as you hang up, another comes in. They have a hiring class every month, because everyone quits or they get fired. You cant miss a day of work without getting written up. Even if you have a doctors note, it doesn't matter. If you miss 2 days in one month, you will get written up twice. They do not care about their employees. I only stayed with it as long as I did, because I was at home. Trust me, this company is the pits! "
bad,"they play favorites "
bad,"I thought this would be a good place to work, but when I started I only got a few hours of training and that was it. I was not trained on everything. I knew nothing about mixing drinks and was never taught. I just had to guess and hope that I could find someone who knew what were in drinks or rely that a bottle would have a recipe on it. I always worked by myself and was never left any notes. I was treated unfairly and babysat by the office people like I didn't know how to do certain parts of my job. They would take over and leave a mess for me to clean up. This place was the worst I have experienced."
bad,As long as you walk in with a smile you will leave with one ....
bad,you would field 100s of calls customers thought they were calling the hotel instead got us . the managers were a joke there were all family or dating each other. they would cheat people out of their monthly bonus. i was there for 6 months they hired 300 people and fired about 350. 
bad,I just didn't like working here.  No regard for family or anything outside their doors.
bad,"Best place to work,excellent co workers,I really enjoyed working in Marriott,i wish i can work again with Marriott"
bad,"This is an an awful place to work. The pay is lousy, the hours are long and the managers are absolutely awful. I feel sorry for anyone who ventures into the marriott company"
bad,"At first i loved working for the company. I have always loved hospitality so this was amazing for me. The managers seemed nice, but as i got further into the job, i started to notice things wrong. The assistant manager would show up drinking, and acting crazy. She loved to stir up drama and honestly had a horrible work ethic. Whenever we would have a crisis she would bale on us and we would be left with very unsatisfied guests and no way to know what to do. When i found out i had to move, I gave them 3 weeks notice, and that's when things started to get bad. I noticed her starting to treating me worse and worse.  I accidentally took the spare key home after working a long Night Audit shift (which happens to all the employees) but she decided to tell all the other employees that i stole them and i was going to be arrested and fired. So then after i tried to speak to her, there was no way anything was going to get resolved, and i quit. When i got to my new home and tried applying for jobs, she gave all the potential employers a bad reference about me. The only reason i found this out it because i always follow up after interviews. I have now taken that number off of my resume. "
bad,Horrific place and terrible GM.  Horrific treatment of managers.
bad,Terrible GM and horrific labor practices towards F&B Management.
bad,"This hotel property has high turnover rate with no advancement, no appreciation for hard work and Low Pay. Management treat employees like disposable, no job security and favoritism. Be very careful working there because management can fire you for no reason just because management dislike you. And, there's no advancement."
bad,Today i will not work for that company because they do not pay .
bad,"I worked at a Courtyard Marriott. Originally I applied for front desk agent. However when I was hired, the operational manager said that I will be working as a bistro serve then crossed trained as front desk agent. I have no bistro experience and have never worked in a restaurant before. I was not happy about this at all and felt I was misinformed. However at the time I needed a job so I accepted it. The hiring process was awful. It seemed the operational manager did not know what she was doing. I was told it was a new application process that's why it was taking so long. I completed all of the paper work that was required of me in a timely manner. It came to the point that the operational manager told me to call HR to see if my paper work has been processed and when. I have not worked for a company where I have to contact hr myself to get myself hired and move the process along. Unprofessional! My first couple of weeks in the bistro were hard. Since I had no prior experience in that field I felt a little under confident. Within my second week I was working a double shift and left alone to run the bistro. Whenever the bistro were to get busy the front desk agent is suppose to come and help out to kill the line. However when I worked that did not happen. The front desk agent and ASM would not come and assist me! Guest were complaining and did not like the one man team concept at all. Neither did I amongst other things. I meet staff member that were really nice caring fun people. The room discount was awesome. Marriott is a global company which means the opportunity for advancement"
bad,Benefits were very expensive and management did not treat staff with respect.
bad,Worst managed company I had ever seen i did what i could but that was not the job for me alot of glass ceilings and alot of terrible employees i hurt every day when i got off work i worked late and got there early but i could do very little to slow the demise of that hotel
bad,"No comments nothing to said, yes a housekeeping superisor nothing more"
bad,There were way too many supervisors on site. Lack of leadership.
bad,Its an ok place to work. The supervisor is very pushy the cheif.
bad,"You come in, get linked to a phone and answer calls all day/night. You're expected to know every promotion at the drop of a hat, you need to promote a credit card that no one is interested in and that you can't benefit from if you tried to apply for it."
bad,management was very bad at this job I wasnt really treated good at this jobs employees talking about other employees alot.
bad,It was a good job for the age and time period I was in. I am very great for the the job opportunity
bad,"Where do I begin....when I was first hired for the job it was told to me that it was for ""reservations"" but shortly after training was over and I was then pushed onto taking calls I was assigned a team lead and supervisor to have me work on my ""sales""....We have a certain % each month that we have to reach or we would get written up....3 strikes, your FIRED!!! There were other things along that which we could also get written up for STUPID THINGS! Another was you couldn't call out more than 1 time per month. I was sadly going through a ruff time and had a kidney stone which I was hospitalized for, in order to NOT get written up I had to request a note for 3 days off. And to make matters worse they took those 3 days out of my vacation/sick time which I didn't want! And due to the medications I was taking I would have to use the bathroom many times within my shift. Also another thing I got written up for even though I had a note stating that I needed addtional ""personal time"" to use. We were like cars salesmen....being told to ""LIE"" to our customers about the avialability of the hotels they were calling. You had to do ANYTHING possible to get that sale!!! As for the bonuses, they were good when you could get them. However, towards the end of my employment they began to find ways in not giving me a bonus. Saying that ""Even though you made a booking, you didn't do it the correct way so you will not receive this month's bonus"". And as for the actual reservation system, that was another thing that was unreliable, always crashing usually near the end of the month I would always notice"
bad,"Basically, everything that looks good on the outside isn't, just because its a new establishment but all will be uncovered once you sign on the dotted line. Management doesn't show concern for your needs, pay is terrible with little or no raise, you will never recieve a break/lunch which is illegal by federal law, and benefits will never be discussed during your interview or when you start because they will fail at mentioning that its not included. A typical day at work is stressfull including unappreciative guest and management(& owners) who basically don't care as long as its not affecting their revenue. I have definetly learned that everything that glitters aint gold, the hardest part is the realization that your time was wasted on endless(sometimes double shifts) hours that management will threaten to issue write-ups if you recieve overtime for work that you actually did. Co-workers are basically over worked, stressed, and definetly under paid for all they endure. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out at the end of your shift, soon after heading to your car to leave for the day"
bad,"when I first started working for this company it was a cultural melting pot. People from all cultures, since they hired this new human resource person you can see a drastic change in whom they are hiring and firing.....They say racism is out dated but it so up in your face with this company. You are so lucking to see a person of color at all."
bad,"was a very good company to work for when the old man ran it, now its just another job. Its no longer one big happy family, once your out your never getting back in."
bad,"A typical day at this job was hectic. I learned to just do my job and it will be over soon. The management was horrible, my co'workers became my best friends. The hardest part of the job was dealing with racism. The most enjoyable part of the job was when my shift ended."
bad,"people are rude at the W hotel, they preach about image when they themselves give a bad image. I was called for an interview was jerked around in the end never hired never applying there again, not making that mistake twice."
bad,The westin Richmond was the worst job I ever had. The managers were so disrespectful to the employees. The yell at you say anything they want to you.I wouldnt recommend this job to a enemy.
bad,"This place is rigged to grind people out, so that they can keep costs down and avoid paying benefits. It started as a training facility, run by a firm that the Dept. of Labor successfully sued for cheating its own employees: to see the $1.8 million settlement from Nov. 2008, Google this term: Chao v. 888 Consulting Group, Inc.; Civil Action Number: 1:08-CV-11961. So, the sharks who run this place still get paid based on ""hiring"", i.e., on firing pricier, longtime call reps and replacing them with new hires. Also, don't apply here if you don't like systematically ripping off your coworkers. Though your supervisor listens in on your calls, if s/he hears you accidentally or deliberately cheating, few of them will even mention whatever-it-was to you. There's a disincentive: their bonuses are based on whether you make yours. Corporate Starwood (Stamford, CT or White Plains, NY: I think they moved to Conn.) either has absolutely no clue about, or no interest in, the Fall River management's misdeeds. If you have any scruples whatsoever, the stress level is NOT TO BE BELIEVED. All senior management (HR and Top Jerk alike) care about is ""making your numbers"" -- in terms of sales, not, as they like to claim, in terms of sales and call duration. Sales stats underlie all pay raises, all bonuses, all scheduling verdicts (big money's in biz-traveler calls, shifts Monday-Friday between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m.: you repeatedly compete for slots from early a.m. Sunday to 11 pm/+ Saturday) and all decisions about training, promotions, duties assigned, whether you have ""your own"" workspace on the floor,"
bad,"They preach customer service, but really it is all about selling the SPG membership & their American Express credit card. The constant barrage of unhappy callers is exhausting, & tech support is useless. Worst. Job. Ever."
bad,Working with the public can be fun. I think I better keep my comments to myself
bad,"Maybe things have changed but I worked there several years ago and they treated employees like kids....giving them balloons and silly stuff when a sale was made. When hired they said it was ""reservations"" but after being hired said it was ""sales"" witha quota. If I am going to be in sales then I want to actually make a real commision not just pocket change. The training was so awful. My supervisor could not mentor her way out of a paper bag and was more conerned with her phone calls and emails than mentoring me, while I sat next to her."
bad,"Expect no life"
bad,Employees are treated differently. Management is poor. No respect from the higher management. When a issue is brought up they laugh at your face. I do not reccomend working here.
bad,The skill need were not fully trained on and the computer system too many programs to use to do one thing.  Hard to change between program to di your job and help consumer.  Did fill like I was helping consumer.
bad,This company expects their employees to work themselves to death. I worked 50 hours a week on average and made about 11/hour (both tips and hourly pay combined).  I often worked 12 hours straight without having any time to eat or even drink. Most management is unproffesional and gossips about employees to otheremployees.
bad,"After working weeks of overtime, there was a discrepancy for a clock out during lunch where I took an extra 15mins for lunch due to the amount of hours I had been working that week. I agreed to work as much OT as I could, that was 10-12hr shifts weekly for 1.5 months with over 35 hrs in OT at least and because I could not explain the 15 extra minutes they let me go. This was the weekend before I was to leave for vacation which I had to cancel due to unemployment."
bad,"youre are just another body/worker bee to them. Zero job security. Management is condicending, pretentious, and rude while they sit in their office and go on 2 hr lunches while you stand for 8 hrs straight and have to beg for a small break."
bad,"I wasnt trained properly and left to deal with the job with little proper help. I was always joked about, the hiring manager left because they overworked her to the point of hospitalization with little pity. They expect far too much for how they treat you. Its sad how stressed everyone always is. The management is a big part of it, and for such seasoned members of Marriott, I would think they would know how to treat people."
bad,The owners and General Manager were awful.  Drug dealing at night through Night Auditor.  Employees fighting.  I was the professional one and was accused of doing something I DID NOT do.  I love Marriott and Marriott would be ashamed at the ownership and management of this company!
bad,I had a very good experience at the Marriott Until we got a new director over the security Department. she is a real  mean.. hey And made everyone feel uncomfortable.
bad,"The General managed is very okay to work with, but He won’t accommodate your schedule and he says “everyone needs to be a team player?” The Head housekeeper is rude doesn’t care about you only cares about herself and her son and is constantly telling people to get off their phones when she is the one who is constantly answering calls on her phone from her children and her husband and she’s always texting them. They work place is not good to work in because It is always a mess and no one ever seems to know what to do or how to work things and once you’re hired on in one spot you don’t start in that spot you’re starting breakfast, laundry, front desk, Public’s. They hire you on as a housekeeper but that’s not what you will be for the next 2,3 months. "
bad,"The Manager is very rude to employees. Other than the manager I got along with the other employees. The Manager would tell at us instead of talking in a nicely manner. I would never work at the Marriott Courtyard in Beckley, WV ever again as long as she is still the manager"
bad,"I had a very bad experience working here. I started off loving it, helping set up all room from scratch considering it was a new hotel that wasn’t open to the public yet. Moving forward when we opened management changed, we wasn’t being treated fair and some of our supervisors was taking our tips before we got to our departure rooms. We had no one to talk up for us considering we didn’t have a  union"
bad,"The only good thing about this place is the discount that you get a marriott hotel's when traveling! The pay sucks (at least for me it did) i was there almost 4 years and only received one raise after almost 2. I was constantly promised promotion opportunities and salary increases that never came. I wised up and left. Worst job ever!"
bad,Not up to Marriott standards at all very unorganized and non of the staff is trained correctly from GM to front desk very unprofessional. would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for employment. Has some racial profiling to certain guest. If i would have known at the interview process what I know now I wouldn't have excepted the offer.
bad,"Management is horrible, after a year working crazy hours I received a terrible review and $ 0.18 cents raise. Lot of drama queens around, no respect for employees from general manager. I would not recommend this place to work for; is plain terrible"
bad,"The manger here at this location, has repeatedly lied to me, concerning benefits , and made promises about raises, and lied about it, only to string you along and keep you working for them."
bad,This is a terrible place to work. If you want to be abused for working hard this is a place for you. They treat the lazy nonfood safety workers like gold and the hard working trained staff lousy
bad,"Management at the hotel I worked (Marriott in Edinburgh Simpson Loan) is there to exploit and push their staff to the limits. "
bad,"This place is horrible. Management is always shorting your check and their only solution is to wait to the following pay period. The equipment is outdated, and the kitchen is super dirty with expired food."
bad,"The more work you did, the more they gave you to do..poor management...horrible place to work..was there 3 years and worked every holiday and weekend..when my aunt died, I got written up..I believe it was just these managers..they are terrible..had to  beg and plead on several occasions to get my 2 days off working 3rd shift in a row..otherwise you would be scheduled 9 to 11 days straight.."
bad,"In interview was lied to about bonus manager was late to work at least 3 days a week.Was not told about breaks. Over all Job was not bad except the fact they expected rooms cleaned in 30 mins. this would have been doable except Some housekeepers were allowed to check their own rooms (they always got bonus) then when you have to clean the rooms they cleaned the day before it took a lot longer because the did the min. to make bonus.  Ok, if you don't care but if you are a true cleaner this is unfair."
bad,"I worked for associates hotels as a contract with marriot. My manager was horrible, I received very little training and was blamed for every mistake even if it wasn’t my own. My general manager was having a relationship with one of my coworkers and gave them special treatment. I never received a uniform as we were supposed to... this hotel had bed bugs and many other structural issues unsafe for guests and employees. We worked long hours and were never given a lunch break. There was often only one employee on site and we were never allowed to leave the desk for even a bathroom break."
bad,"I loved the job it`s self,but my boss kept saying I could be replaced any day, and she would do so if she had the choice ( this started day one of my job). Pay was low, worked 34-40 hours a week, no benefits."
bad,"If you want to work in a kitchen, avoid Morton's at all costs. ""Chef"" is a terrible person to work for who will yell at you and belittle you infront of all the staff, or pull you into a walk-in cooler to ""talk"" with you."
bad,"Marriott, when first hired, was more focused on their members. After a couple of months there, they were more concerned about numbers. They pushed call volume more and cared less about the members and employees."
bad,Poorly managed from the top. Guest and service elevators that frequently breakdown. A/C problems throughout the hotel. Only HOT water available on the ground floor. Broken drains. Low labor budget with high service expectations.
bad,"understaffed,no management, no training, mandatory overtime, not guaranteed work hours, underpaid, lack of leadership, this property is losing revenue, and is currently being sold."
bad,Since Marriott bought the company from Starwood the standards are poor and the overall morale of the employees are way done and they don’t value you as an employee . You have to pay for parking and walk quite a distance traveling through unsafe areas
bad,"Marriott cares more about making money than the satisfaction of their guests. They'd rather us rush a guest off of the phone than actually making it a memorable experience. They also do not value their workers, hence the multiple ongoing protests. It's really sad to see all of this transpiring, especially when I used to love coming to work every day."
bad,"Members are being rewarded very well, which is the only reason there are more members holding Marriott Card. This program is not only for the Hotel guest; it also applied to the employee as well."
bad,"Handled portion control activities according to specified instructions provided by the chef."
bad,"hours are not guaranteed, no adjustment for advancement. Cannot be missing work as there are no other employees to cover the shift. No room for error as the job was to help others do their job."
bad,"This Specific hotel and management is the worst place ive ever worked, the management do not care about your well being and do no handle conflicts well at all. The areas in the laundry are hot and are unsafe to work in. Multiple employees have gone home due to heat exhaustion and nothing was done about  resolving the problem. They overlook problems and do nothing to resolve them. The hotel from the guests perspective is nice, but the way the company is run is pathetic they will over work you the bone and not say thank you afterwards. DO NOT work at this establishment."
bad,"Worked here for a short number of months in which a typical day at work would include jobs that you weren't supposed to do aswell as being shouted at several different mangers despite not being anything to do with them."
bad,"Zero development, finger pointing, cut throat, weekly threats on job, the absolute worst work life balance, terrible structure, cover your own back, untrustworthy, zero respect given, monthly turnover in key positions, inexperienced leadership."
bad,all i can say is this place doesn't care about their workers they pick and choose who they like. Its really high school at that place. i was the night auditor and got sick and was taken to the hospital even after all off that they let me go. management is horrible and they have the biggest turn over in employment.
bad,"This is a hotel, you expect to work off-hours, however, this hotel is exceedingly poor at managing time and requests for time off. In 8 months of working for this location I had one weekend (sat and sunday) off and had to work every major holiday."
bad,"I was initially hired to be a restaurant host but that never happened since they’re so short staffed. Although, I did learn a thing or 2 about f&b I wouldn’t go back even if I got paid 3x more. Department manager is so dense, doesn’t care about anything leaves most her problems to the supervisor who basically runs everything, she was the most helpful person in their team and employees are treated like they’re replaceable. LETS NOT GET STARTED ON THE AMOUNT OF ROACHES I CAME ACROSS MY TIME THERE!"
bad,"Everyone loves luxury. But most fail to realize that luxury comes at the cost of someone else. That luxury comes off of the back of the overworked, understaffed, underpaid casualties that work at the W hotel.  I worked for the Welcome team which is the front desk . 1. They do not set up to be successful. They throw you out there with absolutely no training whatsoever and you have to learn everything on your own. All of the reports, about all of the room types (about 15 different room types) about the different tiers of guest, everything you will have to learn on your own because everyone is so busy they don't have enough time or energy to help you. 2.  the scheduling is absolutely horrible you can request a day or even literally on your interview tell them what days you cannot work and they will schedule you on those same exact days anyway. And if someone calls out on their shift whoever that was scheduled at that same time instantly gets their work doubled or even tripled instead of checking in 150 rooms with three people within 8 hours now you have to do all of that with two people. 3 Even though you already have your hands full you have to run back and forth to grab bags from the ambassadors closet for the guest. These guest will have anywhere between 2-7 bags that are heavy and difficult to handle. on average 1 out of 30 of them will give you one to three dollars so definitely not worth the trouble. 4. The biggest problem is loyalty. I was the top salesmen and top 3 rewards program enroller at this hotel for pretty much an entire year and I got treated very poorly. I literally"
bad,"A typical day is standing for about 10 house. I  learned how to lead a diverse work force.  We did not have a GM during  my time there. The culture was not a great but  we were woking  to fix this. I still believe this the result of not enough managers and a GM there was a hard road to lead the way. The hardest part of my job was having no guidance. We never had a gm, but we were getting by. The most enjoyable part of my job was when i would mat new people and working with my teammates."
bad,"typical day, the guest start asking you questions before you even get to the time clock. you clock in, and either go to the desk or wait in the back for stand up. after stand up, your suppose to get your bank situated and some employees go relieve the previous shift while other employees tend to hang around and chat with the previous shift and managers. during the day, it's a revolving door of people leaving the desk, especially if there is a long line or we are overbooked and rooms aren't ready yet. this hotel has 1408 rooms and is a convention property so this tends to happen a lot. "
bad,work place is a very reactionary hotel in stead of being proactive.  Management  does not see that there is a problem with service when the guest complaints and will not return.
bad,"management is very unprofessional and immature.Irresponsible, cut throat pompous and classless. Not at a good role model for customer service. Take no accountability but blame subordinates. God complex"
bad,"Everyday was pretty much the same routine, checking guests in and out of hotel, answering switchboard and forwarding calls, taking reservations, payments, daily cash reconciliations, correcting any errors in pricing and guest information.  Hardest part of job was dealing with irate guests from previous shifts who did not have their needs taken care of and most enjoyable was having happy guests leaving at the end of their stay."
bad,I am a former employee of the Marriott Residence Inn in Boca Raton FL. Do not work here. They make you do more than what your title is. They don't tell you all of this during your interview process. I found out the hard way. I tried them out and boy did they make me do more than what my position was entitle to. You did 3 employees job and they paid you 10.00 and hour. Really. They need a new Manager there.
bad,"A typical work day consists of verbal abuse from coworkers, 8.5 hours of trying to balance tickets, special projects"
bad,"not flexible despite being on a zero hour contract."
bad,"You get no support or communication from management, and good employees are pushed aside to keep the lazy ones happy.  No support or sense of belonging, and no one actually works.  They all try to push their duties on others.  Managers sit on their butts, never show up on time, and expect everyone else to do everything for them.  Also very little training before you are forced to work by yourself and looking stupid because you know nothing and no one has taught you anything.  Not to mention, there is constant drama.  Pay isn't great, just ok.  Benefits are ok.  You get a discount at Starwood hotels, but even that's not all that great.  Basically, don't bother."
bad,"I work as the sole LPO at Marriott Surfers Paradise and responsible to attend all First Aid Incidents and Fire Alarms, Also attend to all other incidents in relation to the safety and security of Staff and Guests"
bad,I got a job working for the Marriott residence inn   I have never seen such a extremely unprofessional Gm management as this one omg what a nightmare I cooked breakfast in the morning and the GM was very petty
bad,"Was made to feel highly unwelcome from my first day by most people apart from a few members of staff. Management are awful and had favourites, Two faced people everywhere and being belittled in front of people for some things which could have been resolved with proper training (which you do not receive!) Also horrible shift patterns!"
bad,a typical day at work requires more work than what they pay you for no advancement unless your not a minority or brown nose your way up thru the company the wages suck they max you out on pay is the excuse the give and it doesn't matter how much you know or skills you have they feel like you should be happy to have a job
bad,"Marriott is great to work for as a 1st time job, gives you the customer service experience. Terrible as a long time employment- over works employees without over time (due to the 2 week/bi weekly pay base). Back to back shifts (16hrs in 24 hr. period). Raises are a joke (2%). Does not pay time in a half for holidays worked, instead will take your next scheduled day off and will use your PTO to pay you. Offers great Marriott discounts for employees, but you never will have the day off to enjoy them."
bad,"I worked at the Marriott in downtown winston-salem and it was dreadful. The management and human resources department never knew anything. The front office manager had a bad attitude she picked favorites. She would treat you differently then she would treat her favorites and she didn't care who had a problem with it. She never gave you any type of praise when you did well or went over and beyond for a guest.  She always made big deals about petty things always focusing on what wasn't done. There was no balance between family life and work. They don't care if you was sick, had a death in the family or car problems they would still write you up for being absent. They have been through sooooo many different managers and front office clerks in just a short amount of time which is a BIG sign."
bad,"I've worked at the Fairfield Inn and Suites in Fenton, MI. This company is bias against certain people. There's  no diversity in upper management. I was there for awhile and every opportunity for advancement they hire outside people with little or no experience. It was a nice place to work at first when it was a little diversity. Management doesn't work on weekends and if someone calls off they still don't come in and cover but expect someone to stop what they're doing and fill in. Don't get me wrong your suppose to be a team player but management needs to step in a lot more.The hotel has gone in the downward direction and has been that way for about 2 years now. The company that owns this property never does anything for its employees but at Christmas gives us a box of candy, cookies, or popcorn. Your voice is not heard and complaints fall on death ears. The turnover rate is ridiculous high, you would think they are a temp service considering how many people have come and gone in the last 3 years and they been open for 5 years. They wonder why people don't come to work or quit at the drop of a dime. If your looking for a career look somewhere else, this is not the place for you."
bad,"Didn't really give me much experience too meet new people. It wasn't very hygienic either. Unprofessional management, not very nice people too work for."
bad,"No team work, no appreciation, no manners, discrimination and humiliations. Only go there to work if nothing else left!!!!!!"
bad,You're doing way too much work with not enough hours or pay. The hotel got a new clock-in system that doesn't let you punch in. Paychecks were all wrong. Hauling heavy inventory around the hotel on a daily basis. Lost 10 lbs just from working there. Club Attendant means waitress/hostess/bus boy/janitor/ stewardess/ and bowing down to guests 24/7. Shifts start at 5:30am & you're lucky if you make 5 dollars in tips.
bad,"this very good property just i want to change for city, GOOD staffs ,good managament, good food ,nice to work this property"
bad,"When you get to work, you must be there early or you will little to nothing to work with. The assistant supervisor is a person that you can go talk to about anything but the housekeeping supervisor is a person you want to stay clear of. The assistant and general manger are hardly there so if you do have a complaint be sure to wait until you can talk to them one on one because leaving a note will not help your situation."
bad,"Most managers were very friendly and enjoyable, and the environment as a whole was okay, but there are new coworkers every few weeks. Like most call center type jobs, you have good calls as well as bad calls and have to learn how to deal with irate callers. Definitely a learning experience."
bad,"The Marriott is definately not a pleasant work environment. Upper management is the worst I have ever had to deal with. They treat ALL employees like door mats. They talk about team work when in fact no team exists. The manager I have to deal with is a bully and abuses his authority. I love the job itself, but can't wait to find employment where management actually treats their staff with dignity and respect. The morale in this work place is so low it's almost non existant. Their answer to this problem was to hand out ice cream to staff instead of a face to face meeting where this issue as well as others could be addressed and hopefully resolved. Not only do they nickel and dime guests, they do the same to the staff. The turn over this past year has been phenomenal due to hiring an operations manager that is incompetant, unprofessional and highly immature.The hardest part of the job is going in everyday!!"
bad,"7 minutes of phone plus breaks"
bad,"Every night is a very challenging night at work since i am the only one in charge of the shift.  In this co. i am exposed to high rise environment and and high tech. fire fighting system and fire monitoring system as well. The people at work are friendly and very helpful, a team oriented environment. The hardest part of the job is when too many engineering issues arise and i am by myself on the shift.   The most enjoyable part of the job is when there is a free pizza and thanksgiving time when we have the big edible castle  at the main entrance lobby, also when new year comes when people comes and celebrate their new years eve at my job site."
bad,"I have to say that I was very excited to begin working for the company, I had heard a lot of good and exciting news and thought it was the perfect place to take my experience. My boss was a liar, who didn't care about us as employees. Promises of advancement would later be met with ""we will talk about this later"" only to never be discussed or brought up. I put in dedication, hard work, and a lot of extra effort to prove I was up to the task and it was all over looked with distrust and mismanagement. I decided to move on and I suggest you do the same."
bad,"this place is giving very less salary for the supervisor, then make them work for long hours"
bad,The managers are all very unprofessional. The main manager let everyone I worked with know that I was going to be fired before she even bothered telling me. So I quit before she could have the chance. Spare yourself the drama of working here. It sucks.
bad,Few opportunities for professional growth or to make necessary organizational changes.
bad,"The Marriott in Rye, NY was the worst hotel I have worked for. The atmosphere was not team oriented. The Managers did not hire enough people to work and expected everyone to do more then what their job entailed. The Marriott was not well as far as keeping their employees happy. I hope they can get this together before it begins to crumble."
bad,"Work shifts started before 6 am which we would stock the buffet, register, restaurant floor, and the hotel mini-store. I learned about the different types of management and which ones I worked best under. My co-workers were easy going which helped during the rushes from group meals that would sometimes overtake the lobby. Hardest part was dealing with the friction between the Manager and other supervisors. Most enjoyable part, I learned that I could provide great customer service. I learned about the Boise area through the eyes of the guest and my associates."
bad,"If you are looking for steady work, than this place is not for you."
bad,"This is not a good employer. They are also very dishonest on many things. They really promote that they are on the the ""top ten places to work in Austin"" They tell the employee's they have to take a ""company"" survey and is mandatory, on working conditions, managers, etc, instead of telling them it is for the local newspaper, who does the top ten companies in Austin to work for. That way they get good survey's, cause employee's will not say anthing negative, in fear of losing job. They also do not tell you, when you first start, that if you take your sick leave that you accumulate, it will count against your attendance, even though you get the hours, you will get written up, three times and your gone! Horrible turn-over, pay is very bad."
bad,"-Set up cold cooler, restocking things that were needed."
bad,"The Residence Inn starts employees at minimum wage. Many people that have worked there for years are still making less than $7.50, and are expected to put in $20 worth of work. It's the most nerve racking underpaid job I've even seen."
bad,"Really bad work environment"
bad,You work hard all year only to get a $.30 raise. The manager doesn’t do any work and has the employees who get paid less do all their work. Bad employees are put on a pedestal while the hard workers are told to do their job or quit. There is no room for advancement. No room for growth. You are also expected to do work that’s not in your job description. Benefits are trash as well.
bad,"Working as a server you won’t make any money! Save you the headache, apply elsewhere. Management does not care about you, don’t listen to what your availability is. If you’re looking for FT they will say they can give it to you but end up giving you PT hours less than 20. Play favorites. WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER WORKED FOR."
bad,"Was let go because a new manager was hired who did not like me.  I had been with the company for years and dedicated alot of my time and energy.  If you are not in the click, do not wasre your time"
bad,"Work at marriot courtyard invernes, managment cover ther own, and leave the rest up to there own, not a relaxing place to work, short staff, and no overtime"
bad,"La brigata ,a parte alcune persone, lavora solo nel proprio interesse personale."
bad,Poor quality work environment. Lack of equitable scheduling. Slacker friendly🙄😩. Only put younger people on money shifts  at main hotel pool as servers  Very poor quality in management
bad,"I’m talking about the property I work at."
bad,Tiene bueno beneficios pero la administracion no sirve de nada mucho equipo dañado y no escuchan opiniones de ningun tipo. Se enfocan mas en el bonvoy member en ves de a todos por igual. Muchas veces tratan de humilla.
bad,The only good thing about this job is the pay and room discounts. The actual job is very stressful they want u to meet unrealistic goals to advance. They promise advancement but it doesnt happen..i worked at the company for 3 years got promised a promotion and never got training for it. Management is bad they pick favorites.My manager harassed me everyday and HR did nothing about it
bad,Working at the Marriott's not easy is a hard-working I just got so many experience by doing housekeeping work and for I was working there I was doing home health care work I'm taking classes CPR classes I'm in a different things about charging so I have some type of experience
bad,"Very poor management & little support. Communication sucks. Team work is very low priority. Under payed. Deal with a lot of entitled, disrespectful, and rude guests."
bad,"No chance of Career/Job Advancement"
bad,"I felt I was always going above and beyond and there were not enough employees available. If I was a night audit, I literally managed the hotel which was extremely unsafe for one individual. There are days my breaks ""had"" to be skipped and I was not paid overtime."
bad,"I formally worked for Starwood Resorts and Hotels when it was taken over by MARRIOT.  The transition was awful nobody knew anything. We lost vacation and sick pay, we were not paid for Holidays we asked for. Our managers were no help cause they didnt know what the process was. I gave it almost 3 years to get it all figured out, moving on. Ive found that Marriott is all about the profit and not about their employees at all. I worked in the culinary dept where if somebody quit they were never replaced, everyone else would just get more work to do. When I left there were only 6 cooks all day left for the entire Hotel thats including room service, restaurant , banquets and cafeteria food for Employees."
bad,I have worked for over 40 years and never had such poor management.  Immature and no management skills. In one month 7 people quit. Wake up mcr please investigate.  Executive housekeeper is a two faced liar. Tips were stolen??. They hate white  men and are homophobic. Loved working for a hotel but we felt pushed out the door. They will miss us. Management called employees liars . Place
bad,"Lots of bullies, sucks to work in a kitchen fulls of wannabes! If they find out that you’re good in your job you’ll be in trouble. They will full you down. They will laugh when you’re struggling and cry if you’re successful."
bad,"Work schedule all over the place. You could be asked to work 11p-7a and then have to be back at 2 or 3p for next shift. No work life balance. You can request a day off months in advance, but no guarantee until you see schedule you will get time off. No proper training. They make you watch hours of videos during your first few weeks that don't really train you properly. Guests come before employeesGubbeforemployees"
bad,"Racist subculture on all sides and managerial cliques. advancement was based on which manager or exec you were friends with.nothing more to say, dont work there...you will not be happy... they talk a big show but do NOT practice it"
bad,"Marriott has really gone downhill in the past couple years. To begin when I first started in 2015, there was support all around, benefits, scheduling, work life balance, and even the beginning wage at the time was tolerable for a college student . It quickly changed with the sudden and poorly planned changes the company implemented, all for money to be placed in their corporate top dogs pockets. Management became extremely cutthroat, and for lesser words didn’t care about us as employees. It seems like large companies like this tend to forget about the people who keep it running behind the scenes. Implementing half built reservation systems because they didn’t want to support the well functioning older systems that probably cost more money, expecting us to do better with the systems that crash on eight-year-old computer builds, and expecting us to be extremely robotic in taking two extremely strict 15 minute breaks, no bathroom breaks, and offering no flexibility whatsoever when it comes to your needed time off unless you’re dying basically or if you don’t care about your attendance. Growth is a joke here, and management will tell you whatever they need to in order to keep you around so they can milk you of everything you have. Marriott was the reason for my depression as well as many people I worked with. Save yourself the time and get a better, higher paying job than this. Not even worth the benefits."
bad,Manager was not knowledgeable.  She would not keep meetings with me that she had scheduled. The tools we were provided to assist guests rarely worked.
bad,"I'm a current employee. I've had co-workers who were great at their job be fired for no reason other than the fact that the managers didn't like them. This company also discriminates against Christians, while working here I have had Muslims try to convert me more than once. I've witnessed a manager talking about islam with employees on the job. Its a hostile, environment and I plan to leave as soon as possible."
bad,"been hired as a full time cook,,,it turned out was only seasonal full time but after will be casual/part time,,,,didn't feel welcome by the other co-workers,,experienced some of racism ,,,you are expected to work every time they need you 24/24,,,no good communication between the management and the big chef,,,forget having a break or even getting paid for it if you don't take ."
bad,"Housekeepers/room service have a ridiculous amount of work with no real advancement opportunities. Company hires from outside before promoting within. Lots of gossip and nasty lazy people. Hours are awful a majority of days you go home without making any tips. Front desk and bellman get paid more then housekeepers/room service. Dont work here if you want to make money, McDonalds pays more and has less work. Customers are nasty and full of themselves. Low pay most shifts start at 5am and if you try to advance or look for better shifts its impossible because most of the employees that do get paid well have been here 5 years +. They take care of the managers sales and front desk but the rest of the employees pretty much get told to fck off. If you end up needing to transfer most marriott's are owned by different company's so you'd have to quit and get rehired losing your benefits or just find a new job. Bad company to work for very greedy"
bad,Do not work here!!!! you will work 8+ hours with no break or lunch and then when you take a break manager yells in your face. Also when you you need to ask a question to other staff member they cannot understand you 99% of staff and manager does not understand english.
bad,"Poor team..poor management..General Manager is changing consistently  also assistant manager... They go and come as they want no set constant schedule for him or his agm..Both has not had prior experience in being a manager of a hotel.. "
bad,"Do not expect advancement or fair treatment if your are a minority. I have worked here for years, and have been in the same positions as when I started. I have watched numerous managers come and go like a revolving door."
bad,The hotel is new and in a pretty good location. The GM has no idea how to be a leader and has no clue on how to work with his team. Very rude and doesn’t trust none of the staff to effectively do their job. The entire management team is lost and everyone does what they want.
bad,bad maanagement and very mean hispanic people and they only speak in spanish i had no good experience with them the call me names in their language and are thiefs
bad,One of the most unorganized place. Work in the restaurant and its one of the nastiest kitchen I have ever worked for. And to remind you it’s a brand new kitchen. This kitchen keeps molded and expired food to serve the customers.  I surprise no one has gotten sick yet. No one never cleans and sanitized the kitchen area.
bad,"I was working in the restaurant at the Metrocentre, Gateshead hotel. On my trial shift, it was quite scary to start as you don’t really know what to expect as your first job. Some of the staff were welcoming, however some treated me like I didn’t know what I was doing when in fact I was doing exactly what everyone else was doing. I proceeded in the job process and found out that I had the job, which I was happy with after months of trying to find a job. A few weeks later I had my first proper shift. This time it was working with different people than on my trial shift, but they treated me even worse. They completely acted like I wasn’t there and in a way looked down on me, anyways, I got the job done with and went home. The next day I then had another shift to do which was for a wedding. All of the serving staff were working so I thought it was going to be fine. Howeve, nobody spoke to me. I was ignored all night, I didn’t want to ask anyone where something was or what to do because I knew I would just get spoken to so rudely. A worker from another hotel was there, who was the only one who spoke to, had actually said to me that there was poor communication here compared to the Marriott hotel that she works in. This impacted my decision to leave a lot. The manager had changed a lot, she was so nice up until the point of me working for them, the manager only spoke to me once that night saying I needed to walk around instead of standing still, but this was towards the end of the night when I was very very tired after doing a 4-11 shift with only a half an hour break. I could not"
bad,Its honestly alright. Some days are better than others. if my manager wasn't so bad and actually did her job i wouldn't have many complaints. Other then that if you enjoy helping needy people and people who are extremely privileged and will let you know then this is the job for you. Perfect job to get by.
bad,"Messy place, employees have no possibilities to book vacations, I was working for many companies and I can notice the difference between strategy in here and in previous companies."
bad,"The people are rude, they trust everything the company says whether they are right or wrong. Very unsanitary place were patients touch and bite you. Don't apply."
bad,I worked at  the Marriott in Canfield Ohio it was horrible bad management and supervisor. You had to jump through hopes just to keep your job not work my time.
bad,I liked Marriott but the Ritz-Carlton Club Aspen has poor management and is not a place I would recommend. It was the worst experience I have ever had.
bad,Don't do it. only care about bottom line guests and employees aren't important.regaurdless of efforts couldn't achive unrealistic goals.micro manage to the point of making you useless.
bad,Its a place thats more about customer quality and that is fine running a business although the employee coordinate and insure that quality is in affect every day but its not given in return as much as they push it into employees.
bad,I hated working there. The managers are on drugs they go behind u and mark the sheets with markers and then they fire u and accuse u of not changing the linens after they watch u do it and take them to the laundry shoot
bad,Working at the courtyard Metairie sucks!!!! Checks are not more than 170 a week and it’s nkt a full time job like they say when hired ! I wouldn’t recommend a cat to walk in front the Marriott in Metairie yet alone someone to come and work here
bad,and absolutely nothing else. Management has very openly and publicly humiliated almost everyone of the staff members. There is a revolving door on most positions and a severe lack of communication between departments.
bad,"During the 18 monthly worked for Valley Hospitality, I saw 12 managers come and go, due to the insane lack of consideration for employees given by upper management. Pay is lousy, hours are demanding, you will get screamed at each week."
bad,"There is no business which means you don't make any money unless the hotel or conference center has business. There are no benefits, no opportunity to move up within the company. It is not really a career oriented place to work."
bad,"No PTO for a full year, No 401K, No Direct deposit, 90 days for insurance eligibility. Management has favorites and they get the attention and respect. Everyone else is made to feel they may be unemployed at any time. Walking on egg shells..."
bad,do not work for this company they expect managers on salary to work more than 11 hours a day and over work you with stuff that it is not your department
bad,The HR Manager will hire you as a full time but after the one week training thats the start of your on call schedule based on the hotel occupancy.And after your probationary period if the management dont like you they will terminate your contract without a valid reason.
bad,Good extended stay hotel. Management does not deliver on hiring promise's. No insurance. Management does not listen to suggestions. If you are female you will do well. Micro managing.
bad,"Poor management. The culture is one where management requires employees to do things they themselves don't even do. You are always left alone on any given shift trying to answer phones, assist guests and even complete tasks that are not in your job description simultaneously. You do all of this for subpar pay and no recognition for a job well done. If you need help, management is nearly impossible to get in contact with. The turnover ratio is outstanding here and obviously for a reason that management doesn't seem to find out why. It is a revolving door with staff. Not to mention this place needs to clean up. Guests even complain about this all the time. Only good thing about the place are the benefits they offer and that's only if you stay long enough to even receive them."
bad,You should be paid more for all the work you do while you are there. I was literally doing things in the workplace that werent on my job description that i did not get paid for
bad,"This property is a franchise. very demanding and stressful, they give you basic benefits such as health insurance but not very good. They lack good and strong leadership. They eliminate other positions which makes it hard for the employees because they end up having more work and not enough time of the day to finish your work. There are good people / employees which makes it hard to leave sometimes."
bad,If you have kids or a family not a good place to work under staff no communication with management you will get written up for forgetting to punch out for lunch or to early the have a point attendance policy if you late call in you will get points don't matter if you call hours in advance you still get points
bad,"Having been in the Hotel industry for over 15 years, and in several different states and properties, I can honestly say this is definitely"
bad,"Some staff lovely couldnt fault them. Very clicky. No departments get along. All constantly arguing and slating and trying to be better then one another. Managerment couldnt organising a good night out in a brewery. Absolutely shambles. Some staff are smelly including management. Very 2faced. Someone gets wrong and the whole hotel knows. No confidentiality. Clicky Staff always late, nothing ever got said. Yet someone else would get wrong for still being there after the shift ended (truly because staff taking over are late) but again stupidity of current management. Nothong to eat. Nowhere to buy anything. Scabby vending machines. 10 hour shift and 1 free rotten sandwich. Shocking. Not even allowed a bowl of chips. Older members of staff. Been there since it was built  do theeir own thing, think they are incharge. Nothong said about them. Not a place i would advise. Nothings fair."
bad,"What a bunch of martyrs this company is, especially management. Even if you properly put in two weeks notice, it's a pain to return or not at all. You have to know the president of the company to return to ANY of their hotels. Favoritism is bad and you'll have no luck moving up unless you know a manager or GM."
bad,"Work culture is unprofessional, management is not experienced, CEO dose not show appreciation. Make promises they can`t keep and job ethic needs help."
bad,"This was by far the worst employer I have ever worked for. The job is extremely stressful, the benefits are not very great, and the management is either uncaring, rude, or both. The company does not care about their employees whatsoever. They do not accept doctor's notes as an excused absence, and only allow you up to 80 hours per calendar year for missing work. That means if you become seriously ill, get hurt, etc. you better hope that you don't go over said hours. If you do want to get those hours excused, you have to go through their ridiculous FMLA process. And make sure when you and your doctor fill out the paperwork, you are extremely specific. Otherwise they will continually deny it for asinine reasons. I saw many a person get denied and then fired soon after the denial. These were people with valid reasons for their absences such as diabetes, and an ill child. Another was denied because the company considered a miscarriage as a ""minor transient occurrence"". Highly recommend staying away from this company."
bad,"trying my best to achieve my targets and finding every element of  fun in  my job to be done  resolving the problem, booking appoitments, , picking up phone calls, speak different languages supportive and understanding co-workers, the hardest part of job was dealing with the angry customers. the most enjoyable part of my job  is booking  appoitments and talking to the customers."
bad,"The Marriott here in downtown Richmond just might be one of the worst hotels to work for, not because of the duties or the environment, but because of the management. ALL of the managers are overtly bossy, catty women with the mentality of high school girls, who get on people for the smallest things and even talk smack about the employees behind their backs. They actually start more drama than any of the employees do. Not to mention the hotel itself will make you work long shifts with no breaks; and (not as important) even if you do get a break, they are extremely strict about the employees helping themselves to what leftovers sit around after the banquets. In short, a terrible excuse for management with severely limited intellect, who don't care about employees, and who think micromanaging is the way to go."
bad,"Co workers not very friendly no morale very low paying for the job that I have had for so many years for such a big company.Many managers have left the company after being there for at least 15 years of service .The benefits are good but, very high premiums.Other call centers in the area pay at least $ 3.00 more to start.I have only one manager that is just fabulous.If you get promoted you will only get 30 or 40 cents not enough to support a family on your own."
bad,"This place and management are horrible. There is so many shading things going on there. If you are not apart of the backstabbing, lazy, willing to step on the good employees to get ahead, lying group you will be over worked. You will be given the worse schedule, expected to do all the work while the lazy ones do nothing."
bad,Working for the Marriott was one of the best careers that I have endured because the perks of the company and the management were top notch.  My boss was always asking what I needed to maintain sanity.
bad,"Working at Marriotts Warehouse wasn't the best experience, admittedly it is at first, but then you get to know the staff and the people who work there"
bad,"busy always unfairness in front desk busy busy busy, hard part being busy typical busy  the hardest part about the job busy"
bad,A typical day is 12 hour days without breaks and you will not have any weekends off. At each Marriott there have been clicks and it is hard to move up in the industry. Marriott is an awful company to work for!
bad,"What i learned working for this company is how much they discriminate!!! They take advantage of the good & protect the bad.. They are unprofessional & dishonest; they would do whatever it takes to protect their interests!! I would never, ever work for these crooks again @ the Richmond Marriot Downtown!!! This is a crooked corporation.....BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"walk hotel checking all equipment, lighting, building asuring all in working order, check with front desk makr sure all guest calls are taken care of ASAP. everyday we are learning and growing, working with co workers and guest.management is the act of  leading by showing and doining and working with.the hardest part is nothing just doing.the most ejoyable is know that everything is In working order and looks great. well balanced life and work is everyone caring for guest and doing great jobs."
bad,disappointed in the way Marriott corporation manages employees. promises for advancement but not allowed to advance. discriminate against people based on age and race.
bad,Non era molto gratificante il lavoro per una questione economica e perche non venivo utilizzato per la mia mansione
bad,"- very stressful environment"
bad,"Never safe at work, zero safe work practice , egoistic management ,arrogant owners, ZERO job safety. No appreciation. Foreign workers are made to work for free after 8 hours shift. No raises to any staff after few years of hard work. The worse place to work I have seen so far in my 20 years of Chef carrier"
bad,"The job itself is easy but the managers make things very difficult because they aren't organized so my particular shift always gets overworked. I am a very hard worker, and don't mind working. I just want things to be fair. "
bad,"Seriously lacks in effective management and leadership. No member of management really knows what they're doing and cannot delegate their employees to maximize their skills, talents and abilities (but what can you expect from young and inexperienced people just out of school in roles for which they are not qualified?). Never seen a hotel where your sales force spends more time in housekeeping or front desk than in sales doing their actual job (again, because upper management is LAZY and cannot schedule appropriately). Management is completely corrupt and sneaky. Company is incredibly cheap, entry level work at $9.00/hour and below while expecting their employees to be flexible and dedicated. High insurance premium, full time is 32 hours/week and not guaranteed more than that (which is needed for benefits which you won't be able to afford anyhow). The only way to get a promotion is to be in the ""click"". GM is a very little fellow with no spine but incredible ego and voyeuristic tendencies (will watch your every move on camera, even from home), very micromanaging and incredibly lazy. You will do all the work but get blamed for whatever incompetence arises because nobody in management can accept responsibility for their actions and decisions, especially when they fail to order enough food or supplies for hotel and guests have complaints. Management gives directive for you to follow, but will throw you under the bus if a guest complains about it. VERY HIGH TURNOVER!!! Not very challenging work...any monkey could do any job in this hotel."
bad,I enjoy working at residence inn it is a well mentained hotel  we have a lot of platinum and silver elite guest who have made this their home away from home. Managment and co workers are easy to get along with and are respectful to each other
bad,"All I have to say about this company is, once I got pregnant and had complications they weren't willing to work with the needs I had to keep me and my baby healthy. I was not supposed to stand for more than 5 hours because I had a hemorrhage. The second my manager told me I couldn't sit at all at the front I quit and went somewhere that wouldn't put the health of my baby in danger."
bad,"Hated ever minute there, only stayed because of the great benefits. Good heathcare, the hotel discounts are amazing. "
bad,"If you don't mind working on 10 projects all at once, and constantly being interrupted, having to meet tight deadlines daily, and not mind a nasty boss, this is the place for you.  My boss never showed appreciation for me having met every single deadline—without having to even stay late like the other freelancers!—and she was nasty whenever I miss something unimportant.  It might have been a personality thing, but she was not a pleasant person to work with.  The other people I worked with had no clue about anything and I had to chase them down constantly to get any information to do my job.  It was the worst job I ever had and the longest commute ever."
bad,"The money was great but the things that you had to endure during your work week was terrible. Starwood really does not care about its employees. At the time of hiring, we were forced to sign an ""At will"" agreement , which I found to be very suspicious. During the 30 days of training , the Managers made it seem as if things were going to be smooth sailing during calls but once we started taking calls, it was a completely different story. I got terminated because I had to take 4 days off due to my Dr.'s orders. The Managers made a big deal about me potentially missing work,when I explained to them during training that I wasn't feeling well . They said that I knew what I signed up for. Which is a lie. Had I known that they cared more about meeting their quotas instead of the health of their employees, I would have NEVER wasted my time and applied. I was ordered to bed rest by my Dr because I have Colitis , an issue with my colon and I would be heavily medicated and I wouldn't be able to perform my job at even 15%. I contacted my Managers via email, while I was medicated in the ER to inform them of what was going on and I have yet to get a phone call and/or email from them. After being on bed rest for a week, I tried to log in and start my work week and I was locked out of everything . I find this to be very unprofessional . So overall, I would NEVER recommend anyone to work there unless you care about making a quota instead of your health."
bad,"The work was routine and somewhat varied, with lots of guest contact.  We had to stock up on all supplies for our carts in the laundry room on breaks, or before or after work ( if done before or after work, not paid for it, but the expectation was that it was to be done then so as not to lose time on cleaning rooms). We were expected  to only take 30 minutes to clean checkouts, not taking into account that some guests trashed many of them.   We were expected to be available 7 days a week once we got a new head housekeeper, which was not what her predecessor and I had mutually agreed upon. Management would have ""employee appreciation"" lunches (excellent food from our hotel restaurant), at which our redneck manager would tell us at the beginning if we didn't like working working there, we could get up an leave right now - horribly inappropriate.  We were also control-freaked about using the guest elevator over the service elevator even before or after work. Curiously, this rule was never enforced with any staff that wasn't labor, another ""you're the slaves, we're the masters"" class-conciousness.  Most of us just ignored management in the interest of saving time. We had to have extremely good reasons for not being at the 5 times per week ""training sessions"" that we were paid to attend, which were  a half an hour long discussions of something out of our employee rule book.  Most of us felt that they interfered with us getting our rooms done in a timely fashion when we were really busy or understaffed, and after a year you pretty much have the rules down pat. I didn't mind these"
bad,The company bids for contracts and sells solutions that they have no experience implementing. Projects are poorly managed. The subject matter experts fail on implementation causing cascading failures to provide clients with desired project goals. Clients end up paying double or triple the original expected costs because they already committed a significant amount of money into the project already and have no other option than to agree to pay more. The company culture does not recognize the extra hours you put in. There is no training. Management leadership is poor and unfriendly.
bad,"Management at the Marriott West is the worst. People I worked with were awesome but the general manager and HR person were just terrible. People showed up drunk numerous times, stole, and the HR manager is the worst gossip. DO NOT WORK HERE. I'm sure other marriotts are good but St louis Marriott West is terrible and TPG properties are terrible also."
bad,worked for brighton gardens by Marriot about 2hrs in I wanted to quit. I had to send someone home because of a physical altercation.
bad,"Calls all day long, no break between....if you don't hit your quota in three months your are fired.... They don't help you. The quota is very high. Certain percentage of your calls have to be turned into sales DAILY!!! Very difficult, a lot of little games and no one listens to the employees. Yearly survey for the entire centre... St.thomas never does well but the people stay because its a job and they feel intimidated."
bad,Management is constantly looking for ways to get rid of staff or make people work overtime for free. You have no friends there because everyone will stab you in the back. If you have a bad boss just wait because they will leave. Nobody stays there for any amount of time.
bad,"Marriott should be totaly ashamed and embarrased to be associated with this branch. I use to love coming to work everyday and they switched managment and the place is being run to the ground. Teh co-wprkers minus a few are out for themselvesand what they can get , thereis no team work at all, it is all about who can get who in trouble and get further in theri career.We have kids running this center who do not provide the quality of food that we were use to serving and the evaluations should show you that . All I wanted a year ago was to get back working there and now all I want is out , we barely have enough staff now. I am considered part timeand I am off all week but get 16 hours on a Friday and 10 hours the very next day , does that make sense."
bad,"I worked for this company for 1 month and I hated every minute of it I just quit one day because life is to short and why waste time going to a dead end job where they don't respect you and treat there employees like a machine. This company believe in work until you pass out. There's people that worked 19 hours straight with one 30 min lunch break. Some even work 75 hrs in 1 week only 30 min lunch break was given. Your schedule is a joke if you schedule a shift believe me you will stay an extra 4 to 5 hours on your feet non stop working. I was schedule 4pm to 3 am and I had to report to work 8am that morning yes people 5 hours later wow no sleep how can your body rest when you been up for 12 hours and have to do all over again in 5 hours? A average day at the Westin is clock in, report to your department and work until you drop to the floor. If you try to go to bathroom manager will go looking for you because taking breaks isn't allowed. Management isn't fair and the employee of the month is a joke. The people that wins this so call employee of the month is those in the office sitting on there behind."
bad,* Dealing with errant customers
bad,management was ok but had better. learned more about my job. co-workers ok. no hard parts. pot luck dinners'
bad,"One thing I won’t miss is the ""misery loves company"" attitude everyone has that works at the Westin. Seemed like it was hard to be happy about anything in life since Westins ""secret brainwashing"" (brand training) robs employees of any joy in life. The Westin was foreboding. I was stressed out about losing my job and had little to do. I was constantly wasting my energy on trying to stay out of trouble. Since anything you do good is either unrecognized or negetively critisized. Then the monkey suite and brand language makes you lose your identity and now you’re just another brick in the wall. They make you feel like you wont get the job if you don't sign something that says your available to work any shift. Then make you work when you don't want to. I hated my employment with Westin in the end. I'm very happy to be gone... Westin robs you of any joy as it's culture tends to consume every aspect of your life."
bad,"they are very picky, not very nice people to work for. the only good thing is we get free leftover soup for lunch everyday"
bad,"No support from management of you aren't willing to give all of your time and energy to the company for Cents above minimum wage  "
bad,"this job was fair to me at all. I had lost some loves ones last year starting with my father, mother, and my younger son. I was going through a lot at the time. some of the workers were very passionate but they had their picks and their favorites."
bad,"Work ethics is good, but no personal life possible with this low culture . "
bad,"Orlando World Center is a TOXIC WORK ENVIRONMENT*(Front Desk/Office). The pay is very low (you make more at Wal-Mart hourly). Job Culture/Moral is extremely poor. Front Office is poorly ran. Front Desk is always understaffed (your constantly working twice as hard and given multiple extra tasks daily) Paid Time Off is never granted due to understaffing issues. Work hours change every day, you never have a consistent shift. For example one day you may work 6-230 the next 3-11. The worst is when they make you work until 11pm one night and make you come back at 6am the very next morning! You barely ever get two days off in a row. Your sleep schedule is always out of wack. You are constantly stressed out (from guests, co-workers, low pay). It feels like your health takes a backseat as well. GUESTS ARE ALWAYS MAD at housekeeping, restaurants, high costs, valet or check-in process. Housekeeping never has rooms ready (so therefore guests will keep coming to the front desk and giving you a hard time until their rooms get ready) Housekeepers purposely call off on busy days, leaving rooms dirty until 6 7 8pm! Listen Marriott is a great company to work for but just not this property. It is extremely poorly ran. Make the healthy choice and do yourself a favor and seek another Marriott Property. This property could be so much more with the correct management/directors in place. Hopefully help is on the way and managers/director gets replaced!"
bad,women/housekeepers are too caddy keep up a lot of nonsense and harmful gossip too much favoritism ever changing schedule low respect level almost non existent
bad,Got fired cause I had a hospital trip after having an allergic reaction to peanuts I had to clean up. I came back with a doctors note and was still fired
bad,Good place to work to make some fast money.... But I was told be a few co-workers to watch the politics. Basically meaning watch the management. I should have listened.
bad,They look out for themselfs and lie on you to protect their own tale. You are not appreciated for your hard work. I work a lot of shifts and eving in laundry. I got assaulted and i was fired.
bad,I had to wait six plus months to receive my last paycheck and my earned PTO check and that was after allowing them to give me the run around from November to January they gave me excuse after excuse They charged my for company insurance after my policy was canceled.  I finally had to take my case to the Nebraska labor board to get what they owed. The funny part is they paid me in cash.
bad,"New, incompetent and inexperienced managers were hired. They try to bully, and push their weight around. Micro management is bad! Your manager will dig and dig to find any reason, no matter how small to fire you if they do not like something/anything about you-even after the decade of committed loyalty and highly intellectual knowledge of all aspects of job. They will approve vacation for you, then revoke it after flights and all arrangements have been made. Shift bidding is a nightmare."
bad,The Marriott overworks and underpays its employees. Everyone worth anything left because work was so unfair and dramatic. No management support. Hated going to work everyday.
bad,Stressful work environment with condescending management that have no clue about anything that is going on but then blames workers for managements mistakes.
bad,If it was not for the Poor Management I would have stayed. Management shows favoritism towards the hispanics.  They are very rude and they nit pick over your work to find something wrong. Margarita was the worse. I would have like this job better if upper management actually listen to your complaints. The days were long especially sunday. I didn't mind because the pay was good.
bad,It was pretty good the pay was not all that but it had its benefits you get discounts on rooms and get to stay there sometimes if you don’t have a ride to work the next day so that was pretty cool
bad,"Talk about looking out for your staff, this place does not. There is always a reason you can’t have the next job, you can’t apply for this or you are not ready for that. They’re will give every excuse in the book to keep you where they want you. In a low paying, low level role where you are not challenged. "
bad,I take call all day and make reservations. I book world wide for Marriott international i sit all day i mean its not to much to say about the job im at a computer 8 hrs a day
bad,This place cares more about making profit than actually taking care of employees and giving them a liveable wage.  There’s is no opportunity for advancement and terrible communication
bad,Depressing job and they lie and tell you that you’ll get promoted quickly when people have been working in sales for years with no advancement opportunity
bad,You pay way to much for benefits. Their good but you pay a lot for it. weekly pay which is nice. The amount of PTO time is horrible. Some managers are none helpful. No coaching or talk about career path.
bad,"Marriott is a great place to work for, but not under the Aimbridge company. Aimbridge company doesn’t care enough about their workers to pay them holiday pay. The employees doesn’t realize that is a 500+ room hotel and it is ran like a motel. This place care more about labor rather than effectively training their employees. I would never work for another Aimbridge ever again."
bad,"Poor mangment, unstablework place, unfriendly staff, not enough pay  for your work, uncaring staff, healthcare taken, overall I would not recommend this place for anyone to work at."
bad,"The manager consistently lied, no team morale, low pay. Constantly expected to do more and more with no extra compensation.  Expected to work during holidays. Overall a terrible place to work. Do not recommend"
bad,"This job is the easiest job that I've ever worked in my life and oddly enough, became the most difficult and mentally-draining. Factors for this: changing management with a high possibility of decline, an ever-evaporating staff, and a corporate culture I found myself frequently at odds with. It had the surface-level necessities required of working in a corporation (insurance, vacation time, etc.) and a not-so-criminal low wage, but all of that couldn't keep me secure financially with working such a lowly job with high demands and with cutting hours, getting paid way lower than what my output was worth."
bad,I did not work for Marriott VW only for Marriott International. I really do not understand why this was picked up. MVW is not the same as Marriott International.
bad,The job itself is not the stressful part of this position. The stressful part is that the people at the particular Marriott I am employed at does not communicate proficiently. No one is organized and I am yelled at from all sides due to others not doing their job.
bad,Great place to work but management was horrible and controlling. When things goes wrong it's always finger pointing and the blaming game. Management makes employees lie on the survey by telling us what we have to check and write down. Management hardly gives credit to hard working employees and plays favorite.
bad,This place is horribly managed. Its only 2 years old and is already being run into the ground. If you want to be respected as an employee dont work here. If you want to be treates poorly and taken advantage of then definitely go there. Most under qualifoes managment ever. I would rather be job less and homeless than continue to work there.
bad,"If you're the type of person that does not like kissing up to your department manager or HR then this is not the job for you. The only way to advance here is to be best friends with your boss.  Plus the department managers play favorites and the employees that know they're favorites take advantage of it."
bad,"I really enjoyed my job here, I loved the guests, and AT FIRST my coworkers. Then I found out everyone who worked there was two faced and talked behind everyones back. Management is just as bad, and favors butt kissing ghetto trash over others. I was ""let go"" for having a SMALL problem with another co worker. Not because I did anything wrong at my job."
bad,AGM is very good at job. Most other managers were clueless - at least when I worked there. No career advancement. Hiring practices at front desk questionable to say the least.
bad,the people i worked with are nice and friendly but the management is terrible. they will not hesitate to write you up for an honest mistake after only being there for 2 months. unacceptable!
bad,"During my time at the Marriott I enjoyed my coworkers however management was very lackluster, incompetent , conniving And quick to pass out writes ups  without hesitation .This is the worst company to ever work for ."
bad,To some up the GM and AGM are both the most closed minded and least like Marriott standards I have ever met. I love the company but was so shocked at this location. I have worked at many Marriott's but I would never tell anyone to work at this one.
bad,"Job is a temporary till I found other employment. Not a friendly place to work. 8 minutes a day off the phone"
bad,When you first start working here it's great everyone seems to get along and its rather relaxing though still rather fast paced. But immediately after you start to feel like you're settled in it all goes down hill. The management team constantly fights and can never seem to get their work done. A lot of which they push onto the lesser associates who get overloaded most days already with extra cleaning duties on top of their normal day to day work making sure everything runs smoothly. Quite frequently you end up under appreciated or not at all for the work you do and no matter how much you seem to get done you're always told you haven't done enough. People frequently come and go due to the actions of management making for an unstable team and how improperly they handle situations. I would not recommend working here to anyone at least not for a long period of time the stress and workload DO NOT match the tiny scraps they toss at you as pay.
bad,It would be best to work for corporate. Can be very busy but can be very slow depending on the season. Nothing hard about the job other than....Most enjoyable part would be the guest.
bad,"Management was terrible, they didn't care about their employees or what they needed or wanted! They take advantage of you and just don't care about the end result!"
bad,"Received daily emails from a certain department head to constantly complete her work without compensation. Working for this particular hotel became extremely stressful, which lead to me not wanting to work for the company any longer."
bad,No respect for their employees or lower management. AGM very prejudice. DHR is never available. GM invisible. No team work at this property and 90 percent of the staff is very unhappy.
bad,"Management is the real issue here. They pay minimum wage. Both hotels are sold out almost everyday but yet they don't want to compensate. And every manager in every dept. here is as incompetent as they come. If you want to work for Marriott, this location is a good place to start because since they pay so little, no one wants to transfer here. So they only hire people with no hotel experience. My advice, do your 6 months and transfer out."
bad,"Took this job temporarily while looking for something more in the construction field. Treat employees horribly. Cant even begin to describe the con artist who runs this place, and how horribly the management takes advantage of their employees. Just got a settlement check (only for a couple hundred dollars) from a class action lawsuit from the employees against management."
bad,"If you like sitting down for 8 hours and 40 hours a week, this job is for you. You consult with customers through the phone so it is a lot easier to communicate and discuss issues. "
bad,What a horrible place to work! ! The management team lacks intelligence and tact. There is no level of understanding for you and your job as a therapist and this goes all the way to the GM through corporate.  The atmosphere is catty and they want to treat you like you don't have professional licensing.  The Marquis in Atlanta is just horrible and if you have the pleasure of working with these people regret will follow soon enough.
bad,"Management was terrible.  Lazy, unmotivated staff was constantly leaving work for other employees.  Bickering and threats between staff.  Revolving door of good staff leaving all the time because they didn't want to work with bad staff."
bad,Worked part time as a security guard for 2 years. Within those 2 years the hotel changed hands three or more times. Didn't know if I would have a job from day to day. Finally the hotel changed hands and new management was brought in and desion was made to move from in house security to outside security.
bad,"a typical day at work includes washing dishes,communicating with guests (most employees don't), ensuring that foods are out and cooked well. with my experience at Spokane valley residence inn i learned how to cook foods to correct temperatures and how to work as a team (sort of). The hardest part of this job was getting hours cut daily without warning (everyone has this issue), communicating as a team with management when problems occur with machines or equipment (frequent).  the most enjoyable part of this job was communicating with guests, helping them with their needs, and the hard work of cooking foods, doing dishes, cleaning tables, and overall upkeep during breakfast hours."
bad,Manages safety and security for the largest hotel in the Carolinas. Decreased the amount of Worker's Comp Claims and dollars.
bad,During the interview I expressed my need for growth. There is no where to move at this property. Management sucks. The work is a joke.
bad,"A typical day at my job is making sure that our guest receive 5 star service from the time they enter the front door. I am the first person that they see and I have to make sure that they have all the necessary information that they need to have a perfect stay for whatever reason that they are there. Management there is pretty fair and easy to work for. The hardest part of my job sometime is making sure that I have all the information that I need. The most enjoyable part of my job my job is my day to day interaction with my coworkers and guests. This is overall a decent job, just no room for promotion."
bad,"Majority of the employees are miserable, worked out, stressed. They are not flexible with the hours. The managers are complete idiots and very unorganized and unprofessional (late etc.). Communication is awful no one tells anyone about what is going on in the hotel and what the guest count is in the entire hotel. They do not even pay workers time in a half for holidays. I would only recommend this job to people who do not mind working a slow paced job."
bad,"•	Patrol hotel property to ensure the safety of guests and employees and to protect all hotel assets.  "
bad,"Over worked."
bad,"Working at the Courtyard Marriott was an OK experience. I enjoy working independently, and all of my co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The management, however, is a different story."
bad,"Management was all over the place, people coming in and out and there was no stability. Too much work on one person, this was not a fair place to work. Management showed favortism to some and completely ignored others. The guests were nice at times but some were very snooty because of their kids that attended the college right behnd the hotel. The money was pretty good but it was so much B.S. with the managemnt and staff that you could really say you dont wanna deal. There were never enough staff there and you were over worked. They cannot keep staff due to the poor management. There is some racism involved but i wont comment on that. They take your lunch period from you even if you dont get to take a lunch so please watch your time and make sure your tips and hours are accounted for. The supervisors and management need more training. Watch out for free lunch fridays, it may be food left over from a banquet from 4 or 5 days ago."
bad,The management are rude and unhelpful to their employees. If they can get away with throwing their work to one of the housekeepers it's going to happen.
bad,"I just don't recommend this job to anybody."
bad,"Low employee morale. People more focused on going home early, even though they were late to work. Lack of management."
bad,Nothing good can be said about this place..... it's horrible. Managers are rude. Period
bad,"Not an innovative company, low salaries, long interviewing process, etc."
bad,"Executives take home hundreds of thousands while everyone else earns way, way less than market. You get capped at ridiculously low pay rates and then literally can't get a raise."
bad,First there is no work and life balance.
bad,I dont think that the management really knows what they are doing and take the sides of other managers even when they are wrong but the other employees made this a really fun job to work at
bad,inizio attività mattina alle sei per apertura e organizzazione dei piani
bad,"While there is great learning opportunity, this opportunity is forced upon you b/z there is no actual training from management. There is little accountability for work not performed and any concerns about job duties are ignored."
bad,They didn't work as a team at all. The olds housekeeping always ask for help to finish her work and the new ones have to work harder even the supervisor gave less work to their friends and persons from their country Philliphinas
bad,"The management is terrible unless she automatically likes you. She is demeaning and rude and she cant even be bothered to train her employees, you basically have to learn as you go along. But god forbid you make a mistake because she will hold it against you for as long as humanly possible. She is very adamant about having a “cheat sheet” to answer phone calls yet it doesn’t even say verbatim what she expects us to say. She is rude and unprofessional going as far as badmouthing you to other departments."
bad,I used to love it until new management took over! The new general manager is the worst! She doesn’t even speak to her employees. Very sneaky and a micromanager! Makes working there very uncomfortable.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend that place to anyone!!"
bad,"Worked as maintenance manager with pay.of 17/hr. During interview, they said that after probation, we will talked about salary raise. After 3 months, I stated about increasing my salary due to my performance. They ignored me. After 7 months, they said they cannot do anything about my salary. I have worked more than what is expected of me. They want me to do everything which I am not responsible of."
bad,NOT ENOUGH WORKERS FOR ALL THOSE ROOMS WITH LOW PAY THEY NEED MORE HOUSEKEEPERS.If they hire more workers the job is ok.They have great benefits they just work you to hard.
bad,Marriott seems to breed an air of arrogance that makes it so unappealing year after year I work here. There is nothing hospitable about the hospitality industry. I have seen some great people come to work for Marriott and leave as hollow shells of the former person they used to be
bad,Company is not inclusive. Bad experience with managers. Terrible for trans people; no gender neutral restrooms. People don't respect you or treat you seriously.
bad,"I was really excited to start working here at first because it's a major company & i thought it would be a good fit, but it was absolutely not. The housekeeping department is absolutely terrible no management or organization whatsoever. And not to mention the pay is also terrible. The supervisors had favorites and if you were outside of the race they preferred, you will basically be treated terribly. My last week there, they had lost so many workers, I won't be surprised if they close the place down soon."
bad,All the housekeepers are noisy and it's like high school all over again other than that they were okayi guess I still can't believe that they fired me because I got sick and I was in my 90 day probation period
bad,Human resources was extremely difficult to work with.  General Manager would not allow me to hire employees even though we were short staffed but had room in the budget to two more people.  Overall a horrible work experience!
bad,Poor work environment and poor management. Use the union a lot as to why the cant do anything. Would not reccomend  this as a good work environment...
bad,I work in a Virginia location and the management is horrible. They are really not well at screening management they let anyone work. I love the company but hate the management
bad,"I lasted about three weeks or less.  Never did I ever get trained.  Both managers were moving on, and didn't wanted to give you hands on training.  They humiliated you in front of customers.  My first day I blew up balloons for the managers birthday party, the next day I was told to read a binder that was 8"" thick, and after viewing the e-traing which everyone knows is BS, they sent me to the wolves while they sat on their butts."
bad,"I have a hard time understanding this location, maybe it's poorly representing the Marriott brand but otherwise I'm judging what my experience is at the marina del Rey, ca location. As an employee of several other companies this is my first job where I had to battle with myself is it worth the money to come in and be treated poorly by people that you report to everyday. Is there like a disease where no one knows how to treat each other? They do offer amenities like cafeteria, however the food will make you sick 30 percent of the time.. especially during days we are short on staff. We work without gloves and essentials accessibles often..somedays it seems like a nightmare job, and human resources painstakingly handles issues at a pace that baffles me, Its like a circus with wierd things happening like a strangers coming into the employee locker rooms naked and you hear nothing until you have to go to work and the locks are on the doors with no explanation... you wonder how these things happen at such a beautiful location. The pay is nice for my job, I have not missed any days prior to the mishandling of a sequence of recent incidents so now I'm looking for another job because I'd rather not stress about such a mundane job. I just need to get past school and working jobs like these are a harsh reminder to keep focused and studying so you don't have to be miserable at a place like this. I think the hotel does a good job of performing for the guests most of the time but the grittiness and cringeworthy payout of what goes on at that expense is an unreasonable tradeoff for your time"
bad,"If you want to feel like a number and not a human you should work for marriott. Nothing they give you works, and your job depends on your stats. They always want more, while paying you the bare minimum. The upper management us so out of touch, its comical. Look elsewhere unless you really need a job."
bad,"At the time I needed to secure employment and accepted the role of Guest Services. The pay was low and management was poor. A typical day was working, receiving a discounted lunch and end your shift with not much motiviation,."
bad,"This is a big company that claims they care about their employees but it appears to be more about making money. I feel for a company this big, they need to manage better and not put employees in dangerous positions such as driving a beverage cart in the rain, and getting things fixed that cause injuries because they aren’t working properly."
bad,I felt like I was just a number. This was with Marriott Rewards in Salt Lake City. The pay was horrible. I might have put up with the stress if they had paid better.
bad,"For the whole time i was working there ( almost a year ) i haven't received any training, except my 3 first working days. Management treat the staff very badly  and they  have very poor management skills.  There is no empathy, support or motivation."
bad,The guests are what keep this going. I enjoyed meeting people from around the world and hearing there feed back about there experience with us. As far how we can make them more comfortable and what we can do make the experience more enjoyable.
bad,it's a poor job over worked and under paid we have to do far too much just to not have enough money. It's just a terrible job especially if you need to make more money.
bad,"I worked here for 2 years and it was stressful overwhelming as well as management sucked, we became short staffed and had to stay late nights at work."
bad,"my day start at 5 am to prep food and maintain a hot buffet. for 3 hour till i being back the food  to store them.Then I clean the food lobby, hot buffet area and the kitchen area and and perform serve safe daily usually by my self with the exception of weekends, and leave one in finished."
bad,"The entire team is very lazy so you end up doing everyone else work and on top of that management has no clue what they are doing so the front desk person usually ruining the show and taking all the heat for all the mess ups. oh, and they only pay 10.50 an hour."
bad,love working there most of the people i worked with were great but the management sucks. really wish they would learn on how to handle problems properly
bad,"They will overwork you if you give them the chance. It is not uncommon that they have people working 6 or more days straight. That being said, you won't get any over time, they structure your hours so you could work 8 days straight, and not receive any over time."
bad,"Hired and within 3 months was told by the Director, that I was to replace him.  Long story short, middle management found out and would stop at nothing to prevent it.  I don't work for the Marriott anymore, nor will I ever again.  Crabs in a bucket."
bad,The hotel had to cut the staff in half because of not making debt service and that coupled with no money for upkeep made for a very stressful job. Overall I enjoy what I do but with staffing and money constraints it was very difficult to achieve  all my goals.
bad,"This is a very bad place to work if you are in a technical role especially Software Engineering roles.  This company relies heavily on Outsourcing companies who do a very poor job. The software development and coding practices are completely ignored. The Software engineers don't really do any technical stuff: they are expected to spend all their time in meetings, reading emails and fixing silly issues brought up by oursourcing companies."
bad,The customer is extremely tough to work with as they do not treat vendors with any degree of respect.  Public humiliation appears to be part of the culture.
bad,"Multiple responsibilities, ordering food and provisions and non-food items, scheduling,  assignment of prep lists to line cooks, sauce preparation, creating menus utilizing seasonal ingredients, maintaining food and labor budgets, Oversee banquet coronation,  ensuring health code compliance, educated employees regarding food standards, Oversee the Sous chefs and assist them as needed."
bad,"Does not care about employees , if you are sick and there is no leave time available they will tell you to come in anyway even if you are a risk to others."
bad,"this is a terrible place to work, never had weekends off  always had to request anytime off ahead of time.  general manager did not know anything at the front desk.  Everyone was trained differently and no one did the same thing for the same position."
bad,I left due to the lack of management and low pay for a management position. I needed to make enough to pay my bills. I met a lot of really great people but they deserve better - just like I did as well.
bad,i was super excited about working here UNTIL i started working here. i only worked here for 2 DAYS and it was because the management is TERRIBLE!  i would go into work and really be ready to work but the managers didnt bother spending more then a hour helping and then leave you to fend for yourself at the front desk. the managers stayed in the back for my entire shift and i had to go back to them each time because i was new and needed guidance. its a shame that they preach about team playing and then the second you start they leave you for dead. the manager told me it takes 6 months to learn this business but the rate i was starting i can completely understand why. its a shame when you are actually someone that wants to learn and your getting no help or guidance.
bad,"Always understaffed,company does not live for its marriott values as far as taking care of their associates. they can care less about you or your family."
bad,"Would rather work in a field picking cotton all day"
bad,Lots of talk about caring about employees but not much actual management in regard to this.  This company should practice more of what it preaches to it's employees
bad,"Kitchen Line Cook (Former Employee) - Aloft Ny, Feb 10, 2017"
bad,"I loved working at the hotel because you see things you never seen before. The hotel was beautiful, there were people that came from out of town, it was just a great environment to be in. There was nothing to really learn i just vacuumed 4 floors and went home. Management was so horrible it's like they just hired people on the street they did no work always left early and made you do other co-workers jobs it was just horrible. All the co-workers were friendly and helped when you really needed it. The job wasn't hard i just vacuumed and had to make sure it was clean. I enjoyed meeting different people and just exploring the hotel"
bad,Bad management. Contentious work place. Very bad morals. Need to do more for employees. Very high turnover. Have to do more to retain good employees. Management is more reactive than proactive. Company can do much better especially for its employees.
bad,"The company itself has decent benefits. Free life insurance after 90 days and your PTO (2hrs for every 40 hours) accures after this time. The pay is absolutely awful and it's sad that you have to beg for money. The only upside is if you like to travel the room rates at some of the nicer chains can be very decent. As far as management (GM & Assistant GM) is concerned at the Courtyard Greenville Haywood Mall they are racist, biased and extremely unprofessional. They will belittle you and make you feel as though you aren't a valued employee even when you're going above and beyond for them. I have never in all my years come across such heartless and ungrateful people. I hope that Marriott cleans up that mess for the sake of their brand."
bad,It wasn't a friendly working environment. Seniors or managers will throw the most difficult job to beginner and they don't teach you. Also they will talk bad things behind you.
bad,"The job  was hard and physically hard on your body."
bad,All management need further training on all employee interactions. Not a great place to work. Too much employee turnaround.
bad,"As a housekeeper a typical  day included: Changing bed linen, emptying trash, vacuuming, dusting, and keeping up with the cleanliness of the facility. I learned that many people don't respect the job title of a housekeeper, and how much work it entails cleaning up after guest. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting tips from satisfied customers. The co workers were diverse and ok to work with for the most part. Management could have been a lot better, as far as rate of pay, and scheduling."
bad,Can achieve lots of overtime. Cross training in other departments is advised for advancement. Typical day can involve checking in and out a lot of guests.
bad,"Nothing to really say about this place besides my team were amazing hardworking people, I learnt a lot from them and became a lot more confident within myself and received high audit scores"
bad,"They are looking for a skilled worker to do all this for $13 or less a hour! What a insult! "
bad,"This is by far, one of the worse places I've ever worked. Your body and feet will feel like they've been taken thru the wringer. $12 an hour is not enough money for the work you have to provide. In order to get a decent paycheck, you have to spend almost everyday there. I'd just started and was scheduled for up to 14 hours a day some days. Good luck with training unless you speak Spanish. We're a very diverse world but the people training you barely speak English which is ridiculous. There's lots of room for growth within Marriott, just get out of the lower level positions and you can really excel because otherwise, you're wasting your time. The majority of the housekeeping department is Ethiopian and that's because the Manager is. The majority of the Banquets Department is Spanish and that's because the Managers are. Be prepared to do a morning stand-up daily which includes the GM amongst other department managers.  Also, be prepared for the dumbest most lame jeopardy and trivia questions. Who really cares about the trivia? The department I was in had no structure, no base, too many Chiefs, no respect amongst employees, lots of race relation issues, no real direction, you're just on your own or the pawn amongst other employees who don't get along. I realized where I'd come from and how far I'd come and decided that I'd worked too hard too long to get where I'd gotten in my career just to take it back and start way from the bottom almost as a slave because that's surely how I felt. To each his own. Please take heed and run. Don't do it, you are wasting your time. Seriously."
bad,learning all areas of kitchen. Staff is great. Schedule flexibility
bad,"A typical day at work would be coming in and counting the drawer, making the call arounds, printing out all the reports, making sure everyone is checked out, check flight schedules, check shuttle schedules, check in early check ins, look over special requests, transfer callers to other extensions, restock the market and refresh coffee. I learned a lot about the hotel life and how it actually functions. Management was not the best. They promise you one thing with your schedules and then they don't go through with it. They will change your schedule for the week and not even tell you. You won't know what you are working unless you look every single time you go into work. They fire you because you tell them you have a 6 month old daughter and need a more set schedule. The general manager is just plain rude. If you ask her any kind of question she will act like you are the most incapable, dumbest person ever and literally walk around with her nose up in the air. The hardest part of my job was trying to remain happy in these circumstances. The most enjoyable part was meeting all the new people that came to stay at the hotel."
bad,"One of the most unprofessional environments I have ever been a part of.  This hotel is a former red zone property, which means they almost had their brand stripped away due to grossly poor performance.  Within 5 months of my employment they had reached #1 global status for guest satisfaction and there was no mention of this by upper management.  Once asked, it was brushed off and portrayed as ""their own work"".  Which I found astonishing since in the previous 5 years of existence they had never been as high as #150.  My staff was not congratulated, nor was I.  This type of morale permeated the entire property and was not something I wished to continue being a part of."
bad,"•	Provided professional housekeeping services for various standard hotels"
bad,"Worked for this Co 12 years , Ended up leaving for a competitor .Best move i ever made, All Starwood cares about is there stock prices. You can work very hard but if they dont like you ,you can do nothing right"
bad,"Hired as a server, I left this company within three days. For 13% grat and 4.77 an hour we were bussers, furniture movers, servers, food runners, dishwashers, and housekeepers on every shift. The bottom line here is they need to hire more employees This resort has billions."
bad,It's a good place to work but the pay for room service associates is below poverty rate.
bad,"Long hrs, Nothing I loved about this job...too tired to spend my money working at the Marriott"
bad,It's ok. If you have a more then two kids or going to school this hotel is not for you they want more of your time
bad,I enjoyed the hotel setting i was meet someone of high profile status
bad,"I would not recommend working for this particular location if your work success is a factor in your overall happiness. Marriott is a great company to work for, but the event center is not run by the Marriott so the management does not have to follow any training guidelines, doesn't have an HR department (for good reason), etc. The way the employees were treated at the Riverwoods, and Elements was a huge disappointment. There was no proper training, there were no evaluations (even when asked for), and there was daily harassment by the management to their employees."
bad,When new ppl come in they are not treated right by most of the workers. They will tell you the wrong things because they think you are coming in to take their job.
bad,"The management do not care about their employees.  I was repeatedly bullied by a supervisor and when I reported it, nothing was done.  It was so stressful I had to take a leave of absence.  When I came back, the bullying continued so I had to leave.  I was never given an exit interview nor did anyone from hr or management ask why I was leaving.  I have worked in call centres for 20 years and this one is by far the worst."
bad,"In my entire life, I have never felt depressed or anxious until I started working at the Downtown Dallas Marriott. While many of the employees are friendly, the management is demeaning and militant."
bad,The company I work individual experience while I was working there is know what need to be done and everybody's is happy great day. Details about why I liked or disliked my job is liked it because what I been doing skills level of cleaning rooms daily and for the dislike is no team player at the company.
bad,"The environment sucked! You’re exhausted all the time! I worked a lot harder than what I was paid! I swear I should’ve been in maintenance because I went from fixing bed frames and fixing vents to taking 20-30 pound windows out to clean them and pressure washing balconies. On top of that the Supervisors we’re always trying to be the managers, so they were always fighting."
bad,"There was no working as a team, as almost everyone was out for themselves. I was not trained properly and was told by the hiring manager that the job is easy, when in fact, it's very stressful and hard on the body. When it came to me quitting, the GM became unprofessional and made it personal."
bad,"I worked for Le Meridien, one of Marriott's newer hotels in downtown Denver. Management is running around like chickens with their heads cut off and can't follow up on anything. They never listened to anything I had to say and always seemed disinterested. One would make a point not to look at you and instead watch everyone else in the room except for you even when you are trying to discuss something important. Their attitude is that their jobs are secure and everyone else is expendable."
bad,Buen trabajo ambiente de esta empresa honesto puntual
bad,TownePlace Suite (Former Employee) Saraland. The worse place Of employment ever. The upper management talks about the employee. Supervisor talk wirh other employee about other employee personal business. Employee come in smelling like alcohol and weed.  Supervisor have employee inspecting their own rooms.
bad,Supervisor was no good. Put his people down using his hurtful words. Doesn't appreciate his employee. Gm is the same too. Will tell their employee not nice things. Don't even work at this place.
bad,Appreciate workers and order enough supplies to complete our assignments for the day. Help workers to understand what they need to do to improve. More team work is needed.
bad,Being a part of Marriott’s Analytics team was the worst experience of my career.  Our departamental leader was frequently missing in action and did not communicate.  Working with the outdated data systems was a pain.  Marriott’s culture is not data driven which made the place even more miserable.
bad,It would be a better job if the management was better. They had bed bugs in many many rooms and never shut them down and treated them correctly so they were spreading threw the hotel
bad,The company has great benefits but the Chattanooga location needs a intervention from corporate. No training or effort from management to do things right. It is completely cut throat.
bad,Marriott is a large corporation that is it. They employ associates to take back to back phone calls. Long hold times between transferring to different departments and very wishy washy communication between the company.
bad,"Shifts leader in villa 5 and 7.6. I manage a group of internal supervision for the processing of the rooms in all quality standards and the hotel Istander"
bad,"A typical day consisted of a quick meeting in the morning and everyone getting their assignment board for the day. From the first day I worked there, I quickly noticed how unorganized everything is. My supervisors never introduced themselves, they were unfriendly, I had to figure out who was who. Most of my coworkers didn't speak English, so communicating with them was very hard. The hardest part of the job was that a lot of linens were stained which made making beds to be very time consuming. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the guests."
bad,"Was not satisfied at all. No advancement and management doesn't seem to care about you. They talk about appreciating our efforts but don't do anything at all. All words, no action."
bad,"I have been a manager in this hotel for a number of years.  "
bad,"great days at work, wonderful customers who knows what they want, same customers keep coming back, build relationships,"
bad,clean and wash dishers mop and wax the floors dismantle cupboards and old funitures change bulbs fix tables and chairs fixed beds and clean the windows and doors.
bad,"no work life balance, cut staff in half before realizing that the staff was needed. the staff working was very professional however overhelmed"
bad,Had to book as many reservations as possible but company discouraged from forming personal relationships or any relationships with customers. We only had a certain amount of time allowed on the phones
bad,"Middle Management works about 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, but the associates keep you smiling and laughing throughout the day.  Many of the guests that stay are business travelers that come on a weekly basis and as you get to know them each week you can surprise them with something as small as having their luggage from the previous week already put into their preferred room or buyiing them dinner because they reached their Platinum membership status with Marriott!!"
bad,"I relocated from Calgary to Halifax for a supervisor position and at first it seemed like a dream job. Shortly after realizing that management were absolutely crazy, unreasonable, unorganized, and unprofessional I realized I made a terrible mistake. The stress level was unbelievable and totally unnecessary! Worst employer ever! Don't ever relocate for them for gods sake whatever you do trust me! The pay was good at first glance and the benefits were good but not worth it in the slightest. "
bad,"Good people "
bad,"If someone reports a coworker for something they did not do, there is no way to refute it. Management takes their word for it. If you do not do well with your stats compared with others you do not get a raise. Others will try to undermine you so that they can look better. NOT team-oriented. Everyone is for themselves."
bad,"When i came talk to my mangers, and told them my rent was increased. Beyond the pay. And i cant afford my rent do to low paying . I asked if i can transfer from houskeeping to the front desk since they make $3 dollar more so i wouldn't get evicted."
bad,"I was still in my probation period when I was wrongfully terminated due to racist management. They excused my absences which were legitimate  and made up lies about me not doing my job when the managers weren’t around to check on me. The employees were cool but the managers expect you to work at the same pace as the other people even if you don’t know what you’re doing. Instead of the managers being real managers and letting you know that you’re not doing something the correct way, they find excuses to get rid of you and wonder why the turnover rate is so high. HR doesn’t fully investigate the situation, they just take whatever the managers tell them and run with it so it’s your word against theirs."
bad,"I was harassed by my manager and the hr department did nothing about it until 2 days until my last day. They don’t care about their employees, but they’ll go to war for their management. Like letting their drug addict managers go on leave instead of firing them like they would do to regular employees. Don’t waste your time here. At least not in Louisiana."
bad,"Towson University Marriott did not live up to that standards of Marriott. When an employee walks into a Marriott, they have a level of expectation for great customer service and supportive management staff. The general manager lived in the hotel on the 18th floor with his family and HE was NEVER around. It was like inmates were running the asylum. Worst hotel that I ever worked for!"
bad,"Not busy, no hours, favoritism from bosses causing unfair situations, not a good work environment, poor management. Rude managers under 13 hrs a week if lucky"
bad,"I'm a temp, so take this as you will, but I was never informed of how long I would work, what I was even paid for the work, and I never got a break after working for nearly 12 hours, on my feet, constantly. "
bad,Great place to work  in culture district  haven't met a guest I didn't like management isn't what it needs to be they are very unorganized and some of the managers there only want one specific race for them
bad,The management is poor the have poor communication they treate staff poorly. Its alot of discrimination against employees poor judgement of self-esteem against employees and I do not like working here
bad,"Summary sums it up. Started the job with in a month because had been slow all over in 2008 main office cut all employees by 3% to 6%. No a good way to start, but you have a job."
bad,If you have no social life or family this would be the job for you! Typical day would consist of being talked down to by complete strangers because a housekeeper didn't do their job correctly or the fact someone cant get a luxury hotel room for $80. I left everyday with a migraine. Two good things about this job. First is you can work from home and second is the discounts.
bad,"I currently do work here and I am quitting immediately! This place was very fun AT FIRST! The Front Desk Manager is very nice and accommodating, it is the Executive Managers and the General Manager that it extremely disrespectful! The other managers (Housekeeping, Front Desk etc) are very nice and friendly and fair, however the Sales department and the Executive Managers are uppity and rude to everyone. They complain about you behind your back and eventually to your supervisor. I haven't been here that long and I looked forward to working here for quite a while, but after only being here for a short amount of time, I am sorry I ever step foot in this place. I do not recommend anyone work here!"
bad,"stuff was never in its designated spots, management was a joke,: gosipping like teenagers, their work ethic was poor, and made it intollerable to work for this company. I have good work ethics, and have found it really hard to work for grown adult children. At the end of the day, all they want to do is point fingers, and play the blame game against other coworkers, even while calling some of them their ""friends"" . Their work ethics is a joke, at best."
bad,"usually , I start my day work crossly. Even though is a hard work , I enjoy to be there just to bring my support to the team. by the way, I take this opportunity to explore this new area which is laundry department. it's a very simple jobs in which we link skills and strength. although when the hotels is busy , the job becomes more harder. this experience allow me to work under pressure and quickly."
bad,"had to take a job to pay the rent. it was a blessing to have at the time.  Working nights and the customers were horiblle.  IT was the same job day on and out just audiot, and people normally in a really bad mood."
bad,Taking the skills I learns for each job trying to build my career up move forward in life with the skills I learn
bad,"Do not recommend"
bad,"I can never thank Marriott, and the disgustingly sexist general manager, enough for all of the lessons I've learned. I have never learned so much regarding how NOT to manage employees or how not to treat people in general. So much bullying, favoritism, hypocrisy, and harassment. Employees were retaliated against for calling HR, so don't even think about it or you'll basically be forced to quit your job. Employees were threatened not to speak with HR regarding harassment incidences that occurred at the hotel. If they did, they were treated very badly by the general manager. "
bad,*Every morning starts with an 8am meeting
bad,"Most enjoyable part was interacting with the guests. The most challenging part of the job was working with no breaks. They would give us too much work for the time we had, that we were too busy to take our regular ten minute breaks."
bad,I worked in a hotel with no AC in the lobby. Where guest hated coming to the hotel and I had NO lunch break and was still expected to have a smile on my face. Which now I realize it’s completely illegal. Manager would come in whenever he felt like. And corporate seemed to not know how to manage their staff or guest.
bad,"If you are looking for a company that holds you as a priority, this is not the company to invest your time, future or effort into. Make one mistake and you will lose it all. “Put you first” is a lie. You are disposable. I do NOT recommend working for this company."
bad,It started off cool but people with a little power abuse it. Another thing is yeah they hire felons but Marriott holds that over your head. Neva again
bad,This was a ok job for the time being till marriot started to take over then it got worse management policy started to change and it all went down hill was great at the start if your looking for a job it's ok for temporary but I wouldn't suggest it as a permanent job. People quit a lot or get fired.
bad,"It's a good place to work, if you're really geared towards customer service and great at communication skills.  At my location, they didn't really offer opportunity for advancement."
bad,Not speaking for all Marriott's but if you don't speak Spanish you won't last African-Americans are targeted IF they get employed if the owner would only ask questions about why that specific location is always hiring  that is the reason and these are facts
bad,"I started working here as a housekeeper in  September through December 2018,  let me tell you don't waste your time at all applying for this job, all they do is criticizes  you how you look and they are some rude co-worker and working for the MARRIOTT they  don't care about coworkers only when it comes to money for the guest. When you are assigned to clean rooms, they Rush you when the guests want the rooms clean  right away especially when there's a check out too. November and December are the worst time to work  there's no hours to put you or it's slow ,they only give hours to the sonority and if you're not sonority you only work one or two days out of the week ,you get very frustrated when you're not working.😲😬😵😱"
bad,"Great employment great wages, work is very hard, getting yelled at all day about Marriott products; most guest are complaining after their stay or during their stay about blood on the sheets, bugs, or toilet running, sink not working properly, etc"
bad,Bad management and unable to advance my career.  The workplace environment was poor and I was unable to take any breaks during my shift.  I did not like working there
bad,a few of the chefs had some pretty big egos to get past and the work environment was turbulent. the paychecks for the work done were insufficient and much of the management had a high turnover rate.
bad,"The job itself was fine, as if you have experience in the industry its quiet simple. The food and beverage management and staff are not friendly whatsoever,  as being new they kind of expected me to know where everything was even though I asked many times. Also didn't receive a contract even though I was a month into the job, the food and beverage manger was young and rude, wasn't helpful at all!"
bad,"Working at Il mulino. Poor management. Dictatorship. poor people skills. Very sexist, unprofessional, and major favortism. Co-workers were cliquey. Manager was not looking for you to succeed, will lie even about employees, not open to suggestions, over staffed on slow days, manager will take out a bad mood on workers. Too bad a terrible manager took over this restaurant, it was much more successful and had happier workers before Brian Exner. Manager went from bus boy up to manager with no actual management skills. Very vengeful, temper tantrum style. Unprofessional."
bad,"Unorganized, Too much of upper management  from other department interfere in other department. Turn over rate in high."
bad,"it's fun to work if you just start your career. long hours, hard to advance and move to different positions. low pay, management are only there for themselves. low level employees will be there for min wages. "
bad,just a place to work that's about it management isn't great & no one believes in team work . moral is always down I would not recommend anyone to apply to this job
bad,The Detroit Marriott has a bad work environment. The employment turn over is high. From management to the workers they all was rude.  And they have a racist job culture at the Downtown Detroit Marriott.
bad,"We have to convert a certain percentage of calls into sales to keep our job and get ""bonuses"""
bad,Pros:
bad,The company is a good company to work for but management is very bad. The employee have no say so.
bad,"* Other employees were very nice"
bad,"I only worked here for a short amount of time before coming to find that the staff at this location were completely unreliable, unprofessional, and not supportive of advancement in the company."
bad,"Unfortunately, Marriott could be a wonderful place to work, but the politics at corporate are disgusting. People do not really care about you unless you're a higher up. Even then, you can easily be replaced. People play politics and talk about people constantly. The pay is not even remotely enough to make it in the DMV area and they have these events to make you forget you barely make anything."
bad,"Poor experience,I would never like to work at Portsmouth Marriott hotel again.I do not recommend work in the restaurant due to poor performance of Food and beverage manager."
bad,"*bonne ambiance collectifs"
bad,marriot is a strict company that doesn't always openly support it's employees. But i will say that i have very tough skin from my long years of working for the company. The skills and knowledge will forever remain with me.
bad,"Very laid back job - you just call out all day to confirm unless you get a call in. You can be on youtube, on your phones they don't really care. The real challenge is when you need help. The sups have it too easy so they do the minimum."
bad,"Working for this company starting off was fun,stress free, An a very good working environment that you could work years an years to come very great pay,but the mangerment were petty an bullies an lazy!!!!!Its the housekeepers that work the hardest at this address an I tell you we swallow crow working there.All I wanted to do is work!But Great Big EGOS WOULDNT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN."
bad,"You can't be overwhelmed, you deal with customers all day. Its a fun experience to meet new people from around the world. I liked customers more than anything."
bad,"Residents Inn Whitby is in need of new owners, management trying to get things done but owner is to cheep."
bad,The staff is very racist especially the housekeeping manager evylyn piersanti she does not care much for her employees she treats them very poorly and like they are trash
bad,"This was an enjoyable place to work...at first! They make you feel so welcoming and important and promise you all sorts of things. After a month, you get treated like garbage. Management are phony and pretend to have your back. Supervisors talk about everyone behind their back!"
bad,Marriott was an ok company to work for. I personally never received my pto when I left the company. I left the marriott in one town and went to another marriott that just opened and they dont give pto and pay 3 dollars less
bad,Learn to new software in the business I enjoy the distress pas sager giving them good customer service. I enjoy the hours and the paid. I enjoy all the Marriott family embrace me when I was losing my mother
bad,Management is terrible with complying with family life. Long hours with no appreciation shown for the hard work you do. work is not hard but time consuming
bad,I work here for just a little while I left so soon. Because I was hired for fulle time and they worked me part time I could hardly pay my bills. And it didn't help that the management should favoritism and were very unprofessional from physical touching to they way they communicate. I don't recommended anyone to work here until the get better management.
bad,If you love to stand about for 8hrs doing nothing but a work sheet like school then this jobs for you.. Ridicules staff with no idea what their doing and false promises for training and help from management.. Ignorance is bliss!
bad,"it was a fun place, and a nice, friendly place to work. I learned so much from this place. The co-worker are friendly there, alloy of team work there. everybody help each other out a lot. The breakfast is very good. overall its a really nice, clean place to work."
bad,A typical dayconsist of me answering phone making sure the guest are happy with there stay.
bad,Currently cosulting as a GM for Fern Valley Hotel Holdings LLC in Louisville Ky
bad,"it was fun working there, i enjoyed greeting people and working with different people. there was times it got hard, but i managed through it."
bad,"While i enjoyed working there, the management did not handle situations appropriately at times. they were not very organized."
bad,"I was hired in 2015 to work for their call Centre with 2 weeks training which was amazing training."
bad,Not bad but organisation and not nice atmosphere people were ok didn’t really show much interest in helping us learn and do useful things only cleaning
bad,"marketing managers couldn’t set up a big training "
bad,I really like Star-wood Be for Marriott took over. Marriott  is very different even though some change is good this was not a friendly nor good change
bad,If you’re going to accept a position in Orlando at the ritz Carlton as a guest experience expert... don’t. they make all their GEE’s part time to avoid paying them when it gets slow. Then because you’re part time you receive no insurance benefits the position itself is basically 4-5 front office roles in one with super low pay which isn’t enough to live on. They demand so much of you and don’t pay you even close to enough to compensate for your hard work. Don’t accept this position unless you’re going in as a supervisor or manager. Also there’s no room for advancement they rather hire an outside person with no experience or skills to be your supervisor.
bad,"Absolutely terrible management. Can not keep good employees because the management is completely clueless and ineffective. My advice, stay away, stay far far away. No respect for employees, and micromanaged beyond belief by people without a skill set.This place has a lot of potential but unfortunately no one is doing"
bad,"Productive, over workload during event but manageable, fun with the hotel surroundings, additional knowledge on the venue set-up."
bad,"I could go on forever and ever about how this is by far the worst job I have ever had, but I'll leave it short and simple."
bad,"poor teamwork, supervisor was rude and mean, people wasn't coming to work all the time, to many rooms per person,  the house men was very lazy and didt want to do nothing half the times and there job is to bring the house keeper what they need to clean the rooms so the guest wont be waiting for a long time"
bad,A typical day at work would be to come in and set the room for the banquet function that is about to begin. My coworkers are like family we look out for one another and we work well together. It is never a dull moment. The hardest part of my job is when we have to flip a room for another function in such short period of time. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to interact with my coworkers and guest.
bad,A typical day at work is begining my day with aarranging and organizing guest order. Managing each order before sent up to guest room. The most enjoyable part about my job is giving excellent customer service to our guests.
bad,"They weren't interested in actually hiring me they just wanted dirt on the management company I was currently working for. He also said they have a lot of drama at this location which is not a surprise by what I saw of their leadership. Any manager that sets up ""job interviews""  just to dig up dirt on the competition isn't going to inspire integrity in their team."
bad,"I'm writing this review in hopes to get some kind of help. At the location I currently work at, there's many problems with employees. The Housekeeping Manager hides a lot from our General Manager. I personally feel like HR needs to be aware of a particular day where the Housekeeping Manager left with a housekeeper to an ""appointment"" on company time. He was being paid as he went to said appointment and hasn't experienced any kind of disciplinary actions taken toward him for this. He picks favorites and drives out the employees he dislikes. I'm hoping this review gets some kind of recognition to the problems we're encountering at our location because it makes it almost impossible to feel like everyone is being treated equally at our workplace."
bad,"this is challenging to employees of the hotels directly as well as 3rd party agencies. Because the company owns such a large portion of hotel industry, they are able to set standards for salary and commissions."
bad,"It’s a pretty alright place to work if you KNOW what you’re doing, they really don’t care to train you or if they do they stick you in one area for weeks at an end. Not a very great place to communicate about what you need they’ll throw it under the carpet & treat you very poorly. if you needed a day off you couldn’t have it because only 2 people are allowed to take off a day."
bad,"New company owners are stingy and removed employ care rallies and fun events.  more work less pay.  love the people i work with is the only reason i haven't left.  Lot of work with little pay, on your feet the whole day."
bad,"The Review was not listed"
bad,I will not tell anyone about this job the pay is to low and it's to much work for that low pay if you want someone to clean up rooms right pay them the right money.
bad,"They were very unorganized, they didn’t have enough equipment. The managers weren’t the nicest. Overall i would never work with them or their company again."
bad,they could not keep employees. way to much drama. people around there like to accuse you of things. the accounting manager accused me of steeling the bank. when he called me he right away said to return it and was going to the police by this time the same day. i worked over nights so i didnt get the call before i woke up half hour to the dead line and i never stole it. it was sitting on the managers desk and never even bothered to ask her for it....
bad,"Stats...stats....stats... always have to make quotas... expectations very high...with little compensation"
bad,"So I was the first person in my position(houseman)to get a couple of great comment card reviews,did my job and others,went above and beyond,etc."
bad,"Very poor management, younger and would sit back in the office and bad mouth their own employees, very much like high school, lazy and only would speak when they has something negative to say, never once gave positive reinforcement advice for job."
bad,"This a franchisee of Marriott they are so over the inept management they are threatening to pull their name off the side of the hotel. Which would be my recommendation. Underfunded benefits.bare bones insurance coverage and no HR person.  😢"
bad,"Honestly I was overworked and underpaid, and considering how often I was told how ""valuable"" I was my work schedule and my pay did not reflect that not even a little bit. They would still have me work for them today and I would never go back"
bad,"Alhough my salary was competitive, with some benefits including hotels discounts, over the years I found myself doing exactly the same work with no possibility of advancement. I also noticed every year the hotel discounts were less available and less affordable for employees."
bad,"I didnt like the way the managers treated us. We all was suppose to be treated as equals of our culture but some of us was treated unfairly. They didnt care about if we were sick, or tired all they care about was their rooms getting done. Spanish women was treated with respect and dignity while the african american woman was treated unfairly. They say it was a diversity business but all they cared about was the spanish women. Managers and supervisors was young and didnt know to run the housekeeping department. The general manager over housekeeping was rude and disrespectful. The higher level bosses had their backs more then ours."
bad,"very good company with good benefits as a Marriott employee, but in the area of ​​work as a domestic employee, has a very bad administration of schedules, a slow response when unexpected happen with some guest, there is favoritism, very bad organization, I would not work again there, in that area of ​​work"
bad,The work place was safe! But everyday it was something new that u wasn't train on so u had to self train yourself and that was hard for th e guess as well.
bad,"They try hard but they aren't fixing the problems there all there doing is covering it up. Its painful to sit in a chair all day and asking for help. Don't bothet all they do is hang up and tell you to figure it out."
bad,"Falsified info at interview then switched it up in the training class, staff and trainers very judgemental, my supervisor not understanding, very insensitive to people under her, rude atmosphere,  people steal from the lockers they have for your things yet supposedly they have a camera in the locker room.  I would not,  have not,  abd will not reccomend this place to anyone."
bad,management was an issue when I worked there and from what Ive heard over the years is that its gotten worse. The pay isn't very good and you work with a lot of lazy people
bad,"Being an intern at the Renaissance Hotel provided little career advancement opportunities. This provided me nothing but experience and after understanding i would have the opportunity to be employees here and did not receive it, now has me looking for a source of income."
bad,They are not a good establishment to work for. They do not look out for their staff and a lot of very shifty things going on. Meeting new people everyday was great but the tourist industry is very different. They put a lot of pressure on you and overwork people.
bad,"This was my first hotel ever, opened this hotel, was never given the opportunity after working for them almost 4 years of moving up the ladder, was kept at front desk at measly pay."
bad,Are you people that cheap and unreasonable that you want one person to do multiple types of jobs for one salary? Really?... esthetician/receptionist/maid/sales associate . My goodness.
bad,"ok"
bad,Aimbridge hospitality who manages the hotel is the worst company to work for.  No holiday pay is offered.  they micromanage and speak to their employees in a disrespectful manor.
bad,The kitchen is very nasty .... Chef is very disrespectful spends more time outside polishing his bike instead of helping his team. Comes in a hour an a half late but writes all the other people up for 15-20 mins late has alot of harrassment complaints and talks to you like a child. I think its a good place to work but they need to get rid of management and start fresh
bad,Terrible management and very unprofessional. Staff is unappreciated and taken advantage of. Management is deceitful and there is no HR department to bring any concerns to. Suspicious activities occur within the property and management partakes in it. The only reason I rated this company with 1 star is because 0 was not an option.
bad,"5 years and it was all terrible. Sales expectations are stressful , Ended up taking a leave of absence. You will be let go if you dont meet their crazy standards"
bad,When you work in housekeeping not all of the staff is very friendly. The hours are not always what is promised and training is short. You kind of get thrown out there even if you have no experience.
bad,"I am working in san francisco airport marriott since 2006 , start as a banquet server , and then transfer as room service server and operator . I am always working hard , working fixable hours , team player . Also i like to learn new things , so i also helping M club and flight 101 . I am always working weekend and holiday as the hotel needed ."
bad,Brand new Director of Golf and Superintendint have changed the place. The moral isnt the same. Went from being a fun place to work to a not so fun place
bad,"Moved all household items from one location to another, packed and loaded clients belongings onto truck, unpack and unpack to clients specification,"
bad,thankfully I had experience because had no training no orention never could keep all your supplies because they were either out someone else took them.
bad,Marriott no longer has dietetics services.  The hours were long and had to work most weekends and holidays.  Most people were unhappy.
bad,"Loved every minute of my work there."
bad,"Very enjoyable,rewarding and exciting."
bad,This company is fun to work for there are lots of incentives from the hotels and the company its self.  People there are fun to work with.
bad,They write you up for everything you do. Then they expect you to do something for them or work over time. When they interview you they lie just so you can take the job i would not suggest someone to work here.
bad,"Springhill Suites was not up to standard with any part of their facility. I was offered very low pay, no benefits and was forced into non-compliance with the law causing my resignation."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at this establishment one bit.  Management was horrible.  I had my hours changed with no warning, and if I couldn't fit the new hours into my personal schedule, I felt as if I was going to be fired on the spot."
bad,"A typical day at the Courtyard by Marriott in Coatesville, PA would consist of cleaning 16 to 25 rooms a day. Management at this location was not up to Marriott standards.  Managment had no regards to their employees.  In the 2 and a half years I worked there,  the hotel had gone through many changes of employment staff. People would either quit because management did not treat them well or they were fired. Some that were fired was because of things they did, such as not changing bed sheets on check outs. Most of my co-workers I got along with. There was no accentives to working there."
bad,"Very exciting work day"
bad,Starwood employment allowed me to reach out to many people so they could fulfill their family vacations and just get away times.
bad,"for me its a good place to learn things I didn't know before that's normal for every new job I learn some thing new may be for this job I became more respectful for the rules I knew new things in carrier of tourism and hospitality language and I had the opportunity to be more friction with other departments like (Food & beverage ,front office, engineering  and the other departments inside the hotel  and how they works with understanding for the relation between them I have a good relation with my co-workers based on respect and cordiality ."
bad,Learned the operations side of the Food and beverage side of the hotel industry
bad,"Ho fatto una stage al quarto anno di superiori."
bad,I was the incharge for italian resturant and american resturant
bad,"Good solid business to work for ."
bad,"The training was a joke, micromanaged with out guidelines. The general manager ended up being fired for stealing company products."
bad,Management show favoritism to their family and friends and some of co-work like to start drama  a lot works leave because of drama
bad,Unique experience of getting to learn everything that went into running a hotel.
bad,"This job is a joke! If you are a server looking for a job, do yourselves a big favor and skip over this add. I always wondered about places that continuously have adds up. Not anymore, now I know it is because they cannot keep there employees! The managers are disrespectful that one is there to make a living, pay there rent or mortgage or whatever. they offer full time and give you 4 hrs per week."
bad,"Typical days consists of checking in and out guests, washing and folding laundry, setting up reservations for future business, and answer the occasional question about the surrounding area. The location manager here was awful. The manager would overbook the hotel on the weekends and ecpect everyone else to take care of the mistake. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the disgruntled guests."
bad,Poor management team not always fair and not very willing to help with problems.
bad,"In most cases my day started around 7am and worked until 4 or 5pm. I was given the opportunity to get educated and learned to be an administrater. I was Chief Clerk in the Orderly Room. Chief of Publications, Executive NCO for the Installation Commander and ended my career in the Air Force as a First Sgt. Hardest Part was keep the morale of the troops up but again at the same time the most enjoyable."
bad,"Working with others, learning new thing ,working as a team,in a safe work place,"
bad,"Ok environment , nice people there and great motivation to grow up , and you get good benefit anfter 3 moth working , if you get in it will good place"
bad,I worked very hard to make my guest happy. My company punished me countless time for being too helpful. I wasn't handing out free money I just wanted to help them in simple ways. The company does not let you treat the customer very well at all.
bad,This was a good opportunity . It was close to my home the hours were perfect since i have kids in school. It was a very comfortable and family oriented hotel
bad,O didn't leave me working there. No career advancement and the training supervisors don't train u well so I can succeed. Very competitive and cut throat staff there for there own advancement not yours
bad,It wasn't a very fulfilling job. I was in the computer all day long.  I had to lie to the customers on line.  I had to say that I was at a certain state when in reality I was in Maryland.  The customers asked me questions about the hotels in that state and I lied and told them where to find certain attractions even though I have never even been in that state.
bad,"After working here for only a year, I'm tired of dealing with a manager that is not only never here, but refuses to acknowledge hard work, or get the schedule out on time. We have lost so many others in my department that the manager can no longer keep up with trying to fill the empty spaces. The only reasons I have stayed this long is because my coworkers are an absolute joy to work with and I have been unable to find other work. I would not recommend this job to anyone as long as the current manger is still in place."
bad,Marriot intrnational poor have a head souschef dim sum is not a gread joob in a tim.  He is not a good person if in resto have a new people. He target if a new  person have quit work in 1 week. He write recipe for new person but he write is wrong.
bad,A typical work day would not be horrible if I had everything that I needed as far as the supplies I used to do my job. Granted our lunch was free I felt that the cooks just through anything together and gave it to us. I can say once we got a new manager he did solve alot of those problems.
bad,"great start each day"
bad,"Assuring each client’s details and needs are taken care of to assure a flawless event."
bad,"prepare coffee for customers, wash  bed linens and towels. help housekeepers, clean lobby, gym and pool area.It was first experience in English. The management was very friendly, always ready to help and answer on the questions. There were good and nice co-workers. I did not have the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable parts of the job were to prepare the meeting room for meetings or party and help customers."
bad,It was a great workplace but i am a person that likes to move around at work. i didnt like sitting at a desk. Before working there i had only worked factory jobs.
bad,Great place to work! always room for advancement co workers where very friendly and caring. Very professional environment.
bad,"many thing learned about customers management ,helpful co workers ,lot of customers pressure was more ,when there was events or parties we use to enjoy. work was never forced on me"
bad,I was a housekeeping running helping to guess with everything they would like and everything they would need an eighth of a thing that I can assist him with
bad,"Work experience was very long. Great co workers who were willing to help. Managers were unreliable, didnt give enough detail. Straight froward. Needed more time preperation. Payment was excelent as a good seasonal pay. Hardly had scedules printed out at the right time."
bad,I love working with customers & Helping Their needs. But it can be a little stressful some if the managers don’t appreciate the hard we put it & the new changes in company is driving me away

bad,"Greeting guest , and finding solution to there problems. Learned to be patient and listen carefully. Management is always willing to jump in when its busy, there easy to get alone with. Most of all they care about the employees. Different culture in my work is great, and rewarding. There really is not a hard part of my job. When a gst check in happy and check out happy still, thats wat makes my job joyable."

bad,"every busy throughout the holidays and events friendly, helpful, hospitality."
bad,"The merger has added even more approval and red tape to all processes.  Decisions take a very long time and technology is outdated.  Rather than spending the money up front to invest, the slap a band-aid approach is used which causes information to be unreliable.  Opportunity is available within; however, you must apply and interview for every position, including a lateral, no matter how hard or how many hours or how many years you've worked.  If your manager does not support you, you are stuck where you are and your only option left is to leave the company, Soon to be ex-employee"
bad,Everyone there is out for their own. Not a team player or work family environment. Management is only good at making trouble among other departments.Embarrassed to work there.
bad,"Worked as Accounts receivable associate and also part of income audit. Poor management, non-supportive managers, hectic worklife balance, long working hours"
bad,"They dont care for their people, its like working with snakes. If the environment was friendlier. This would be a different review... my true feelings"
bad,This was the most hostile and horrible job ive  ever had.  I could not understand any one and had to learn a lot on my own. Even supervisor barely spoke English .and every meeting was in SPANISH?????!!!!!
bad,"Management is terrible, the supervisor is a lying back stabbed, totally two faced. The AGM has her favorites and will not address your issues or concerns."
bad,"Job was fine "
bad,"When I started working for this company from it pre-opening phase, it was a very healthy environment. But, once the HR Director got replaced twice, the management style was extremely chaotic. There were many unethical practices going on in the department such as total disregard for employee career growth."
bad,Food department management is overall POOR! It’s unfair how they schedule you and not at all like described in the interview. Dissatisfied to the fullest
bad,"was answering work orders , and anything gm might need done , or housekeeping . how to repair and keep most repairs in house without calling outside vendor . management was not very good at helping with any problems or answers to problems . Overall moral was high and everyone on team was good and everyone got along. There was also no benefits offered at job . Was sometimes having to repair issue that I didn't find out about until 5:00 pm . having staff cookout parties"
bad,"Very low wage for the fast paced, high volume, extremely hard word they expect. No appreciation or credit for all the incredibly demanding expectations they have. No compassion for employees having a hard time. You could be dying and all they wanted to no is when u will be back and u better have a doctors note. When people call in sick. They question whether they are truely sick and roll there eyes in disgust instead of having some genuine concern if the employee is going to b OK."
bad,"I do more than work than just my department, I do housekeeping, houseman, janitor, grounds keeping, and maintenance. My pay is less than average and I am supposed to be chief engineer. The owner does micro management and doesn't want to keep the amount of staff needed or pay the employees fair pay."
bad,At this property they lack the communication skill between staff and managenemt.. when hired they dont train you for the specific posttion you bascally are self trained theres no resources for guest the lack of hours in restaurants and lack of communication skill
bad,Unfair to hard working associates they do not care about you. The managers have this alliance with each other and do not treat anyone under them fair.
bad,"The pay is low and for the amount of money you make, the benefits are pointless because basically you're taking home nothing. You bid on your shift so you can work from as early as 6am til as late as 6am. Its very inconsistent and the schedule changes every six weeks so be prepared for no life outside of work."
bad,bad boss bad coworkers boss was mena and un willing to work with any one and the co workers were mean and back stabing so its a bad place when i worked there
bad,"I did not enjoy working at this property. The management team lacked of communication. The only people who got promoted were the one who were related. I got no training, I trained myself. I was told I was going to be getting paid a certain amount, I never got paid what I was going to get paid. I had asked about it, all I kept being told was it will be there on my next check."
bad,My nights always start off with smiles to my guest. Making sure if needed a wake up call or anything else before they turn in for the night.
bad,"-unprofessional"
bad,"nothing great about this workplace..just a job. compensation was poor, and 50% of the time I spent correcting management on the amount of hrs I actually worked. I would have to wait another week to get paid for the additional hrs. I left because it was just a job to get me by until something better came along."
bad,"Excellent co workers, okay pay, nice area, excellent guests, okay management. The most enjoyable part is interacting with guests. A typical day at work is okay. Sometimes it can be slow, and other times it can be busy."
bad,Just didn't really care for the work environment. Management did not back you up when you needed them.
bad,Inbound call center hotel reservations great job dealing with hotels and customers. Handle rewards customers and work with travel agents as well as corporate customers as well.
bad,Better compensation for bilingual employees. Benefits are good except compensation.
bad,"When I was first interviewed for this position I was promised so many thing like a raise in 6 months, advancement into a higher position in 6 months, and a full 40 paycheck each week. It all started out fine but as time has gone on this particular property has left a bad taste in my mouth with the Marriott brand as a cook. I am just barely getting 32 hours weekly and I was hired for the full time. The pay that I accepted was not nearly what I wanted but I took in on the faith that I would get a raise in 6months. Well when 6 months had passed had asked when I would be seeing that increase and was then informed that the HR department decided not to follow through on that promise. The quality of the food products have made a slow decline since our initial opening in June 2013. Yet we have raised the menu prices TWICE and  give smaller portion sizes. None of the management seems to know what they are doing this place is going down hill fast and I want out."
bad,"Terrible management, and unfair treatment of employees. Inventory was not well-kept and often not updated with new products."
bad,bit slow and need to focus on thing people want and helpful for staff
bad,A typical day at the Westin was unpredictable. I never knew what department I might have to work in until I was at work. I learned every area that was under the front office management. My co-workers were the best to work with. We were more like a family who took up for eachother. The hardest part of my job was the fact that I never knew what department I would have to work for which caused confusion with my wardrobe and what to wear. The guest and my co-workers made the job a complete joy though.
bad,"upgrade is much needed, proper (customer service-professional) personnel is required. Racism and favoritism should be tracked down and removed, it hinders the hotel image because it affects productivity and customer service."
bad,"Worked here for about 9 months. Mgmt does not care about your personal life. If you live and play a mountain lifestyle dont get hurt or they will fire you. All they want you to do is consistantly work a high pressure sales gig were upper management is kept clueless to lower management poor skill sets. My manager was promoted after 6 months on the job and was a corporate clown and yes man with no real employee/employer skills. They like to promise you big rewards/bonuses and then find any reason to hold it back from you. It was the ultimate in bait and switch jobs, but I sappose it's the sleezy world of time share sales..."
bad,"Not paid a living wage. Terrible managers."
bad,At the Westin I worked at on the river front the manager was rude didn’t know how to speak to her employees and was not really willing to work with me being a single parent and only was nice when she was in a good mood
bad,"I loved Marriott, but it I learned it wasn't allowing me to make enough money after using there discount ... I never had enough money to afford my hotel and room experience and expenses. But they did help me to see a bigger picture in going after a education first will help me to afford a life like the ones they show there customers, but a grateful experience I might add."
bad,Once you do a good job...you are stuck in your position. The promise is to have opportunity to learn and grow and this is the WORST part of working here. Sad to lose such great people because they don't recognize they would be great in another internal position too!
bad,"Let employees live on the site while working there, bring their kids to work putting them in clean rooms, allowing family members to come to clean rooms when we was short handed....... MANAGEMENT WAS TERRIBLE"
bad,"Team members are largely supportive of each other and some of the management are lovely (Jane). Others too quick to point the finger."
bad,"Excellent job to build customer service experience."
bad,"as a supervisor expector working at the marriott i learn that there is no team work , they will set u up dor failure know proper training house keepers can say whatever to there floor supervior in front of our manger with he or she saying anything , very ghetto not professnal at all over all front desk is very in order polite and very welcomomg , house keepers rushes there job on every rooms purpously knowing us supervior have to come behind them to check just very un professnial waist of money to spend for a room"
bad,"Initially applied up for Maintenance, but was shortly assigned to housekeeping and Laundry. Housekeeping Manager was foul mouthed and disrespectful. I would not recommend employment here, unless all other options have been exhausted."
bad,"Lazy coworkers ,inconsistent scheduling,poor communication between staff and management"
bad,"The Sheraton Hotel in Brookfield has been the worse work places I have ever worked. The managers are poor and unprofessional. Micro-managing at its finest. They would offer anything to get you on board or to keep you but do not follow through unless you put up a fight. (Pay, hours). There is no integrity. No communication. Lack of training. Dont even think about calling corporate because that's a waste of time. If you are someone who works hard or even just want to go to work and do your job, this is not the place for you! Everyday there is something. Do yourself a favor and keep looking. Some jobs are not worth it."
bad,The GM for this location creates and enables a toxic environment amungst employees. Exudes lack of brand knowledge and its ethics. The guest are amazing! Any and all problems are more tolerable than the management team.
bad,all employee is ok but supervisor seem to be to mean i ask for supplies i get a mean as attitude back but when i don't ask i get the blame for not asking for supplies not a good place to work at no team work there
bad,"The compensation for varying departments is very unfair. PBX department for example does way more than transfer calls. They do mostly accounting calls, dealing with very upset over charged guests, but they are paid $2-3 less for the same chore that an actual accounting person gets paid. HR will justify this low rate of pay by saying compared to other PBX jobs, the pay is better, it is just a title they compare, not the actual duties. It is a scam."
bad,"I hope it was only this site, but I wasn't hired for overnight and somehow that's the shift i was given."
bad,"Tell you to do one thing one way, but mad later and ask why you did it as instructed.  Manager needs anger management classes"
bad,"Managers are terrible, hours are terrible, benefits are terrible. They expect you to Uber to work if you are dying, and they favor men and treat the women there like garbage."
bad,"This company doesn't care about you, they pay as low as possible,"
bad,"Fuel (specifically) has terrible management. They are extremely un-experienced. The way you move up in that company is purely through favoritism. You get no breaks if they are ""too busy"" or short staffed and management does not care, even forcing you to work 13-14 hour days with no days off a week sometimes or just one day off. sometimes working 13 days straight."
bad,Management did not care about the employees. Management only cared about the sale of rooms because they would bonus after a certain amount was reached.
bad,A bad place to work there is no advancement lots of favoritism when it comes to who gets the best hours and days .people go years without a raise and then it's only 30 cents when they give one out .
bad,"Working at the TownePlace Suites- Owasso would have been outstanding if it weren't for management. A typical day at work was being criticized, talked down to, and overall bullied. The manager was awful. He treated all of his employees with disrespect. My co-workers were awesome. If only it were for different management. The hardest part of the job would be balancing all of the calls at once. You would have guests' call to ask questions, complaints, and to make reservations. All while having customers in front of you. Working the 3-11 shift you were all alone so every task; even not in your job description and not have been trained in. The best part about the job would have been getting to interact with people from all over the world and making new friends and hearing all of their stories."
bad,"Took this job to get to the next promotion. I worked this and two other jobs simultaneously to get promoted, while others were considered ""college recruits"" and skated by. I went to college too..."
bad,"Production environment in large kitchen. Quality equipment and a good place to gain experience however, as is typical for a large banquet kitchen, few days off, will work on weekends and holidays, compensation did not match the work required. Decent benefits, very little opportunity for advancement."
bad,"the management department is poor too much hard work"
bad,"Management doesnt listen, gives requested days off when not even requested off, not allowed to call in have to find someone to cover, no advancement unless you are the favorite, never acknowledges what you do unless its negative. NO COMMUNICATION between management and employees whatsoever. Promises are never kept, everyone gossips, poor hours even when full time, when the budget gets cut only employees lose hours, management hours stay the same. Dont work here, its little pay and you're expected to do everything the managers dont want to do."
bad,When I started everything was fine then I felt as if I was doing ever one else job while they stood around doing nothing. Felt like I was being used!!
bad,"Terrible training, most employees are given a check list of instructions and let to fend for themselves. "
bad,"Both jobs were both very fun and I enjoy working with guests and getting to know them, however management needs to work on enforcing rules and regulations."
bad,Really bad management team. Not organised. Salary was bad. HR Team kept repeating the same mistakes with my payslips. The environment was not professional at all.
bad,i us to work for marriott hotel 6 years ago as a J1 and it was my first experince in United states.i was really happy to work with new people.i improve my knowledge with the new people and i learn to many thnigs to be better.
bad,The most enjoyable part was providing great customer service. And being able to assist other co-workers when I could. I learned how to multitask and to be an effective associate.
bad,they gave me a .10 raise after one year.  not rewarding enough....a lot of work for no compensation.. no room for advancement.
bad,"Mowed lawn for golf courses also maintained weeds to keep off the golf coursers, and we also maintained the bunkers. Pay was very poor"
bad,"No training, too much put one one person, no support very low wages all around not a good company to work for. Worked there for 4 months, was given very little training, and had a terrible supervisor. The pay was terrible, and the job duties were to much for one person to handle. Mistakes were made as a result."
bad,Let me begin with the general manager hates women and you'll know who he is immediately.  He makes comments that are demeaning.  Supposedly it's because he's gay and he hates women.  Who knows though.  Everyone talks behind everyone's back.   I worked there for 2 years and they never called me once to schedule me for my on-call shifts.  Another employee would call me to see if I could work and schedule me.  The management was lacking (except maybe one person there).  Do no trust them for anything.  They don't appreciate their employees or how hard they work unless you are one of their favorites and then you can do no wrong.
bad,ont fais plus des agent d entretien que d agent de sécurité pas a pris grand chose vue que j ai déjà 15 ans d expérience
bad,It depends on if there was anyone in the hotel. How to been that ear and to listen to the customers. Are over the top and very repetitious. There is no teamwork and the hardest part of the job is the amount of things that one person has to do. the different walks of life that visit the states.
bad,"Union contract hasn't been signed in 4 years, so no one has gotten a raise in that long."
bad,"at the time it wasnt a good place to work, i dont really know about now"
bad,"Job in ""Marriott International"" was my 1st.All i learned is PATIENCE with customers."
bad,I enjoyed working at the hotel I did not like the favoritism from the management. Co-workers most of them were ok.
bad,no room for advancemnt and not paid enough for the work that is required
bad,"A typical day at work would be pleasant. Most of the associates have a good rapport. I learned to be very patient when dealing with the guests as they have quite different personalities, but it was very satisfying to resolve issues to the guest's satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was growth, most, not all managers were not well liked and morale was always low. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see a hourly employee enter management and to be accepted by the other managers, regardless of the department(back or front of the house) where they elevated from."
bad,enjoy working as a front desk agent but seems to be no room for advancement. No benefits & pay is not sufficient.
bad,"cleaning rooms, and long hours on my feet. I didn't care too much for this company because they don't appreciate all the hard work that their employees put into their place of employment."
bad,i was able to excel amd master my job duties which were • Developed and implemented strategies for front office supporting achievement of hotel goals
bad,Would not recommend it to anyone who wants to work in an enviroment where you feel appreciated.
bad,Learned fantastic customer service skills and enjoyed many great training sessions and social gatherings. I did not like the atmosphere and sitting in a chair for 8 hours.
bad,"I enjoy working with the Marriott. Management should be carefully analyzed and selected better than what is currently been chosen. These manager tend to have personal issues and poor communication with employees, which causes problems within the workplace!"
bad,"typical day would start off greeting GSA and guests, taking care of any guest issues pending, morning huddles with staff, review all arrivals as well as any groups. work closely wtih housekeeping to ensure rooms are ready. Co workers at this hotel were fun and knowledgeable. The hardest part about this job was there was not a lot of support from our management company. The guest and team members were the best part of my job."
bad,"I don't believe a job like this should change who a person is, it should actually enhance or expand on certain things. But this place does the opposite. Management doesn't encourage feedback, they actually threaten job loss for speaking up."
bad,"You work brutal hours sometimes only getting one day off with minimal pay, no Christmas bonus or advances,  when you get hired they make a lot of false promises about rewards"
bad,Low starting pay would not recommend unless first time job if they don’t like you they will get rid of you good fo first time job or part time work only
bad,"IT Management are utterly incompetent, chasing trends while trying to cut costs, trying to square the circle with outsourcing and offshoring. If you like a frantic and idiotic work environment, this is the place for you."
bad,"With this business yes the customer is always right , but when will you ever be backed up ? If you don’t mind coworkers and guest being able to physically harm you then please sign up . The hours are terrible  and unfair , lots of favoritism , if you want to cover all shifts because people are able to just call out and be late go for it."
bad,"For the amount of expectations the company expects you to abide to, the low pay simply does not match the magnitude of work.  Couple that with the very poor training to no training by the company; then you get the toxic morale that is very clear in the workplace."
bad,I worked as an Chief Engineer for Marriott in Mobile and in Birmingham Alabama. The management was harsh and working conditions were very hard. I never thought I would say that companies like this is why Americans are losing the battle....
bad,"I would not recommend anyone working for this specific hotel.  The hotel manager is a jerk and doesn't appreciate productive employees; no recognition for a job well done; negative criticism of work performed instead of coaching to improve performance; supervisor was very unfair in giving me too much to do in an 8 hour shift.  Eventually, hotel manager/assistant manager hired another Houseman and gave him some of my hours.  This resulted in my resignation after 60 days of employment."
bad,"not a team work environment, sale department are lazy and does a half job, no commutation, management is unprofessional and do not take any resonability"
bad,a company conjoined with another one that is missing the value of its philosophy. To grow with the personnel and accomplish the daily tasks to remain a major figure in todays hospitality industry.
bad,"So I worked at the westin bwi for about 4 years on and off. The 1st 2 years were great we had a good management company great general manager as well as great hotel manager. I am no longer with this  Because management has changed and the building is going downhill. Personally the only person I feel like they do what is supposed to be done is Jose the food and beverage director. The building is always leaky they never have enough help , every time there is a issue at the hotel the staff feels the pressure. They never have the materials they need to do  Do your job proficiently. I would not recommend this company to anyone. Although I'm not there anymore I feel at ease with a piece of mind. This place  Was horrible. No life work balance, always called in for shifts that you don't usually work , staff plays management role without  The correct pay. There are plenty other hotels in this area I would recommend anywhere but here."
bad,"Hiring process was quick. Got trained by other employee. Job overall was easy but once high season began it was also stressful because manager didn’t hire more employees. For the same reason it was impossible to get days off for personal matters. Manager also didn’t make big enough orders so we ran out of food and other items every week. "
bad,"Very little support from management. The hotel has a gossip culture, employees and management are very hostile towards each other."
bad,Not a good place to work management is very rude and treats there employees like they are nothing more then slaves with hardly any pay or hours. They dont train anybody the right way they change things up everyday and then yell at there employees fof not having everything look the same in every room.
bad,Management is horrible in the Pompano beach location there passive aggressive and only think of themselves. Long hours for a few guests to sit in the restaurant. Over priced food so no one would like to eat there but had to cuz there no other locations to go near by. Kitchen staff is not on one page as well.
bad,"only 20% discount for employees room rate& food, when westin gives 50% discount in rooms& food, no more personal classes every class is on line no personal touch, all their managers are under salary that’s why they don’t do anything."
bad,"Extremely poor management. A lot of negativity in the workplace.  You do something wrong, and you'll get chewed out by the guest, the managers, and even by your co-workers."
bad,"Most hotels are owned and operated by hotel management groups. Experiences with these companies can vary widely. I don't feel like the current owner of my hotel places a high value on its employees. From low wages, lack of developmental programs offered to all employees, and slashing benefits, I find the company draining to work for."
bad,"Working for a franchise has its cons. Working for this property I cannot say I have the opportunity to have work life balance. So far I have not had opportunities to get promoted within. The current management likes to hire outside first, however I do agree with everyone having an equal opportunity to come aboard the team."
bad,"Unorganized, Demeaning to employees, un prepared for events, no team work, unprofessional at times around guest and other employees, not genuine when it comes to work ethic and general care for employees"
bad,"I started to work here as a Room attendant. Hard physical work, which I love to do, I was enjoying the job a lot."
bad,"•	Ensure fixtures are properly mounted"
bad,"I don't think this is a reflection of the Marriott company, but the property I work at is owned by an individual who doesn't acknowledge Marriott standards. He also didnt care much about the staff or the property itself."
bad,It was fun and I liked working there. The rooms were very nice I sweat and worked very hard even when I had to do 25 rooms on my own. I owned up to it and I was never late to work and my cleaning skills showed.
bad,Horrible place to work. Incompetent senior management drove good employees to look for jobs elsewhere. I would highly advise looking for other jobs in the area
bad,"Nothing much to it, but lack of management skill at this particular property"
bad,"working for Marriott is stressful, the hours they give you are probably the most inconvenient hours for school. The amount of work managers give you in order for them to not do work is overwhelming. When you have a question about your job the way they go about it is pushing it to another day in hopes that you forget."
bad,"I have worked with this company for two years, and I have learned that management needs improvement and causes negative environment for the workplace."
bad,a lot of improvements need to be improved but it was a fun job easy and a lot of free food so that was cool however the management staff sucked ;;;;;;;;;
bad,"Company is undergoing a merger with another large Hotel chain and significant restructure, causing extreme stress to their current employees in the process.  It doesn't seem to matter much about experience or skill rather than who you are friends with or who you know in order to ensure you have a stable position.  Lack of communication between departments is the norm and causes major issues as a result."
bad,Working a 8- 10hour overnight shift just to see a check that didn't reach $350 due to taxes and unnecessary expenses ie: uniforms. No one can survive.
bad,"..............................................................................................................not the ideal job for single parents. The schedules are not consistent."
bad,"for my first time working it was a learning everyday"
bad,"Very poor management. No communication between supervisors, one will tell you one thing then another will tell you something different; meanwhile none of them followed their own rules. They (the management) favoritism and cannot keep track of hours and cut breaks short. Coworkers brag about doing cocaine."
bad,The management here was horrible. Unorganized and under prepared to run a business. The employees are treated poorly. But they work u to death with no regards to even say thank.you for your hard work. They can't keep help because the way they treat u. I loved being an inspector but bad management will cause you to hate your job!
bad,"Works well with any schedule and especially ideal if you're retired and just want extra income."
bad,"this job has poor management, the workers are stressed out because either we were over worked or always left to deal with every situation. We weren't paid enough to be yelled at like we were the management, I just think that when a guest ask to speak with a manager...a manager should actually come out to speak with the guest. At this job your left alone a lot so your pretty much on your own."
bad,"If we were busy with events you would work all day, if there were no events that week, you would be off a whole week. It was hard to have a work life balance in the position i was in."
bad,"a typical day at work is ok because i have a job. what i have learned is nothing i aready had knowledge of the job. management sucks,  the hardest part about the job is nothing, its a pretty easy job. the most enjoyable part of the job is being around a great group of people that does what it take to get the job done"
bad,"As a full time manager, the benefits are great. The company pays your health care premium and gives you a cell phone allowance. However, the bad out weighs the good. The communication all around is horrible. The department heads don't communicate with their associates. You would think, because the managing company's corporate office is located in the hotel, that everything would perfect and the hotel would run like a smooth machine. If you think that, you would be wrong! The managing company has only a handful of properties of which one (this property) is a full service hotel. They do not have an HR Dept on-site, nor do they have a Front Office Manager. They try and run this property like a select service hotel and they don't completely fix things that need to be fixed. They pretty much place band-aids over things and hope they don't get worse. I have worked for many other Starwood properties and this one is by far the worse hotel I have ever worked for. They have SOME great people who work for the hotel. But, upper management is lacking all around. If you are looking to make a career in hospitality and come across this hotel, make this a stepping stone to where you want to go. This is NOT where you want to stay."
bad,"Personnels mal conpris et mal payés, management abusif et stupid, pas de sécurité de travail ! Possibilité de se faire viré pour motif personnel sans explication. "
bad,no chance of advancement . lots of work not enough pay. work really long hours no recognition and no chance in advancement . the hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the work.
bad,The hotel really needs new owners and new direction. The way it is going it will not be too long before it isn't a Westin anymore.
bad,Not a great company to work for. Being human is most unacceptable and they'll tell you about undocumented policies that cost you your job.
bad,The management were not good! The work force communications are very poor and the majority of the floor work force are employing street languages to communicate among each other and i couldn't take that so i resigned.
bad,"this place is a franchise. the company who owns this place doesn't want to  pay workers what they deserve. The girls work super hard and during summer it's aweful, long hours, no family time, you have no life and paychecks are weak. I stayed because I had an awesome team and we made it through."
bad,It would be very good for you to know spanish if you want to work in housekeeping here-even though the executive housekeeper doesnt know it. plus she never had experience in housekeeping (used to work front desk)
bad,"Unfortunately being employed by Marriott has not been one of the best experiences I have had with a company, but it definitely taught me a great deal.  It taught me how to be balanced, multitask at a fast pace, work with all types of people from all different places of the world and so many other things.  "
bad,Management is OK there but main management is very bad they treat you like you are no value to them what so ever. I had a crisis in my household and i asked to be off and they complain that i had to be at  work. But in the time i was there i was called in a couple of times and i did go in on my day off so i expected for them to understand me if ever so i needed some time off in an emergency like the one i had. I enjoyed my job while i was there. But looking away on things wont help solve a problem.
bad,Management changed three times in the short period I was employed.  The company was more interested in the bottom line that ensuring that customers had a good experience.
bad,"I cannot explain it because i worked there for a couple of months, but personally i did not enjoy the time there."
bad,I feel that housekeepers physically have the hardest job in a hotel and and guest satisfaction mainly depends on housekeepers. I feel the pay is definitely NOT worth the work.
bad,"I liked my job and what I did there but the management team was very appalling, they had they own personal problems and didn't know how to separate business life and personal life. They were not equal."
bad,"What a ride....."
bad,You have no life working for this company. The management is horrible and no room organization anywhere. You are worked like a dog and only paid $12/hour. Your schedule is posting every Wednesday/Thursday night and your week starts on Sunday so you have no time to plan anything outside of work.
bad,"I worked at the Westin for a year and noticed every month 3-5 people quit every. Yes i worked alot of overtime but did not enjoy life! Managers dont know how to do the schedule, one day i would work until 11pm and scheduled to come in the next day at 6am! Putting up with rude clasless ""owners"" that will talk down to you and belittle you in front of other guests and coworkers just to get comped a free night or dinner! Management only seemed to care about our monthly g.e.i. score and would usually take care of the guest even if they were in the wrong do they would not leave a negative comment!  This is just a scratch on the surface with how bad it was to work here!"
bad,"Expectations from management are unfair, progression is non-existent to hard workers the only way to progress with the company is through making friends in the right places. I have been moved around departments whenever they want because of the lack of hours. Support from management for progression again is completely non-existent. You work crazy hours, in my case some days 13+ hours with as little as 8/9 hours in between shifts. Co-workers at the base level are nice enough some friendly faces. The most enjoyable part of working for the Marriott is clocking out at the end of the day."
bad,"No matter how much experience you have across the board, there is no chance for advancement and, if you do try to advance, they'll find any reason to fire you for the smallest thing."
bad,"productive and a wonderful place to work;"
bad,The hardest part of this position was that I was never traine.
bad,they payment is really low for all job you have to do. All the job is standing up
bad,"Learned too much, Gave too much, No Career Development at all."
bad,Never work of any SRG restaurant. Its a life sucking company that cares nothing for its employees. you are viewed as expendable and they treat you like sh**. Nothing good about it!!!
bad,Great experience I had in this property....Very busy and profit driven. Great advancement opportunities
bad,"Responsibilities include: make the bed, clean the bathroom and replace linens and toiletries, vacuum, clean and replenish toiletries in kitchenette, dust, take out trash, etc"
bad,"Great field training if you have the  right boss. People for the most part were great, but deep down they don't really care about the whole work life balance thing...kinda a joke at the end of the day. Guests were great, (the best part) Management very disconnected from what  was really going on."
bad,The job is okay. I'm just not happy about the job itself and the management isn't doing what they're supposed to in order to have things running the way they should.
bad,"The job overall is challenging, mainly due to the disorganization of the management. I have, however learned a few new cooking techniques that will undoubtedly assist me in future opportunities"
bad,"I thought everything was great with my work performance. I paid attention to detail, followed directions for the menus and I also did a daily walk through during my turn over shifts. My check was not enclosed and a young lady found out she was getting paid less than for all the work she did and we had the same title. I never discussed this with her she looked at my check. One manager was fairly new and hadn't been there long enough to even give me a full evaluation they had me work up until the end of my shift and terminated me but the HR directors tried to work with me and transfer me downtown which would have been an inconvenience due to gas and finances for parking."
bad,I certainly enjoyed assisting guests in having a memorable stay at the hotel.  Each day I was assigned rooms to clean after check out and then restock and clean for current guests.  The most difficult part of the job is how it is the same thing day in and day out.  During the transition the communication broke down drastically which made it difficult to complete tasks or even to know what the daily tasks needed to be.
bad,day to day operation
bad,It was a fast paced environment at times. It was also a fairly unorganized work situation. Management made several promises of future advancement but the opportunities never came to fruition.
bad,ive never worked for management more unorganized and very rude to its employees. decent job with the wrong people running it.
bad,"My job was mostly room service , which was customer service, I loved that part. I learned more about people in general"
bad,"aprendi a dar rotacion al producto con vijencia de caducacion ,estar con gente no capacitada y racibir ordenes de la misma, siempre se aprende algo nuevo-"
bad,I enjoyed the job itself and some of my co-workers. But the main problem I came across was in the amount of time I was there I was constantly trying to move up and better my professional self and was never given the opportunity or even helped to try.
bad,"It's a job. Owned by a franchise, they don't care much about their employees as it's a revolving door of new faces."
bad,The Managment was ok but there was noticeable favouritism especially in the department that I worked in. I will say there was a few good employees that I enjoyed working with.
bad,Beautiful hotel to work at. When it was a Marriott they took real good care of their people and longevity. Good benefits such as medical and 401k if your looking to move up
bad,I was a head housekeeper for a year after being rehired for the job and after being there for a few weeks I wanted to hire some more stuff as we were short management refuse to hire more staff that quit after a year and after I quit found out they hired a new head housekeeper and has hired a whole pile new staff make sure really wonder if they really know what they're doing at this hotel
bad,Management cares nothing for employees and point scale pushes you right out the door. Favoritism is prevalent if you have kids or family think again about working for Marriott Syracuse downtown have seen good employees push out the door by management basically which is the reason for such a high turnover rate
bad,"This hotel was not run by Marriott International, it was run by a management company under the name Champion. The management company did not care about its employees, offering terrible working rates and no benefits for full timers. While the local manager was terrific to work with, the management company would sometimes take weeks just to respond about a simple issue."
bad,Not so good supervisors. Let go for no reason but standing up for myself. I gave a lot to that Company during my short tenure. I liked my job. Never had any problems until they lied to me.
bad,Marriott used to be a family oriented company. They got away from that and now they are very focused on bottom line. They don’t seem to really care about individuals in the company. They don’t always take advice from those two best know it.
bad,Once a great place to work has now become infiltrated by shark like management who will happily destroy the career of anyone else not willing to play the game.
bad,"I spent nearly two years there, and would not recommend anyone I know work there."
bad,"Management truly sucks. From the General manager to the managers to the supervisors. They all party together, gossip together and steal whatever tip the guest may leave at the front desk or in the room. They are not very professional and very messy. Don't tell them your business unless you want it to be all over the hotel. Sad to say, but it's TRUE."
bad,i had no social life when i was working at the Marriott hotel . poor management for front desk. over worked. high responsibility. high pressure. i worked there because i was a student at the time
bad,N.a I am not writting a review per say. . my overall experience started off fantastic until I discovered a sexist environment. Favoritism . lack of qualified managment and staff. Really destroyed this opportunity for me.
bad,"No tienen una bendita idea de lo que es COSTO solo quieren ganar en su departamento hasta por el mas estupido error regalan cosas con cargo a tu departamento, no dan vales de despensa , se roban las propinas de los empleados ...un fiasco"
bad,"Decent place to work at! Manager was not the best due to not being available at times, was often rude to other employees/co-workers, never sent request for new uniform when other one was damaged. Co-workers where friendly but when I first started they told me what to say and what not to say towards the manager which I thought was odd."
bad,Always work with the time . Had a good relationship with the service and improving on our food always . I enjoy the most when the guest enjoy the food you make greatly.
bad,Worst management a company could ever have. No communication at all. Turnover was incredibly high to the point managers had to bribe employees with minimal pay increase to stay. Didn't work.
bad,"Working at this specific location wears a person down. There is no predictable work schedule due to high staff turn over. It is not uncommon to not know when your next day off will be once you begin your work week. The particular location I'm referencing is a franchised facility, meaning that it's owned by a local family and operated under the Marriott License. The owners refuse to invest the needed resources in order to keep the building up to Marriott standards (i.e. replacing faulty equipment, hiring skilled contractors to perform structural repairs) and it is reflected in the guests' reviews and complaints. It places unfair pressure on the hotel staff who are often subject to the guests' anger and disappointment. While the General Manager makes the most of what slim resources are available, it is blatantly clear that this workplace leaves a lot to be desired."
bad,"I loved working at the hotel, I have always loved being a hotel employee. But unfortunately the Fairfield that I worked at was poorly managed which mad things very difficult. Managers literally sitting on the floor in their office planning games and listening to loud offensive music while guests would be checking in right in viewing distance of them. Managers walking around barefoot in the hotel, singing and laughing. Very unprofessional. They were nice but unqualified for the job which made us all look unprofessional."
bad,"Basic customer service job, clientele very verbally  abusive and environment does not allow option for breathers without risking stats for future schedule bids."
bad,"At first they seem like a good group but then they suck the life out of you. While you  come to work everyday the ceo and lower management won't even recognize or say anything. The crazy part is they have a circle of people who don't do anything. However, the young kids coming out of college are being used to pick up the slack of the circle that doesn't do anything. It's a waste of time to work here. You're better off going to any other hotel. Lastly, they don't appreciate you're hard work at all when its time to move on."
bad,Marriott is a wonderful company to work for as long as the management team works with everyone the correct way. I love the benefits of discounts on hotels.
bad,Management is regularly discriminating against those over 50. Their culture is cut throat between departments. Marriott is definitely against organized labor.
bad,"Texas Western has a poor management system. Little to no incentives for working holidays, overtime. No holiday pay. High-stress level job and little pay. Job duties do not match pay. Job tasks that management are responsible for can get passed to subordinates."
bad,I enjoyed working for the Marriott but they laid me off because of the hours were being cut. I enjoyed working with the woman that hired me at the first.
bad,"The job seemed like it would be great but they did not stand by Marriott's expectations. Employees aren't happy neither are the guest. Mr. Marriott built a great brand, but the hotel does not stand by it."
bad,Not happy here. Hours get cut if the hotel doesn't have enough business. You are open holidays and if a natural disaster occurs and your hotel isn't in a evacuation zone you have to stay open and work. I feel we are not paid enough to put up with the complaints and the yelling from guests. If you are front desk you are the buffer between the unhappy guest and management.
bad,"There was no advancement. Management doesn't care about giving you what you need to get the job done. There isn't a good life balance. You work all the time and do an absolutely Great job, but they will never move you up!"
bad,Most of the managers are not accommodating or competent. No budget for supplies. Very high corporate expectations but no rewards. The employee treatment is not equal.
bad,Management Sucks! They lie to you just to get you in the door. Payrate is more less then a teenager gets for their first job. Everyone leaves bc they can't keep workers and it's 4 girls there doing 17 checkouts. Ridiculous..
bad,"Too many supervisors not enough staff.  Management's concern is occupancy with no regards to revenue.  Always on a witch hunt among employees.  Too many rules and regulations with not ample time to focus on the job at hand.  Not enough hours per shift to accomplish your job plus not enough staffing.  The learning curve to fulfill the job is steep thus cause for margin of error to escalate.  Too much pointing the finger for tasks not done."
bad,"Marriott overall is a great chain to work for, however for franchised properties it's the management companies that make or break the experience. As for Atlanta Marriott, there is no support from upper management, hours are all over the place with very little concern for health/well-being and doesn't seem to care about any portion of a proper work-life balance. Pay is subpar to say the least and raises don't happen or when they do they find a reason to not pay you what was promised."
bad,Very outdated equipment with brand new rooms is not a good mix.  The training is self-taught and trial and error.  The most enjoyable part of this job was my break.
bad,"I have worked in this role for over 4 years and although I am a TOP performer I notice that career development is slow and not happening at all; managers here PRETEND to CARE about employee’s development  sucking up to Senior Leaders; making sure that ONLY business goals are met. (Not personal)."
bad,"Poorly staffed throughout but I hear that has changed now.  Things were being stolen from employee lockers, desks, offices.  Nothing done about it.  NO security cameras."
bad,The one in central islip no one speaks english the managers dont help if you are running behind. No proper training.you have to learn on your own. And for all the work the pay is awful.
bad,"Amazing, amazing hotel."
bad,"Overall, a place I would not recommend. Solid mainland mentality with a group of managers and directors from the mainland not willing to know or understand Hawaii. Being part of the biggest hotel chain is a benefit but the have a long way to go,"
bad,"Management can be unsympathetic even to disabled veterans. They only care about the job, you are replaceable even if you go above and beyond for them on a daily basis. The co-workers are the best part of the job because they understand the frustrations of the work environment. They often don't hire enough people for the job or they just don't schedule enough on the busy day's, and you often have to do the job of multiple people because of it. The worse part is after all that you don't even get the respect you deserve."
bad,"I worked at Marriot hotel, work tends to be repetitive and hectic, you have to be on your best all the time, like a machine 100% always!!!  I didn't enjoyed work atmosphere at all. Also really slow paced when you want to jump to Managerial jobs (if you don't have your sponsor)."
bad,"Marriott is a great company, they have a lot of good benefits and discounts. They are individually owned and have different owners so each hotels is ran differently."
bad,"I've worked for quite a few hotels and have never come across management like the starwood in Galveston, Texas. The General Manager is horrible. He dismisses guests, telling them they are lying. Told me as a front desk agent to have them go sit down and basically not listen to anything they have to say. I have years of experience and work for two 4-Diamond properties and was absolutely appalled by what I saw. This was supposed to be a nice part time job but I couldn't handle working there for more than a day. I'm sure other Starwood Properties aren't bad but I will say the one in Galveston is not up to par. My co-workers are great, work hard but not given the respect they deserve. I like the OPS system, very easy to use. The location is nice but when management is horrible it dwindles down. Maybe that's why it is ranked so low on Trip Advisor."
bad,big turn over overtime not worth it they are starting incentives the management team could be better  overall its a nice place to stay but to work there can be messy
bad,"A typical day at work is very slow"
bad,"multi cultural working place leading to favourism but quite understandable."
bad,"Management is a joke. Not worth the headaches working here. "
bad,"Good group of team members in the Sales and Marketing department. When I joined, I was actually new the SB County; learned so much about the culture of the area.  "
bad,"Made it out to be this amazing place to work with an awesome bonus plan and perks, after a couple weeks in training and management tip toeing around how to bonus, it finally became clear that it's almost impossible to bonus at the rate they talked it up to be. You also never sit in the same seat each day and take back to back calls tethered to the phones never getting to know anyone around you, and no time after a call to collect your head. you also get in trouble if you aren't on the phones showing an average of 98%  each month, and also if you talk too long on each call, you will not bonus. One of the most restrictive, lonely positions I've ever had and was so disappointed it wasn't everything they said it would be."
bad,Pay is great. Extremely corporate work environment. Promotes happy working lifestyle but really a cut throat environment. Extremely weak leadership. Run if you are ever offered a job here.
bad,"The work days of my hotel was not soo good.but i was in room service i was able to learn how to do service,setting up trays,way of talking to guest.The management was not so good,my co-workers treated me very badly they didnt even helped me to learning.the hardest part of the job was over time and was not allowing to have food.The enjoyable part of job is doing service to the guest which make me feel happy."
bad,"I love most of the workers that I work with their awesome."
bad,"The Charleston Town Center Marriott was a good place to work except for Management. The Managers at this place didn't care about their employees and guests but cared more about making money and working their employee's to death. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the guests and most of them was very nice. If you work here be ready to not have a social life, or a life in general because they do not work with your schedule if you want to go back to school or family issues."
bad,"Not know if your relief would come in. If not it was expected that you work 2 shifts. Management was afraid to do anything,fear of the CEO"
bad,"The benefits were honestly very good, but that's about as far as it goes. They recruit management from trade schools, which basically means hourly workers end up ""training"" recent grads (with usually zero actual experience) on how to be their managers. "
bad,"only unionized staff or boss flickers can survive here. old ideas of management. no encouragement for new ideas, no cell phones. no social networks."
bad,"Majority of managers abused their position and it became acceptable for several of them to openly belittle, humiliate, embarrass, shame and degrade the employees that they supervised. Very hostile work environment, constant theft of hotel property by employees and the work load that was expected to be completed by housekeeping and maintenance staff was nearly impossible to achieve. If you enjoy poor treatment in an abusive environment, then, yes! a job at this Marriot is for you!"
bad,Fast pace environment with great staff and reasonable flexible hours however the work itself was pretty boring and the hourly wage was low.
bad,"Hard labor, no raises, no benefits, bonuses, or incentives at all.  Very small hourly wage.  You are disposable here.  They do not value employees."
bad,you work like a dog for a terrible pay and you definitely get no respect from onsite management...
bad,I worked at marriott downtown and a typical day at work includes having a morning meeting with management.what I learned  at this job in the housekeeping department is that the managers doesn't care about their employees. If you talk to them especially the director of service manager about a job related issue he will not be willing to help you and he will gossip about your issues to other employees where as though everyone throughout the whole department and other departments will know your business.the coworkers are ok and the most enjoyable part of the job was only the benefits. But if your applying for housekeeping I wouldn't recommend nobody to work here.
bad,Overall the staff is lazy. It's a union hotel. Upper Management is useless. There is a lot of turn over.
bad,Management says that both managers and hourly employees are a team. It is the complete opposite.
bad,"This was a job basically to help me get through college. I worked off and on for 8 years in the hotel business. The management staff was not willing to help out at all, which made it very difficult to deal with. They also made promises they never kept. There was alot of turn around in management, which made if very difficult for the staff at times."
bad,"My typical day was the same at the beginning of the day and changed as the day went on,I would get different work order request from one hour to the next.I have learned preventive maintenance skills, trouble shooting, and problem solving. I worked well with my coworkers and management, my job wasn't hard at all.The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers knowing that they had a satisfactory stay."
bad,A typical day was dealing with coworkers and drama from within.
bad,"The job itself was decent, just a few factors which ruined it for me. I always started before buses and would have to get a lift in and would have to wait in durham from 5am to start at 7am. Some of the supervisors were a complete right off! Unhelpful, spiteful, sarcastic and generally just rude and nasty towards staff, although there was a few were decent ones there. I was made very unwelcome by a bunch of the staff already there and felt rather lonely on some shifts, although the main group of people I worked with I miss as they were great. You get a free uniform and free lunches on a 4 hour plus shift, long hours some days, pay was good a little more than other places for this type of work. On late finishes there was a staff minibus to take people home, although I was told due to being on a zero hour contract I didn't benefit from it! Causing me having to walk 4.5 miles home an hours sleep and then back in again! Good for some and bad for some guess I was just unlucky."
bad,"Did not like their management structure. Job got me through college, only good thing. With Marriott I learned its not what you know its who you know."
bad,"Busy hotel with no management oversight."
bad,"Let me start out that the first day of work, you won't be prepared. It takes forever to receive all of the tools you need for being a front desk agent such as a proper uniform, bank, and software accounts you need to actually check people in. Also, the training system there is poor and they hardly teach you anything at the beginning because they only pay attention to those that have been there for years. "
bad,"Morale at the Westlake Ohio location is extremely low.  Management provides the same raise (.25) to each and every employee without regard to the extra responsibilities and projects they may take on.  It is disheartening to know that although you take on many extra projects, you will receive the same raise as the employee who takes nothing extra on.  There is zero incentive to excel at this company.  They do not do reviews at all.  Some people have been there two years without a review."
bad,"The experience of interacting with interacting with individuals from across the country and the world was exhilarating. The position permitted me to enhance my people skills along with perfecting professionalism. The position was tough with long hours and different types of people as coworkers. Unfortunately, management was not up to par. While they were very pleasant individuals, they did not understand what it meant to be a supervisor or manager. One of the female servers enjoyed bullying the other girls while at work and almost all the male staff sexually harassed the staff at ever chance they received. Incidents were reported, however, no investigations nor follow ups were preformed. HR was notified, but once again, the sexual harassment and bullying continued. Eventually, it became a toxic work environment. Certainly, there are some people that would flourish in this hotel, I, certainly, was not one of them."
bad,"job was okay paid every week , cool till people start asking for me to cook their breakfast, then the first cook start giving me hell, but i hung in there till they went out of buisness, as second cook. I learned to work well under pressure, and it was great, now i can take orders three at a time , get done and work the line down, by my self."
bad,"maintaining facility,keeping it well kept. helping others, being that support as a team player.making my rounds throughout the building seeing all guest is satisfied."
bad,"I was hired to open a restaurant. I did. somewhat successfully. However, the management company was like working for children who changed their minds on a daily basis. They ar not very good at what they aree supposed to do but will tell you everyday how good they are, it's kinda weird. Typical day as executive chef of a 13 million dollar operation; I was told not to get ""involved"" in the banquet dept"" to focus on the restaurant only. the restaurant made about 4 or 5 thousand a day banquets about 40????good business?"
bad,"The best part of the job is the benefits. Aside from benefits, that job had no other redeeming qualities. Do NOT work at the call center. The job is not hard, but it is taxing, and working with the people that work there is quite an unsavory experience."
bad,The Marriott could be a great company if they were more selective when it comes to management. The Marriott is not good with flexible schedules or job safety. You should never go into work feeling like you may never leave.
bad,franchise not corporate owned.....Too many different supervisors/managers who are not qualified in there positions. Always telling you what you are doing wrong and never what you are doing right. Rules dont apply to all employees. Poor compensation!
bad,"I worked at the W for three years and it was a mess. Mgmt and hr are terrible. No method to the madness. No promoting from within. Poor pay and do not expect more than a .23/hr raise per YEAR ... If you get an excellent review. Main perk is hotel discounts BUT be careful, they will cxl your res in a heartbeat and without notice if they feel they can sell your room for more than your rate. Health care is scary expensive and has a min 3500.00 deductible. Starwood is where educated college grads go to committ career suicide. Don't waste your time. Also, working all holidays a must."
bad,"With the exceptions of a few employees that I became friends with the the company sucks to work for. Your raises come every year and are based off of ""how the market is doing"". Even though in this state it is the largest hotel so they only give you up to a 3% raise IF your lucking to get all 3%. They also force you to use your PTO for the "" SLOW weeks"" even though this company makes money like the OIL industry. Overpriced rooms with HD TV but NO HD Reception in the rooms c'mon man! I would never work for this company again. Seriously the only good thing about the job was most of the people I worked around. Oh and good luck if you have to miss work for illness on the overnight shifts they don't like when you have to call in for being sick or taking care of your sick kid. All they care about is making money and keeping for upper mangement. I do not recommend working for this company unless you have to for a means to another job comes along."
bad,As the valet supervisor i was responsible for
bad,Being rushed to the hospital by ambulance... then having surgery counts as a write-up for being absent.
bad,"There is a lot of gossip and trustfulness relationship with the staff."
bad,Never again will i work for a franchised hotel chain. All of the standards expected but with none of the perks. 75 hour weeks were regular to make sure tight budget targets were met and ecceeded  ( no bonus scheme also so not encouraging) when other HOD were lucky to touch 40 if that.
bad,"I've worked in 2 Marriott properties at the front desk, but in different capacities, for 7 years. I had to leave my first property because I couldn't afford rent in my city anymore. That was after moving, twice, to get further from downtown in search of cheaper rent. I ended up with an hour commute from my last apartment. Now I live with my parents because I still do not make enough money to afford rent and to pay off my student loans."
bad,Hr policies very bad. Too much discrimination among old and new staff.very less staff support.no proper leave policy.long duty hours.no staff welfare program.
bad,Terrible and under managed with lack of communication and respect for your time and work. Work place culture was terrible where it was preferred to compete opposed to working together.  Employees pushed out of having benefits. HR not helpful when you discuss what is needed to run a better working environment.
bad,supervisors know very little and are unable to assist in serious or everyday situations. very incompetent and unprofessional place to work. You also rarely receive your bonus for completing or exceeded service expectations.
bad,Management didn’t want to take care of any problems they took vantage there employees.recommend people with a  truck so they can use that person‘s truck not pay for their gas take a vantage of them nobody in that building as a team player they like to use people but housekeepers are good from the front desk people are good kitchen staff are great B where they like do you people especially w
bad,"Management really needs to believe in their employees rather than just going with whatever the supervisors tell them. Also they should know that employees talk to each other and i know my manager was talking behind my back but because they don't have any housekeepers she never said it to my face. Goodluck with your drug addict, stealing, and lying supervisor. She's gonna drive everyone away and ill make sure people know not to work there if she's still there."
bad,"Management and go workers are not on the same page. Cleaning 15 to 16,rooms a day, and have to be done at a certain time everyday. Management says one thing to a coworker, then nothing to the others when u make a rule, it applies to everyone. And believe me the rules change everyday..this place has a big turn over in employment. No insurance, no benefits,raise in 90 days, really, be 9.50,really...."
bad,"being there for six years things have changed, work is alot slower we are losing alot of groups coming in. human resource and the union are working together to  minimize the amount of employment because its slow."
bad,The managers were afraid of confrontation with guests. They couldn't handle when things needed to get done or knew how to multitask. Not enough employees to get the job done. Rooms always being left dirty and would have to change room types and then get yelled at by the guests. Rooms/lobby were always hot
bad,"I gotta say the money is good, but what is the point of paying bills on a house you rarely see. If you have family/friends, you won't see them often. We went through 7 managers in the year I worked there. It was chaotic, with no collaboration or instruction."
bad,First the pay is terrible to me. I just needed a job to pay the bills and get by. Second the job the job is unorganized and people do not communicate anything. I have been training and everyone tells me something different. You stand around all day and have some guest that are rude to you just because of the reward status. I have been here for two months and I do not have everything that I need for my job title. Then everyone has attitudes and yells at the trainees for not wanting to do their job. Then we have people that cry about their job and want to do something else. I have heard employees talk to the guest in a nasty way and get away with it.
bad,very big eagle. need to humble themselves. Not what they know it is who they know. I have work there for a long time for  this company at this location is not diverse at all when it comes to advancement for minorities. I don't want to bash everyone because there is some really nice people there. But they really need to look into diversity.
bad,Management never communicated with the workers unless it was for reprimand of being absent.  Due to old management starting 3 weeks after I started it took me 2 months to get them to acknowledge that I was hired FT.  Management never had time to tell you of changes that were occurring as we were moving towards a Starwood system.  Due to this change I only received 1 week of training as they focused on getting Starwood approval versus good up front customer service.  If reservation line called to complain on behalf of a member they always let it go to voicemail and I have no idea if they ever responded to customer needs.
bad,"Worked in a call center that was so unorganized with such poor management it wasn't funny. Long hours, computer systems that never work correctly and performance goals that are unrealistic to achieve. They randomly change benefits and goals so you can't make bonuses and now they don't allow you to earn points on your hotel stays even if it's for incidental charges. Management is barely trained and not required to take calls on the new system so they have no clue as to what you go through on a daily basis and can not help. Customer service has it's hands tied by certain properties and brands to help correct issues."
bad,"I worked for Starwood years ago and found it enjoyable and an amazing environment to be in. Now the call centres for reservations are a joke, you take constant call after call and you don't get a break to catch your breath in between, you are told if you do not meet your conversion you will be ""coached"" until you do so, you are told by the front admins that you will be ""fired"" if you make mistakes, the work life balance is non existent as you only get one weekend day off and one day in the middle of the week, working weekends is fine but lets face it in a high stress environment you need 2 days to distress yourself before going back into the trenches. Minimum wage for this job is completely ridiculous for all the information you are expected to know and all the programs you have to navigate. Don't be fooled when you go into your interview and are told a bunch of empty promises such as you will get to put a bid in for a shift or get every other weekend off. HR is not honest about the stress of this position and the training although 4 weeks long does not prepare you for what is coming on the floor. I'm not saying don't apply to this company. I'm just saying be prepared for all the things that come along with the job."
bad,"Choosing the right property when working for Marriott is paramount. Career opportunities are available but at the right property. During my time at my current  property of 5 years I felt that there was alot of favouritism linked with job promotions, carer opportunities and training which left associates frustrated and demotivated."
bad,"all a lot of work and low on staff, always under a lot of stress because poor management on the department. Managers give more work on top of what you have already. always doing jobs that were not part of my duties."
bad,"When I first started with this company about 7yrs ago I was excited and pleased for what Marriott stood for with it's family based values. Once they acquired the title of being the worlds largest hotel brand all that went out the window. They expected one person to take on the job of others to create a universal agent with minimal pay raise. Protest began throughout the country and still no change. To top it off they expect you to use new systems that aren't fully working. Call quality is horrible having to repeat yourself. And training has changed as well. Instead of getting a week or 2 of training you get trained by someone who has never worked with that particular system remotely in a different state. And you get trained for 2 days, and you're expected to use your online resources and figure it out on your own or reach out to your assist desk that has no access to the systems you're using. All while you're expected to keep your call handling down. They reached out to a temp agency to fill in for all the employees who have left due to the changes, temps get a better schedule over someone who was hired by Marriott directly."
bad,I was a maintenance technician mangers there are untrained in there jobs been through 9 maintenance techs in 6 months changed GM's no better worse actually had the department working well what do they do throw a monkey wrench in the middle stop paying overtime for on call and changing sed.everyday telling you to leave at different times to allow for on call on call don't happen that offten working maintenance down to 33 hours a week per person and over working you while your there total joke
bad,I liked working there. The hardest part was waking up at 4 in the morning and trying to be at work at 5:30 AM. Other than that it was a good experience for me.
bad,Management often talked down to you and treated you very disrespectfully. They make you constantly doubt yourself and makes you feel less then. Wish they hired upper culinary management better because the company is great in other areas
bad,The managers could not determine the actual dress code so it was terrible for me. And there was no dyed hair and there was a specific manager who always was complaining about me
bad,"Even though the hotel is a Marriott hotel, the particular hotel I worked at was managed by Kriya Hotels.  They are a horrible management company.  Will not spend any money on the basic needs of the hotel and you get yelled at when you spend a few dollars to order parts for repairs.  Their benefits are horrible.  They do not offer any pay raises.  Don't even think about working any overtime because they will go in and manually adjust your timecard to be 40 hours and not a minute more.  However, they want you on call 24x7 and expect you to drop what you are doing and drive to the hotel and work however long it takes to fix the problem."
bad,The job was fun and I learn a lot about myself. Working for a fast-paced environment gave me edge in my current job. I learned to speak up and never take things for granted.
bad,"Been employed with Marriott for almost two years, terrible work environment. It has the potential for greatness, but the basically non-existent GM and Director of Food and Beverage, as well as poor management and workers in general, it all adds up to a terrible place to work, and any good workers stay only a short while before finding something better. Pay is okay for the area, definitely not ""competitive"" as HR always claims. Also, HR is a nightmare. All around a big ""no thank you""."
bad,I learned how to prepare food for the guess aswell as the employees. i learned how to use the industry machine as well learn how to use the flat top grill
bad,I sat guests. The management was poor. Answered all calls. Good luck not over working- most of the time I went into over time. Answered all questions the guests had about the restaurant.
bad,"We had managers that were horrible and managers that actually cared greatly about the hotel and the crew member, the bad managers abused the system and would do crazy things that have gotten crew members fired but nothing would be done about it. IN the end the good managers left and the bad managers eventually got fired or just left but the culture as a result suffered and everyone was miserable. Upper Management needs to listen up and treat everyone equally when disciplining workers. It is such a fun place to work and really could be the best if they get it together and LISTEN. Money is important to make but you don't pay anyone on the lower level enough for them to maintain good service in the face of your guests which is a recipe for disaster."
bad,"this is a good place to work because a very nice company and as a laundry attendant I learn to work in the washing machine, presser machine and distribute it to floor by floor of the hotel. Learn to manage your time of work by being consistent and hard work to produce a quality of production in timely manner."
bad,The company in whole mainly the HR department is the most unorganized HR I have ever see. They have different department in differents states handling medical leave
bad,VP of Sales and whole organization did not listen to anything Starwood did right - only followed Marriott's old ways.  All about money!  No heart.  No fun.
bad,"They treat their staff bad, a pay lower. Poor management !!!  Disrespectful , and like to blame to staff . They didn't have any policy for training their staff."
bad,"A typical day at work is slow paced. You learn the basics in your area and have no room for advancement. Management will prolong any of your basic requiresments (Work card, nametag, uniform, training etc) for as long possible. The hardest part about the job is finding something to do and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have guests be satisfied with the hotel."
bad,"A single day would typically include four project priority shifts along with three to five production issues."
bad,J & S painting company has been maintenance painting in the hotel for the past 20 years. Work has slowed down allot in the past few months. managers from different departments don't always communicate well which leads to problems.
bad,Marriott is a ok company to work for. They work you alot. Management  has a high turnover because of the daily workload. Most of my coworkers were easy to work with.
bad,Hotel was ran horribly only a few people did their jobs some did not know how to do their jobs . Stuck doing other peoples jobs. Guests were able to talk to employees however they wanted.
bad,very bad place to work very poor management no set schedule they had me working 8 days straight received zero overtime everybody is cool that’s the only thing that drives you to work  Managers & HR pretty much sit on their behinds & walk around with their noses up towards the housekeepers don’t really do anything to help the hotel people steal tips from housekeepers they let it slide & they decided to put 5 dumpers in a garage and we now have a roach infestation and they have yet to do anything about it or take action they knew since july just lazy supposed to be a highly ranked hotel yet they set up events prepare food where roaches thrive only if people knew.
bad,"A pleasant work environment with great people to work with, but very poor pay and benefits.  The work required a great deal of effort because courses in customer service were necessary as well as much effort put into keeping customers happy, but there was very little pay for the effort or compensation through bonuses."
bad,"I used to think from the outside looking in that this hotel would be the best hotel ever to work in, advance my career and make a decent buck....  What a mistake the hours were ridiculous. They were out to make a buck at anybody's expense. "
bad,"I can't completely knock the time I had at the Marriott, some days were very eventful, in which I shared a lot of experiences and memories with various staff and customers, and in addition to this i gained a lot of useful skills that I would be inclined to use in any other work place. "
bad,"although i loved the place the new management seems to have favorites, and they don't listen to what we think would be best for us. they have no cameras on the floors which is very dangerous. New management also has had this thing of not having the materials needed for housekeepers to preform their jobs. they make you pay for parking and or walk 4-7 blocks to get to work unless you would rather pay the 10 dollars a day to park across the street which is usually full."
bad,It's a good place to work. The work can be challenge. I just had to leave because of manament. It was very pourly ran. Never gave you off days upon request. Ran out of food and drink on the  regular at the bar. Over book on room almost every night
bad,"I worked as a general runner last uear and it was very exploting. Sometimes you can be the only one delivering amenities to 700+ rooms and its extremely busy. Front desk agents lay back and dont like to help even when they not busy. This job has so many duties!! From delivering food to guests to delivering refrigeratos, roll away beds and you have to make the bed as well and delivering laundry and many many more duties! Even stocking the refrigerators for the kitchen. The pay is not worth all the lifting and running up and down all day!! I had to leave it was too much for the pay . marriott is a good place to work if you are not doing this job or housekeeping. Good benefits and cheap lunch."
bad,"Great people, but there is a lot of things being pushed under the rug. The communication sucks. They don't ever give raises. They don't follow the labor laws."
bad,A bunch of employees lost benefits when they cut everyone's hours and then moved as many people as possible to part time. Hurt a lot of loyal employees.
bad,worked here for 8 years. I had to beg for time off. Management team had more ego than leadership skills. Didn't even get a Thank You from HR when i resigned. Everyone is over worked and miserable.
bad,"The day starts with a elevator not working and at least ten or more pieces of equipment broken or in disrepair,I learned that the building is at the end of its service life and there has been a recent remodel that only serves as a facade no real infrastructural repair .Current management is running this building into the ground .A series of bad decisions one after another.The hardest part of the job is to actually do the job at hand to its complete fruition.the most enjoyable part is watching the buffoonery all take place in front of your eyes .Do yourself a favor and follow the the other 60 + emloyee's and look for a different job"
bad,"Not everyones experience will  be the same. Mine was a nightmare. "
bad,I have learned how to deal with people attitudes when they are having a bad day or you have some guest that just want free things. The fun part is when we have a big event and we all work together that's when we make it fun.
bad,"Work day starts at 530, or 6.Set up all stations, polish silverware, fold napkins, stock all stations. Wait on customers, serve drinks, food, etc. handle all payments"
bad,"It was very fun accommodating the guest. I enjoyed cleaning up the rooms and making sure all my guest needs were fulfilled as well as providing excellent customer service,"
bad,"Great place to work, Management is not very organized and does not function well as a team . However the ability to network is great."
bad,"i used to work at the global sales office and the reason i say used to is because due to the poor working environment i resigned months back. when i first started working at this office, the management seemed to really know what they were doing and care about employee satisfaction and performance. that quickly change in the course of a year and a half. the working conditions quickly declined. there isnt room for growth because agents are promoted based on favoritism. and i wasted my time while i was there."
bad,"Overall, the co-workers at the workplace are amazing and helpful. Management can do some improvments on organization of documents and work. The job is physically demanding and give you too many rooms to clean without enough time."
bad,Management could use some work. Pay could be better. Schedule needs to better. opinions could be considered more and used.
bad,Not a long term place for employment! Hostile environment. Marriott is the epitome of a horrible place to work. Job security is a joke! My recommendation is to leave before they have the upper hand on you.
bad,Long hours for uncooperative management. Uncaring towards staff members. Best part of the job was free access to the facilities in general especially the gym.
bad,Courtyard By Mariott in Marlborough is a huge joke to work for. Managers are completly out of touch with the staff. GM is a lunitic. Constantly harping at employeea why isnt yhia or that done but wait and look how under staffed they are. Kitchen is the biggest nightmare. No exuctive chef for 6 months. GM promised for 3 monthatnit would get better bit never did. Horrible work enviroment.
bad,"Typically answered calls not only coming in from guests, but also supported all departments in the hotel. I learned sales through service skills which greatly improved my revenue productivity. Immediate colleagues were supportive and enjoyable to work with. The most difficult parts were hours and taking time off not too flexible, and not much room for growth or promotion."
bad,this was a job I took when I relocated to the area I enjoyed the shuttle driving portion of the job I was also the auditor at night the only issue with the job is that you were not guaranteed 40 hrs a week and they did not offer bonuses or yearly evaluation for raises
bad,Management discriminates uses stall tactics instead of resolving issues.  they have no human element to what you tell them everything procedural to their advantage
bad,"The front desk is almost always the ""first voice/face"" of the hotel, and being such we get to interact with a variety of people. Sometimes good, and sometimes bad. It is very enjoyable to find those guests that you can chat and interact with, while at the same time you will have those grumpy/needy guests that can never happy."
bad,"I had to clean the room such as sheets, bathrooms, dusting vacuuming etc. In the winter time there's not much work so full-time summer hours were part-time winter hours."
bad,I enjoyed working with the diverse employees we had and the guest of the Hotel.  The most difficult part of the job was dealing with other managers within the Hotel.  All were looking for the next promotion and relocation they could apply for...this made for a very unproductive management team.
bad,"Looking for upward mobility, no advancement opportunities, little management support.  Not culturally driven, no organization"
bad,I was excited to come to work because of guest. Serving people and making them feel at home was the highlight of the job. The over all building needed updating. That was probably the most consistent complaint from guest.
bad,"Shortly after I was hired, before I had even worked my first day, the entire management staff that hired me (GM, Asst. GM, Housekeeping Supervisor) quit.  That threw everything into a crazy tail spin.  While the property was nice, the management never really stabilized during my time there."
bad,"meh its a living i guess. The managers never know what they're doing, and they blame us for poor training. It wasnt bad but unless you kiss butt you'll be treated badly. Anyone higher up is NEVER at fault. and if they're worked here longer and dont like you quit now. Its like HS"
bad,"Good pay, but that was the only benefit. Fired people every week. No support from managers but then again they were getting fired too. They fired the GM, then most of the other managers. It was a sad place to work."
bad,"Was promised 29 hours a week and was lucky to get 18 hours. They are considerate, I applied for Front Desk and was placed in Laundry and Housekeeping instead."
bad,The management needs to change in order for the place to prosper
bad,Busy construction site working with great co-workers. Hardest part of my job is not being use to construction work.
bad,It was great in the beginning but ended up being a very hostile place to work.
bad,A typical day starts with reviewing what happened the night/day before. The culture is such that the workers run the show. They are unreliable. Upper management plays favorites and there are little or no opportunities for advancement. The Pay is substandard.
bad,Company is biased toward non majority. It's all about who knows whom
bad,"No Praise, just more your doing wrong.  Staffing levels here are very low with line level employees, so managers are expected to work extra days, with no extra recognition of sacrifice personal time."
bad,"Its okay if you like a rotating schedule, and weekly pay. perfect job for a people person and someone who likes a fast paced work."
bad,"The manager of the hotel, which was franchised by TMI Hospitality, was very meek and let the Vice President of the company choose employees. Employees who blatantly disregarded the rules of the company. One of which being fraternization with guests, which is considered grounds for immediate termination of employment. Employees hired by the Vice President of TMI Hospitality practiced in fraternization with guests, yet were never fired."
bad,Communication is greatly needed and fairness among all employees
bad,cold calling Marriot's own reward members offering very low rates for their valued members to visit except the catch is the 90 min timeshare meet and greet on this trip. That fact lead to many hang ups and turn downs. The reward members acted as if they never signed up and were difficult to deal with considering they signed up for this in the first place.
bad,"no comment it is not a good place for advancement. "
bad,"The General Manager was a joke! He never answered his phone, he hated conflict and told us to handle just about all of it. Not a leader, at all. Now the Front Desk Manager should be the GM she was awesome and very fair."
bad,Management does not value their employees as much as they should. They are more focused on money making schemes then taking care of their employees. 
bad,the hardest  part of my job is when the hotel is busy  i dont get any help i fold everything by hand I just have 2 washers and 2 dryers
bad,I was hired as a fulltime associate and getting part time hours.
bad,If you enjoy people this is a nice place to work. Lots of cleaning and could be a busy at times. Everyone helps each other.
bad,"Shame on the Sheraton Duluth Management Company/Owners for keeping your employees underpaid, under compensated, under staffed and under valued."
bad,"Some days I really enjoy working here, and others I can't wait until something better comes along. I definitely don't get paid enough for all that I do here, but that's why it's a starter job."
bad,"i started 3 yrs ago at SHS and it showed signs of weak leadership. i did what i could daily to help each department. Because of the turnover rate i was cross trained on every position in the facility. I would start doing maintenance caring for pool,take trash out fix problems that may came up overnight. Work breakfast answer phones assist housekeepers with making beds separating linen. 121 rooms in this property i was the only maintenance man for a year then i decided the conditions were not beneficial enough to go to daily. Because all the management changes i had to write to corporate to get a performance rating wich i never recieved through my entire employment . The best thing about this job was the challenge it was a great learning process."
bad,Work hours are hard to achieve and o/c status could last several years. Healthcare not free so when laid off or on call you are responsible for payment of your healthcare.
bad,"Management hardly works with you, or cares, overtime is given but not paid, management has a very unprofessional attitude and appearence."
bad,"Starwood has always taught their employees to "" Do the right thing"" Unfortunately they do not practice this themselves. They can treat employees unfairly, especially those that are long term. They either fire them or the employees ends up quitting. The hotel reviews on Trip Advisor is a tell all as to how the hotel suufers when they have some incompetent management at the helm. Too bad their bosses don't see this and investigate or maybe they do and just don't care."
bad,Talk is cheap and management talks a lot. Anyone who wants to move up needs to move on from this property in order to do so. They love to talk about all the opportunities and training you can get here but ask as you may you won't get it here. If you want a career in hospitality work here jus to add it to your resume. Transfer out as soon as you can.
bad,lack of communication and consistency. No direction of management. Poor recognition for employees
bad,"unorganized, management is misleading, no respect or communicate"
bad,Management was never on the same page. Communication was always lost.
bad,"The hotel is full of young people who doesn't know how to take their job seriously, and develop personal relationships between management and non-management by going out to clubs, drinking, sleeping with one another and doing drugs. The first manager was GREAT but I wish she was still the manager and not in the group reservations dept. Someone got written up because they were trying to not get a girl fired because she was 19 and accepted alcohol from a guest...she said she didn't care and that she can't get fired anyway because she was in the Guard....the manager was best friends with her and her sister, who also worked the desk, so nothing happened to her. From an employee stand point, there's a reason why there is a high turnover rate from what is supposed to be a great hotel. Your first month(s) you feel good for working for a well-known hotel chain. Eventually you will realize the subtle differences through guests and other former employees that this isn't a real Marriott (it is owned by Columbia-Sussex)."
bad,"Plenty of work to do for the day employees are great . Management does not help or encourage employees unappreciative , treat like servantstrtrlikservants like sla"
bad,"It was a good job just not good managment the manger treats the employees as less than human even tell you when you can and cannot talk "
bad,"Hotels do not pay their employees a fair amount of money for what they are expected to do, especially the front desk staff.  The only reason I work there is for the employee discount."
bad,"Well this job was my first job, I liked this job actually and wouldn't mind going back to this job or this line of profession. I did have challenging times but I believe I overcame them."
bad,sitting and answering the phone all day for upset members is not my ideal job. and every time I tryed for a promotion from supervisor to managment I got denied.
bad,"The job is easy and fun but having to deal with management or supervision is so stressful.  You are constantly having to repeat yourself because they dont listen  the communication is horrible and you always get in trouble for things you had nothing to do with .you have to constantly prove yourself. Management is rude/disrespectful. "
bad,The job was decent because of the pay. They have benefits available that are decent as well. The work can be stressful and unbalanced. Systems were usually bad as well for guests and employees.
bad,"I was super excited to work for this company starting off, and come to realize that this is not what I signed up for. It’s hard to trust a company that doesn’t appreciate nor stand by their employees. I’ve always enjoyed working with the group of people that I worked with, but for some reason management and this company in whole, is just really shady and untrustworthy! It’s hard to feel like you can create an career with this company."
bad,When I worked at the hotel there was too much drama. The management would sit in the office and gossip. I would get stuck doing all the work while the other girls would sit in the break room and talk.
bad,"Has its ups and downs , no life balance always working , long hours and 6 days , it hard but if Your committed like me then its ok , I have Goal to achieve so I Did my Best , for good times and hard time ."
bad,"I have never worked with so many disrespectful people in the 20 years I have been in the trade. I was very excited to have an opportunity at this company, however it didn't take long to realize there are no consequences for being rude to fellow coworkers and or clients and vendors."
bad,"Stringent schedule. Must clock in on time, no earlier and no later. Micromanagement constantly with no room for errors. Continual fear of reprisal and unethical management. Unfair deadlines and assignments that are not attainable. The best part of my 12 years was working in the marketing department where I enjoyed, to the fullest, my job and its content."
bad,It was really stressful and denigrating i had a lot of compliments everyday it was really hard to work there I personally don’t want to work there again
bad,Cleaning each room before ur time and doing them in a fast paste was a work out but it was cool u just had to know how to pasted ur self to clean each room
bad,Me contratan sin experiencia y a posteriori me despiden argumentando falta de experiencia
bad,"The shifts seemed long, the second shift (3pm-11pm) was especially difficult with no management, housekeepers, or maintenance on site after 4-5pm. The pay was very low and you were almost never treated properly by guests or management. I was repeatedly called after midnight because of minor issues or called very early in the morning. The pay was barely above minimum wage at the time and was only at most a $0.25 raise that was competitive against the other front desk associates. Night audit was ok just tiring."
bad,"don't recommend this place, they don't care about their employees , pay isn't that great compared to others. really wanted this job to work. they micromanage way too much and makes the job stressful."
bad,"i learn alot from working at this job it was very slow customer was very in a rush and rude "
bad,I can say that the Marriott training program was EQUALLY as horrible as the actual job seeing as I only really had 3 days of training for the night Auditor position. I was the one & only person overnight & I was proving the hotel guest with FULL SERVICES overnight.
bad,Pay isn't worth the amount of stress you have to deal with day to day with issues at the hotel and the guest. Very stressful and I feel as though pay should be better compensated.
bad,"The hotel working environment was petty, immature, vindictive. The GM could do nothing in aiding a better working environment since he was so inconsistently in the hotel. It's called a 'cushy-job'. Lying to guests is daily...something I could never do. Customer service to guest's face... ONLY! So disrespectful!!! Unhealthy environment. So sad."
bad,The rooms are perfect and it’s also a good place to Travel at as vacation or something. It’s big hotel with SPA good breakfast with Restaurant and Starbucks. I just didn’t like the stuff very disrespectful
bad,"I came to the Marriott Internship ( In food and beverage) because of the learning opportunities I was promised. Yet Marriott really fell short. The food and beverage internship consisted of making coffee and running room service, not working on intern projects, shadowing managers and learning how to run the operation that I was told it entailed. The culture at my specific property was rough, with people cursing eachother out and fights happening frequently, as well as a very slow environment in general. I made no connections with the people I worked with, as they had all been there for 20+ years and did not care about the new kid. Management was uninvolved, and just wanted me to fill gaps of people being sick vs actually learning anything at all. I think Marriott as a whole is an amazing company and brand, but this internship and location does not meet the mark."
bad,"I realized after I started working this was a franchise Marriott which makes huge difference about everything, salary, tips, hours etc. Benefits are eligible after 6 months of employment."
bad,"Its a great place to work if you don't have kids. The pay is not great. You are working long hours, stress out. If you want exercise this is the job for you."
bad,It was unbelievable how little the assistant manager who was very much in charge of tasks in the hotel did.  Everything was pushed off on the supervisors and I had actually never been in a place of employment were management was like that before.
bad,"It was very messy and very difficult to work."
bad,This was one of my worst jobs...turn over rate was AWFULLLL! We couldn’t keep anybody...so overtime was an option if you wanted to stay longer if not then you could go home when your shift was done. Lunch and breakfast was free...which was a good thing. New hires worked nights...2-11 pm. They provide uniforms. Most customers were so rude and nasty. Working front desk was stressful ...but you could accept tips so that’s was a plus. Most new hires only stayed 3 months then moved on.
bad,"You're talked to like trash by guests and staff. You rarely get holidays off and you can be off the schedule due to occupancy with no notice. You can expect to be scheduled 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shift within the same week."
bad,"I once made a $40 tip and that's about as good as it got. The hotel did not have a lot of supply because people wasn't ordering things, so alot of times we had to clean rooms with no towels or linen and then later on having to revisit all these rooms to go back and put things in them. The towels where a big issue, housekeepers will come in the morning and pretty much fight over towels because if you don't get any towels you won't get any towels until the very end of the day if any at all because laundry person is doing more talking than working or no one is ordered any new towels after the old ones just mysteriously disappeared. We went through so many managers in short such a short time. I was only there for a year not even a year 9 months and we had about four or five different managers to come and go very unprofessional a lot of managers will talk behind your back to other employees and you have to keep track of your hours because if you knew and you don't have login information to be able to digitally clock in and out they will try and get over on you with hours. There was favoritism right off the bat and because I was one of the favorites, it didn't bother me as much but it was still wrong. The hours were the worst which is the main reason I quit. There were some days we would come in and literally only work 2 or 3 hours at the most but yet still had new temps coming in every other day."
bad,"Marriott all across America are in debt troubles became visible do to fraudulent activity with guest stolen identification and credit cards numbers. While working for Hartford Marriot Farmington @ Farmington, CTI witnessed people are treated unfairly do to their race and color of skin and opportunities are given to those who are white."
bad,Lots of responsibilities or new tasks would get thrown on you with no warning or little explanation of how to perform said duties. You were expected to help out in other departments with little to no training as the hotel was severely understaffed and underpaid. Management is not friendly.
bad,"This job used to be fantastic."
bad,+30 year old IT infrastructure with no appetite to upgrade. Top down management approach where lower level employee are not allowed to provide input and/or opinions.
bad,"there's nothing special about Marriott - it's just another big corporation pretending to care about their associates.  not good, not bad - just typical."
bad,"Marriott bought Starwood Hotels & Resorts.  I was emplyed by Starwood for 15 years.  Marriott decided not to keep the Scottsdale office so did not offer us as much as Starwood had.  I did not take a position with them as I did not want to move out of state."
bad,"Paid $12 / hr to work security nights by myself only 14 hours a week no uniforms provided"
bad,It's a regular day to work in which you start the day with every day responsibilities and ongoing projects. You are prioritizing your client satisfaction.
bad,No good training to many supervisors your being rushed not get it right coworkers are not Friendly and I feel management could do better with staff all a family front
bad,"You would think working in a hotel environment would be fun but its not. Most days you are verbally attacked or insulted by the public."
bad,First time working for Interstate....not sure how the company works but this hotel's management staff is bad....I have worked for 5 different hospitality companies and this location was the worst....overused management to the point they go to the hospital or quit.   No thank you!
bad,"Company paid very poorly. There was a reasonable reward scheme, but it was withdrawn to save company money! Very poor work/life balance. Very hard to study when working several back to back split shifts! Enjoyed serving guests"
bad,Marriott Hotel is a great place for someone to start due to many opportunity. I left Marriott due to school. That place teach me about hard worked in many difference way. Great Company.
bad,"I worked for this company and property many years ago. And it still hasn't improved, same people, same no business situation. They hire everyone on the spot, which sometimes is bad and dangerous. Good luck in improving."
bad,Trump is good place to work.. not to good with management but good company. they have nice coworkers but they do not really pay good for everything you have to do
bad,This job paid the bills and was able to save enough to move out west. It was a typical front desk job and it was fun working there. I would recommend this job.
bad,"Isn't a bad place to work. I've accomplished a lot here over four years, starting as a agent and moving to supervisor. Just ready for something to use my degree"
bad,Marriott International offers great benefits if you can afford them.  The work/life balance is non existent. The managers and style of managing is awful.
bad,The culinary training co-op was a good way to receive college credit hours and on the job training. The account has a collective bargaining agreement that creates an us vs them negative work environment.
bad,"My main responsibility was driving the guests including airline flight crews to and from the airport as well as other guests to the airport and other places in Sioux Falls, SD."
bad,amazing company to work for but let down by the hotel policies in place and hard to express your opinion . been working 10 years for Marriott. I love the company. but when you get stuck in a country side hotel you are done. nothing is followed and jungle rules comes in place.
bad,"I felt like I should not have known some of the things I do know about supervisor personal relationships at work. There was no togetherness. Once training is over you are on your own, and hard to find a seat since you do not have a set desk. Some supervisors really cared about their employees, but there were a few who just did not care. Also how are you going to try and trick me into a promotion to work a bad shift that is not good for a person with kids. I get it we are open late, but if anyone is working 5- 2:30 AM should get a dollar more just because it takes away from family."
bad,I would never work back here because they are never understanding about you bein sick and having daycare problem with your kids being a single mother and  just rude mangers
bad,When i worked at this hotel it was okay until my boss didn't talk to me right so i left the job didn't work there for long about 3 months. I didn't like the job so i just left and not a good place to work.
bad,"If you're looking for job security and a decent benefits package, you could do worse. The upper management is about as bad as it gets however, nobody stays more than a year. With as much of a turnover rate as they have, you'd expect much better advancement opportunities. Don't hold your breath. Temporary job with room to grow in the company, but not on the property. In all, with better (more stable) upper management and improved ethics/volume- this would be a decent place to work. The overall experience wasn't horrible (due to the people I was able to work alongside on the floor), but after such a big orientation process (more like a show), expect to be thrown into a constant onslaught of disorganized chaos."
bad,very rude people some wouldn't do their job like they should .So then  you would have to pick up the slack ..Hard part doing 30 to 40 rooms. Ten have to do 10 or more of someone else
bad,"Marriott has good benefits, such as a good 401k plan and  PTO, but health insurance is very expensive. The wages in this company are very low unless you are a manager or in a position that earns tips. The politics in this company are extremely strict, and you are always under a lot of pressure to satisfy the guest in sometimes unrealistic circumstances."
bad,"Management was very unprofessional and coworkers were 90% negative. You basically had little training to none and had to learn everything on your own. Coworkers did nothing but talk about each other all day, there was so much drama. Management was childish, did not care about your other priorities, and petty. Although it was a learning experience and Marriott has great customer service, I personally would not work at Springhill Suites again. The only thing good was the employee discounts but that alone was not enough to stay."
bad,its a call center with all the same call center drama as everywhere else. they pay pretty decent. the HR team is awful at best. too many office politics
bad,"The gen manager was very disrespectful, borderline racist, the manager of the restaurant had no food management experience, I was under paid and over worked and they were under investigation for being racist, so on my 3rd day I was questioned about how I was being treated... awkwardly"
bad,job is not what it seem . they don't teach you much . it is all about learn for yourself . I worked here In 2015 and we had mold the place always stunk and they treated us like trash
bad,I learned to become a better team member and leader. Enjoyed working with fellow employees. My day was sometimes long especially around the holiday but enjoyed it because most customers where really nice. But once I came sick I had to find something else to do.
bad,This was a management position and my first job out of college.  Great training but the wrong managerial role for me.  I am meant to be front of the line building relationships and strategic partnerships.
bad,"I have done lots of fun there, the people (colleagues) were awesome there. I have learnt lots of thing from there and i hope company will grow in future."
bad,"answering phones"
bad,Great company but benefits could use improvement for part time workers.This job is a on call bases. Not intended for individulas with real rent to pay.
bad,"I can't say I recommend this location.  High employee turn-over, including management.  No bellman desk, some/most rooms don't have a work desk (it's a business hotel).  Management makes no exception for Acts of God/Weather in regards to tardies.  Had to pay for my own hotel room in downtown at another hotel just to make in into work for a mandatory meeting to discuss how poorly we did on an employee satisfaction survey."
bad,estuve en área de contraloria y aprendí muhos procesos contables
bad,"Dealing with many complaints "
bad,Not interesting in sharing my experience working at the Westin Crown Center. The staff was great at the front desk excluding the upper management team.
bad,No room for advancement the management team is terrible. When something happens the improper response - I'm on my period. NEVER ACCEPTABLE to say this.
bad,Hated this place. Worst group of managers. Cliques. Gossip. All the things you don't want in a work place. Low pay. Only good thing was being close to home.
bad,"Long work days"
bad,"Très bien pour se lancer dans la vie active, prendre son envole ailleurs par la suite pour mieux progresser."
bad,It started out as a good job until politics found its way in. I did learn a lot about management and customer service and hospitality.
bad,They make it sound amazing when you first start then you soon realize it sucks unless you're just an amazing person with call centers. Benefits are no where close to what they tell you either and you can fired easily.
bad,No comment and that is as nicely as I can put it😂😂. I got out of this place quick. Doesn't care about their customers in the slightest and makes you look like the jerk. Biggest legit company/ scammer I ever worked for. Left to keep my dignity.
bad,"Schlechte Führungskräfte vor allem im Personalbüro"
bad,"They built this hotel here in Niagara Falls USA, in rhe summer of 2016. I was one of 1st to be hired before the hotel opened. My title was Laundry Attended. NEVER did one load. I helped cleaned and stage this 75 room hotel OVER & OVER again for 2 weeks! They were hiring construction workers off of the street! Their grand opening was postponed FOUR TIMES! A very unprofessional work environment to say  least! Most importantly, is how the father treats his employees...only 2 people remain on staff from the original crew....says alot about this particular hotel."
bad,"I worked for the W hotel in minneapolis as an executive assistant, the management was poor at best.  They are extremely superficial as my first review by the management concluded that I did not dress with the correct style although I was wearing business attire each and every day.  This was also my first hotel setting that I worked in and the management had unreal expectations with little to no guidance in my daily duties and offered no coaching.  Overall, one of the worst work experiences I have ever had."
bad,"This job had great pay and great benefits. However, they are really hard on you about meeting your conversion fresh out of training. I have never worked in a call center before and this definitely wasn't worth it to me. It had me so anxious every day I worked because I never knew if I would be fired over a bad conversion day."
bad,"Lots of interaction with the guest in the hotel. Learning how to make things brilliant with our guest on a daily basis. They do exist, not always there when you need them. Hard to find good help these days. Finding people that want to work. Having to multi-task and do three or four jobs at a time. the guest you meet and some of the co-workers you work with."
bad,Te engañan con el sueldo te dicen q es neto y al final no lo es así la gente no revisa tu trabajo y aún así lo evalúan y lo hacen de manera errónea grupos separaciones y elitismo donde desprecian a los operativos mientras los administrativos no hacen absolutamente nada.
bad,"Get to work and find a desk if you can. Then log in and get on the head set.  Go on break/lunch and then back on phone. Make sure your are not to long on one call and that you are hitting your targets.  Only learned that the guest does not matter and the booking does.  Most enjoyable part of the job was break/lunch and going home.  Loved working with the people at Starwood St. Thomas, just not the atmoshere and the constant push to either met targets or lose your job."
bad,"In a typical restaurant, the wait staff usually have tables they are assigned to cover, but in the banquet servers’ case, they are responsible for accommodating all the guests at a function while circulating the room; responding politely to guest requests and anticipating their needs."
bad,Independently owned and operated. Owners corporate office is located in this property. You will get the sense of them standing over you and watching your every move the who time they are on property.
bad,"This establishment is run by HEI hospitality, they are a good company to work for if you are a member of their management team. Hourly employees please proceed with caution."
bad,the people you meet are great they are really helpful the housekeepers take pride in there line of work. the restaurant is lovely the overall hotel decorations id nice and comforting
bad,"Management is lazy, you're underpaid and treated badly, managers talk about employees to other employees behind their backs. The general manager is a goon. When you are interviewing they give false promises, room for advancement when there is none, poor bonuses if you even get them. Promises of bonuses being hundreds, and then get 50$. It's a joke. High turn over rate at the Front Desk."
bad,A typical day working there was good at some points . I really did not learn much at the job .. management was ok sometime it seem like the did not know what they where doing because we did not always have the things we need . my co-workers wasn't nice at times. The hardest part of the job was when we did not have the stuff to do my job .. what I enjoy about my job was being able to work on my own .. so I could get my work done
bad,Super cool place to meet girls. fun great swell awesome groovy wicked jolly fast exciting tip top laughable chastising
bad,The job can either be really difficult or really easy. Sometimes you are over understaffed when it is busy and the multitasking is at an extreme. For the pay and the very little tips you receive isnt worth it.
bad,Fairfield Inn just was not for me. I did not like staying up all night doing pretty much nothing besides some paper work. I did not really learn anything from this job other than my body does not like night shift. The hardest part of the job was simply staying awake.
bad,Typical fill in job. This is only good if your a teen ager and don't mind getting bullied into working for close to minimum wage. The mangement there is a joke.
bad,"Ordering, recieving,cooking,inventory, Working with other departments in hotel to achieve goals. Most food and beverage front of the house has been the a long time, good and bad thing to have some days. Many set schedules"
bad,"Day at work:  opening procedures for catering service.  Managing banquet housemen.  Supervising all room sets/turns/meetings.  Maintenance of all tables, chairs, dance floor, risers.  "
bad,"the people you work with are really nice and will help you out with what you need to know on the fly. the most enjoyable part of the job is receiving tips. however the staffing company themselves pay you a decent hourly wage but do not give you hours to make that wage count. in one week you may only work ten hours all together, thats only 110.00 before taxes. then when you ask for more hours they think you whine. Then lower management behave unprofessionally consistently and they even lost my check"
bad,"Fast paced, worked with great people"
bad,"Since the time I have Joined Sheraton Deira, I had to go thru the worst situations of my life. Management and the associate are not supportive at all and there was a nationality difference and the favoritism is done so much. If you raise your voice for Good, you will be either asked to leave and terminated. Heartless people and doesn't care for the staff welfare. "
bad,"The management of this department has always been pretty awful. The supervisors are usually good people, which is why they tend to leave shortly after they start. The restaurant's business is inconsistent, not because it depends on hotel guests, but because the chef refuses to advertise properly to locals. The worst part is when the hotel makes money by renting out vacant rooms to families, the restaurant staff suffers, dealing with complaints, messy children, and poor tipping. Do not work in this department of this hotel, ever."
bad,"Answering calls all day and telling owners that although you have paid thousands in maint fees we still can't get the date you want. I've learned how to sell better. Marriott only wants more and more of the owners money without fulfilling their promise to give them an unforgettable vacation experience. We'd get everyone's sales numbers for the day so we knew how much we were or weren't selling. "
bad,"This is not the ideal place to work as you would think the name Marriott is so big but the wages is so bad. You would think hospitality is a good industry to work in but NO it's not, never again am I going to try working in the hospitality industry once I leave this job."
bad,"Typical day starts with finding a seat.  Sometimes it would take 10-15 mins just to find a desk to work at since they seem to hire too many employees than they have seating for.  "
bad,"it was a part time job ,and the schedule and the hours not enough for me to learn different challenge.i learned how to work as a team member,and the management was OK,and the co workers aren't  there on time which made me very disappointment"
bad,"Guest Reservations, Handle all guest complaints and resolve issues, I learned a new system in the hospitality industry. Management was never around when you needed them. They agreed to the help that was not there and didn't pull forward. Coworkers knew there job and knew it well. The hardest part was trying to run a hotel without the supplies needed. Enjoyable part is meeting new people."
bad,"Hard work and took alot of team work.The customers were very nice, the hardes part was getting timed."
bad,i spend the whole day cleaning rooms. my co-workers are good and very interesting every one have their own differences which is really good. i really enjoy working with new people.
bad,The have a lot of legacy systems and  home grown application. I work as developer and it's the worse experience in my life so far. The IT management do not even have clue how manage a small app. they are just typical corporate and that is not good for blood pressure.
bad,The management was very unprofessional and communication between employees was very limited.
bad,"If they could get every department together and remodel the whole thing it might be a nice place to work but three yrs in and things seem to keep declining. 3 GMs in that time, countless supervisors and front desk agents have come and gone. The turn over in this place has to literally be about 75%. I understand that hospitality is a very transient job but this place basically runs off anyone decent to make way for sheep."
bad,"i love to work with customer. especially helping them with there needs. im loveable, caring, hardworking and honest."
bad,"At Westin we have our busy days as well as quite days."
bad,"Typical day at work tended to be working overnight with a limited staff when the hotel was completely busy. I learned how to thinking my feet very quick, being the manager on duty required some innovative solutions to problems in the middle of the night. "
bad,"Management had a bad attitude towards staff"
bad,no pay advancement for good employees looking for more pay. everything based off of union contract
bad,"I did not enjoy working here for my work experience as there was not alot of work for me to do, I was mainly watching people do their job."
bad,"This is a good company to start out with, but not a reasonable choice if you want to grow long-term. Management only cares about other management; if you want to be promoted, being friends with the CFO is a huge asset. Expect to work hard, and if anything is out of your control, expect your supervisors to blame you."
bad,"Two things to keep in mind when applying for the Marriott. Front Desk makes $9 an hour. At that rate, the turnover is incredible.  The majority of people applying for that rate are young people in their twenties. The team leaders are also very young and lack experience in leadership. The one upside is employees get a discounted rate on reservations.If you are trying to self support you will need a second job."
bad,"worked in morning and was pretty much working by myself. FOM was always at desk behind door. Management never holds employees accountable for their accounts. Work your butt of and never get acknowledged. "

bad,"Really good when you need to break in to the hotel field.  Lots of all around experiences as you practically had to do every job functions in housekeeping and laundry."
bad,"They drank everyday and I had to pick up the slack."
bad,This place does not have everything organized.They do not pay well and no room for advancement.
bad,"former breakfast attendant at the courtyard in chktg, ny.  poor management due to understaffing employees for breakfast rush then complain when tables arent clean. one person is NOT enough on weekends, understaffed. will never work for buffalo lodging again!"
bad,"*a typical day at work can be fairly slow depending on the shift. ill typically come in, go through my checklist and handle any paperwork that needs to be done. im constantly dealing with diffrent types of guest, checking them in and out of the hotel and handling any and all complaints."
bad,"I was in charge of  heavy desk. "
bad,it was okay working there at that establishment but I didnt see a career in it.
bad,Overall not a bad place to work if you want to fly under the radar.
bad,"if you are not prepared to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days of year, then this is NOT the job for you.  As a guest service representative or service express agent, this is what is required from the management.  the new guest service manager is inflexible and has implemented new ""no switching shifts"" and ""no honoring time off requests"" rule.  perhaps this has something to do with her recent affair with the Supervisor of Rooms?  This hotel is rife with interoffice affairs and rewarding of sycophants.  the co-workers are great, but as in all experiences in a corporate environment, they will stab you in the back in order to climb the corporate ladder.  Unfortunate for such a good parent company.  This particular franchise is one of the worst in the country, as can be viewed on TripAdvisor in comparing to the Westin Calgary, Westin Vancouer, etc."
bad,"there is a lot of drama between employees, the management goes by what they hear from the employees they ""favor"". they dont take the time to investigate what is being said!"
bad,over worked and no pay if you want a workout and get paid its the job for you the discounts were great
bad,"Need improvement overall management was very unorganized and unprofessional,"

bad,"just cleaning every day, nothing for us only work just do your job and go home and tomorow the same thing."
bad,"Inventory control of 727 rooms of 3 hotels in all distribution channels"
bad,"This company, on the corporate side, has very strong customer satisfaction goals and success record but the individual property General Mangers only care about the bottom line. They are greedy and often make their employees feel less than human and under-appreciated. I would not recommend working for this company if you have low self esteem issues or high hopes of feeling comfortable at your work place."
bad,"I liked working for Marriott they take care of their employees, and give great discounts for travel."
bad,"Lie or mislead you in your initial interview for your position you are applying for. They will leave out other expectations and duties they require you to perform, ( not pertaining to helping out other departments when needed ). I am talking about them not telling or informing you of all your job duties and requirements upfront. they like to keep adding to ' the plate ' so to speak.Your opinions and suggested never matter. They act like they listen to you and then never give a response except, "" we are looking in to it "". Pay raises are never guaranteed no matter who you are or how great you are for the company, and if you do get one it is no more then at greatest a 3% raise.( This may change from year to year based on the market of course. ) You are ' used and abused ' and very "" replaceable "" to them. During the ' slow peak of business ' you are told to use your PTO to make up your hours from being cut during the week, even though the CEO's and Management never have to take pay cuts during this time, hourly employees suffer the most."

bad,"needs to change the management to be able to impose the standard rule of Marriott Hotel, which is "" The fair treatment policy"""
bad,Management experience for different departments. Good work experience. World know chain.
bad,Found upper level management to be unethical. Overall standards are low. If you are of high moral fiber this is not the place for you.
bad,I would NEVER recommend this employer! Leadership does not care about your life and work you to the bone.
bad,I only got minimum wage. I was not using my talents or making as much money as I used to. Any person can work as a dishwasher. A dishwasher can not get a promotion.
bad,"Decent managers and supervisors. Pay is not commensurate with skill level. Raises within department is non existent. Callers are mostly rude while to trying to assist, self entitled, arrogant and pompous. Required to constantly learn and adapt to unannounced procedures. Training modules are hard to understand sometimes. Variety of system errors complicate the process of assisting callers in a timely manner, which creates frustration for both parties. Strict on the call time guidelines for each call is at best, attainable but not always realistic"
bad,"Not sure if all locations are like mine... but our gym and head manager don’t deal with anything... turnover rate is high, showing a problem not with lost employees, but management. They would rather bury their heads in sand than deal with unruly coworkers creating a hostile environment, or even messed up hours when it comes to pay day.."
bad,"It's like going to high school, only thing is you are the teacher. Common sense goes a long way! Anything you know will be wiped away and rebuilt. Old saying goes, take care of your associates, associates take care of guests, guests comes back. Well that went away once Starwood was acquired. All brands have became your standard Marriott's."
bad,"Good values, good product, great location, competitive market, long hours, very stressful, more conscious about the customers, overwhelming, not enough staff..."
bad,"Mr. Marriott Sr. and Jr. stood by their belief - You treat your associates well, they treat the guests well.  Marriott was truly a family oriented company.  When Mr. Marriott Jr. retired the company completely changed.  "
bad,They don’t treat they’re enployes correctly. The manager picks favorites with friends she hired and give them all the dates on the schedule. Barely any other employee got work hours
bad,Started off as an okay job but after working there a few months the general manager an executive housekeeping manager don't have good team work skills an very unprofessional when having issues with other staff.
bad,Definitely a fast paced. Wasn't told to bring my own lunch. I had told them that i needed a break to pump and I was told to wait until lunch. I have never had this problem at comfort suites. I was able to take time out and actually breastfeed my son at work.. and still have time to pump.
bad,"I loved the employees that I worked with. No matter what everyone always did their jobs and I would like a better management. The hardest part of the job is they never really took care of their employees the way Hilton brand has for me. The most enjoyable moments were the bowling activities we did, but they stopped."
bad,"Co-workers are very nice so do everyone else, but the housekeeping management team is lacking of skills and capability as they promote people who do well on housekeeping jobs, but not necessarily good at coordinating, facilitating and communicating over 50 people. Also some supervisors speaks poor English and make it hard to understand causing communication issues all the time.  Supervisors aren't very helpful, no management skills at all, does't seem intelligent."
bad,"This place was just fine when I first got hired years ago until they brought in these new incompetent, useless management. When it's very busy they will not help you, but have the nerve to complain about the scores. They dont schedule properly, they don't have any concern for people's personal lives and are very insensitive depending on who you are. If you are an employee that knows their rights and stands up for themselves, they quickly try to get rid of you.This place is very unorganized and horribly ran. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE AND THE MANAGERS! The work environment is so unsanitary! There are roaches EVERYWHERE! In the kitchen, lounge, rooms, locker rooms. You have to put your things in a bag and time it up so you won't take them home. They know it but continue to serve food as if this hasn't been an ongoing problem. Let's not even get into the weak union we have. Paying union dues is a waste of money PERIOD! Also, HR will feed you lies about being for there employees and they have an open door policy if you have any issues. LIES!!! They are for the managers and will belittle and demean you. Other than the pay and benefits, stay far away!"
bad,"While working at the newly built facility, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the relationships among co-workers. No annual pay raise until I raised concern about it. From there forward, I was granted a pay upgrade but management could have been more aware."
bad,"Great company to work for, except for the owner of the Hotel is cheap and the hotel is falling apart."
bad,great guests. nice people. good food at bistro. starbucks!! room attendants are hardworking and fast. i enjoyed the  thank you letters! Laundry staff are effiecient
bad,horrible management very unorganized wasn't fun to come into work made it very difficult to enjoy work and pay is bad. management needs to get it together.
bad,"Working in a hotel is exciting honestly but it's expect changes all the time and a lot of work on days and sometimes no work at all. If the head of your department sucks, quit or transfer... It'll make your life miserable."
bad,I like my job and my job was very comfortable to work but sadly management was not very understanding. I did learn plenty of new things in the sort amount that I was there.
bad,"I was lied to about my hours, job duties, and compensation. Every day I worked was dangerous because of inadequate security. Wasn't provided the tools nessacary to do a good job. Poorly ran"
bad,Westin hotel was no the best hotel to work for the management was selfish and did not care too much about there employees or there services much they wanted you to get the jobdone and nothing else.
bad,"Poor salary, poor management, but nice colleagues, very supportive. The HR team is not that helpful. Though, it was still a good time working there. Too many calls"
bad,"Marriott international is a massive company with thousands of locations and thousands of above property resources. "
bad,"the first thing i noticed about this place was there were little to no males employees, which means there's a lot of women employees.  Usually when its a lot of Women that means there is gossip and drama. I didn't like working around there to many groups and to much drama"
bad,Working here was fine!! But if your not apart of a certain group its harder for you to get understanding and ideas to management. Overall good experience meeting new people
bad,"Most people are young or of a different culture."
bad,"I've been an employee for a short time now and can say without a doubt that this place needs serious work. The job itself isn't very difficult (Housekeeper), and the other employees can be ok to work with depending upon everyone's workload at the moment. Typical days consist of cleaning trash, rooms, linens, etc. The hardest part of this job is how quickly you need to move to get everything, and keeping that pace for 9-10 hours. Severely understaffed, poor management, hectic hours, and lack of supplies make completing assigned tasks less than manageable. However, customers tend to be very polite. The only real part of the job that has been enjoyable is working with a diverse culture of people. All in all, I would be highly unlikely to suggest this hotel to anyone looking to get into the hotel industry."
bad,"typical day at work - unpredictable"
bad,"When it came to working here i really enjoyed my time there, the only thing that i did not like about being here was the respect from customers but do to the patience that i have and me being an understanding person that is how i was about to maintain my job."
bad,"I worked at a 167 room hotel in Dania Beach, FL where everyone is expected to do the work of 3 people and they have the minimum amount of help possible.  I was given a list of things to do which is impossible to do in only 8 hours unless you do a fast, sloppy job which I guess is what they want.  The housekeepers have to clean 16 rooms per day.  Nights they have two people...the night auditor and night house aide (me).  They allow you 1/2 hour for lunch plus two 10-minute breaks but if you take a break you will never get all of your work done and leave on time which is what they expect.  The benefits were good however, including paid vacation and holidays."
bad,"Come in knowing that your are very replaceable. You will not be treated as an asset no manner how hard you work for them. You be placed in positions to fail daily and you learn how to make it work anyway. I had managers that made me do my job in spite of them ratther than for them. They also will get comfortable with you taking lemons and making lemonade rather than find ways to get rid of the lemons in the first place. Don't look for much planning for events but expect to have unnecessary problems to occur. Also no room for life balance as your life will need revolve around your job."
bad,"NO Communication from manager to employee "
bad,Lots of turn over due to unhappy staff and work place environment. Overall lack of interest in employee well being and happiness by upper management.  Unsuportive work environment
bad,Management can be better.Employees are not valued and or recognized. It is all about who you now rather than what you do.
bad,"Overall the work is not difficult. They are technically still in the 1970's with paper logs and a lot of redundancy. The management is also behind the times and are not the most educated or intelligent people. They tend to bully their employees."
bad,they tell u a lot of good things to get u in the door only to find out its totally different  u bid on schedules  so u never have  a set time for work meaning u cant plan appts and such in a timely matter

bad,I don't  work long in this hotel. Since is a sister  company of Marriott Residence Inn. I love working in Hotel. Is a kind of experienced that i will cherish it.
bad,"working at a hotel wasn't all fun and games, working as a banquet server and dishwasher had me constantly moving and constantly at work but it was a on call only since banquets were only sometimes a month"
bad,"I mange all engineering operations attend meetings do payroll, cut down on such as overtime, supplies, inventory yet still have the ability to move forward with every day tasks. I work with a somewhat great crew but some of the other managers leaves little to be disered"

bad,"My day was always different. They changed my off days on a regular basis. "
bad,"Lately business has been slow but when it's busy not enough employees to caterer to guest."
bad,"Constantly breathing down you necks about conversion rates, They set very lofty goals, even for new hires fresh out of training, expecting you to find rooms for people within 4 minutes at least 45% of the time."
bad,"Our job was to launch banquet events according to the event orders for the day. Learned workload management, interacting with other departments to get banquet orders fulfilled. Co-workers were not forward-thinking, and at times inconsiderate to guest needs. Hardest part of the job was interacting with co-workers unwilling to execute in the workplace. The most enjoyable? Free food! Lots of downtime used to prep and clean."
bad,"a typical day at work was little chaotic to say the least. it was a new hotel and it was not executed properly. we were not prepared on a day to basis due to lack of mangaement. i wasnt a manager but everyone looked at me as one because of the way i took control and made lemonade out of lemons. we had to endure the chefs attitudes and refusal to listen to what was really the problem. even though it was a tough situation i did learn a lot. i learned control, motivation, and leadership quality. most of all confidence. people will follow if you show confidence even if you dont know what exactly your doing."
bad,"Work location was great. Management skills left much to be desired as they seemed clueless about the ongoing daily operation and did not step up the the challenge in handling guests' service issues (always hid in the back office & refused to come out to speak to upset guests or had a supervisor speak to the guest although the guest asked for a manager), everyone seemed to assume someone else was handling needed projects at hand which caused many guest issues, rooms that were booked & guaranteed by sales team were not communicated to the front desk which at the same time doing daily out/up sells to fill the house & in turn caused overbooked situations...Poor work environment in general but after the hotel renovations the place to to look good on the outside but much to be desired in terms of service management on the inside."
bad,Excentes trato al personal. Compartir con los compañeros de trabajo
bad,"Management is filled with unqualified candidates. The company is disorganized. The management is disrespectful. I do not advise working there. If you do, work in a position where you won't have to deal with a lot of others. Pay isn't bad, but job is stressful and mismanaged."
bad,"The hours of housekeeping are good, never work after 6. The pay is minimum wage and the management is continuously testing to see if we are aware of certain practices. Also, if change in behaviour is needed the lines of communication are not effective. The best part is the other housekeepers and their humour. The worst part is the pay to expectation ratio."
bad,"I may come off as unhappy employee , I'm not my situation is like no other , I have worked for Marriott for 14 years without any write ups and I was terminated wrongfully, I was asked to work an overnight shift { Fire Watch} , Marriott did not supply a flashlight which is a requirement under Maryland law, so I utilized one that I use for Med Star which is also a taser , I am also a Special Police Officer for the State of Maryland monitored by the State Police, Marriott chose to terminate me by the laws of Howard county , I worked in Montgomery County MD, which states it is unlawful for anyone under the age of 18 to posses one , mind you it was not being used as a weapon but a flashlight, one of my coworkers observed me with it and requested that I purchase him one , the transaction was conducted on Montgomery County street where my vehicle was parked , the associate was instructed to retrieve the item mentioned from my vehicle , after his purchase the associate chose to act irresponsible by showing it to employees throughout the facility , he was reported , mind you know one ever reported me for having it or inappropriate action. I was terminated because of his actions and him implicating me in he testimony to Human Resources. Maryland Department of Labor Licensing and Regulation determined it was a wrongful termination and awarded me unemployment compensation , Marriott appealed the decision but didn't appear for the herring , the case was dismissed , Marriott appealed it again but the appeal was denied."
bad,"This is the worst hotel I've ever worked. Horrible hours, the managers don't have any experience, the owners are rude and disrespectful. This company doesn't treat everyone equally and that's their biggest downfall. Im in the process of filling for discrimination"
bad,"good opportunity to learn about managing people, operations, and client service."

bad,"Starwood Vacation Ownership is one of the most ridiculous companies I have ever worked for. The amount of 'red-tape' it takes to get ANYTHING done in this place is enough to drive a saint insane. The work/life balance is a JOKE because it doesn't exist. The workload I have is enough for at least 3 more people and yet they demand immediate results. They thrive on telling you what you did wrong, rather than the 1,000 tasks you got right. Management is not open to feedback and if you give it they will let you know that 'they don't have time for this'. A typical work day for me is sitting down at 8 am and immediately starting on the 1,000's of tasks I have to do, working through my lunch, leaving after 6:30 pm everyday and still being told that I need to do more. By the way, I am no executive, just a lowly Project Coordinator so my compensation comes nowhere near the amount of work I put into this job. If you reading this because you are thinking of a job at Starwood...DON'T DO IT."
bad,"The housekeepers here have worked for Marriott Courtyard-Hobby Airport for up to 25 years and will run off new housekeepers. These ladies do not speak English correctly and are from other countries. It is difficult for a bilingual speaking individual, Spanish and English, to stay working in housekeeping because the women are jealous of the bilingual skills. Yet these women will not learn English to advance themselves within the company. The housekeepers come from various Spanish speaking countries and tend to work with only there kind. Example: Salvadoreans work with each other every well, they will help each other, gather supplies for one another, and would consider themselves better than non Salvadorean people. The housekeeper supervisor would give people of her nationality more hours than others of other nationalities, even to temporary staff members who are of her nationality. This is not fair to the employees who actually work for the company. The housekeeping supervisor shows here breast cleavage to the general manager who usually approves all of her requests even the ones that are not fair to others. They are having an affair. The general manager would use video and audio recording to catch an employee who does not agree with him for the purpose of terminating the employee's employment. Other employees of different departments keep silent for fear of losing their job. Advice....do not work here."
bad,Started working as a commis chef mid 2012. To start with it was a brilliant job but as the months went on it became hell. Didn't do my compulsory training till over a year after I started and I was promised on the job training but only managed to get 2 units done in 1yr and a 1/2. As is the norm within the hospitality industry the hours were long and the pay was shocking! You work your butt off for no thanks. Marriott has the potential to be an excellent company to work for proving management are on the ball.
bad,"Supervisor of Lounge (Former Employee), Amman – February 10, 2014"
bad,Brainwash is all I can say. You either get the culture or you don't.
bad,"- Grand souci de l'application de la culture d'entreprise"
bad,"Every day, the staff would meet for morning meeting after placing items in unassigned lockers (that did not have locks). One of my co-workers stole multiple items out of my purse. The hotel refused to provide me with security footage of the room and insisted I file a police report - I did. When the police investigated, they did not actually have video footage for the room with all of our belongings. My items were never recovered. The manager of the hotel told me she had a feeling who did it and they had been set up in the hotel before and caught stealing from guests! I was ashamed to even continue working with them and resigned after this mess. I did however learn how to pay extreme detail to cleanliness and how to maintain guest rooms the correct way."
bad,Checking and checking out guests.  Answering calls. I learned how to be more effective in customer service.  My managment was poor. I was taught the job and because of its simplicity my position was belittled.  My co-workers were business cordial. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the manager.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers.
bad,"The guests that stay at a Marriott hotel are top notch, but the staff over time become non customer friendly especially if you are not a rewards member or frequent guest rewards member."
bad,Pros:
bad,"I generally work an 8 hr day with 1/2 hr break. I have learned to mult-task and have greatly enhanced my customer service skills, as well as, problem solving."
bad,"I have been here for 7 years and I have applied for several promotions which I am qualified but have been turned down no raise in over 4 years, I go way above my normal duties and work hard. I answer phones, make reservations, send emails, answer emails and check in guests. I have learned that no matter how hard you work for this company it does it mean a thing. Management has its clicks and if you are not in the click there is no place for advancement. And my reservation manager would always blame here mistakes on me and never take the blame. So how do you compete with this. I love working with my co workers and we get along just fine. The hardest part of this job is going into work and dealing with management and trying to talk to them about the issues and just talking down to you. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the guest and making them feel so special and then returning to the resort and making me feel good."
bad,"I worked at The Renaissance Pere Marquette, as a Concierge Attendant. I must say it was a horrible place to work. They have terrible management, they are very unorganized. Talking to the managers was like talking to a brick wall. They barley trained me, I had to learn everything on my own. They never gave me a name badge, or a user Id for the guestware system, or for my go Concierge. I must add that those two systems play a major role in my job. By me not having access to those systems, I had to depend on my co-workers just to get certain task done. I worked in the p.m. So when I would come into work, the am. person would leave the place a complete mess. It had gotten so bad, that I started taken pictures, of the mess that she would leave behind. But nothing was done about it. I felt so misplaced at this job. Don't get me wrong Marriott is a great company to work for. But this property was by far the worst job I have ever had. Only highlight of this job I had was my guest, and my co-workers."
bad,Work environment allows for distractions. Incentives for offering hotel rewards points programs that gives the employee a hotel benefit.
bad,ok good work place its a lot of turn overs no benefits and they work people to death
bad,"First of all the entire operation is a pyramid scheme. They tell you all these great ways to make money, but in reality if you dont make money then your boss doesnt make money then his boss doesnt make money and so on."
bad,"this hotel did not treat the employee equally, i would say this because this is my experience with that hotel, that is why i quit, and the management of this hotel they dont care about the employe, they are care only how to make big bucks without thingking about the employee, they are pushing too much people to do the job what its not supposed to be.....they are not fair"
bad,"I feel that there is too much corporate nonsense for certain people to work there, if you're the type who can hold their tongue, then this is the job for you."
bad,"I love everything about my job in seaview, what I don't like is when dolce bought marriott's they bring the old managers from dolce and did not work like marriott's manager. Not even close not knowledge about marriott's managers."
bad,"A typical day at work for me, begins with a smile. Providing wonderful customer services is my goal. I love the work I do on the job training and reservations."
bad,"Management does not follow any specific work schedule for the management team. There are many times when no manager is present. This leads to a lack of leadership and workplace issues which are difficult to resolve. This particular property management prides itself in having the most productive staff in the organization(20 properties). This is quite misleading because there are significant differences in individual productivity: While some employees are highly productive and are very teamwork oriented, other team members are severe slackers. One of the most egregious issues is the core value of the franchise itself that employees stick to their own job duties rather than function as a team. This value is in direct violation of Marriott Inc.'s philosophy of teamwork as it relates to guest satisfaction."
bad,Too much responsibility for the money .they want you to be a staff manager for cook money. And still give cook's hours if you're not salaried. Just need to up the pay and trust supervisors more.
bad,"Busy work day from beginning to the end. A lot of work to be done depending on the type of day as well as business. A lot of different outlets to manage and be in control of. Lack of staff, and help from management. A lot of unwanted stress for a work day. Good Luck."
bad,"The management at the time of my employment was pretty descent to start. There wasn't enough banquet employees, I had no assistant, and did not have the tools to operate my department."
bad,"Operational sound and process-driven.  There is a job aid for everything that could possibly need to have, including breaks time instructions.  Very cillo'ed environment and management is not really interested in new ideas or opinions.  No clear path for growth and development.  There are extensive opportunities... just no one is able to provide any insight.  Human Resources makes all of the decisions.  very slow to move.  Constant re-orgs and having to re-apply for your job. Often times the new positions will be graded lower and the pay is reduced as a result."
bad,"Eigene Initiative ist strikt verboten."
bad,"Coming into the role, fresh out of college it was fun, but i would soon realize the shortcomings that came with being in management with a major company like this."
bad,Very friendly people but management isn’t all that great. Very low starting pay and to many tasks and responsibilities for that small pay. Not worth it at all.
bad,"There were to nany managers that  were racist, had there favorites and harrassed and tormented blacks. I seen a girl veing harassed by a manager and then blame the employee and cut there hours after"
bad,"I found the team managers reliable and realistic, however...the pay is terrible! Not everything was bad though, we had great discounts for Marriott affiliated hotels and paid time off was awesome."
bad,It was a very fun place to work at the manager are nice and understanding my coworkers were always helpful we would have our monthly lunch in to see how we approved
bad,"If you want to advance in your career, do NOT apply at Marriott."
bad,This is were I got my start. people were great to work with. They had no problem training you in the off season. for advancement. They have lots of over turns management do last very long with a business run by corporate.
bad,I learned how to balance pool chemicals and working in the hotel business extremely enhanced my eye for detail and helped to manage my work detail. I also learned great customer service skills.
bad,The GM is not very friendly or understanding of concerns of his employees and the housekeeping manager is rude and hypocritical. Management is bad but the other staff are nice.
bad,"beneficios varios, gerencia preocupada del personal, compañeros desagradables y poco amigables entre ellos y/o clientes"
bad,"After one year of working here, they began to implement new changes and old requirements for employees. Management is hard to work with, never considers others."
bad,Under staffed no benefits very difficult to understand all the places and rooms you have to do in a small period .Very unorganized and not friendly to staff
bad,"The housekeeping department works hard to get everything done by time to go. Pay isn't very good and benefits are not good either. Although, I did like the customers that came in from all over the world. Management changes often."
bad,Did not enjoy working here. this was many years ago. Maybe management has changed since the 2000. But this type of job is for a single person that does not need a social life.

bad,"Saya pernah jadi cassual waiters di sunrise"
bad,"Good working Environment but benefits not Good  "
bad,"Typical corporate ladder scheme. Difficult to get past the employee morale of those who are just there to collect a paycheck and focus on being a great and innovative, observant and accomodating hospitality establishment."
bad,"sub par management, white lodging is not a good company to work for. paycheck has been wrong multiple times...had to hassle them for referral bonus I was promised."
bad,Outside work pushing carts from room to room outside of the buildings there's 14 buildings and they have no laundry facilities on the other end of the buildings they do not have any cover so it is really hard to keep your linen and towels in your housekeeping supplies dry when weather is nasty
bad,"I love the people from all walks of life that's what I miss the most, the wokers was burnt out do to the high turn over rate, and they are suppose to be friendly when they were tired from working strange shifts, like late nights then come back in the mornings, the best part of the job was metting many from all walks of life, at times it was very unorganized, with other co workers pushing their work on others because they was tired and burnt out,standing on your feet all day was also tuff, but when you keep busy you don't have time to think about the pain :) most co workers was like family, which made the work bearable."
bad,I love working g with positive peers. & really don't like the fact that some people don't even notice the positive in others. But I would love to fi d a decent job so I can better myself for me & my four children.
bad,"A pretty good place to work the pay is not to good but the job itself is pretty good.  The people that work they are good people"
bad,With this job came a lot of stress and no flexibility. Even if we were to meet our goals or exceed them we would still be told management to do better.
bad,very hard work cleaning around 25 hotel rooms for other guests to use. great bunch of people to work with. great atmosphere. you get to meet some fascinating people.
bad,Everyone even the managers gossip and talk about each other. It was like being in high school. It's best to mind your own business and work and go home. Also it's a hotel so they will fire anyone and not think twice about it. they don't mind being under staffed (which is more work on those who works there).
bad,I would rather not comment again about this company.  I had a good time there and the tips were great.  I would do it again if they paid more. I had to leave because the compensation was not making it worth my time.
bad,Job posting will say its fulltime but its really not its more an on call job. Who ever worked there longer gets more days and hours. They are very unorganized closets are never stocked with material needed to do the job. Good pay but bad management and hours.
bad,the job would be great if the dispatcher didn't pretend she knows your job just so the blame of already known out of order rooms(shes not supposed to sell) doesn't reflect your work ethic.
bad,"Started this position as a Front Desk Agent/Guest Services. Moved into the Night Audit position to assist with loss of employees. "
bad,"My job at the Marriott was extraordinary (for lack of a better term). There were the good days and bad days. For half my time there i worked in the Banquet division, preping foods for the multiple banquets we catered. Was also responsible to help with plating massive meals as well as operating a few carving stations. Then I switched to the Line to make food for customers of the restaurant as well as room service. There were a lot of nights that were extremely slow that we served barely anyone, but then there were nights where it was rolling. I had developed an issue of not being on time, So the management moved me to closing shifts permanantly. That meant coming in between 2:00-6:00 pm based on when the scheduling was made, and working until close which was 11:00 pm every night. So there were times that it felt like the night would never end. "
bad,"Coworker need to learn how to respect one another. Help one another. "
bad,"It wasn't bad working here, however the management isn't what it seems. They're very picky with who they want where, they have very little care in sanitation or of workers."
bad,"I used to work at this property and let me say I'm not worried about them finding out who I am reason being 5 of us left within a month of working for the psychotic of a Director of Security at this property. Marriott is a good company to work for just not at this property. "
bad,"Didn't like this outback, seem as tho favorites were played. Its a small work place and alot of others had worked there longer. The discount is great and the work pace is up and down. But somethings I'd like to change ."
bad,They was a good place to work it wasn't the employees it was the general manager she had some issues she would only listen to one person side of the store instead of getting them together and try to better things better I think anytime a employee comes to you with a problem with anything it could be looked at not ignored
bad,"Very nice hotel! Beautiful property but the one i was hired at had very poor management, no structure, things were not handled as they should have been, made my job very difficult so i quit."
bad,"Typical day is prep, cleaning, ordering supplies, working with other departments for customers."
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 years and it has gradually changed into a company that has an HR department that looks out more for themselves and the managerial staff, than the workers who keep that hotel afloat. I felt racially profiled many times and completely uncomfortable at this establishment. There were many times where I myself had to act as a manager despite my actual job title. This was not a fun place to work for behind the scenes, but the people you were able to meet made me stay longer than I should have."
bad,A typical day begins with me coming into work at 8:30am handle any complaints that came the night before. Next get my paperwork started so that I can send each team member to there assigned section.
bad,The first month on the job you feel great and energetic like new life has pumped into you. Once the second month enters you begin to see the real colors of management and how they are more concern of their BONUSES and MAKING THE NUMBERS then looking or caring about their employees.
bad,Housekeeping staff wonderful ladies but management does not follow through on thier promises...sometimes way tooo many rooms per house keeper in an 8hr shift..never enough laundry..
bad,"Exhausting work schedules, very scarce benefits. Not many promotion opportunities. Monotonous work, boring environment, lack of recognition, lack of challenge."
bad,"A typical work day is calm and slow not much activity."
bad,"I was working with Poor Finance manager who needs anger management training."
bad,"serving guest with food and cocktails learned and sharpen my wine and spirit know how."
bad,Nice place to work - very focused team - worked very hard on strategy for 2015 - very nice colleagues - great location - solid hours 8-5
bad,"Marriott has good benefits but horrible management and culture. "
bad,Enjoyed a lot on daily basis.. Innovative ideas popped a lot by undergoing training.
bad,Marriott is a good place to get some supervisor experience.
bad,"everyday i didnt really have fun, didnt really learn anything, didnt like the management, co-workers were upset at me, hardest part was getting to work at 6am without my own vehicle and bus transportation didnt open till 730am, the free breakfast in the morning."
bad,"Management isn't the best, doesn't really help its employees much nor do they care about there employees."
bad,all ways on the phone. very busy work envioronment. its a challeng and its a great way to gain customer service skills
bad,"The management in the Kitchen at the Westin Nova Scotian is just plain bad.  Mostly due to lack of communication and I think part of that is a language barrier.  If that was it that would not be so bad, if there are issues that need to be resolved through the manager they refused to do anything to help.  They would basically just shrug it off and leave you in a bad position. I would not recommend working int the Kitchen."
bad,"A typical day in this kitchen is pretty hectic and just plain crazy. I'll admit there are SOME good managers but not a lot, One manager did stick out and actually taught me a lot about culinary. It would take me forever to describe how terrible management is between your bosses not being there, roaming around, or taking a two hour break it can get frustrating. The hardest parts of this job were"
bad,They are under new (almost two year transition) management.  This place has its good points but the GM and VP of Sales are really struggling.  This is evident from the top down.
bad,"Met wonderful people there who has left.  The hardest part of the job was not able to give every guest what they asked for. Also chasing those who did not belong there out of the hotel."
bad,"during my training period the trainer gave me bad advice, did not clean correclty simply covered up. they try to fire you or give you a warning if ur rooms are not clean to there standard an when u tell them thats what you was taught, they dont believe you. i did not enjoy not one part of this job. the manager was mean an not helpful if you ask a question they get fustrated and impatiant. The employes are all mean, they steal from eachothers carts making it hard to do your job in timley mannor. Tips get stolen by Managers/coworkers."
bad,Great Co-workers.
bad,"The money here is very good from the server point of view, as the clientele consists of mostly business professionals. The stress levels at this location are typically high as there are many different goals to meet at as short period of time and there are repercussions for many things that would normally require only a coaching for one person but another will get written up or just plain fired for."
bad,The hotel were busy at times but I have learn to work under pressure. I was not satisfied with the management but i enjoyed working with my co workers. The hardest part of the job was making sure that all rooms were clean within the time limit. The enjoyable part of the jobs was making sure that all guest were satisfied.
bad,"I have worked here for a short time. I have had issues some were resolved some weren't. in the end I wasn't happy working here, too much negativity, too stressful, under staffed, insensitvity from others. I just became depressed working here. Not the job for someone that is sensitive and has a heart."
bad,I worked here during the time of the merger August 2018. It was an extremely rough transformation. I did not feel as if concerns were heard.  The benefits and pay were great after 2nd raise.
bad,"This job can be isolating. If you are wanting to stay at home to spend more time with your children, this job is not for you. You do need to be able to be attentive to the calls and it is very fast-paced. You basically say goodbye and hello to the next customer in the same sentence. It is tough to get shifts changed or covered. It is also frustrating as you are not provided with working equipment. I had my equipment replaced MULTIPLE times and still has issues as their main operating system and customer booking website crashes often and has multiple issues daily. If you have a lot of patience you will be better suited for this job. The technology is not on your side, and the management is unable to help you as often as needed with tech issues during your calls."
bad,"The company has grown and changed so much, which opens a lot of doors for upward movement. But in exchange, you give up a significant amount of work life balance. Management is complacent, corporate didn’t have a clear vision for the future, and as I found out after leaving the company, the pay scale is lower than the market average for everyone except the top level."
bad,"They expect a lot of efficiency in a short amount of time. It makes that hard to want to stay working there, which in turn it makes it  hard to pass probation."
bad,"My direct manager, and co-workers were great.  We were all overworked, over stressed, bad communication from upper mgmt, and systems that constantly crashed causing long hold times, and understandably irate callers.  Marriott 'stressed' that it's associates come first, but that is NOT true. "
bad,"Maybe it was just this Marriott in particular. It was the pier Marquette Marriott downtown Peoria, il. They were very unfair and the management is always the worst no matter how many they went through. They will never move you up I was there for 6 years and never made a ounce of more money than the day I started. I would never recommend working at this hotel."
bad,"I started out as a temp in 2018 but since being full time 2018-2019 it is really mentally exhausting working there with the back to back calls from the moment you log in to the time you end, you are also not allowed to hang up on a customer that calls 3 minutes before the end and keeps you there for another half hour, you also don’t get paid much extra for that time you stay because it’s not in your schedule as over time. "
bad,the job was okay the manager was poorly she did not do her job I have called girls not changing their sheets and just making up their bad it was very disgusting and there I did not like working there because they did not fire the people who were not doing and cleaning correctly.
bad,"The guests at my hotel were alright most of the time. Management was fine, but the pay was extremely low and more and more demands kept being placed on us at the front desk. Full timers worked hard while part timers got whatever they wanted.... I said I couldn't work one day out of the week, my only schedule restriction, and was still scheduled on that day while part timers got the better shift (morning) and whatever days off they wanted all the time. My coworkers were mostly nice. Breaks are 30 min once per shift, which is average, but employee menu was awful. Pros are the discounts on hotels. Other than that I definitely don't regret leaving Marriott. Took a lot of harassment from guests and couldn't say anything even when it was extremely inappropriate because that was my job."
bad,"Kauai Marriott (lihue) worst place to work. Very stressful. I work in hskpg, my managers sucks. Hskpg management dont know what there doing. If you dont kiss there butt they wont like you.In hskpg its all about kissing butt and favoritism. In orientation, they talk about taking care of their employees BIG BS. Most coworkers in hskpg and laundry loves to criticize and judge you. Work environment is horrible every one talks bad about each other. Some are nice but 85% are fake and judgmental. My honest opinion i will never work here again, worst experience ive ever had. This property needs a check up from corporate. The only goods is benefits."
bad,working overnight as a houseman most of what I dealt with were deficets that happened throughout the day such as things not being completed. I had my list of responsibilities but due to poor staffing I took on many additional roles
bad,"The pay is ok. You will get plenty of hours. There are benefits but you work so much you don't really get a chance to enjoy your room discounts because you are at work most of the time. The balance of work and personal life is off. I barely would see my family because I -worked 7-12 days straight, 8-12 hours a day depending on occupancy. An employee only cafeteria is available for complimentary lunch and dinner. Every Friday is free coffee and donuts for associate appreciation day. Co-workers are like family. But the work hours are ridiculous!!"
bad,"Competitive, every 6-8 weeks shift change based on your performance attendance and seniority almost impossible to take vacation time off due to shifts"
bad,They paid me terribly for running a giant kitchen by myself for the most part. The chef likes to push of the fault onto cooks while he takes a vacation every month. i was also paid 5 dollars less an hour to do the exact same work as others.
bad,Hotel four points by Sheraton jaipur is good opportunity to work with the brand as it is now Marriott international but management is not strong enough towards staff facility and there no accommodation and according to salary not possible to live in rent house
bad,"Job is fine, but the night audit manager was far from the best. He did not have a level head and would get flustered over the smallest issue. He was argumentative with most staff and did not listen to suggestions or criticism."
bad,"This job is one of the worst I have ever had. This place is like highschool. Drama drama drama, it never ends trust me ive been there for almost 2 yrs and I have never felt so left out in a job. Everyone talks about you even management ! Watch out for leadership at this job they are all out to get you fired thats why our hiring process goes on all year long stay away!!!! Theres reasons people drop like flies in this place! Its not marriotts fault its starwood"
bad,it was like a family environment we enjoyed going to work and getting the job done my boss was very laid back and she was a good person to work for the culture was a nice place the hardest part was dealing with upper management with all of the nit picking the most enjoyable part was the people that I worked with I love my co-workers
bad,"There is an extremely high turn over rate at this place and the morale is extremely low due to horrible management. The housekeeping  management are all in some sort of relationship. Oh and let's not forget how head of housekeepers speak of their staff once they close that office door... and try speaking to HR about any issues and rest assure it's definitely not confidential and you'll be out the door within a week or 2 "
bad,"Unprofessional management, too many rooms, not enough pay, over worked, not enough workers, and you have to do everybody job in different departments including your own."
bad,"staff is suppourting"
bad,"work at evening time"
bad,Started off very great . But just seems like everyone is out to get each other . Food and beverage is something I  always wanted to do .  guest are nice and sweet most of the time . But managers sucked . Never approved days off even if you give them time in advanced . Never wanted to take suggestion . Also nobody every leaves so no chances of moving up . A lot of fake people . My manager never knew what was going on around . If it wasn't for the people That actually cared to work there they wouldn't pass any test .DONT WORK HERE IF YOU DONT WANT TO GO INSANE
bad,"A day as a bellman / Valet at the Westin Hotel: would be me taking guest luggage to their room and telling guest about the amenities that the hotel offer. I also assist in parking guest cars."
bad,Management is not understanding to the needs of students or parents. Requires that you put work above all else. Expect to be called in on your days off.
bad,"Very busy, you are always on the move. I learn to be patient and very alert when dealing with customers."
bad,"Responsible for the daily operations of the meeting space in the hotel and the food and beverage service in the hotel and attached convention center. I completely enjoyed the fast- paced, heavy volume environment. Our banquet team worked very well together, had minimal turnover, and set standards for service in the state. Standards changed when the new management company took over."
bad,"While I knew working in a small hotel would be much different that what I was used to, I did not expect nor was I told the extent of those differences.  The entry level staff worked their buns off at their own jobs as well as jobs they weren't hired for.  For example; Front Desk clerks also had to make food in the restaurant and clean the kitchen; and Night Porters were required to cook and serve food.  That did not make sense to me.  I was hired as an Ops Manager for the Hotel, and my duties morphed in to scrubbing drains in the kitchen and managing the restaurant."
bad,Making sure customers are happy with  what they room look like. I like my co-worker and management team. The hardest thing is getting the customers to be okay with the arrangement of the room.
bad,Very hard to walk back into the next day. Not professional at all. I am looking for an establishment that respects and cares about its employees.
bad,"I had to book rooms for guests, contact companies to deal some offers."
bad,"Poor people I feel for them because, there was only ONE custodian inside of each school doing the whole school. Ew! How aweful."
bad,I learned a lot from being employed here. It was fun and the staff was nice. It was a great place to start a career.
bad,"upper management does not care for employees, long hours and no support."
bad,"work hard,fast paced enviornment, mangement was ok,co workers awesome,more then nine checkouts in one day,leaving a guest with a satisfaction"
bad,I was bitten by spider and became very sick not knowing I was even bitten by spider thought it was in grown hair or something went to hospital at VA IN Murfreesboro Tn. and they informed me it was spider bite put me on IV of liquids and cleaned the infection up and put me on antibiotics to get rid of infection and told me not to go back to work for four days once returning to work with Doctors excuse they still suspended me after I left Spring hill suites in Florence Ky. To better my salary and experience and paid on my own relocation fees and ended up with no job no salary and felt it was very wrong even know it was during my first 90 days of work there.
bad,"I loved the fact that I built a relationship with every guest that walked in the building. I loved every part of my job I just had to dismiss myself, on the fact that, the new management demoted me to janitor and took my full time and benefits away for honestly no good reason at all. I could'nt take the judgement and demeaning negativity in the workplace caused by my managers."
bad,"Housekeeping was not for me. I got along with evreyone but my supervisor started making my job really hard to do and eventually I had to quit. We had time limits on cleaning and some of the rooms were really messy or dirty and took longer than expected. Overall, it was a learning experience but I wont be doing housekeeping again."
bad,"I am learning a lot because of my own trainings, its a bit hard in my outlet because were only two bartenders in our bar outlet. As much as possible me and my bar maid, we only enjoy our daily bar operations."
bad,"The Renaissance Long Beach Hotel spends more time and energy worrying more about the esthetics and look of the hotel than time and energy looking for experienced people. They seem to hire people that have no experience in the dept they are working. Especially the food and beverage department, most of the employees have never worked F & B and have no clue how to do their job, mostly including management. Their micromangement sucks!!! Their GM is the worst."
bad,The employees are not well trained and lack hospitality. The hardest part is going to work everyday The most enjobael paret of my job is working thrid shift or hacing the day off
bad,"Benefits where great! But, if you enjoy no advancement, and management that treats you like dirt. They even screwed me out of my last pay check, Thanks Marriott!!"
bad,"If you are desperate and need a job just for the Health Benefits then this may be your opportunity. But if you work to live and not live to work, need not apply."
bad,"The job was great, and the pay was excellent. The management was terrible, and the staff was pretentious though."
bad,"Secure a challenging position in the restaurant industry that will utilize my skills, dedication, and hard work to assist in the company’s success."
bad,"I was pretty excited to accept a position at The Spa at Wentworth by the Sea.  Having been a guest  and client of the hotel I anticipated a positive experience.  "
bad,I would never recommend someone to work here the manager is very disrespectful and don’t know how to talk to her employees don’t know how to schedule her employees failure job
bad,It can be both fun & boring at the Marriot.Racine is not much of a tourist location but they try their best to make it one.The appeal is that of a normal dining experience.
bad,"When i clean, i cleaned well but wirh the way i clean, the time limit  and the 15-16 rooms (9-13 checkout rooms), is undeniable extremely hard work that i have to put myself in extreme physical stress. "
bad,"in the banquet we work all types of hours we did it all from break down set up this event break down set up for next day"
bad,"Depending on the department you're in, your personal enjoyment and satisfaction will vary."
bad,"engineering staff not training "
bad,would not recommend due to the merger having changed so much of what made this such a great company when I first began working there. room for advancement is there but it is extremely difficult to move upwards
bad,Enjoy meeting new people in the company and with the new attitude of people. the west in    hotel. it is a good company but the boss are not at all.I have a express worker with the company but one day or the boss of west in hotel didn't say to me i  did a good job
bad,"Answered phone calls in relation to hotel reservations.  Spoke with guests about travel plans.  Once you are confident in one position, you auto-progress quickly."
bad,I was working at this job full-time for 2 in a half years. The job has good benefit and you could make a career out of it. You get discounts on hotels.
bad,Westin Grand hotel was a nice place to work with. I've learned a lot like gaining people skills.only problem was the long woirking hours that can reach 14hrs
bad,This job reminded me of a high school atmosphere & a favoritism system. Hard workers are not praised. Most advancement comes from the management position. There isn't to much to pertain from the company.
bad,I would not recommend this company for anyone. Management has no concern for you and does not allow breaks. You are to stand there for 9 hours a day with a smile. The people are great and the guest always make for some excitement.
bad,you are required to do a checklist which consists of setting up reservations and many other things. Meeting and checking-in guest.
bad,"I love my job and the people I work with, but I am always at work. I come in when my kids are getting up, and go home when they are going to bed. This hotel needs a babysitter that I cannot be. I have four kids and need to be able to be with them as well. My two youngest are struggling in school, and I am not there to check home work, make sure its returned to school etc. I do not mind long hours, but not having any time at home is taking its toll on my family which is the reason i work to begin with. The money made is not worth the time away from home."
bad,"Better than most in hospitality in Aberdeen, however has much to be desired from. Lower managment generally ok, however the higher you go the worse. Terrible pay, very little to none advancement possibilities but it's hard to get fired. One would have to try really hard."
bad,"A typical day at work is a wave of rudeness, and appreciation of me as an employee is zero. I learned to greet people in kind and fashionable manner, and prepare  food during the afternoon. with the co-worker there is a sense of team work and comfort. There is nothing that I can think of. The most enjoyable part of this job are the customers that walk into the door each day"
bad,"This company is a very growing opportunity if your looking to grow, the staff and managers are very caring and supportive"
bad,The Marriott is a good place for employment most the the managers that I work for are good at there jobs but they would hire anyone who is not qualified
bad,"- job duties are simple,"
bad,"A typical day starts with me preparing daily reports for the managers. This usually takes about an hour and 15 minutes to complete. After I have ran all necessary reports, I am following up on emails from the previous day and going into the systems to ensure everything is running correctly. I have learned to appreciate the variety of management styles with which I have come in contact. The most complicated part of my job is trying to re-trigger rate plans after they are no longer selling. The issue could be in one place or in multiple places, you never know until you check, check, and double check. I always look forward to our quarterly meetings because they are are always off-site."
bad,"Its ok, It could pay more for the work that is required to be done. fftyfygwsedrt fyguuyui liujo;u rqwerurc rr2rtijtiji4ot [4tjio4tj"
bad,"a typical day at work is mainly answer phone calls booking hotel room giving out information about the hotel, helping guest... I've learned a lot working in the Marriott, such as computer skills, dealing with mad guest coming in the hotel and leaving. how to deal with irate guest, finding any and every solution to satisfy a guest need and being a brilliant host. the management at the Marriott are honestly good people, but could use better management skills. i have very nice coworkers, i get along with every coworker fine. it really isnt any hard part about my job but sometimes it can get a little frustrating when another department haven't really done his or her job because then it makes it harder on my department.the best part is satisfying every guest needs"
bad,Not real organized in the department.  Nobody really had the correct knowledge to help a customer.
bad,"We would take 25-50 calls a day, making reservations and making adjustments to guests accounts. The management at Starwood were good but they were very contradictive to each other. My co-workers were more help than the management. The hardest part was when we would have inappropriate callers call in and management would tell us to push through on the calls. Making peoples dream vacations happen."
bad,Was a great place to work going through some changes as a bartender work is few and far very scares.
bad,"My typical day at work, I correct folio's, I send emails and faxes. I do paper work for any groups we have coming into hotel."
bad,Must adapt to the overall workplace evolution to achieve its social responsibility exigences.
bad,"Overall I enjoyed working at the Towneplace Suites. My coworkers and my managers were fantastic people I really enjoyed being around. Unfortunately, I felt very under trained and wasn't confident in job, therefore it was very stressful for me, especially when I was literally the only employee in the building. No managers, no maintenance, no housekeeping, no security. So anytime anyone needed anything it was up to me. I would have to balance between checking in 10 people at a time, and having to go up to people rooms and clean their bathtubs."
bad,All the staff are very friendly and are willing to lend a helping hand and help you learn how to do the job. Everyone is doing their jobs in an effective and efficient manner.
bad,Its a job for people that know how to do fast pace and don’t mind clean doo doo bleep toilets and dealing with people don’t want you to clean there room for 2 weeks and the done messed up the room and they still want you to clean 45 minutes maximum Also double bed rooms should be at lease some more time and putting time on the sheets is pressure bull. Everybody’s not the same and don’t feel the same so don’t thing your going to get the same action out of people
bad,"it was a franchise."
bad,"as a hostess in the Marriott hotel i was in charge of keeping the guest happy by welcoming them with a smile, most of the customer were rude in that area as well as the staff"
bad,Geen waardering voor je werk & de bodem van het horeca cao als Salaris! Terwijl het management team de ene bonus na de andere krijgt
bad,"The management staff in the hotel was generally easy to work with, but the pay scale is archaic and needs to be fixed on a corporate level or ownership level"
bad,"Company wise is good, salary, benefits, and perks,  management is not fair theres no support for any improvement or another learning aspect.  Raises in a other way.  "
bad,It was an okay place to work. Management was kind of all over the place and no room for advancement. Raises were terrible and I felt really unappreciated. Also my schedule was real all over the place and when addressed they didn't Care about my concerns.
bad,"I enjoyed working for starwood because they were respectful to associates in the beginning, but once they decided to sell the company, thing started to go downhill. People were numbers - easily replaced. As Marriott became more involved in the takeover, things got worse for long term Starwood employees. bonuses became harder to achieve - resulting in a $3 per hour pay cut. First they took our ""regular clients"" away from us, which also resulted in some very unhappy members.Then overtime was cut, and schedules were changed for long term employees to work undesirable shifts, and new people were hired for the desirable shifts. People felt that we were unwanted, and being pushed out."
bad,"I worked as a housekeeper and the work itself was good, just surprisingly physically intense. The problem is the management and/or corporate."
bad,"As far as large Corporate companies go, Marriott certainly isn't the worst. Nor, however, are they the best."
bad,Unhappy with scheduleig and managment often times feel like just a number and not a valued employee. A lot of the time leadership is out meanwhile i am her working.
bad,I would like work more for Marriott with the most difficult i have in this job.. some manager don’t care for you.... the big boss don’t like people have hours ... the boss made about that .... if i write more i can’t finish
bad,Disorganizzazione totale nella gestione delle varie sale.
bad,"to much work fot the amount they pay to the employees, the company does not appreciated the workers , and there's not room for the individuals to grow"
bad,"Пришла устраиваться на работу в эту организацию. Человека на вакансию искали очень срочно, напоминали об этом неоднократно. Собеседование прошло успешно, однако HR и начальнику отдела очень не нравилось, что я задаю вопросы (о ДМС, премиях, сверхурочном времени), о том, что у меня как работника есть право это знать, девушки, видимо, не в курсе. После того, как мы условились о дне моего выхода и я уволилась со старой работы, мне поступил звонок с сообщением о том, что эта вакансия закрылась. Совсем. "
bad,This experience was well at first I don't have an issue with the company itself It would have to be the changing management I had at the time. My original manager was fine
bad,Not really assigned review with the company just we’re looking for a much more better opportunity experience for a better career to advance on a much better management
bad,"Poor Work Culture."
bad,"In this company I really enjoy working for them because I love to do a lot of moving around keeping my self busy.  Worked in defferent department like laundry, kitchen cleaning rooms"
bad,A typical day at work for me is coming in and doing what i need to do to help the customers. I keep a smile on my face and make sure the customers keeps a smile on thiers.
bad,The turnover rate is disgustingly high compared to other places. This is a nice place to work and the people are generally good. But no one stays for long. The job does not do anything to make sure its employees stay where they are when their needs aren't met.
bad,"I have worked for the Marriot Corporation for the past 10 years, most recently at the Portland, OR Waterfront Hotel."
bad,Hours are crazy and i don't care for sales. By the time the training ends half of the new hires are gone.   I would not refer anyone to work for this company.
bad,"made beds an cleared rooms surfaces floors counters tables tubs and mirrors,made mant friends working here got discount on rooms .they had had great hoildays party ,it was hard work but nice people."
bad,I like my job there but I was looking for more hrs. They training every body and teach for specific job. They teach respect and equal opportunities in the job
bad,"The guests are amazing, people love Bend. The property itself is a gem! they spent a lot of time and effort making that place very nice. the owners are great business people. the management company though is having hard time finding a good balance and work flow to organization of roles and requirements that best suite the needs of the hotel of that magnitude."
bad,I was first point of contact with each guest as they entered the hotel. Greeted guests using five second five feet rule. Registering and booking guests in and out of their rooms while accommodating and special requests. Handling all stages of a guests stay as well as giving them the run down of the hotel.
bad,Great place good environment. Just long work hours and the lay is not that great but it's a job. Not enough structure at the job tho but other than that it's good.
bad,"I Have always loved customer service and sales. My love for culinary and food and beverage has led my career so far and I'm looking to advance my career and take it to the next level. Unfortunately Holston Distributing is not working out to be the place id hopped. There are no typical days at work there because the place is in such disarray and management wont give anyone a strait answer and most of the time doesn't know or even care about whats happening with employees.The culture has gone down hill since Sept. and many employees are leaving. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i got to interact with, while the hardest part was the hours but that's kinda of a given and is not an issue."
bad,Forget about a social life and be prepared to work hard however if you want to move up this is the place but you will have to earn it unfortunetly the pay will not catch up.
bad,"As a contractor you had to work long hours in different departments, and how often you were needed depended on the percentage the hotel was filled at. Some weeks had plenty of overtime opportunity but others barely passed 20 hours."
bad,The company is great gives u a lot of opportunity to expand your career if u should further your future with them . It is diverse and has great values about how u need to work in the environment if housekeeping
bad,"Days can be super long doing winter."
bad,"I objective to obtain a full time position as a professional cleaning and Houseperson. and customer service skills. I like my jobs ,listen to the  guest and company polices."
bad,"*I Learned a lot about how hotels work"
bad,"Då vi var underbemannade blev det alltid väldigt stressigt så fort det var mycket folk i restaurangen. Där fanns inte riktigt något samarbete vilket jag är van vid och därför tyckte var jobbigt. "
bad,"16 to 18 rooms, team work is an effort, management not so good, co workers work hard, hard part is saying no when theres tons of rooms, I enjoy getting home safe"
bad,Its very messy there and get into your business too much . And wanted me to chose between school and there jo and I chose school now Im finish.
bad,A typical day at work started off as pleasurable but by the end of the time that I chose to leave it was not. Hence why I chose to move on from the company.
bad,"Not one of my happier experiences, company is franchise which while there ownership was changed twice within a year span. Great location and great guest!"
bad,my day would start with the gathering of the trash when that was complete I would do work orders for various rooms.  when I got work orders done I would start pm'ing rooms
bad,I m a hard worker and i like seen peoples laughing. Sometimes 8 or less than 8 hourses per day. I like helping co-workers if they did not done.
bad,"Tres bonne organisation, bon plan de carriere pour ses employes, assistance sociale tres en place"
bad,This company has very poor hotel management. it results in a strain on employees and they compromise employees safety. they have a high employment turn over rate. and wages are not fair.
bad,"Everybody had a up beat personality and most were very helpfull at times."
bad,"the pay rate is not too attractive, but you get to work by the beach which makes it fun  to come to work. area is really clean and people are nice"
bad,"Welcomed the guests(check-in)"
bad,Grateful I was employed starting at 15. Respectful co workers. No raises or benefits even after years of dedicated work. Overall work environment was not too bad. Learned all departments but could never get raises.
bad,Not up to standards or Westin brand. Do not pay well. Beautiful property away from the strip. Different environment from other hotels.
bad,A typical work day a The Westin Hotel was tough at time but I made it ok for me I learned the pros and cons of being a good housekeeper the management wasn't fair at all to me but that's my opinion my co-worker was good to me we got along great the hardest part of the the jobs was being rushed to do my job the most enjoyable part of my job was getting the job done.
bad,"Really a pretty bad place to work. While my fellow peer employees were absolutely great, the management was just awful. Sales goals were ridiculously high, and if you didnt rreach them you would never hear the end of it."
bad,The Westin Hotel has a great technique that introduces you to the hospitality field. There is a lot of hands on training that consists of constant attention. The Hotel is well- known for the excellent service it provides and the scenery.
bad,"not enough hours"
bad,A typical day at work consist of cleaning 10-25 rooms. This particular location has very poor management and the inability to handle certain situations. The most enjoyably part of this job is my ability to provide great customer service to all guest and our frequent staff parties.
bad,Call people to purchase vacation packages. Only a handfull of bosses care for their team.
bad,"Working as commi1 "
bad,"Lacking in management skills, favoritism, no health insurance min-wage job."
bad,The co-workers and management I had were awesome and very friendly. Just to warn every one the supervisors in this department usually come in to work with a bad mood and can carry through out the day and they love to trash talk about the other employees. Oh and watch out for one of them to give you an eye roll if you ask a simple question or if you ask for something. If you get on their bad side you will be one of the only ones to go back to your previous room to put a simple pen in like they love to do to certain people. Its the only reason I left. That and others got to go home early all the time for petty things but I got told I couldn't leave after all my rooms were done because I had go to my second job so I didn't get fired. Mind you I haven't taken not one day off since I started and never asked to leave early until that one time. There are many that will tell you the same thing about how they act. I hope it all changes after I leave so good luck to you all.
bad,"Productive work environment. Management is very cooperative as far as work schedule.Co-workers are great, but a little catty at times. No room to grow."
bad,"This job was just not for me.. I am glad to say, "" at less I've tried! """
bad,High turnover at my location led to too many changes. No one was ever comfortable because of a new manager every month.
bad,"Enjoyed being a manger for a good team, everyone worked well. As a houekeeper manger I was the one people come to if there were compliants. The team enjoyed working under my guidance."
bad,I was very unhappy at Marriott. There was not a team atmosphere. No one helped anyone. Horrible place to work.
bad,A mi parecer nunca estuve cómoda trabajando en este lugar ya que no estaba desempeñando lo que ami me gusta (la cocina) y por ese motivo estuve solo unos meses trabajando ahí.
bad,It was a relatively easy job. Unfortunately the establishment is not the most productive.
bad,"Learned a lot about Marriott culture and standards. "
bad,"Standard 9-5 job, nice people. Good company. Learned a lot about the hotel and hospitality industry as a whole"
bad,"I´ve learnt so many things about the company, AC Hotels and Marriott"
bad,"Primo cafe is a small business, and that means that there are not an abundance of employees. Things tend to get very personal and drama follows, I left because I appreciate a drama free life."
bad,Giving Customer Services to the members and associate of the hotel and accounting at the fitness area.
bad,"You must be a jack of all trades to work for this company.  Must complete tasks for housekeeping, maintenance, and even cook dinner.  Constantly busy environment where you must adapt to constant changes"
bad,not a good place to work GM dose not give you the tools you need to do your job
bad,A typical day at work is enjoyable. I learned working with others gets my communications skills up. The management sucks. My co workers I don't pay them any attention I just do my job and go home. there is nothing hard at my job that can break me down. The most enjoyable part of my job is working because that's how I provide for my family
bad,"they don't give people enough time to prove themselves,"
bad,"answered multi phone lines, customer service, corrected billing issues,"
bad,"Too many rooms, and too much to do. I have learned how to make a bed very nicely and also how to fold sheets well. Co workers typically work hard and we all just try to help each other make it through each day. Making too many beds is very hard on my back, and having to go back and forth to and from laundry caryying a ton of linen up stairs is hard. I do enjoy laughing with the others about what we may have come across that day."
bad,great people to work with besides the management. o working knowledge of anything other than making employees lives miserable
bad,"At the start of the day we receive paper work of task that need to be done by the end of the shift. The paperwork is usually detailing the manner in which to organize the banquet functions, also maintaining storage area in to ensure safety of co-workers. The things I've learned and will never forget is employees need to be updated and felt appreciated, and if you enjoy your co-workers it makes for a better experience. I would say the hardest part of the job is not being updated whether you've done a good job. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling a part of the team."
bad,Housekeeping superviso / making sure all the guest are taking care of.
bad,learning about fast thinking and quick decision making. working directly with people and provide service
bad,nice in a way i can be more patience dealing with people

bad,Key member of management team for implementation and coordination of a new system of accounting. I also:
bad,"I love the hospitality industry but this job was an example of what I dislike about it. Yes, I got to meet a ton of really interesting people but most of the job was miserable. I was hired on as a front desk receptionist but was immediately forced to fill the night audit position five days a week as well as the bistro. I'm a team player and love to help out where I can but along with working part-time at my other job, I was lacking sleep and was not prepared or warned beforehand of the responsibilities that were about to be laid on me. Along with that, I was the only one in the building working which as a small girl scared me, and also I was lacking the proper training so it was a struggle somewhat to get through the paperwork correctly."
bad,A typical day was early starting at 5am most days to set up the breakfast buffet at this restaurant. Lunch service ran until about 2pm and the breakdown and set up for dinner started. The hours were sometimes tough as the sun often was not up when the work day began.
bad,"Management lacked  management played favoritism, and would not help me when I had issues with another employee. This other employee was bossy, would talk down to me, and upper management did nothing. That is why I quit. I felt uncomfortable."
bad,The guest calling in are rude most of the time. Loyalty care never want you to transfer calls to them and alot of the time you will have to redo a reservation due to system failure.
bad,"They say they love employees but so many policy changes let you know their priority is not people. They only care about money and more money. They are greedy and want you to do more and more. They do not equip you to handle the bigger work load. You are on your own. Used to be great company. Now, not so much"
bad,"I learned how to make same cocktails and preparation about presentations bar job  "
bad,"I was a full time/seasonal employee.  "
bad,I worked on this hotel for many years base on my experience working at the hotel it was not bad at all good benefits and employee's are the best to work too. Friendly environment to work too.
bad,"It's good. They support you for the winter pass and housing but you do not have break while you are working(straight 8 hours) you are asked to leave when it becomes quiet. One of my friend left there because his supervisor was seriously yelling at him."
bad,"Fast paced workplace. From when the hotel opened it was busy creating spreadsheets, implementing new procedures, and setting up new software for payroll."
bad,"This job requires a lot of flexibility when it comes to their training. Too au different ways to get the same thing done. You jus doing things the right way even those others were getting much larger bonuses by padding their numbers and get away with it. "
bad,"A typical day, I open the Am shift, assign the daily room task and conduct Am meetings with associates. Handle the scheduling of activities and assigns the different areas that need to be cleaned, to public areas and House attendant. Verify the payroll for any edits and meet with front desk for priority Guest arrivals. Inspect VIP rooms. The hardest part of the job is running out of supplies. The most enjoyable part of my job is the staff and meeting new people(guest). "

bad,Meeting new people from all over and getting to know them is always great. Springhill works great with their employees and are always willing to work with them.
bad,"I like the job because you can work independently. But I don't like the opportunities and benefits. I've been working their 6 months, I haven't received a raise. Before I put in the extra time off they would work me 7 days without a day off then only give me 2 days off. I could not recouporate from doing 8 rooms a days in 2 days, so I had to request an extra day off."
bad,"Marriott Hotels nice place to started your level, i was working and learn with one the best managers sence a work for Marriott"

bad,"If you aren't their skin color, they will nit pick everything you do! Try to get you fired over little stuff. Discrimination is what I call it!!! Watch out!!"
bad,By far one of the coolest jobs I was ever a part of all though now they went to contracting out for security. When I worked there they hired security agents directly.
bad,Nother applicable. Do not have to much information about the company. Now that it has merged it is not the same. Would like to work at another place and do different type ofor work.
bad,it was a fun place to work. the people were very friendly and co-workers were polite.
bad,"I worked graveyard shift & not much staff around, but the front desk staff I worked with were great we were team players.. I learned the value of ""Respect"" by my co workers & Guests & it meant a lot.. Management wasn't really involved in staff & guest safety, Co -workers we all had to work together as a team to make the business succeed and improve.. Hardest part of my job management not having my back, working with my co workers"
bad,"managers treat not fairly with hourly associate"
bad,"long working hours, strict management, pleasant guests, very clean lobby & dining areas"
bad,"this s a very good company nice to work on it "
bad,"I was training in this hotel ,I was so proud ,this company very good safety and than the people very nice to me ,they teach me many things it's about good staff and good personality,they always care with us"
bad,you come across all types of people and you learn something new from each and every guess that stays at your hotel. the hardest part of the job is when things aren't in order and you get to work to start your shift and you have no work supplies.
bad,"checking in customer at the hotel, making reservation and balancing cash and making sure everything is done on the front desk correctly."
bad,me permitieron a desarrollar el ingles con la ayuda de los supervisores.
bad,"starwood was a great place to be when first starting to work, lots of cultural learning, fun friendships and great staff members. I loved it there, it was great"
bad,I like the job. The job is very easy and the guest's are kind. Its a very clean environment. They also give great benefits and discounts to their employees
good,"I really enjoyed this job. I was under the impression that they wanted to hire me, but at the time the company was going through some changes. I am willing to go back and apply for a job with this company"
good,"you are on the phones 8 hours"
good,Your day was pretty easy work wise. However the owner was mean and disrespectful and management was worse. There was lots of drama due to management being really immature.
good,Good company but expectations not what they say they are. Work life and personal balance are as unfair as unfair can be. Pay is nothing for the work you do.
good,The manager was very unprofessional and not very nice at all she treated me poorly made me redo rooms that were more than up to par.  Its a nice place management just not good
good,"The owners are new to the Marriott business and do not know how to run the hotel. The management went against the owners, causing friction. Management did not support the staff. Very hectic and stressful environment. Supposed need to prove capabilities of advancement, but continue to give more goals to meet to prove oneself. Therefore, they give the feeling of being taken advantage of."
good,Worked here over a year loved my job just not the managment or head house keeper! Very nice hotel recently built. The rooms are nice size and easy to keep clean.
good,"This was the old location, so maybe things have changed. Management was horrible, they could care less about you having a personal life, pay was horrible, and no benefits even though you worked between 30-32 hours."
good,You can bust your butt for this company and they dont appreciate anything you do for them. They cut your hours and keep you from making the money promised.. They underpay you and overwork you when they feel like it. This job is enjoyable on a slow and easy day other than that its hell. Co-workers at this place are like a bunch of high school kids. And management does nothing when problems are reported. I learned to never work for this company again.
good,Employees were treated with very little dignity and respect. People in management typically looked out for themselves. Very dis organized on the daily basis. Housekeepers were payed the least but are the one's that keep the hotel running/ without room turn overs there is no business.
good,"As a night audit, my job was to come and balance all revenue that was created during that business day. Revenue had to balance in order for the next business day to occurr. I learned a great deal about accountint and how the hotel world works since auditing had a hand in everything that went on. Hardest part about this job was working overnight, which caused sleep deprivation due to me never getting a timely sleep schedule."
good,Was an ok job. Had a lot of problems with the management. Long hours. No support from anyone of the managers.  Hardly had time for lunch. Customers were more supportive than manager's.
good,"the Area has many restaurants, movie theatre and a mall, ithe work environment was great, I worked at the hotel for about 2 years, it was my first hotel job."
good,"como todo, hotel  se trabaja bajo presión es necesario mas evaluación de parte del hotel."
good,a typical day a work in St Pierre would be clock into work and get on with the day. there would always be cleaning to do and glasses or wash. 
good,"(1)	No job security"
good,"Good job. Good environment. Good coworkers. Good place. Everything good except no benefits at all. "
good,"The company was all for cleanliness of the suites. They had less interests for the employees. Working longs hours much of the time, and the pay was not good."
good,"I was prep cook ,and was only working part time and needed full time employment, they offered positions like stocking the coolers and cleaning stock room, such as rotateing the cases."
good,"paperwork all night"
good,i loved my job and working with the customers as well as some of the employees actually had some really good friendships built inside the company however there were some incidents with some of the workers that had been there for a few years i felt it wasnt safe working there. Twice two different occasions i had one of the employees in my face screaming and threatening me which i was warned when i was in training that that is how they get people to quit if they personally do not care for you.
good,Not much job advancement opportunities. Management was discriminated.Staff was afraid to report management. Corporate office did not do much to protect staff.
good,Must be good with guests and be able to deal with lack of management.
good,"few co workers were nice"
good,Cleaning rooms helping other coworkerswith their rooms if needed and laundry.
good,to many people involed in things ie....heads of departments giving jobs out when they should not
good,"The hotel was the worse place to be employed for. The management was horrible there is no communcation between anybody. I had to travel about 30 mins to work a day and than pay a 10 dollar parking fee every day that I worked, they didnt offer there employees free parking."
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar pero poca paga por mucho trabajo , estresante, dan largas a todo..."
good,Job is not meant for women and men with families. Not a family friendly environment. The Quarterly work schedule changes were challenging. Company was not accommodating
good,"Not many staff to cover shifts. Mangement needs a lot of work in house. No teamwork is put in working there."
good,"If you are the last one cleaning rooms your coworkers will come to help you finish the rest of them, but you get treated poorly for it. Also $9/hr which isnt enough for some of the stuff you see in those rooms. Greatful for the experience for sure, but marriott could afford to pay better especially when rooms are $150+ a night for guests."
good,marriott isn't a bad company to work for its just this hotel and the executive committee. the leadership doesn't care about fostering a team work environment or creating a support system for middle management to grow and advance.
good,She has favored she choose who she like and she use a big smile to believe her that she like you but she like her own people as I always try to do my best she always put you down treat in people like you are stupid they don’t no how to talk to they employees every day I was coming home stressed though that I never do a good job is sad no to be appreciated..they only good manager there is the night shift manager very understanding and helpful guy..
good,"clean the hotel room. very hard, pay not good. you must work at the weekend. it's a Seasonal job. you must finish 16 rooms a day. in the summer, you have to work 5.5 days, but in the winter, you no work a month."
good,The management is very poor here. The turnover is super high. The salary is terrible. The co-workers all have bad attitudes. No-one will work together as a team.
good,"When I was hired, I was told I could be full time in 6 months. Then I was told there was no possible way they could put me full time even though I replaced someone that worked there full time and I had more responsibilities as well. After I was hired, there were more part time hires for my position, which means that they could of put me full time but they didn't want to pay benefits for me as a full time employee."
good,The guests are demanding and your job is constantly on the line from guests surveys. Their voice makes a huge impact on your hotel's overall success making it difficult to advance.
good,"I would go to work, started in the laundry room helping fold laundry. I would then take the laundry what I would need for the morning to fill up my  housekeeping cart for the rooms.  I would stock it with supplies needed for the rooms.  I would then go to the rooms I was assigned, start each room one at a time, with taking all soiled bedding, towels, and trash out.  I would then go in and dust, wipe down everything. I then would go in and clean the bathroom, the mirrors, shower curtain, everything.  After everything was clean I’d bring in new linen.  I’d re-stock the bathroom with linen, make the beds, and restock all condiments.  I’d then mop the bathroom floor, vacuum and check to make sure I didn’t miss anything and then go onto the next room.  Here we did one room at a time, as like La Quinta cleaned out all dirty rooms first then went back in to clean.  I felt doing one room at a time took longer because you would have to make numerous trips to the laundry room.  The rooms had to be done in 20 minutes or Less, so doing them one at a time was time consuming, but ok to do it that way."
good,All about the costs and customers. They don't care about the staff. Manager will never have your back. The opportunities are not for the best qualify person. They chase you for small mistakes.
good,"The work atmosphere was terrible. Immediate Manager never backed you up. I was very please to find another job and leave. I know that others there in other departments were fine. The pay was terrible, but it was right after the recession."
good,and the truth be told a GM whos uncaring crooked thinks too much of himself a head housekeeper whos unprofessional and unfair and dishonest what a pair
good,"The job has inconsistent hours and shifts. I summarized ""the job severed its purpose"" because it was acceptable when I was in college, however; now that I've graduate and have to live on my own this job does not provide the salary to do so. It happens every off season until the temperature warms up then there's more hours available. I'm honestly looking for more stability and consistency. Also the pay is low."
good,It is a club and they don't want you.  The culture for non lifetime Marriott people can be exclusive and the willingness to share information is not easily come by.
good,"Management showed facial bias. I have nearly 2 decades in the hospitality industry ,nearly half in a management capacity, but was constantly over looked , for Latin  employees."
good,"It is a lot of hard work, but at the same time I got to manage my time eficiently. You can get the chance to grow in the company and you have acess to a lot of information that can be usefull if you want to have a career in hospitality."
good,"all dusties performed as a housekeeper. striping the room of trash and linen, an eye sweep under all beds and furniture. disinfecting all restroom and surface, dusting all furniture and also sweeping, MOPPING and vacuuming rooms. REplace all clean linen and amentie back inth room."
good,"I loved my job, I only left due to a medical emergency. It was a great experience working there. The staff was very supportive of each other, and if you ever needed a co-workers assistance, you knew you could count on them."
good,It was very difficult to move up as far as position goes. Management wasn't organized. Fellow housekeepers held up the morale which made the job better
good,A typical day is pretty slow with the exception of rush hours. A lot of multi-tasking and dealing with guests and all departments of the hotel. Co-workers and management are unprofessional making the workplace unenjoyable.
good,"It starts out great. They tell you how ""they are throwing money at you,"" but what happens is you begin to lose your sanity and they change your stats when you start getting close to getting bonuses. Give me a goal at the beginning of the month and stick to it. Don't raise it when I am àbout to achieve it. Now they are resorting to sign on bonuses"
good,"working with Courtyard Marriott was a steady pace work environment,Great Customer service but poor Management Skills a typical day at is 4 a.m. till 12 noon normally five days a week. I learned to be more humble if I decide to obtain a management position. the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers"
good,"I got this job when I got out of program to help me pay my rent at the sober living. I only worked there a couple of months. This job really was not my cup of tea, it was about survival."
good,"Load dish wisher, sweep and mop floors. Followed cleaning schedules and perform cleaning duties as scheduled. Assisted in receiving and storing food supply."
good,Worst place for people of color to work!!!! If you are not a white person or  a graduate of USM you will never NEVER advance in you career there.
good,"I'm sure that Marriott is a great place to work at. Where I worked at though, the managers were not very professional. The general manager would slam  her door when she was mad and wouldn't talk to you for weeks if she was mad at you. She would talk about employees negatively behind their backs to other employees and would literally make people want to quit. The hire/quit ratio was horrible as not many people would stick around for very long. It was understaffed and the sole front desk associate was responsible for everything at night as there wasn't whole lot of help to run stuff up to rooms and such."
good,"The most disappointing career move I have made. Marriott had no involvement with my hotel, Interstate also an over-hyped company bowed to the pressure of the owners. In six months, the entire Executive Committee left except the dim bulb GM and the even dimmer HR Director. ""Yes"" people with no creativity, no insight, no ""big -picture"" viewpoints reigned at my Four Diamond Marriott. Maybe Marriott should take a greater role on the management companies that run their brand, and the owners whose only goal is revenue at all cost."
good,"Experienced the day to day workings of the 2nd largest hotel in downtown Cleveland.  Gained knowledge of Lightspeed, reservation software.  I truly enjoy helping the guests with concierge questions and insuring that their stay is superb."
good,"Everyday was something different, I think the management could of been more understanding then thinking of more of themselves. my co-workers some could of done better, but them had the ones that actually worked. The most enjoyable part of the job was i was able to  work on my own with out anyone in my way."
good,This was a part time job to help with the family finances until I could get a job in the Medical Billing field.
good,"Employer only cares about their sales goals. No personal life. work, work and work."
good,"My days vary from day to working in a variety roles under the Front Office/Rooms:"
good,"As an hourly waged bottom of the todem pole dishwasher. My life was not at all glamourous working here. The supervirsor cussed me out in front fellow employees. This is a tough position to work because you are always wet, and must move at fast pace sometimes the dishes pile up so fast you'll think it's the great wall of china."
good,Horribly structured management and work ethic. management didn't follow/enforce the Marriott guidelines for appearance and dress.
good,I enjoyed my immediate co-workers. They have special gifts and talents that made the guests feel extra special. The hotel added a service charge and that was probably the biggest challenge with keeping the guests happy. They did not like an automatic fee imposed on their bill at check out. I learned to be more proactive and seeking out business by attending marketing events and self promoting the business.
good,"It is an awesome company , Management has poor managing team member"
good,I've been here for eight years and have seen the changing of the guard at least 4 times at the CEO level - it has gotten progressively worse.
good,Not too happy. The Hotel is beautifull but the income it is too low compare with the responsability that we have.
good,it was fun to a certain extent i liked working there but didnt love it so i moved on to find a better position with a higher paying company
good,a typical day at work is all FAVORTISM thats all i have to say if you get hired there you will see the shady politics especially in the Loss Prevention dept. mainly in the managment department .People in other departments are great to work with very nice people had met alot of good people .
good,Too much family relation ships going on in there. a lot of work bad pay.
good,The owner needs to give better salaries. I enjoy the people I work with in housekeeping.
good,"Once training is over you are expected to answer the phones and know the answers customers are asking however what they teach in training is in no way close to actual calls from customers calling in. There are so many different situations that arise that are not taught or even touched upon in training. They promote CUSTOMER SERVICE in training when in actuality they want numbers when you are on the floor, they want you off the phone asap,if the customer does not ask for any discount you are not supposed to help them find a good deal. Which is so not fair. They exercise that it is up to the customer to ask for a discount, but if I as a customer service rep knows of a discount why should I not help them find it. In Starwood's eyes it takes too long"
good,Starwood hotels is a terrible place to work if you are working a reservation center. They micro-manage and cheat you out of commissions. Don't ever work at this place. The turnover is extremly high and they are always hiring. Tells you something don't it??
good,"I enjoyed working at these places and I did what was expected of me. I am very easy to get along with and easy going but there was no incentives to make me want to stay. I feel that I am a very hard worker and whenever there were callouts I went in and worked when needed. But there were never any ""Thank you for coming in"" or ""You did a good job today"". I would like to say that I enjoyed very much working at Westgate Manor the most. The manager that works there was always there to help me if needed. I also got attached to some of the residents there."
good,"I enjoyed working there. If you're looking for advancement, don't work for a small property. Benefits were ok."
good,"Awesome people to work with. Culture is great but certain management is not cool."
good,"My overall experience with the Marriott was very nice; I got to work with great people and learn about the hotel business. However, the pay is not good enough and wish it was higher and also the hours get cut all the time and we get 4/5 hours a day. My last check was $487 I was cut hours and it’s not fair and unexpected."
good,In the Hotel business there are a lot of hours and very low hourly pay. You survive on the tip money you make. Most Hotels are poorly managed with a very high turnover rate.
good,While working at the Marriott I feel as if they didn't take the time to really train me as well . They were having some major management changes and didn't take the time to properly train me on my duties .
good,Job is alright but the attendence policy is not lenient at all! They usually don't take excuses even if medically related. The pay was good but their policies aren't written clearly so you can get fired easily.
good,There was very little collaboration or support from anyone at the Marriott Burbank Airport.  The hotel operations manager was clueless and had no leadership skills.  The director of sales and the director of catering harbor a we know everything and you know nothing so just deal with the fact that we are jerks attitude.  There are members of the team that have been working at the property too long therefore they manipulate every situation to benefit them. If they don't get their way then they trump up stories to get you called into human resources and fired.  I would not recommend working for the Marriott Burbank Airport to anyone unless you like to be abused.
good,this place is full of amazing people you have to be ready to pretty much just sit there but the only issue i has is their systems didnt pick up that i was clocked in and working
good,General Manager was clueless and lied about being promoted and a raise. Had his favorite employees. Sat in his office ALOT. Was useless behind the desk
good,"This has been the worst experience. I believe it is the management style, low salary and possibly location woes. Poor communication with team and as a woman I had to pull teeth dealing with location manager"
good,"Although pay is fair, it will be expected of you"
good,"The culture shift after Mr Marriott stepped down is more towards your typical faceless corporate atmosphere instead of the large family organization it once was. The pay scales are set for you to move on to another position after a year; however, they make it next to impossible to do so. This leads to pennies raises after the initial year."
good,Work life balance is not reality. Being able to work remotely helps but the salary does not match the workload..............................................
good,There is no direction and the guest do not come first. This company has a reputation for guest satisfaction. Remington is not the company for this. The service scores are horrible and the staff is not given the proper tools or support to remedy this problem.
good,"The hardest part of the job was ensuring the entire hotel was cleaned from the inside out; however, the amount of tasks needing to be complete was unrealistic for one shift to complete. Instead of dividing up the tasks between 3 shifts, all 3 shifts went over the same things."
good,"It was an extremely easy job, the problem is my manager never communicated with the staff so things were never done correctly. The assistant manager was horrible, she made the job very stressful, which really affected staff morale in a negative way."
good,"Expect to work extra hard and extra hours at times with no break.  Alot of time on your feet and very hard work. But satisfying job if you don't work every day. Sometimes you are asked to work in other areas of the hotel.. laundry, housekeeping,bar,shuttle driver, etc."
good,"can be very fast paced but as long as you have a positive attitude and focus on the task at hand you should be fine."
good,Work pace is fast paced and stressful.  Training is not well coordinated.  Compensation does not reflect the effort required.  Management not well trained.
good,It was okay cool little experience I learned a lot honestly it was a different experience I actually enjoyed it an good  ways and some difficult good and bad
good,Benefits were good and the time off was descent but required to work way to many hours with no support. Being able to take time off was far and few with short staff. The Marriott company is a great company but this property was very taxing
good,"As hard as I would try and as well as I would do, Marriott just doesn't want to pay anyone what they are worth. If you are a high school student or have no education, this is the place for you. If you are looking to be rewarded for hard work, look elsewhere."
good,The marriott company is nice but this hotel is horrible to work for. The upper managment is extremely hard to work with. Everyone is micromanaged. They do not get funding for anything in the kitchen.
good,"Good culture and work place, with 100% positive attitude, great atmosphere and attractive customer service skills.Need to learn every thing about customer service and should have knowledge about our surroundings."
good,I hate working here it is the worst place i have ever worked the management doesnt know what there doing. Im just a supervisor and because of the managers no one listens to me and they allow them to scream at me and they just sit there like oh well pretty much.
good,I choose to NOT share this information!   It is not information that needs to be shared.  I worked remotely and was in a TEMP to hire position.  This position may still be come permanent.
good,"Started my career with this company at INR 10,000 CTC. and worked for more than 12-14 Hrs in a day at front desk."
good,Beautiful place to work. Co workers are great. Management sucks. Very drama filled place. Managers not professional. No advancement for veteran employees
good,They wanted you to be someone you were not. All of the mangers we're never on the same page. One would tell you do do it one way then another would tell you a different way but at the end of the day they were mad because one of then did not get done what they wanted.
good,"There was no work-life balance whatsoever. Hours are long and tedious, but work colleagues made it bearable. Managers are task masters and new recruits are heavily reprimanded for a task done wrong. Salary is extremely low and overall promotion rate is low as well."
good,the work environment was of a high school. A lot of ppl there spend their time gossiping and not working. A lot of stereotyping and prejudices people.
good,The office where I worked was difficult due to the manager.  It was stressful and a negative work environment at times.  I was not always given the proper tools needed to do my duties.
good,"Het is jammer dat er geen toeslagen zijn. Tevens krijg je geen uren contracten en moet je afwachten hoeveel uur je per week krijgt. Wanneer je vraagt om meer werk, krijg je dit niet maar er wordt wel van je verwacht dat je ieder weekend komt werken en de rest van de week paraat staat. Erg jammer."
good,"Go in fill amenities,do laundry ( pool/gym towels ) clean, vacuum, & polish elevators, light fire pit or bbq grill,mop floors clean everything guest see,plus help guest with needs/request to feel more at home. More about hospitality. Management was ok, mainly worked independent & didn't see management a lot. I got along with all my co-workers. Sometimes harsh weather,working outside. I'm a people person & enjoyed working with co-workers & helping / meeting guest, so all of my job."
good,"Promptly respond to all inquiries."
good,dinner theatre at its best. take branson and make it slightly worse. no one really enjoys the job and the area is dull. generally the happiest days of the week are the days when there is no work.
good,i work well with others so being able to work in a hotel to give my hospitality service to good use and make sure the guest are happy and comfortable
good,Not a bad job as long as you can make reservations.  If you can't then they will find way for you to leave. You must hit your quota if not good bye! Management picks their favorites and they will make sure they get what they want no matter what.
good,"ein  Betrieb mit Fokus auf die Gewinne, kein gesundes Arbeitsklima, sehr darauf bedacht die Starwood-Richtlinen durch zu setzten. Betriebsrat und Magnament arbeiten gegeneinander."
good,"As a guest service agent I was able to communicate with guests in regards to solving room issues as well resolving them. I was responsible for opening the morning shift and preparing a list of vacant ready and dirty rooms for housekeeping and maintenance. I checked out  guests and updated room information in the computer system, as well as prepare end of the month reports. When my shift was done, I would close it manually in the system and count out my safety deposit for the day."
good,Just don't work there. If you want to work with racist people than this would be the perfect place for you. While working there (one year and one month) there were three robberies. enough said
good,"I enjoyed working for The Towne Place Suites at first, although it was not owned by Marriott it just had the franchise name attached to it. This particular hotel was owned by CSL corporation, they seemed to switch mangers after a year of me being there. The first manager was great and I loved the way she handled herself and everything she did for her employees. I liked when I  cleaned the guest rooms as they check in and out. Their faces would be priceless on how clean someone could get their rooms. My managers never had any complaints about me and they loved how fresh my rooms would smell after I finished cleaning them."
good,"Baywood hotels are nice hotels for staying, but not for working. The management doesn't care about the employees. There isn't much room for advancement or mistakes. If you aren't trained properly when you re first hired, they won't take the time to help you to learn the things that you don't know. There is a lot of favoritism between the management and the employees that they like."
good,"there is a lot of drama in some of the departments in this place, and the new general manager seems to pick and choose. They claim an open door policy, but very few managers actually follow it, unless you want to spread stories about others."
good,This Marriotts was  a franchise so all the perks and employment was not up to par with the Marriott International.  The hotel was a very nice and convenient establishment.  The location was centrally in a nice part of town with easy access to mass transit.  The hardest part of the job was standing all day with little or no breaks.  The most enjoyable part was I was on my own.
good,"Check on that days  parties and banquets, check on production numbers, inventory and my par levels, also on pop ups, helping out on am production lists. what in enjoy is the menu changes, and showing the chef new things that can be placed on the menu."
good,"The culture of the company has changed over the years.  The field is great to work with and has a wealth of knowledge.  However, the corporate side does not provide for advancement and opportunity internally."
good,"Productive hard work enviroment.Strong Security Premises,"
good,"day can be busy or can be slow, employees are great and supportive of the supervisors and work really well together. Hardest job is time for other supervisors to get there work done on one computer. most enjoyable is being able to create my cocktails and make menus and tastings."
good,"A typical day of work, you easily received support from your coworkers, team work is usually done. Very demand-able physical work for a housekeeper."
good,"the hardest part of the job is not knowing if you are going to be fired at any given time no matter how well u do. you see seemingly excellent employees either quitting cause they cant get promotions or being let go for reasons i dont know.  u just walk around thinking u could b next.  lot of pressure added to an already labor intensive and detail oriented line of work."
good,"This job was not enjoyable and often created a lot of stress for me, and i often left with a headache."
good,"If my memory serves me right, I believe that this hotel had 5 different managers within 5 years.  There was bad communication between management and associates, and lots of times even between the people within the management positions."
good,"Ok place to work"
good,"Loader operatetor ,  help forman with crew. In charge of dump trucks."
good,"it is a nice team, but you only work part time hours as a full time employee."
good,"Marriott was an ideal job for me because of my customer service experience. I was pregnant at the time but training went great. However, after my c-section i couldn't return to work after the six weeks and Marriott refused to give me more time off becasue I had been there less than a year. Needless to say, I lost the job and became an unemployed stay at home mother. After learnin about J.W. Marriott's standars, I was disappointed at how the Marriott Company treated me as an employee."
good,"providing customers with quality care always seemed to be the number one goal at marriot, but always seemed difficult with managment not giving you (the employee) room to make your own decisions when the time came, it always seemed that what you (the employee) did was wrong."
good,did laundry all eight hours could not laugh or have fun at this job
good,"A typical day at Starwood was very busy putting owners on their Dream Vacation which was the most exciting part of the job. The hardest thing about the job was letting an owner down when there was no vacancy during their time of travel, although there was times we could play with dates as well as location. There were alot of Supervisors passing out new rules, guidelines, procedures but not alot of knowledge."
good,"I would say that there are ups and downs in every place. But stay clear of Opryland. Forced culture. Stress levels trickle down to the staff from management. Also, racism amongst the employees. Sad in this day and age."
good,"I’ve been working here for quite a while and it’s always been so chaotic during events and there’s always something that goes wrong whether it’s the kitchen not preparing enough food, or the management not setting up the event properly.  Also the back of house where the coffee is prepared is pretty disgusting."
good,"In my location, unless you're hispanic or a manager, you'll most likely be excluded and treated poorly by everyone else. They mess with your checks and never have your back, even when a guest/other employee is wrong. I was excited for this job, but they ruined it for me. I've never hated working at a job so much."
good,"I was hired under the impression that this was only for the position of 1 property, came to find out it was for 2. Had I known this I would not have left my previous job or would have asked for better pay. I was not trained properly and struggled a lot of the time with little to no help and was frequently scolded for not completing tasks that I had no course of training or knowledge of. The properties went through 5 GMs in less than 2 years and there was no structure at all. The only good part of both properties was the line-level staff being easy to get along with and no extracurricular drama outside of the actual work-related business."
good,It was ok but hire the wrong people to manage and they show favoritism. I had to report them to equal employment opportunity. I loved it in the beginning.
good,Job wasn't difficult but organization was extremely poor. Wasn't able to get job done because lack of supplies to do job. Not enough employees for job. High turnover.
good,"The job was exhausting, couldn't walk the next morning (and i am used to physical work). Supervisors doesn't care about anything, unless they need something. Same story with the management, 2 out of 5 people was nice. While working there, it was the lowest point of my life, felt like a slave every day. Always need to follow and write down my hours, always had problems at the end of the month. Wouldn't recommend this job to anyone, unless you need a job straight away. They would hire anyone, because no one wants to work for them. Lunch 9 out of 10 times was horrible, everything tastes like it was made a week ago. If you are reading this, please don't apply there. I know you can find a better job."
good,"Salaried employees are required to work a minimum of 50 hours per week, and the norm was for employees to work closer to 60+. Management quality varies based on which manager you work under. Some are very passionate, others are only focused on politics and self-success. Overall this disconnect leads to a lot of difficulty for hourly workers and customer satisfaction."
good,"There was a lot of competition within this role and people watching their backs.  This is strange, because the training was good and really focused on the need for teams."
good,I really enjoy working with my coworkers they make working a low end job much better. Employee appreciation week helps as do the monthly luncheons. Need better management
good,my experience working with them was awful. I had met the housekeeping supervisor and the first two days was ok cause i was in training and after that i would miss something and she started to use profanity at me and i tried to tell the hotel assistant manager and the hotel manager and they said that they would talk to her but they have talked to her alright but they really didnt do anything about it and it kept on happening and in my experience being a housekeeper and from watching housekeeping supervisor she does not need to be a supervisor and she was unprofessional
good,"The Managment is horrible at Tampa waterside Marriott! Nothing gets done, you have to ask ask and ask and  if you do it yourself you get ridiculed!! Written up for anything you do that didn’t come from Managment.  You work your butt off and never get days off you want. The kitchen is terrible !!! They like to have 5 different  outlets coming out of 1 kitchen and doesn’t make any sense !!!!!! You wait for hours at a time for food and the customers yell at you every shift !!!!! The turnover for Managment is very high. New manager every 3 months l!!!!  But. The company Marriott is great. Just terrible Managment at waterside Tampa. Great example. When is the restaraunt going to open ???? It’s been a year"
good,"I worked for Marriott for two years in the bistro. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and dealing with so many diverse people from all around the world. The time at this job was a great experience for me. The management was great. I have no complaints other that"
good,While I do remember this being a great job it was a previous company who owned the hotel. I only worked a few months under the new management so I do not feel comfortable rating this company. The previous company was the Radisson Hotel and during the time of my employment there were many department management turnovers so again I would not feel comfortable reviewing these companies during that transitional time.
good,"When you don’t have the right Management running a hotel, things go wrong. Do know there is no  Union. There let you go for the color of your shoes and H.R doesn’t work for you. Only thing that I love bout this job was meeting different people. Georgia laws are very different."
good,"Set up station, help PRN, host/assist servers, close station"
good,"PPM's and a 65 point check list and any remedial work for the hotel rooms. This included air con maintenance of filters and biocide for the condensate tray. Water temperature checks, Replacement of faulty actuators for failed temperature checks in the air con system. Sterilization of shower heads for legionela control. Tile grouting, silicon replacement, cistern repair replacement and any other plumbing issues. Patch repair on walls and ceiling and painting. Also weekly  backwash of swimming pool filtration  machinery and purging of infrequently used water outlets. I also effected any repair/replacement of the bed and furniture."
good,Love working for the company.  Was alot dislikes between housekeepers hard work and no way move up in ranks. Lazy people that came up with excuses that they couldn't work. Management was ok.
good,"It is a 9-5 job.  The workload is overwhelming.  The culture company wide is putting people first. There is a culture within departments, so you have to adjust. Volunteer opportunities are great, because you get the opportunity meet people in other departments and do good work."
good,Fun place to work with a homey atmosphere and wonderful staff. Management unfortunately is never on one accord but other than that a great place to work.
good,Very stressful and really hard to get days off without vacation time. Good pay but you get threatened a lot over small things which makes it harder to want to stay.
good,"This review doesn't reflect on all Marriott hotels, just specifically the one I worked at. I didn't like how management at my property chose to run the hotel. There were certain things promised in the interview and hiring process that were never fulfilled, which is what lead to my departure ultimately."
good,"Initially, I was part of the set-up team that prepped the hotel for its grand opening. After becoming a Houseman, I was not promoted to a Desk Clerk position, after being told by management that I would be able to cross-train.  During the set-up period, I was told that I would get two 15-minute breaks per shift and one 30-minute break per shift.  This never occured. In fact, I was reprimanded for taking short, 5-minute breaks during my shifts."
good,every year they pile more work duties and responsibility but won't pay you more.   They want me to train but refuse to give me the .75 extra cents an hour to actually do it.  They do not care about you.  just shut up and do the job
good,"could have better people at the top of the chain but other than that, i like the hours, money, benefits, etc. really good for somebody who doesnt like change."
good,This place was very unorganized.  I had at least 4 different bosses in my time there. They dont treat their employees right and did not care about thr employees home life.
good,"It was like putting new wine in old skin.  The building was old and always had building issues.  The HVAC system never worked properly, customer were always complaining."
good,"Themariott is a great plac to work, you have to be dedicated abd hardworking. If your looking to get more than 40 hours a week youll def. get it there."
good,"Marriott International overall is a great employer, however, every property has a different atmosphere and work ethic. This property being the worst by far."
good,Marriott it self is a great company but the manager and management company were not professional. The turn over rate at the Residence Inn was 86%. I have worked at hotels in the past but this was the highest turner over rate I have seen. Mostly because of the general manager.
good,I learned a lot working for The Westin Prince Hotel.  I made friends there but not too many.  The people were somewhat friendly but not many.  Not too many people were too happy with management.
good,"must be able to balance life and home life while working. must be able to work at a fast pace with small mistakes, must be able to show progression inside the company with-in a week."
good,I was there for 2weeks to get working experience in England after arriving from south Africa fun environment to work at but a lot of time on your feet
good,the people you work with are great. but can have the potential to be distracting. not enough hours. the pay wasn't great. I didn't like that the hours are not consistent.
good,"Typical call center: you're a number, not a name. Change happens suddenly. The email team was dissolved and all agents converted to voice calls.  Management tried to downplay the change as ""optional"" until it suddenly wasn't.  Any objections went unheard."
good,At the time of employment here I experienced working in hazardous condition due to hotel renovation. Human Resource and Management team had no compassion for their employees.
good,I liked working here but there are some major flaws.  The pay is very low.  The scheduling is extremely inconsistent and they don't require all employees to carry there own weight.
good,The hotel in itself is a fast pace and quick thinking place. We must stay vigilant and ready to go at all times. We also must be able to lift boxes up to 55 pounds.
good,"No era un ambiente de trabajo saludable, mucha presión sin necesidad de una."
good,"My day at work was okay but management is horrible. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, they were a highlight to my day. I have learned a lot since this was my first hotel job."
good,"You could say this was a decent job to get started in the area, but the perks aren't nearly as good as some of the other companies around, and they care a lot more about money then they will about you. You'll do well if you're let into the clique, but otherwise you'll find yourself up against some unfair situations."
good,"I love my job in this hotel,good hotel but management  also nice,food and working place are very nice .any time hotel was buzzy so that working time has gone easily"
good,There is a serious boys club here. They are highly favored over the women. Women get tasseled and roughed up psychologically here.
good,"Great property, not great management.  This is a lovely hotel, but it is very difficult to advance and there is very high turnover (even for thew hotel industry)."
good,"The Westin hotel was a good place to work for. The fellow cooks were an awesome crew. But the executive chef had to be the worst chef i have ever worked for she was messy, unsanitary, a procrastinator, and she didnt know how to run a line properly she would panic if it got to busy. hands down the worst chef I've worked for."
good,"harassment is off the charts in company. boring after you know everything, they wont teach you more unless you just teach yourself with you tube, no one try's to motivate you. management is horrible everyone just comes in and leaves as soon as they get a chance."
good,"Your not heard by the management or human resources at the property. No advancement opportunities. Good Pay though"
good,Working with Marriott was definitely an experience. I worked the grave yard shift as a Night Auditor.The best part of this job was meeting and greeting the guest and getting to know them.
good,Very poor management. They do not really pay attention to you as an employee. Training is very quick and not very thourough. Co-workers were very nice and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job was staying positive with disgruntled guests. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting positive feedback from a satisfied guest.
good,"bon accueil"
good,The breakfast staff I worked with were great but management has it's issues. I tried to apply for a position outside of my department and I was told that I couldn't cross train between breakfast and front desk that it was against Marriott standards. So when a position opened up in my department such as a management position I inquired my manager about it and I was told that they probably wouldn't hire a manager and if they did that they would have one of the front desk people be our new manager. I was furious because of the fact i was told I couldn't cross train but a front desk person could cross train and be our new manager for breakfast. Would not suggest working here unless you can handle the shame of poor management
good,"My typical day start at 8:00am and ending at 10:pm 14 hours a day 6 days a week. "
good,working at this property had been the best experience i can take to any other job. The skills acquired here can never be replaced and the great values that Marriott has are good steeping stones to always look for advancement. I have appropriately graded my review due to the fact my cultural environment provided by my managers has shown me i need to find advancements to other opportunity's and so im now seeking another journey to add to my experience.
good,"I like working here do to having the ability to network with guest from all over the world. Having the ability to gain business professional skills such as learning the FOSSE system, data entry, computer skills and proper communication skills."
good,I would answer incoming calls to make reservations for hotel chain. I enjoyed working on the phone and getting the opportunity to talk to many different people with different backgrounds. That made the job very interesting
good,"The day was fast pace, enjoyable, and fun co-workers to be around. The management was not really in charge it seemed like and everyone was doing their duties but without guidance."
good,"It's a very busy place steady work the management does a very poor job of managing and teaching,too much favoritism in advancement,pay doesn't fit the amount of work and profit we produce"
good,Nice hotel & convention center. Fun place to work in a great location. Every day is different. Great staff! Free lunch daily.
good,"Working at a Courtyard by Marriott was not a regular work day for a host at the restaurant located inside the hotel, my co-workers are lazy and unhelpful, selfish and argumentative.The management team is like working with high school classmates with power and authority over you. The hardest part about the job was not knowing what exactly what I was suppose to do, every other day I was doing things i felt was not in my job description and was denied to see my job description when asked. I enjoy the job because of the customers, every day was like challenging myself to make someone else's day a little better."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the managers lack of ability to create a team or family-like environment. There is more drama than structure, in my opinion."
good,Le Meridien has various property across the world and they provide their branch operations based on certain criteria. So the quality of different branch are not consistent.
good,At this particular location they can use better management with better work ethics. My co-workers are very nice and does a very good job of cleaning rooms and give excellent customer service.
good,".trabajo tranquilo"
good,However return rate of employees is not high and it is extremely difficult for advancement within the company. People look down upon others
good,"I love almost everything about this company. The management was laid back and mostly helpful. "
good,Ok company to work for there are some pros and some cons as with every company.  No benefits and low pay.
good,"Great & Clean Environment"
good,Great to meet new people and loved the rooms.Co workers were all great. Had bad management in 2006. Made Great money for a morning Server.
good,"Marriott is a great place but the brand I was working at is not. There weren't enough positions for me to switch to. I wasnt able to find a position that I felt was right for me. I worked in the kitchen and there wasnt enough employee's. There was only morning shift where I have to get up at 4AM or the night shift where I would be getting off work at 1AM. Just wasnt flexable enough for me. "
good,I worked night audit which was different. I learned a lot about business.
good,"I loved meeting new people and the conventions were nice. I learned great decorating skills for special events. Management had a high turn over and the managers weren't that great. Managers needed more experience and people skills. Timing for food was always late and the choices were limited. Undercooked chicken breasts on many occasions. Not enough plates, cutlery, silverware or drinking glasses for events over five hundred count. Co-workers were either too friendly and personal (hugging and gossip/rumors) or very vulgar and unwelcoming (cursing and arguing), bad mannerisms, bad people skills,  communication barriers. The most difficult  part of the job was finding the ""team"" in team work but the most enjoyable part was actually doing the job and satisfying  the guests and clients we served at each event, along with being apart of the festivities."
good,"Responsible for daily operations of hotel, including Front Desk, Housekeeping,Maintenance, and "
good,The Westin is a great place to work with great people. I enjoyed the co-workers and the guests. Management is good but representative of first time managers. I learned a lot about working with guests in a high volume enviroment.
good,High volume of calls per day. Making reservations and modifying existing reservations for people all over the world.  Sales of memberships to new customers.  Scheduling meetings and training new sales associates.
good,Smart organization. Great leadership but not very sophisticated with cutting edge solutions.
good,"I am responsible for all customer interaction on a daily basis. I deal with retail orders and reps in order to provide the best retail strategy for our target demographic. "
good,There were a lot of promises made that were not met...such as advancement and movement.
good,"controllo presenze clienti accensione forni e macchinari di cucina. inizio preparazione e apertura colazioni con buffett allestito sia per i piatti caldi che per i freddi. inizio evasione comande e coordinamento del personale di cucina e di sala. al termine del servizio allestimento linea per il giorno seguente, ordine merci per il giorno seguente controllo temperature e pulizia celle frigorifere e compilazione modulistica.la parte più difficile: reggere lo stress di servizio con alto numeri di clienti (dagli 80 ai 200), poco personale a volte poco qualificato. La parte più piacevole: la riuscita del servizio, le mail di ringraziamento dei clienti e la capacità del gruppo di aspirare ed ottenere un risultato comune di buona qualità."
good,"Working with the guests has been a complete joy, but the over night shift has been too hard on my family."
good,"It was fun, but the management company Ocean Park Hotel was horrible. Also, yearly Q.A.s and guest satisfaction scores (GSS) make up a large stress of the workplace- but I understand why they do it. I am sure it is a better experience if you work for a hotel owned by Marriott, and not a franchise."
good,"Journée entière devant un ordinateur et un téléphone."
good,"I started working for the company before they opened. It was a rocky start. We went through several general managers and it was hard to get used to. I worked there 4 years and in that period I worked front desk, breakfast, executive housekeeping, operations manager, some work under director of sales, and for a period of time I ran the hotel while the general manager was out. I learned a lot from my co-workers and my bosses. The hardest part of my job was having to second guess myself at things, whether I was calling the right shots, but moving back into management again I learned from those things. "
good,"I work mid-nights,therefore; I run a lot of reports on my shift, I start with cash reports for the day.  I have learned that you can not rush running reports you have to go steps by steps and not miss any of them. I only see the co-workers that I relive or the one that relive me. The hardest part of this job is only being there every other week-end and not knowing my co-workers and know what go on doing the week on the job.  The most enjoyable part of this job is helping customers and meeting different people.  "
good,"This is only a Part Time Job, I couldn't afford to work a job that pays so little full time"
good,"Not well managed, more moving furniture than serving, great co-workers"
good,Aprender em como usar bem o tempo que se tem e em como lidar com as pessoas nas mais variadas ocasiões.
good,"I worked front desk and my typical day at work was anything from typical, we never worked the same schedule twice which made it hard to balance work and home life. My coworkers were very fun and energetic people. The hardest part of the job was not knowing my schedule more than 2 or 3 days in advance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I got to work with and meeting lots of guests."
good,it was an ok first job to work at the people were great work with there..
good,"A typical day at work was okay and like any other day, alittle fun because of the other co-workers, but overall it was a fine job."
good,Most days i did like working jus because ofthe events i did but others i hateded going in because of not only some of my co-workers but it depended on the supervisor who was working that day. i didn.t learn much since i had work there in the past and managent sucked except one person my co-workers were ok most of them and the hardest was pleasing everyone and they still weren't satisfied. i really jus love the event;s and the different people you met.
good,Every individual is trained differently. No 2 supervisors give the same instruction and you are held accountable for their instructions. Very stressful. Sales is all that matters. Customer service means very little.
good,Management team needs a lot of work.
good,"It is like working with the world's largest hotel company. There are a lot of great people and perks, but you are one piece of a very large puzzle, which can be awesome at times."
good,I didn't really enjoy my time at the bay point Marriott pcb terrible management and no clear plan for actions and advancement WAS NOT POSSIBLE!!........
good,"Buen ambiente pero trabajo duro y temporal. Para alguien que busque estabilidad no es lo idóneo. Mala gestión del personal, pero buen ambiente de trabajo. Trabajo temporal y intenso. Clientes muy exigentes."
good,"I enjoyed the environment to talk to all kinds of people from all over the country and serve them with great food/drinks. The people I worked with were very chill and understanding. However, management sucked because they would play favorites and will fire you without giving you a warning before they let you go. Then make up lies about how you cause issues in the work environment when it is actually the other person they are playing favorites with."
good,This hotel is run by very manipulative people that do what they want and without a care of its employee's needs. It is a very clique place to be employed.
good,"Marriott regional office Cape Town is not a bad place to at, however, there is no room for growth unfortunately. The company or this particular office, you would need to know the write people to move forward with your career to get into a higher paid position. You would be given more responsibility to make you think you learning something to move up the ladder, but you won't get the proper salary for what you do and cost of living is only getting higher each few months."
good,"I enjoy this job for many reasons , however the culture that is cultivated at this particular Marriott by some of the management is not in line with what I believe quality leadership to be"
good,Blacks not treated equal managers are lazy no advancement for blacks. Benefits ok uniforms are provided one dollar to eat lunch off menu blacks have to work harder then whites im just being honest.
good,I came to work for the Westin brand before the merger with Marriott. There was a high turnover in staff as well as management. This position allowed me the flexibility to have an income while building a clientele for my own business. I learned what not to do in the spa industry.
good,"Pay was great , No hours no Benefits unless your Full Time Employee, Location is great in downtown area  accessible by Ctrain , if they gave hours people would stay  ."
good,"First and foremost they decided to assign me to a job that I did not apply for ! I expressed that I would like to be moved to my correct department multiple times and I kept being told I wouldn’t be moved until the next year. I was the ONLY original employee left from my department, literally helped open the hotel with my bare hands and working 10+ hour days only to be overlooked for the manager position for people who kept quitting and leaving because the job was asking for too much. I was treating like a child and that cause me to never want to come to work on top of dealing with a supervisor who was very rude. Then when the most current manager got hired my hours suddenly got cut in half and I got moved to part time employment because I expressed how I feel ? I loved my experience there starting out but as time went on I saw it for what it truly was ."
good,"The turnover due to management consistently changing, policies were not followed, and people fired due to rumors. Management never asked what was going on, just fired you."
good,not at all a great place to work too much stress less pay no proper management  too much stress long hours and less pay . there are better company outside
good,"The Marriott is a famed, international group of hotels, and once you're  settled in you grow to love the hotels you're assigned to. This culture does tend to lead to an understanding of the varying work environments at each hotel and various management styles of the individual managers therein."
good,"I came here expecting to do great, awesome things in the kitchen but come to find out its all frozen, heat to order food. Limited on what I could do in the kitchen do to ""high labor cost""  not able to show my talent, was always told not to go above and beyond with food specials or preperation. Nothing is made from scratch. Its all from a box or a bag of powder mix. Only good thing is the pay."
good,Working at Marriott gave me the opportunity to learn more about customer services and how to overcome challenges with he best solutions. I was able to meet people from around the world and provided the best customer services possible.
good,Okay place. strange location. difficult to sell because it's in the middle of nowhere. new management has made it better. and a renovation helped. Is okay.
good,I loved my job for a while. I don't think that the company truly values their top employees. There really isn't much room for growth within the hotel. You will need to build your base and then branch out to another property.
good,Little pay for laborious work. Management was not encouraging and did not provide beneficial feedback for job. Great thing about this job was the privacy and solitude.
good,"Management was kinda off, the atmosphere was relaxed and I prefer more fast paced. The coworkers are pretty cool though, that’s what kept me here so long"
good,"good culture, and good place to start a job. "
good,The best part of this job was the people I worked with. The bad side was you're cleaning 20-23 rooms which almost oall of them were checkouts and they wanted you to be finished at a certain time. I promise myself I WILL NEVER WORK FOR ANOTHER HOTEL AGAIN!!!!! Housekeepers working hotels really don't get paid for all that they deal with. There should be a union for them.
good,Average place to work. Day usually goes by quickly. Most co-workers are nice. Opportunities for growth and advancement are almost non-existent.  Pay is below industry norms.
good,When the times I worked there not do good because at the time salary not so high and I'm contractual with agency but no regrets my steppingstone where I am now.
good,"Expected to work 6 to 7 days a week, to hit unrealistic budgets.  On call 24 hours a day, and not given the support needed to make the necessary changes to drive results."
good,Most days are pretty slow. Its and easy job to hold not very stable. It has very odd hours because its a conference hotel that works when events are scheduled.
good,"Thankful for the opportunity that Marriot gave me while I was attending school trying to finish my bachelors. It allowed me to focus on my studies while giving me the chance to make money as a college student,"
good,"The hotel in general was a great place to work at, but the management was a very poor job. The hotel was busy at all times and the rest of the employees made it much easier for us to work with each other made it a much happier environment for all of us"
good,the guest is amazing but management and employees could be better. I learned that communication is not used properly between work staff. The hardest part of the job is trying to be done at the time written on the housekeeper daily log set by manager and/or supervisor.
good,Decent job to have if you just need to make some extra money. you must be flexible and they dont care if you have other things to do because they want you to cover someone else before they will cover you
good,"I worked the night shift and it was stressful at times.  I had almost no contact with managemet, The job was my first in The Netherlands so it was a great experience."
good,This is a job good. But with better management it can be perfect. It was a great experience and I really enjoyed working with my coworkers minus the bad management
good,"When I first started everything was great, I really enjoyed this job but once the managers changed everything became more stressful and they cut back my hours and hired someone else while i was gone for a couple of days."
good,"I'm sure the brand it self may be a little more productive than the subsidiary chain that I particularly work for. If you are planning on joining the company, make sure you do your research on the specific location you will be working for first."
good,"I've been working at the Fairfield Inn for about a month now doing the continental breakfast which begins at 5 AM. The work is busy and almost nonstop productive, but it's the getting up to be there after 4 AM in order to prepare the breakfast."
good,It was fun fast paced environment but the bosses and high ups were arrogant and demanded alot of hours with low pay..the employees are why I stayed so long I could not let them down..
good,"Guests from all over the world check in and require assistance for their enjoyment and stay. As a night auditor, you balance all the days transactions and initiate the process to send to the bank while tending to the needs of all guests and checking them in at all hours of the night/morning."
good,"Very busy place to work. Be prepared to deal with complaints as the hotel is very tired. And very hot in the summer with no air con. "
good,This was prior to MBS being bought by Accenture but there was no reviews or instructions on how to advance in your career with Marriott Business Services.
good,"The staff is the glue that holds the property together. The property needs a lot of repairs. A very laid back place to work, enjoyed working at this property."
good,"Many issues are left unaddressed and there is a lack of accountability from upper management.  Would not recommend this property for an unseasoned hoteliers, this job requires a lot of background knowledge and does not provide the training necessary for a successful start to your career."
good,The training was very good with lots of support. The work atmosphere however was less than desirable. I found it to be not the best place to work for me because of the hours and days required to work.
good,The westini wasnt so bad ill come in from 7 til about 2;30 I would have 13 rooms in 1 day ome p[erson only cleaning the rooms it is ok I clean pretty fast
good,"No se valora el esfuerzo ni los años trabajados, no hay estabilidad personal, mala política de contratación."
good,just poor management. no routine for the staff misleading leadership. everyone man for themselves almost. housekeepers make the job more harder for the houseman to perform their duty.
good,"Typical day at Marriott included stand ups with each department and overview all operations at the hotel."
good,"Extrememly long hours!  Clients needs came before all else!  Employers were very fussy about details!  It's an expensive hotel!  Typical day started @ 5am.  Getting meeting rooms ready with setups, coffee, breakfast, etc.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with client requests.  Some would be easy, but others would take time, which wasn't always understood.  Good people to work with though."
good,The management changes every few months. There is constant chaos within the entire hotel. The turnover rate is unbelievably high. They need to focus on agent retention. The pay is not worth the hassle from guests and management.
good,"If it weren't for the poor management who care only for numbers and not at all about their staff, this wouldn't be a half bad place to work."
good,"Co-workers an respective department head are excellent but the overall management and the hotel owner dont care about staffs, proprer benefits are not provided for staff."
good,Disconnect between management of ambassador service-customer experience management and associates.  Expectations to continually add more work and clients onto already overloaded associates.  Continual software issues and network/VPN issues.
good,"customer service can be a fun filled and rewarding job but at times it can be difficult dealing with people from all walks of life if you let it ;the one thing you must take remember daily is that you are there to serve and satisfy to the best of your ability. you get to work with fellow team mates who in time become your family; also the support from managers when needed so you are never alone."
good,"I was very disappointed by my experience with Marriott.  Incompetence and lack of communication in management.  All words, no action."
good,"hated it not enough money for all the work you do"
good,There is not that great for advancement and the compensation is not that great for the hard work and long hours of a front desk clerk. The discounts are great and the brand is awesome .
good,"Every department is short on tools needed to properly do tasks needed,upper management belittles staff and doesn't properly take care of staff."
good,"Work days are hit and miss. Some weeks is so much work, it's unbearable, other weeks, you practically beg for work. Management seems not to care much for the employees and advancement seems next to impossible. One is lucky if management knows what they're doing half the time."
good,I get to work and everyone is upset or just not in good spirits. They disregarded how hard i worked. Management was not fair and they sabotage employees until they quit or set them up to get fired. The hardest part was staying sane. The most enjoyable part was the certificates and staff meetings.
good,"The job was fine at first because you are happy to have a job, but when it comes to advancement, there is none "" just be patient"" is what I was told,"
good,"I honestly really liked working here because the co-workers are great and so is almost all of the staff. Even most of the management was very supportive, but there are always times when there is added stress to the front desk when there doesn't need to be. I just think with some future planning that the stress on the front-line could be maintained better. "
good,"Nothing to say."
good,"The management at this specific location were highly unprofessional. The front desk staff was great, always helpful and willing to learn."
good,"Fun work place with multicultural stuff, The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues."
good,"Barista, making coffee and interaction with customers, stocking, cashier, keeping the store neat and clean. coworkers were wonderful to work with. really nothing hard about the job, it can be very fast paced sometimes could be crazy otherwise fun."
good,my peers are the best part of the job. Challenged with location wanting HR to complete Payroll/HR responsibilities and fund raising.
good,"I worked with the company while I was enrolled in college, so the schedule worked well with my classes. However the room for growth at the location I was with was very limited. Individuals had been working there for years with a minimal raise or job promotion. I believe after 1 year of working they gave me .50 cent raise. The culture was good for a college student because most the associates were young. I remember management being less than stellar; my GM rarely came to work, but he/she had the highest performing location in the state so the DM allowed he/she to skate by on 6 figure salary and minimal working days. As long as the bottom line was reached he/she rarely cared what happened. He/she did take reviews from customers very seriously. The issue with this job is its hospitality, so it's open 24/7/365, so we were mandated to work holidays. I worked for the company during the recession so hours were cut, which put a damper on the individuals who worked there full-time."
good,I am way under  staffed I this property has over 40 meeting rooms that me and one guy set we have new management that is not that experienced.I make the best out of it  . The staff here are good people . I try my best to train people on skills that they may not know. maybe with this change over in the future it might get better
good,"Good place to learn how to develop communications skills especially with co-workers and the guests. Fast paced environment has shown me how to accomplish more than one thing at a time. Great place to network because of different types of events we hosted. Everyone always worked together to get the job done, definitely a teamwork atmosphere. The best part was being able to see different cultures and their celebrations and seeing the results of an event."
good,A structured close knit family environment of co-workers. The employees strive to make their guests happy and satisfied during their stay at the hotel. As the Banquet Chef I worked hard to insure that the food prepared for the larger group functions were to the guests satisfaction or exeeded their expectations with the support from the Executive Chef and the Banquet Staff.
good,"Worked in various departments. Mostly enjoyed the Front Desk and Sales. Very nice and trustworthy co-workers.  Management was not very nice, not pro-employee. Last department worked was Reservations, and a typical day was just answering phone calls. Hardest part was not being able to perform at my maximum. Most enjoyable was my co-workers."
good,"The hardest part was the unrealistic amount of rooms to be done in one day and still be up to hotel standards. We almost never had enough linens/product to get the workload done on-time each day. There was extremely poor management/organization. The Hispanic housekeepers were poorly treated and spoken of at the hotel. "
good,"Morning shift you get the day ready and check guests out. We  review arrivals coming in that day and make preparations for each need / request a guest might have. Evening shift you check people in and make sure they are satisfied with their stay and make sure they have everything they need "
good,"Marriott has great structure and good employees."
good,"typical day starts with stretching and stand up meeting, follow by getting your assigned boards.  i have learn things are not always what you are told. management is full of false promises. hardest part is unfair treatment by management. most enjoyable part is when i get to go home"
good,"I worked there for 9 years and came to the conclusion that they rule by fear not by example. They were constantly having employee turn over and did not reward, even verbally their employees for a job well done"
good,"good place to work. got promoted to banquet chef in just 9 mouths. management is ok, working those up and down schedules."
good,"The Marriot Huntsville has a very good site manager . Owners and staffing are quite questionable. There is no benefit package,training or any type of employee incentive/retention."
good,"at my job everybody knows everybody by name ,we know of each other success ,it the co worker that make the work environment enjoyable and the day go by faster,it great when you know it all about team work"
good,"Mediocre, cannot trust management or HR department"
good,It was a very fun working environment. You could dress down and it offered down time. the pay just did not match the work responsibility.
good,The management staff would be my only complaint. The manager at the location on  Memorial was not a great manager for many reasons that I have no control over.
good,"answering about 70-80 calls during each shift , assisting customers with booking their reservations ; assisting guest with any modifications / cancellations ; explaining all policies to guest , processing credit card payments ; explaining cancelation deadlines  pushing the sale , upselling , etc"
good,"We worked short a lot. I feel the pay was to little for what we did.  I applied for housekeeping executive supervisor, never got an answer back."
good,"This was a new hotel that was not able to keep management positions consistently filled. As a result, employees were constantly unsure what to do and most of the time had to ""wing it""."
good,"•	First Point of contact for customers "
good,This company is ill- managed and is made up of friends and family. Not one of the managers is educationally qualified for their position. This company's ethics are based on who you know and not your work ethic.
good,The company is a great stepping stone but if you have real goals in life continue  to move around.
good,"Most of my time is sorting, washing, drying and folding linen so my housekeepers have everything they need always available to them whenever they need it."
good,"The type of work I was doing for the amount of pay was not for me, however my coworkers where really nice to work with."
good,bad pay no work/life balance high turn over the front desk is alone doing everything including driving shuttle sales housekeeping for $9 an hour
good,I Learned alot about the hotel buisness here.I became a great michanic at this job.
good,"On the night shifts the work place is cool and laid back and no one is nagging and clouding on anyone. But morning shift its different have so many people watching and trying to correct and tattle and nag you for no reason, no matter how long you been working or how good you do your job."
good,"On a typical work day I would come in get my board and go to the laundry to get all my sheets I would need for the day if they were their for me to get , then I would go upstairs find a cart to use for the day and then I would set it up to my liking then I would begin to knock on doors too see If all my guest were gone if so that is when I would proceed to strip and clean the rooms."
good,There's not much room for growth at this company. There's not much more to say..........................
good,I don't have much to say about this company. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at this company.
good,"Advancing in the company is near impossible. I enjoyed working there, and loved the hotel itself, but if you start at the front desk, and want to advance and build a career there, you're probably wasting your time. Co-workers are nice, management is nice, and there are lots of skills you gain in the Hospitality industry. Hotels aren't a bad place to work, I just wouldn't recommend this one."
good,"Hard work in a fast pace environment with a low pay scale and no possibilities for advancement. Tiffany, our assistant manager work very hard to keep the troops motivated and happy. Great boss lady."
good,"un dia en hotel para ser mas exactos en area d e a y b con los compañeros meseros inicia desde el doblado de servilletas hasta tener en orden  y con suficientes complementos  para poder atender a los huespedes, (cubiertos, catsupś , mostazas, etc), conocimiento de menus y precios asi como la sugerencia del chef."
good,Young new management. Not bad people to work for but they prefer the title and perks of management not the job.
good,i want to relocate in other hotels to gain more learning. the company is nice but i want to transfer in other hotel...
good,"Awful hours, very low pay. Unsociable hours. Unloading coaches and taking luggage to rooms."
good,Its not a job i enjoyed the people and getting to meet new people from the guest. making people happy and making sure they had what they needed. i would go in get my cart ready to go then get to work knock on everyone's door get all the linen out so that the laundry lady could start washing laundry then would go back and start cleaning all the stay overs so if the guest came back to there rooms it was already done instead of waiting till the last minute. The hardest part about the job is they expected you to have everything done at a certain time every check out had to be done by 3 so it was hard trying to get all the guest that were still there cleaned and ready for them and have time to clean the check outs for the next person and some days you would have 11 stay overs and 10 check outs or more so it got difficult sometimes
good,I hated working here. I didnt like cleaning up other peoples mess. It seemed like people would leave their room extra dirty just for housekeeping to clean
good,"The company as a whole is great, but depending on who is in charge of you, it can be a hard place to come to every day. I wish i could have stayed but the work hours were simply not compatible with my family life."
good,"Enjoyed communicating with guest....empathizing to them                     learnt how to interact with businessmen guest,"
good,"The typical work day was bringing maids and guests things they requested such as pillows, sheets, drinks etc. I learned how to deal with frustratingly negative people because all of the maids were always complaining about working. Management was not the greatest, very spiteful, and did not care about their employees the way management should. Hardest part of this job was unloading stock coming to the hotel such as kegs of beer and other heavy items. What i enjoyed most was meeting guests from all parts of the world and conversing with them about their travels"
good,"I work for Fairfield Inn, and while exciting at first, it quickly became less than stellar.  Mostly female staff, TONS of drama, very low pay and increasing responsibilities.  The work is not hard at all, but it's customer service. . .. management takes the word of guests over their own staff.  Constantly left to field complaints by guests that property is NOT up to Marriott Standards.  Horrible Wi-Fi connection, broken equipment that doesn't get fixed and no chairs allowed.  Front Desk is expected to stand in the same spot for all 8 hours of their shift."
good,Gained telephone manner and customer service experience. Lerned how to work under stress and pressure/achieving targets and deadlines.
good,"Typical work day was very busy, management was very helpful and co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was reading a map and giving tourist directions, the most enjoyable part was the flexibility of the schedule."
good,need more hours Advancement Job Security co-workers great
good,"Working in this job role enabled me to excel beyond my job description. I ensured my daily tasks of maintaining hotel and room cleanliness were completed and my colleagues had my support with their duties before I finished each shift. I was able to build on my communication skills by communicating with the different departments to ensure guests needs are met."
good,This was my first time working in the hotel industry. I had always been on the other side of the counter. It was a learning experience. I saw the other side of the fence.  I helped to open this property. I watched this hotel be built. I helped hire the staff and train the staff to open this facility.
good,"Over worked and under paid. Simply. I do NOT want to blame the people which who i work with, its just the appreciation in which the higher staff operate/treated housekeepers in general. The hardest part of this job is if you have children and your regularly scheduled from 9am to 5 p.m. But the lead housekeeper SNEAKS 5 extra rooms Schedules,hours,days off,pay etc..."
good,My staff great the management staff not fair. Hardest part of the job was not being able to speak up for my staff. The most enjoyable part of the job working along with my staff
good,I worked for this company for a year before it became a franchise property (TPG Procianti) & have survived several GM's. I recently left to follow my old boss to another property/resort. Our new GM rubs everyone the wrong way. The worst part? Since this guy took over HALF of our employees have left many of us going to the same hotel. TPG really made a bad call with this guy. No one likes him...with good reason! It's good to go someplace that appreciates me! Also like working with former co-workers (that left for the same reason I did)!
good,I won't say there is no rules but as far I know it should be to all. Few member who called them as head of department thinks that they can do or say treat anyway because off course they are in the high position and even not capable to hold that position. and the management also trust only on them they don't bother to listen the associates. so i will say rules to follow is only for the low level staff not the managers. there is no same treatment for every people working there. Never want to join back thank god I am free from that kind of environment. Manager had appointed her second person such a women who even do not know anything the reason behind is she was manupulated every time by the women who had hold the assistant manager post.
good,"There are no benefits that come with the job, if you are a young adult looking for professional business enivornment, this is the company for you. There are no advancement opportunties within the company. Manager runs a great company, but managing employees has room for improvement, needs to learn how to talk with suborinates."
good,"The camaderie among the employees is great, if you work there long enough you make very good, long term friends. The work can be fun."
good,"Every day was never the same of the hours, then on my days off I would get called in if someone got called out. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I got to expierence so many different departments of the hotel industry and meet guests from all over the world. The hardest part was financially being able to maintain."
good,It was only for a couple of months. i learned how to book .reservations for customers. it was hotel reservations
good,Not family oriented to say the least. No balance of work and life.
good,Resort was sold once and then taken over by another. There was no instruction from new management regarding procedure changes. All we experienced was the loss of many employees and no job replacement.
good,Their success is on the backs of hourly enployees that pull the weight of incompetent managers. Slash & Burn style management. Highest turn over rate in Savannah. HR is out of control. Don't walk away.... RUN!!!
good,All and all it's a good company with opportunity all over the world. How ever to get to that point you have to be there for at least a year. Which I understand but it's hard for them to keep employees that long because the pay is really bad.
good,"i worked at Westin hotel for 2 months but resigned do to health issues that are now well taken care of...i loved my job completely only things i disliked was being rushed to clean rooms, or when guest get disrespectful towards housekeepers if their rooms were not on the charts to be cleaned."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and rewarded with a great team experience."
good,"decent starter job, lots of focusing and being responsible for your time management. cleaning a certain amount of rooms in a certain amount of time, small crews so you get your hours and have a steady work life."
good,Good job just managment takes advantage of you schedule preferences and doesnt adhere to them.  They hire you for one schedule then makes schedule to cover unagreed upon hours
good,If you work in hospitality then Marriott is a good brand to work for. They appreciate hard work and innovation. The benefits and perks are great. Who doesn't like cheap hotel rooms?
good,"Marriott Al Forsan aimed to corporate, long-stay guests. Short amount of guests from outside. I realize my opportunity to grow up and achieve benefits and skills with each new position. Management dependable of mood and personal issues. Workplace culture highly motivated to create personal connection with guests according to concept of hotel/outlet. Difficult to be creative because of all attempts usually closed by management. Good opportunity to develop stress-ability."
good,"The people I worked with here were fantastic, but the HR Director was incredibly challenging to work with.  He seemed only interested in himself and was not supportive of others unless there was something in it for him.  He caused a lot of problems while I was there and caused a lot of really fantastic colleagues to leave."
good,"Never enough time in the day. Politics and favoritism is a huge issue.  No longer is it about taking care of the guest it is about MONEY. "
good,"Very seasonal, required to do back of house and locker.  Most enjoyable part of the job for me is helping my clients with skin care issues and concerns."
good,The hardest part if the job was that i had to escort non-guest of the property. I worked overnights and I noticed that the night crew was more or less a little family with only 4 people on. I really enjoyed that i was able to use the gym and exercise equipment.
good,"Good job,friendly environment. "
good,"At first it seemed great due to the bonuses for meeting goals until they started making the goals almost unattainable, so you no longer got a bonus. And once everybody was finally meeting the goal, they make it even harder to reach. People would lose their jobs because they could no longer meet the always rising expectations."
good,"Hours vary day to day not a set schedule, difficult to plan ahead without knowing your hours you are scheduled to work. It is rare to work a full 40 hours a week."
good,"No one here really knows what they're doing job wise. The food and beverage managers can't even bartend or do opening and closing duties. It is such a dumb white boys club it's insane, if you're sub par at your job and a white male, you will for sure be promoted over a woman. Also, they should pay their staff better and make sure we actually get breaks."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Marriott hotel, i was the first point of call for the room service, i took the orders and sent them through to the kitchen for delivery."
good,It was a gr8 job when mrs.penny and husband ran it but when it was sold it started getting crazier and crazier as time went by but i guess a job is a job and i gave my all
good,"Most days are as expected as a houseman at an hotel, but there and always a few days of the week where they show unprofessional ways of training. it got so bad that a month into me starting i was training foreigners though i was not thoroughly trained myself so i ended up training the the way i did things which they did not like."
good,"Marriott Prague is beautiful hotel in amazing location by Old Town however it does not aim on quality anymore. It became hotel fastfood. Big amount of guests have no level of behaviour, but i am not surprised. For that funny cheap rates sometimes what to expect? "
good,"Management can be good, I've worked for a lot of properties, nobody groundbreaking, but nobody too terrible. They're a hotel like any other hotel, but they are a good starting point if you want to work guest services."
good,It was very hard to make decent money because they would often make you work up to ten hours in the middle of summer when they had big events. We would have to close everything up and we barely got brakes when it was busy. Although when it was slow they would cut you immediately. They had a way of working you to the bone but cutting you off so you had no hours. Overall it was not a great workplace. Although the Marriott company has a very good workplace structure.
good,"Unless you are a butt kisser or one of their college interns, don't expect to go far.  Favoritism is very rampant.  Pay was decent, benefits were okay."
good,"The pay could be better. you have to work many ridiculous hours just to have a decent check. The job is cool, you have to have patience to work in customer service."
good,like i said above i have exactly nothing bad to say. i had to leave so it's okay. it was fun to work with the other employees and they working environment was good
good,Marriott International is a fantastic company with Global opportunities within many fields of the hospitality industry.  Procurement is fast paced and building positive relationships both internally and externally are the keys to success.
good,I work to hard for what im payed and was told i could advance and was lied two when it came time for said enhancement the hard est part of jod is haveing to pick up the slack when lazzy implores dont do ther jod .
good,"The Marriott itself is a nice place in general, but as far as the manager at this specific location really isn't a Manager at all. She would pick 2 of her friends that were working that day and they would be considered ""head housekeepers"" that day and would sit around in the office and gossip about the other employees."
good,"I don't think they handle disciplinary actions the right way. I was never given a handbook, background check, or drug screen when I was hired and now it is a safety concern for those hired behind me."
good,Was a good place to work just wasn’t my kind of job was only temporary. I was in a car accident and went to housekeeping they’re short after didn’t give time for my body to heal.
good,I worked here for a few years and this is a great training grounds for anyone wanting to get into the hotel industry. This hotel though does stand on the side of the highway and is seen as a hotel that does just that.
good,"I been working for Marriott since July 2006 and end on August 2017"
good,"It’s a company that opens the doors to success."
good,I worked on the Overnight shift at the Marriott and it seems that they will accept any Supervisor that shows interest for this shift. The Core values aren't upheld by the Overnight Supervisors. Shame on them
good,"Working in the Banquet Department is often fast paced but the work is executed as a team unless you are working alone. There are days where you will work alone or with a team to get a lot done. Some managers will trust your abilities while others will micromanage your work. The hardest part of the job is working with some people who lack a strong work ethic. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly interaction you have with guests, and being the source of their satisfaction."
good,"Management is overworked. Therefore, they are not completely staffed, leaving the business short staffed and lacking organization. The service suffers due to a lack of service providers and staff fatigue.  Managers do not respond to calls or emails due to their extreme fatigue. "
good,Use to be a 4 dimond great place to work.  Use to have pride there.  Food has went down hill. My regular guest go out to eat. And come back for cocktails. The rooms are neglected. Hard to have pride in a place where the G.M. and HR. Are unprofessional. The managment just kept getting worse. Not experienced. I trained my bar manager how to bartend. No pride in the food.
good,"It is a good compnay with a good reputation. Call cneter not too busy. The team is the best, very helpful. The salary could be higher. The office is in a good location."
good,"Major player in the hospitality industry with locations all over the world.  If you're willing to relocate often, there are a lot of opportunities for advancement"
good,"Okay place to work. Not a lot of room for advancement.  Management lacks in its ability to back their employees, teamwork is not encouraged nor is hiring employees with descent or even good work ethics."
good,As a past co-worker there weren't enough hours given and management was very hard to keep. The employees would come and go because of lack of work. There was more so called drama in the work environment then should have been and because of that they couldn't keep employees in all areas.
good,Lacks a little of team work and more attention from management on how to handle all employees equally. Sadly I learned not to trust most coworkers. Other than that it's a ok job.
good,This job destroyed my sleep cycle. I was asked weekly to work 3-11pm then 7-3pm the next day. They were constantly short staffed and I wasn't able to take lunches or breaks if I worked the late shift. We got minimum wage and were asked to work 10hr days often... and this is for minimum wage. Let's not mention the stress of the type of customers you're dealing with either. Hard pass. I left as soon as I could. Good benefits though.
good,it was ok place to work when every body showed up the people i worked with was good people .it was ok place to work when i worked there not a bad work place . easy work they did not really ask for to much hard work to be done
good,"Friendly environment, but not much to do. Over staffed at the time I was hired and was hardly getting hours. Management was nice at some points but did not care if you had a family emergency or sickness."
good,"Walked in made boards for my housekeepers as per daily forecast, schedule public areas to be clean such as restrooms, gym, pool, kitchen, lobby, offices, schedule houseman and laundry personal, as we were short as staff I had to schedule a board of 30 or more rooms for myself to cover. Had to make sure everyone was clocked in timekeeper and conduct payroll. At the same time had a formula as per minutes per room to be completed at a certain time. At end of day walk all floors for left over trash or dirty linen, check next day forecast and make sure we are covered the following day. Serve as Manager on duty on weekends."
good,"Good place to work; however, management does not support their employees for advancement.  Employees are not appreciated for what they do above and beyond"
good,You get to see weddings on a constant basis. everyone loves coming to see the ducks. Guests tell you stories about other visits to the resort. Once in a blue moon they will raffle off fun things.
good,It depends on the management company that operates the hotel. They control everything. You follow Marriott guidelines but within the management company’s parameters.
good,"Not functioning as a team, many improvements needed within management and staffing. Marriott employee benefits are a great perk when they can be used."
good,"Must have tough skin to deal with rude guest 100% of the time. Even when a guest is wrong and may treat you badly, chances are upper management will comp their stay, meal etc. to keep hotel scores up. Work and life balance can be difficult, I would not recommend this job if you have young children. Hours consist of nights ex. 2-11: 30 PM maybe later hours due to call offs or short staff, no weekends unless you randomly are scheduled off or request months in advance for it; this position can be stressful."
good,working for this company was like attending high school all over again. Maybe it was just the location I workered at but the mangers were terrible thats the reason I left.
good,"1. good working environment and accommodation facilities are enough."
good,"The Albuquerque Airport Sheraton hotel sucked out my soul. I had too many daily tasks too do and not nearly enough time to do them all. That, and the fact that my position, the night dishwasher, was responsible for washing every last plate, utensil, pan, etc., before leaving. Those two things combined to make an absolutely excruciating experience. And God forbid if there was a banquet or anything that took time and attention away from your regular duties. All of this is okay if you are a fast worker. But I am not, and I was miserable at this place."
good,"There are a lot of benefits with SPG but as far as the work is concerned, it is crazy. For every call they have you trying to sell a hotel room. Every last call"
good,"Wages are average, and the scheduling is okay. Flexible with giving you certain days off if needed."
good,"It, was a good expérience ,working at marriot hotel , workers were very courteous and tactful ,the manager took good care of his employees. Good place to work at but like usual the salary is not extraordinary ."
good,Working at the Marriott I enjoyed coming to work every day our pay was enough for me to take care of my kids with & even go shopping wasn’t benefits I was content until I realized I could really truly show my love to Children. Because all my babies wasn’t babies nomore.
good,"Beautiful surrounding area around hotel, lots of places to go to after work.  close to major downtown miami attractions.  easy transport to and from the hotel."
good,Nice place  to  work meet lost of people from all around the world did catering for over three hundred people very busy place you stay on your feet you meet people  from all around the world I'm a strong believer in god
good,i have been working for the hotel business for ten years i enjoy the culture from different people from different  country they show me a lot of love there its just the book rule is more stressful and strict there   the hardest thing is the clients mood how they feel and also the fast paste .
good,"If you were on the good side of management, everyone tried to help, if you were on the bad side of management everyone tried to get rid of you. "
good,AGM great some guest were outragous cursed hollowed & through things plus threathened you I cared about some guest and employee's standing 8 hours all
good,Working for Starwood is very fast paced experience. It was nice to be able to help people book reservations at some of the best hotels in the world...
good,"changing management between startwood to Marriot, it gave bad impact to my sponsorship. i have to leave this job in the middle path for my sponsorship"
good,dealing with day to day guest and really seeing how much they are enjoying the product that you put out. There is a certain enjoyment that you get from seeing a plan that you created implemented and it succeeding.
good,"Train and greet members and guests"
good,Property was going through management change when I arrived. So there was no focus on guest services advancement. Mostly things to help the budget. Property is in a wonderful location.
good,"unorganized, unprofessional and hectic work place, with minimum opportunities to advance in that job related work field, the hours of work was over barring"
good,It's a great job to start out your career. If you are fortunate to stay with the company there can be opportunity for advancement. The office politics/favoritism can be a problem.
good,The management is not it's greatest. They do not know what they are doing in this company. They do not have the skills to work with the public and it's a total mess.
good,"was a good place but at the moment wich is like 10 years ago,the paid is not enough for my expenses ,,but is a good place for started ,good memories,,"
good,Typical day would be from 7am to 4pm certain days overnight audits Monday’s and Tuesday’s. Management was ok just didn’t care about the employees. Hardest part was doing management work on weekends with hotel inventory.
good,"a very good place to work, learned the Administration of Airport services, flight catering and food services at the Airport, learned about the Airlines, Civil Aviation and interaction with domestic and International Passengers"
good,"they really are really bad with giving new people hours"
good,it was a decent place to work but there is no room to move up unless you know someone. they sort of over work you and make you stay overtime when the hotel is busy.
good,"My last manager was a misogynistic person who told me anxiety wasn't real and suicidal people need to suck it up. The pay was great but not for what all you had to do the longer you worked there. I wouldn't change having worked there as I made some friends, but would never go back unless they fired a few people."
good,It was a job that I did well in. I quickly learned that the hotel industry was not for me. I did work here for 3 yrs or so. I found it hard to advance beyond the department that I started in.
good,While I enjoy what I do the staff here definitely needs to be worked on. There also needs to a change in management. I do not feel much advancement in this position.
good,"Good place to work, just no experienced managers to rely on for help  or hotel knowledge.  No people skills or employee incentive programs.  No acknowledge of good workers."
good,Was a cool place to work but management wasn't that great people where fun but that only gets you so far and when you are given more then what is your share of the work it gets over barring
good,Not managed very well and pay is not good. There was no room for advancement here. The hard workers are not appreciated and the lazy ones get promoted. Horrible management
good,"Unfortunately I have to give the Westin Wheeling Hotel a negative review, despite a lot of really wonderful people working there, Most of my negativity is with the upper management and the lack of respect and follow-thru on important issues within departments. There is also a lack of effort and camaraderie between departments and department heads. They don't have a big enough budget to hire the amount of people they need for the events that we do. Equipment needed for daily tasks was always broken ( some broken equipment went on to seriously hurt employees)"
good,"Loved working here got to meet a lot of people . just a good work place over all friendly people , friendly manger's . I would go back if they ever needed me again"
good,The management at this particular property was always rude to guests and staff. They showed little concern for their employees or concern if they even did their job.
good,The Westin Mission Hills is great.  The bag room positions are seasonal and there are no benefits.  Its not full time and tips are limited.  The facility is clean and pleasant and the course is in good condition.
good,was termed for something i could have been coached for so just do everything perfect and do not go against anything in their handbook or you are going to get fired eventually
good,"No Good Leadership skills on this property, Is who you know and who they like. Its very high turnover in Managers and in supervisors.I did love the team I work with very good and hard working woman."
good,"Marriott hotel makkah ksa  is one of good international hotel in the world,there are so many people are stay at marriott hotel because there are has good a management,good service to the guest."
good,Very stressful and Marriott does not give enough tools to actually solve customer issues. Hotel owners have the real power and cause 99% of the problems that we are not able to solve.
good,"Working three different job roles within a single shift and having to get work completed in an 8 hour time frame.  I have learnt to become incredibly strong and multi talented because of this."
good,"I am an ex employee. I loved my job in the kitchen. For 3yrs I gave them my all. New manager comes in and the hotel is tanking big time. Disorganized, bad work ethics. 6 hours to do an 8hour job. The place is looking dirty."
good,There are great benefits for being in the hospitality industry and wonderful opportunities for relocation if desired.
good,It has its days where it can be slow or busy. Iv learned hoe to use the different systems on the computer. My co-workers are all very well helpful. The hours are not consistent nor is the schedule.
good,The overall company is a success.  The owners of the company are a little all over the place but the company itself is a great and educational place to work.
good,"I must say working here was not what I thought it would be. I wanted to quit at first because the housekeeping department was being overworked. However, working a whole summer with no a/c and elevators breaking every other day I still stuck it out. This is the hardest working department and the most underpaid. Bistro department was ok. This department could have been excellent if management did not lack proper training and communication skills. The manager and supervisor are too close that it effects the employees and the business. If they don't like you, you are retaliated against."
good,"Great co-workers, hard workers in general, management is ok, seems to worry more about the bottom line then the employees to get them to that point. Great part of the job is leading a team to achieve great service, restaurant staff and banquet staff. And that I have the skills needed to run both."
good,"My co-workers and I worked well together to the best of out abilities. as one of the nicer hotels in Troy, AL. I went into the job not knowing much about customer service except that you had to be nice. I learned that many people are of a genuinely nice nature and some prefer to be catered to in all aspects. I learned how to handle irate customers and that all the proper channels always need to be gone through. The management staff had taken a few turns while I was employed there but the corporate level management was very fair and attentive to our needs and situations as employees. The hardest part of the job would have to be that on some night I would work the front desk in the evenings alone even though there was a nearly full house, no one on housekeeping or maintenance. In those cases I had to act as everyone and it was very taxing and difficult to manage. The most enjoyable part of the job would be that there were a few regular customers that I befrended and when they would come in it would make the days better."
good,"Observeren van inkomende en uitgaande gasten."
good,"They are a company that tells you there is a lot of room for advancement. How ever they do not promote from with in, they work you very hard and do not provide you a balance of life and work. Management as a whole does not care about their staff."
good,"Through my 3 years at Marriott Oakbrook, much was required of associates with minimal compensation or gratitude. This is no reflection on other Marriott properties."
good,Don't have much to say about this job because I don't want to just be negative. I think that people should decide on their own. Everyone is different and whereas one person may hate the job the next may love it.
good,No consistency in schedule; no raises for several years and if there is a raise its 25 cents. Co workers are always friendly.  A lot of turnover though.
good,Not available....Will discuss in person. Do not want to put on here. Great atmostphere and employees. Everyone is very hard working.
good,"every department is treated differently than other departments (stricter in front office) than anywhere else. work life balance is nonexistent. more like no life. working conditions are bad, no air circulation for the office, practically breathing in fumes."
good,"Runs the full operations of the hotel. In charge of multiple depts. This is a small company. The owners are very involved. The owners are great but the upper management is difficult to deal with. There are two property's total with the company. Both have a hard time keeping personnel. Can be rewarding but also a curse."
good,I learnd new thinks.The job was very hard.The co-workers were nice to me.The nicest part af the job was the lunch time when we meet together.
good,Each phone call we take is different. I've been taught to use substitutes words. Which has made a difference in my everyday life. Our management team could be better with communication. The hardest part of the job would be asking them to accommodate your school schedule.
good,"The location was beautiful, the rooms were pretty small though it is a very old building, the management was not very accepting of change, many guest complaints were advised to be ""swept under the rug."" I learned a lot about interpersonal relationships."
good,Each work day varies upon the percentage the reservation house is at. So everyday is a mystery until experienced. I have learned to become aware of people within the work place as well as the guest who come and go on a weekly basis. This job has helped me grow tremendously over the last year and I'm very happy with what I have learned so far. The most enjoyable part about my days are feeling accomplished from the guest reaction from what you were able to-do for them with or without them asking. I enjoy personalizing each guest stay from the time they check in to the time they check out.
good,"This company hired on at least 40 new employees about a year before they decided to close down the call center. I left as soon as I heard they were closing and acquired work elsewhere, however some people stayed hoping it was only a rumor and management went along with the rumor theory. Over 400 people were laid off with little to no warning. I think the entire situation could have been been handled with a lot more care and professionalism."
good,"As lead engineer I was responsible for many areas of the hotel, which I enjoyed. I especially enjoyed and learned much from my position as Manager on Duty. However, the shift work became too difficult to manage."
good,"as per my experience, the typical day of work will depend on how passionate you are about what you do;  I learned that are some things that you can't change but you can make the difference. Regarding management, I have experienced good and caring managers to work with and those who forgot the Marriott legacy ""take care of the employees, so they take care of the guest"""
good,I can't speech for the other departments but the loss prenvtion department was a joke. It had alot of potential to be a good department but horrible supervisor prevented that from happening. The pay was decent for the job but so much extra work was passed off on security that it wasn't worth it. My supervisor was the most incompetent control freak I have ever worked for. If you like to be micro managed to the point where it's sickening and talked to for penmanship for a security job then this is the place for you.  If not don't waste your time because the ends just don't justify the means. Also the way scheduling was done was also a joke never steady days off very hard to get 2 days in a row off if you want a social life don't work here because you won't have one. Schedule constantly changing for no reason only because supervisor was some wanna be cop control freak  but never was cause he probably would never pass a psychological exam. The people I worked with were good people but horrible  poor management made the job intolerable.
good,"The working environment was one consisting of hospitality, that involved daily accounting procedures relating to revenues, markets, and interactions with guests."
good,"When we had an Executive Chef, I was invisible but when they would leave and I was acting Executive Chef I shined getting many compliments including BEST FOOD SCORES w/o an Executive Chef Said by the GM referring to his time with the company complimenting me."
good,"During the winter months, business is very slow, but we try to give the best customer service to each and every guest that comes in and out. I do feel that there can be some improvements made both with Marriott and the Towne Park valet company."
good,I used to love going to work and had so much energy. I've learned how to interact with guest and make sure they left with a smile. As in management we just got a new GM and everything has gone down hill. slowly but surely he is replacing the hotel with his ex employees at his other Hotel. there's nothing hard about the job just the manager makes it hard. The best part of work is my Co Workers. I just havent left yet because its what pays the bills but the hours are no good cant make 40 hrs a week .
good,Ive learned how to be more professional. The most enjoyable parts of he job is meeting new people from different states and countries.
good,"*setting up the day for success by preparing boards for housekeepers"
good,"High pressure sales and customer service. I learned to operate at maximum mental capacity for long periods of time.  Management was readily available if i reached a new found situation. Co-workers were seemed discontent and for the most part in a state of constant distress. The hardest part of the job was being micro-managed by a  success philosophy that was implemetented by computerized statistical formulas, causing a lack of the human personality in the workplace.  I found the the most enjoyable part was having personal success."
good,Productive but enjoy because you have learn a lot to this job
good,Poorly managed and managers don't really pay attention to their employees needs
good,The food is good. The climate inside the building is always relaxing.
good,Many Management problems. Have recently hired a super whia G. M. to staighten things out. Compensation not great.
good,"In senior management within the PMO, project managers are treated a bit calves being corralled by a herder.  There are no training programs, and no governance processes.  To their credit, they are building them now.  But I believe the leadership in the PMO needs to change."
good,It was boring working the 3-11 shift. No time to do anything else. Management would never schedule me anything else.
good,Days are long dealing with all deferent types of guest. With a low opportunity for advancement.
good,"A day at work in the marriot included checking and rotating stock, making customer orders and keeping the kitchen clean and tidy."
good,"A typical day @ work was, preparing breakfast for guest. At times there was only 1 person in kitchen, & if that was a busy day, you have to prepare breakfast,put up food from delivery truck,greet guest,make sure food did not go lacking."
good,"Depending on the time of day most of the time is spend doing check ins (morning) or check outs (afternoon, evening). Cash drawer counted at beginning of shift. Clean rooms are reported to front desk staff and then recorded in the computer system as clean so that when guests arrive they may check in to clean rooms. travel agencies or websites call during the day to make resevations for guests, ensure payment, and collect guest bills which must be faxed or emailed to the company. half hour lunch break any time employee elects in the shift. at the end of a shift the cash drawer is counted again and money taken in during the shift is dropped in a safe before employee clocks out."
good,good team here specially in food and beverage department.nice co ordination.
good,Clean everything that is required of ud to clean....receive orders from the chef help the kichen as soul chef
good,"Monitored the distribution of food to assure that orders were accurately prepared and received."
good,My day started with running a housekeeping report and assigning rooms to housekeepers. Checking vacant rooms supervising housekeeping staff greeting guest  handling there concerns and complaints. Having morning meetings to update staff and listen to any concerns they may have. management was great for a few years and then the hotel was sold and it was nerver the same again.Most of the co worker were great and easy to get along with . The hardest part of this job was not getting the credit for all the hard work i did. The most enjoyable part was my first supervisor she was great and she did not get the credit that she deserved.
good,"At work the co -worker was terrible everybody hung with their on"
good, It is a good place to work if you do not want to move up. The management is OK . The people that I worked with is great. 
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work, when things were good. Managemet was sometimes annoying and didn't know anything about the bistro, but expected you to know everything."
good,good work environment.  Fairly good at work/life balance.  Lots of good people.
good,Im very familiar with the work so my days are not complacated. 
good,"I had a wonderful time working at the W hotel except for working with management. There too many people barking orders and all of them where undermining each other. Sometimes it became confusing. All in all, I meet a lot of people from different backgrounds and made a lot of connections from working at this location"
good,It was an ok place to work for. I needed something more than customer
good,the opportunity working in a complex has been a tremendous chance to further my career endeavors
good,"A typical day at work is to expect to work by yourself without any help from management even in a full house, they only gonna help if they know that the corporate is in the hotel and watching. very poor management unfair treatment and low salary, manager gonna talk bad about you to the other employee which is not cool. but all my co workers are nice and friendly, the hardest part of the job is dealing with the manager, they are very good in favoritism they are nice to you only if they need you,they never appreciate all your contribution to the company, do something good? they will reward you, and the reward (HEAVY REWARD) try to be the best employee they will take a dvantage of you they will gonna give you more and more and more jobs to do."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you like the flexibility of work schedules. food and beverage upper management are great, not so much other upper level managers."
good,I am a professional seeking a long journey of success and development.
good,"The management at this property leaves a lot to be desired. The staff however, does a great job."
good,able to take advantage of using the benefits for out of town purposes
good,"a typical day consists of interacting with guests, answering questions and inquiries of the property. The hardest part of the job is that there is no opportunity to advance in the company."
good,"My experience with Brussels Marriott Hotels Cluster as well helped me to understand the challenges to face a highly competitive market. I believe that my optimism and dynamism as well as my creativity undoubtedly proved, and prove today, helpful when I meet clients and overall focus on maximizing revenue."
good,profit and lkoss sheet
good,"Maintained rooms, grounds and some electrical and plumbing. Was responsible for breaking executive rooms that had been in use for several months at a time and making them back ""new"" Managament was a little condecending and did'nt really value time off with family, showed alot of favoritism. Not really much opportunity for growth or to learn new skills on record. Management would not provide official teraining just showed you what to do to get by. Supervisors were intimidated by hard workers with talent, seemed as if they felt threatened like their jobs were in jeopardy so they would only teach you so much and then try and take credit for it."
good,"my shift stars at morning 07:00 and does not end up till 1800hrs and much more,as there no manpower to releive me and can stand as concierge in-charge.Learned many things ,handling the associates ,operational softwares and multi tasking during busy movements.Disappointed with management as they havent kept there promises for the salaries and the growth plan for all employee.The hardest part of my job is tell my juniors to wait for long hours without any extra pay and making fake promises which wer told to me by my superiors.the most enjoyable part of my job is everyone here are team players ."
good,"I was only working at starwood for 2 months before an outside influence caused them to put me on leave without pay. They then strung me along telling me i ""might"" get my job back and then one day 2 months later they called and said i was fired with a conditional re-hire. I WOULD NOT recommend working for that company at any level because of their lack of support for their employees"
good,Be ready to help every single guest with their needs and fix any type of complain they had.
good,"Very busy, not alot of training being offered to new employees. Very low care about employees."
good,"I have been at the Westin in Morristown for over 3 years. It was my first job out of college and I was able to grow immensely not only professionally, but personally as well. I used my hard work, dedication, and perseverance to be able to be promoted to a management level position I currently hold. I have learned what it is be a team player, great communicator, and problem resolution skills. The most enjoyable part of my job is I come into work each day, and every day is different. I am always learning from dealing with different types of people and handling situations accordingly. The hardest part of the job is the hours and not having a set schedule. It is a challenge to find a balance of work and my social life."
good,I open day by checking for any call offs then the meeting room set-up and av set-up against the BEO also all the coffee breaks and breakfast greet the guest upon their arrival and go over the event manager in case of any last minute changes or any special diet and communicate with the executive chef as well as the event mananger
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me being able to go in and complete the job that I was hired to do. I learned quickly that there was seldom if any typical days. The management was okay but too outgoing and allowed the employees too much control. The hardest part of my job was having to complete other employees work , which happened way too often. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers, they were always friendly and I love working in a happy environment."
good,Alot of leisure guest tavels at this property
good,Company has a ton of potential but it is undergoing renovations and has been bought out by a new management company. It has had 10GM's in the last nine years. The veteran staff does a wonderful job with the limited resources available. Overall a good company with wonderful landscapes and genuine point of interest that needs to right candidate to be able to fully dedicate their time and skills to a property that needs some TLC.
good,The Marriott Reservation Center is a very good job. The only problem is the hours because you have to bid on your shift monthly so you cant plan ahead.
good,• Responsible for entire gamut of T&D in the hotel
good,i over all loved working there there was just issues with the managers never really had a stable one.Also i was doing night audit and never got was paid any different then other employs.
good,While working for Marriott I work two different departments. Each department is ran differently I really enjoyed doing serving for Marriott they worked with me
good,"Low pay, good place to get experience. Work is hard, frequently short-handed ,especially on second shift. Terrible days off, was unable to move to first shift after ten years of service."
good,"The employees and management staff at Marriott Hotels International and W Washington DC specifically, exude professional, genuine, warm customer service. Management empowers employees to go above and beyond, and think outside the box to provide epic moments for guests."
good,"*Worked 24/7 to make it happen."
good,A lot of work for not much money. Not much to add other than that without giving away who I am. For the amount of work Night Audit does they really should hire an accountant.
good,"very stable job, only problem is this site does not provide benefits for its employees. It also does not offer holiday pay. Not the most flexible with scheduling. The job itself is a good one."
good,It depends on which Marriott property you work at. Avoid Atlanta Marriott Marquis at all cost especially Loss prevention department the pay is horrible and there's no manpower.
good,"This hotel was a good place to work at first especially being in the heart of Nashville. Nice working environment. However, other than the distance being an issue for me it was really just poor management. They are very nice to your face but then talk about you behind your back to other co-workers. Lastly, they hardly ever relieved me for lunchbreaks which made it more stressful."
good,Learnt many new things from servicing the guest to handling the system. Overall great experience in getting to know new things as well as new people and guests.
good,"Just another big corporation thats only concerned about the numbers. Employees are nothing more then away to achieve the numbers. The only time they act concern about anything is when they think they are going to be sued. I have spent almost 40 years in the hotel business and regardless if its Hilton or Marriott or what ever ,the attitude and mentality is the same. I would never advise my children to ever work for such a heartless and stressful environment in the hotel business."
good,The job was ok until I had a death in my immediate family. I called my supervisor to let them know. The response was “ Do you know how difficult this makes it for me?” Not a word of condolences
good,Low pay is reason I'm looking for new employment. I've learned a lot and enjoyed the position. I'm looking forward to gaining new employment for a property with livable wages and higher service standards.
good,I loved working in the restaurant but management sucked. Usual days are pretty busy but it makes time go by fast. Management tends to put workers against each other. Management picks who they want to advance.
good,"En realidad el ambiente de trabajo es bueno, pero no cuenta con herramientas para realizar los trabajos que te exigen y no te proporciona un uniforme por lo que él cliente te ve con desconfianza"
good,"Guests are enjoyable and some coworkers make work fun, but management is uneducated, no experience, employment does not honor experience and promotes due to popularity."
good,"Growing company with lots of room for career advancement. Learned  a lot in the short time I was with the company. Unfortunately, the company has a closed minded approach when better solution are presented. You hear a lot of ""That 's how we always do it"". If you are a Kool Aid drinker you will go far."
good,"need better mananger and better hours and need better employees"
good,"very judgmental , never really cared about employees , give your all and its unappreciated . managers were only concerned about certain employees and not everyone as a whole ."
good,If you are planning to work in the multinational office corporation environment this is a very good opportunity. Good starter of open minded young multilingual candidates.
good,I have applied  for a managers twice and both times have been told thank you but no thank you and the people that have got the positions come with less experience which is the reason I'm looking to find somewhere where advancement is based on your knowledge not who we know.
good,Marriott is a little behind on pay rates. but a good company. They do promote within and the Marriott Culture is Great. I Would recommend this company Have a great day.
good,It's a hotel so you are going to be worked like a slave. It all depends on the type of management. Mine for example is pretty bad. I have been working for a good amount of time and feel little appreciation from it.
good,"I enjoyed being able to work from home. In my position, I can arrive whatever time I'd like up to 10:30 as long as I worked my full 8 hours. I would check my emails, then start plugging away at work requests. Most of them didn't take long. The hardest part of the job was receiving ambiguous tickets with little information. I would have to request more information, then would not get an answer for days. Also, in this position, you have to track your hours worked by specific task. A lot of the project managers were a pain to get a work number from. I'd be delayed in submitting my times because they would take forever to get back to me."
good,"culture changes by different leaders.  team members are helping each other, and supporting... good location, and free parking.  technology is also pretty advanced."
good,Coming in to this job I was not very prepare by my manger who told me that I wouldn't be hire if I had disclosed that I have a slight disability with learning. the people that work there were really nice and helped me. I think the hard part was cleaning check out in 30 mins with 18 other check outs.
good,"good pay and benefits but poor management "
good,"Working at Aloft is a fun job. You get to talk to guest, friendly staff, it is a dog friendly hotel, so you see dogs everywhere and it is so cute. Live music on fridays. Management does have favoratism, they also like to contradict themselves. The owners do not like to fix all the broke stuff around the hotel."
good,"I enjoyed working with my team and other departments."
good,"Long hours, short staffed.  Meetings. Corporate red tape.  Marriott ""lifers"" not very welcoming of new staff.  Change is difficult to implement.  Pay and benefits are fair."
good,"The manager did not give us the right to speak, housekeepers is not important to them, we're just a maid and had no rights to speak or complain. Lock of people but the manager keep saying we dont have budget for everything. Overall not a good place to work there"
good,"Sometimes its busy and sometimes its slower that molasses, I've learned a lot of different things. But I liked it better at this company when it was corporate."
good,"Delta Toronto Airport is good when it comes to hiring within. However, what i've noticed is teamwork is lacking, and once given the tools to succeed, growing within the company is difficult. and not worth it. Pay compensation is also lacking. More work for less pay"
good,If they paid more and treated the employees better it would be a great place to work also a couple improvements to the hotel would be awesome and didn't run out of important products that would also be good
good,"the call center is great, but has a lot of in regulations to many managers handling different scenerious. we have a manager assign to the sales agent any issues always can addressesd to her/he if not the Director of the Dept."
good,"Pay is unfair. Need more hours available, higher pay. Not enough to be able to live off of. Don't offer very god benefits. Get benefits taken away if not working enough hours."
good,"Muito stress;"
good,"Gives Everything away free before investigation or approval, no guest discipline, disrespectful spineless managers, employess are to fend for them selves, takes 5 years to grow in company due to lack of empoyee reviews, or eos reports which resolves nothing and terrible HR."
good,"Very low parenting benefits, no perks. They need to find a way to create a better work life balance for their employees especially Managers. They prefers bringing Executive leaders from outside than promoting from within."
good,"All tips are shared between sections, for productive and hard working employees this entails giving sometimes as much as 50% of your earned tips away. Money was good but leaving with 60-70% of what your actual work day entailed makes it very difficult to sustain a good attitude. Management constantly over-schedules and then refuses to cut employees, consistently wasting 2-3 hours of any given employees time on any given day."
good,"a typical day at work, you sign in and you immediately take calls back to back, you rarely have enough time to have a drink a water. The calls never slow down your just assisting different guest all day long. When you need some assistance from a manager they have a bad attitude about assisting you if your not on their team, so you have to depend on your co-workers who may or may not been in the situation. What I learned was to try my best to find the answer by myself. The hardest thing about the job is taking the back to back calls all day long"
good,"I trained over half the people in housekeeping, brought in at least 10 people and never once was praised for my effort in helping the company. Then because of one mistake they hated me. It's a great place to work at if you like drama and you don't mind if you have to fix the laundry all the time. I loved housekeeping and the schedule worked really well with my school hours."
good,"I liked working at this hotel in the beginning because I was looking for a Marriott chain hotel to receive a discount and benefits; however, I quickly learned that I was not going to get any benefits for a year and it was not clear what those would be. The partiality that is allowed by management is stifling."
good,"I worked for Marriott International at the Anaheim Marriott for almost 29 years.  My position was eliminated.  The GM said he ""did need an assistant.""  I worked for 4 excellent general managers who I thought highly of and they respected and appreciated my work.  The last GM, I believe didn't know how to use an assistant.  He had a track record for his assistants quitting or leaving.  I was disappointed but respect his decision."
good,"All departments were micro-managed by the G.M. The G.M. was working at 2 properties and was not accessible. Very, very poor communication, and lack of organization."
good,An alright place to work.  Fast pace and a lot of pettiness. Management expects a lot from a person and not much in the way of perks or acknowledgement.
good,"At the start they did not fully teach me how everything works, it was more of a self-experience and when it is a quieter shift, they will tell you what to do, which is quite difficult because sometimes we'll forget how it runs, we just learn the skills throughout every shift."
good,"I started here with the hopes of being there long term. I unfortunately was not given a fair chance to learn my job. Then when I did not meet the expectations, I was fired."
good,I worked one winter season for The Westin Resort and Spa in Whistler BC and I am not sure that I would return. The hotel is beautiful and offers a great deal of services as well as great proximity to skiing. What I found to be most difficult about working there is Whistler itself. It is a very small community and very much designed like a resort that has one major attraction. I found the situation too small for my liking and prefer a larger city.
good,Working for Marriott I get to meet all different types of people from all walks of life on a daily basis. I get to assist families on vacation and professionals that are traveling for work.
good,"I loved my job. I worked night auditor, so my hours worked perfectly. Since I just had my daughter 4 months prior, it worked out even better. Working overnight is probably the best shift, not too many guests, no managers breathing down your back lol. You could get your work done at your own pace. I learned a lot. Patience. How to audit, somewhat. The management and workplace is what made me leave. There was way too much drama within management, and since my GM was good friends with HR, I never felt comfortable with expressing myself with them. If it wasn't for that, I honestly would've stayed. I loved the people. When it got busy, it really got busy. But I still loved it. I met all kinds of people, from all kinds of backgrounds. It would've been nice to also have someone to talk to lol but that's why they made cell phones!"
good,the upper management does not work pass 4:30pm    M-F and never on Weekends the they leave the hotel to hourly employees to run on evenings and weekends
good,"This company has fantastic people and a strong back bone, however it is undermined by a lack of appreciation of employees and poor management. It has the potential to be a great work place, just needs some improvements."
good,"The   shifts  never  allowed balance . Worked until 1am, was hard getting Pto to use. Job culture was tuff. Pay was good. Shift changed a lot, hard to"
good,"This job was a good learning experience. Though most of the learning comes for doing, when I first arrived at the job my own manager was struggling leaving myself with little training. But the workplace culture is positive and helpful."
good,"A good entry level job but you get paid minimum and they cut your hours/send you home very often. No communication between management and other employees. Little to no scheduling flexibility. They let you have piercings/tattoo/shaved head, until when 'audit' season comes around they suddenly have strict rules. Lots of standing around. Very difficult programs to use."
good,You have  to be able to give good customer service dealing with different guest that may have a delay or they are distress and just needs a positive smile or how are they or better yet make there experience here at Marriott phenomenal.
good,Schedule is always different depending on business.
good,"Being part of the sales complex team was great so far. i learned a lot and i achieved a lot in one year and half ."
good,Our team of kitchen professionals got every job done that was required. They have all gone above and beyond to provide an excellent dining experience for guests. The management however did very little in helping much around the kitchen. Lack of advancement as well created low moral. Other wise good benefits and company.  Very poor management
good,"-Management was very passive aggressive and uncaring"
good,"People are great.  Most have sincere interest in giving the customer a great experience. Benefits are good, and getting better.  Hopeully, with the new management company, the organizational structure will get better."
good,The job is a job. They make it seem great but it doesn't have the glamour that they want to make it seem like. You'll make money but you won't have much fun doing it. The customers will be mostly kind but pretty snotty too.
good,you will learn how to multi-task and do other things like take orders and make sure the kitchen is clean and wait on costumers in the lobby as they are waiting on there food.
good,"good if you love working alone . its very fun stocking and seprating clothes . very hot in the laundry room, good food , big break room , friendly guests"
good,"You will get your workouts worth"
good,"The job itself is fairly easy. The management is not the best nor do they listen to the complaints of their staff well. Some of the ""management"" staff is inappropriate and immature. Staff is not regularly treated fairly. Management needs to take some classes and training on how to properly manage."
good,"The management people here horrible, they think they are so supperior to you and they treat you that way, i just kept going for a while because everyone was getting laid off and i still had a job,"
good,"As an Event Manager my days were long and challenging for not a whole lot of compensation. "
good,Night shift was an awesome experience with the best team of coworkers i have ever had the pleasure of being a part of. Management was extremely awful and everyone left around the same time due to a very unstable management/ worker relationship. It felt very much like the military in how it was ran and with no room for improvement even though we had a team of security with a range  of rank from E-2 to E-7 with much experience and improvement skills. No room for promotion or ideas.
good,Eine altes hotel fast in zentrum von München wo mesitesns kommen resie gruppen und business
good,This place is good for whoever is seeking for a job that requires not much experience. They will provide the proper product knowledge that will let you develop your skills and potentials.
good,"The upper management is horrible, they say they care about the employee's but it's a lie. The managers are lazy and do not help out with anything. Would not recommended working here."
good,If you work there you will most likely not move up in your career and you have a chance of being a lifer at the hotel. Most of the management team on property have been there many years so they are set in their ways. The property is very out dated and if you are a newer person in your hospitality career then this may not be the property for you.
good,"Working with Hotel Le' Meridien is a memorable experience, along with friendly managers and colleagues. There are lot of things to learn but at there own term and conditions."
good,Poor management people in the work place show favoritism with employees they cover up wrong doing and can never get your pay correct pay is always wrong/ short working hard for no money no matter how long you have work for the company or how loyal you are it goes un noticed
good,The only issue I had with Starwood is that it was a little be unprofessional for me. I went from working in an office at CLC to working in an environment that it was ok to wear PJ's to work. The people are great and if its your first call center job and you're young it would be perfect for you.
good,The work culture here is very family oriented. They value the concept that family is important and do not condemn you if you have to leave early to attend your childs school programs. The management is nice and they are always asking how you are or how you feel. The phone system is good and the people there are very colorful!!
good,Fun atmosphere and working along with great coworkers but the long hours are very stressful and no type of family life. Very stagnant on promotion within the company and stingy on raises.
good,"Lunch is provided whilst on shift, Department managers vary but everyone is very friendly. working long hours 9 - 5 mid week and Saturday and Sunday.."
good,Good place to work as far as job knowledge. The expectations are high if you are an employee But the product is not up to par. The tools you are given are limited to run a successful operation.
good,"Very little pay for long shifts, demanding customer service, and an almost on call scheduling experience. The management was very supportive, but you could sense the frustration of having to work within company guidelines."
good,The job is great but the management choose to ignore employee complaints or concerns and becomes very frustrating but other than that the job isnt as terrible as others
good,"Great job for a kid fresh out of high school or someone trying to pick up a second part time job. Other than that, it wasn't a great experience. Hotels do vary when it comes to management, so my experience may not be the same as another's."
good,"Clean hotel rooms and suites. "
good,"they offer great pay and great benefits. I poured my heart, soul, and most importantly time into my job. when it came time to move forward in my job I was held back, so I moved on elsewhere."
good,Owned by large corporations. Managed by Marriott International property is managed on a cheaper side due to low budgeting to profit for the owners. The property is poorly managed and completely outdated for the level of customer they serve.  The hardest part of my job was basically managing the department between my coworkers and I because management were nowhere in sight to make proper decisions
good,"I worked at the Aberdeen, dyce hotel. The hotel itself is an embarrassment to the brand - if you went to any nice city the Marriotts would look so much better than this one."
good,The job was okay. There was very little possibility for advancement beyond what my position was. The management was decent except for lack of concern due to family issues.
good,"I wish I could say the benefits and pay reflected the amount of work expected and was put in, but that simply was not the case. However, Marriot is a solid brand and the property I worked at was unique and had much to offer, in comparison to other hotels located in the area. The problem with the property I was employed at, was the constant turnover at the manager position, as well as the current state of the building itself. For far too long, serious maintenance issues were patched and duct taped till the weaknesses could no longer be masked. Instead of addressing these issues, corporate would continue to pressure management to rectify the customer scoring issues and keep all rooms opened, when they should have been shut down until the necessary repairs were made."
good,A typical day was checking in guests.  Running items up to their rooms.  The hours are not good and below standard for the area.
good,"Quality food and beverage product. Four star hotel. Most popular up and coming area in Boston's waterfront area."
good,"Might be my first and only Marriott Hotel I ever work for.  Starwood employees and management, I feel sorry for you.  They don't care about the managers, you can work 7 days a week, 12,14,18 hrs a day, they want more and always cut hours.  Cut Costs. Don't spend. Don't Buy.  But Marriott's approach, ""Take care of the associate, the associate will take care of the guest,"" B.S, at least in North America.  How about take care of the managers."
good,"cleaned rooms, made cordial conversations with the guests and spoke of possible changes to help the company.  associates were very helpful with teaching me on how to clean and make the guests feel at home."
good,"Loved the fast paced environment, learning that teamwork and communication is crucial when it comes to the success and safety of the internal and external guest experience."
good,Great Job! Great customers and coworkers. I loved interacting and helping people. The hardest part is emotional management which makes the job not worth the time.
good,"I liked the fact that I had my own office ,and worked independently got to create my own schedule, had excellent client and coworker relationships"
good,"My manager was great to work for as well as some of the employees working.  I worked 9-10 hours per day or as needed.  I did all positions in the Food and Beverage area, which was a tough thing to do, because the managers wanted me for all jobs."
good,"great employees, aweful management."
good,"Nice work environment and co-workers, but management was continually changing and there was no consistency with scheduling, day to day managing protocols and therefore standards were lowered."
good,"A typical day begins with side work. Chopping onions, cutting veggies, and ripping lettuce for salad. I would check the board for any specials we had that day. I would check my station to make sure my tables are clean and the condiments were full. The rush of customers would come on. At the end of the night I cleaned my station, completed side work, and count my bank. I learned how to serve multiple customers at once. Management was good for the business. My coworkers were fun loving and helpful. The hardest part of the job was when the restaurant got full and a lot of pressure was on everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with good people and taking care of customers"
good,Fast paced working environment. Management was horrible. Most pleasant part was dealing with customers.Coworkers were strange. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management and trying to get them to do their job.
good,"new school management is about the numbers and ASA/AHT and not the customer or the the employee or the quality of work."
good,It is a good job but the management is not very friendly and dependable. The company is ok. The employees were great but the overal job can become over whelming. It was under staff.
good,"Overall it was a fun company to work for., however when the company merged with the residential property things changed drastically..."
good,"This would be a wonderful company if not for the fact that the management was in a transition phase as I was hired. Lots of things I was taught by previous managers went out the window when they either quit, or were forced out by the higher ups. I just did my work as a bistro associate, so I didn't have to deal with much of that. Retraining once every three months or so got old, so I moved on."
good,felt as if i couldn't move up in the company and be compensated for the area the hotel was located as we seen sales increase steadily for four years
good,"When working here, i do believe the pay could have been so much better since you have to do a lot of work.8.50 Hr working over 40+ hours are you kidding me."
good,The Westin is a great company but an improvement in the HR is a must along  the over all management. The work load balance must be improved for all workers. Also there must be a better way to secure the employees and give them better feeling of job security and they belong to the place.
good,I learned a lot about the company. It is a great company to work for if you are in a permanent position. The overall company has a great culture.
good,"I have been able to advance very quickly in multiple areas of the hotel, but that is also due to shortage of available employees, management, and lack of communication."
good,Not the place for advance if you want to move up. Can be a challenging place to work at times. No real career development so its hard clear path to advancement.
good,Great company to work for. Benefits are really good but it depends on location and department that you may work in. World center Culinary department is not a bad place depending on your department but very unprofessional. Most cook and chefs are not team players will throw people under the bus. This location  is great if you want overtime but not if you want to advance
good,"Can be very busy at times because you are the only staff in the hotel."
good,I opened the restaurant daily. I provided service for the nation's top executives and bankers. Trained all new servers and wait staff the in's and out's of the hotel and restaurant. Basic food safety/handling and policies and procedures. I thoroughly enjoyed working with my peers. Very dynamic staff from all over the world. I was given the opportunity to be creative.
good,i worked at the UT Campus in Tyler TX as the manager of Subway. I was quickly moved once I became 3 months pregnant to downstairs in the caffiteria. I did not like the managment. Cinthia was not always pleasent with her employees for no apparent reason.
good,"Management of restaurant in a hotel is a high profile position.  Exciting moments, but very long hours both in the evening and day time.  Compensation for long hours didn't feel existed."
good,This company is all about keeping their reputation while throwing their employees into the wolves. They portray this family atmosphere   and fair atmosphere but do no make decisions based on the same. They allow their corporate counter-parts to make decisions for them who does not have a working relationship with the staff members.
good,The daily in and outs of the hotel are fine. The behind the scenes is the worst. They need to improve on management skills.
good,"Great environment to work in, Good co workers and great location."
good,The place is a revolving door of employees and that's never a good sign. it has great people that come through the door but very little in the way of opportunities for advancement.
good,"There was not a typical day, everyday was different in it's on way."
good,"I knew when I was being interviewed for a job at Courtyard (for room attendant) that I wanted to work there because the housekeeping manager was awesome. She actually seemed like a real person instead of just someone who was doing their job. Almost every person I talked to, it seemed like we were already friends, so I knew I liked the atmosphere."
good,"Good place to work (Loss Prevention Only). Friendly people. Good benefits, good work life balance. Lot of politics in upper management, but reasonable work place. Too bad the hotel removed Loss Prevention Department."
good,"I would rather talk about this job and company in person."
good,"The supervisor would go in the rooms before us housekeepers, checks were shorted. I reported the problems and nothing got fixed."
good,"This is my first job (mainly office works). I'm enjoying but I still need to see and explore different surroundings/ properties. As I believe the more persons you meet, management you deal with, the more knowledge and experiences you can acquire."
good,"Each shift starts with a look at the arrivals, departures, meetings/events planned for the day. Then a look at emails that have been sent prior to your shift for any updates. The next tasks are to print the contingency report and to make sure that Elite Members have their rooms blocked as well as their requests fulfilled before they start arriving (around 4 pm). A call around is done for the occupancy and rate of other hotels in the area in case a guest needs a room and we are at maximum occupancy."
good,"Typical day was cleaning 12-16 guest rooms. Responding to guest request by more pillows, towels and extra amenities. Co workers were great and always there to assist"
good,"It was good learning experience, but the shift work wasn't good."
good,Great place to stay at but not that great to work. Benifits were not that great and they didn't treat employees nearly as good at the guests
good,"The work itself was easy and not complicated. I came to work started my prep of the daily soups, sauces, and stocks. I would work the line to cook for the restaurant and room service. The hours that I was scheduled to work were very difficult for me. I had a newborn baby at home and management was fully aware. Management on the other hand, relied fully on the staff to fulfill all job tasks down to inventory and guest special needs. Management was not on hand at all times. As a new employee, I had to rely on my coworkers to train me, even though each one had THEIR own way to do things. So, needless to say I had to make a lot of corrections when it came to recipes and plating. The coworkers were all nice people, but because it was a union environment made it hard to trust them. They made me feel like I was there to take their job instead of being on the team (which isn't a word often used among the staff). If I could go back, I would, because it gave me a sense of stability for my family. The best part of the job was meeting the new people who were genuinely sweet and friendly."
good,"The people you work with are quite simply, the best. Marriott has a gift drawing in good people and training them quickly. Very great group of motivated individuals. "
good,"Great side of town to work"
good,Fun place to work at. You'll get the chance to meet a lots of great guests and enjoy an ocean view.
good,"Enjoy working and meeting new people, and have great coworkers that I really enjoy on the audit team. there is no team work around here. they do not care about their employees."
good,"The Westin Downtown is a great hotel. The people and my coworkers are great. I was the Manager on Duty tuesday through saturday, handling any guest or employee concerns from 1pm to 11pm."
good,The management is never there to personally assist you. They are simply there to forward their careers.
good,"too much of work at a stretch"
good,"-my typical day at work would be I come in and clock in go to the bistro help prep and bounce back and forth from front desk to bistro"
good,"Carpet cleaning in the rooms and corridors"
good,"- free lunches and dinners"
good,"it is very good to work here, nice working environment here but not that fair salary for executive ..salary standard is very low"
good,This facility is old and lacks the modernized requirements of a new hotel. Management skills are not of the greatest my current boss lack skill in talking to the staff.
good,"Learned to organize things,"
good,A culture that is not of normality. No room for advancement. No communication from management. Poor working hours. No training opportunities.
good,Staff is friendly towards coworker team and guest.  Great place to work.
good,Would be able to write more If I am taken aside and asked and just so you know I am new to this property so there Is not much I know until I have been there A few months
good,A typical day would be running the dishes from banquets held at the hotel through the dish machine. As well as the dishes from the chefs in the kitchen. Also cleaning the entire kitchen at the end of the night. I learned how a hotel and resort actually runs. The hardest part of the job was getting off of work late at night due to a banquet running long. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to eat some of the food that the chefs prepared.
good,"Typical workday, Cleaning by day, patrolling & securing the hotel by night."
good,"there are lot of things to learn and you get exposed to various customers throughout the world which helps to study about there culture get to know about various places around the world."
good,Chance to serve exciting people daily. Many celebrity and governmental officials.
good,Currently under new management. Everything is ready to be put into place.The new GM has the facility going into the right direction.
good,"It's an ok place to work. There is usually plenty of hours and work. Wasn't impressed by the management, very un-organized."
good,Horseshoe Bay is a hidden gem in Texas. It is a beautiful place to visit.
good,This was a brand-new restaurant in a brand-new hotel. This was a great opportunity to create unique specials and build clientele.
good,"a typical day revolved around keeping hotel guests satisfied and informed"
good,Aucun support de travail - fausses promesses - management quasi absent
good,"Marriott is a nice place to work but there was no room for advancement in my workplace. My co-workers are great to and just like any employment place you must be respectful of them regardless of how they may act. A typical day for me is to go in and answer emails, update numbers for the day, coordinate group resumes, contact clients with updated pickups and staff meetings at 9:00am and 1:00pm. Management needs a lot of work. I feel that in order to be a good manager not only should you know your job and do it well but you must be a people person and be able to relate to your staff and always have an open door policy. The hardest part of my job was not being able to fully use my skills the way I wanted. I have so much to offer and when you are in a position that limits you it is very hard. The part I enjoy is working independently and having flexibility. No matter whether I was in the office or not my co workers know that my job gets done and they keep that confidence in me."
good,"In a typical day at work I'd handle cash, checks and credit cards.  Worked directly with customers and delivered excellent customer service.  Management worked very well with employees needs, also directed and helped to make every employee be the best they can be.  The hardest part of the job was sometimes having to explain why the hotel was over-booked and why guests didn't have a room although they had a reservation.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new people every day and also forming business relationships with guests who visited frequently."
good,Decent pay and benefits.  Management lacked diplomatic skills.
good,I would have loved to stay with Starwood but the communication between departments and holding people accountable needs more work.
good,I did not feel part of a family. They were not sure of the direction they were headed.
good,"Low paying job for the amount of time, effort, and duties i was responsible for. "
good,"• A typical shift is about 9+ hours, majority of which is set up and clean up. Most guests staying at this hotel are business travelers who stay at the Marriott throughout the week, therefore the employees get to know and remember most of the clientele. "
good,"Each day presented a new challenge as all service industry jobs do, never know what the guests would do next.  Had great accounting team, so each day work was done accurately and timely."
good,We had to relocate due to wife's medical problems.  This complex is where the president would come to get away.  The little cuban boy that everyone was arguing about (Elion) was hidden & protected there.
good,Enjoy working here as I am responsible for many chores around the facilities. However pay is not all that great and I am looking to advance.
good,I learned that you can work hard all the time and not get any credit for what you do. My co-workers were wonderful and i love majority of them. The hardest part of my job was getting off at 12:00 am and having to be back at work at 5:00 am. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting people from all of the country.
good,working from early morning to late at night and doing all types of cooking for party of people
good,". morning ,evening shift its excellant"
good,"its not for everyone, need to be able to deal with high level of stress and pressure from managers and work place can be stressful, work extremely long hours. Can become a very rewarding job depending on which department you work in. A lovely perk is to interact with guests staying in hotel."
good,"It was a good company, butsome of th things that went on I did not agree with."
good,"Without my fellow associates who were also my friends I would have probably crashed and burned on my first day. It is all on the job training and they literally throw you in the deep end! My manager was remarkable, always kind, understanding and worked amazingly hard. However the supervisors not so much. They were unorganised, quick tempered and didn't have any consideration for all the new starters. When I actually got a break they did provide free food and drink."
good,"Aprendi a lidar com clientes de várias nacionalidades e culturas diferentes. Melhorei imenso o meu inglês falado e escrito, pois pratiquei diariamente. Aprendi a fazer relatórios, cálculos em excell, fiz tabelas estatísticas, geri um sistema de horários com turnos para 10 funcionárias. Escrevi e-mails, respondi a reclamações, fiz comunicações externas, corrigi documentação externa. Elaborei brochuras. Aprendi algumas técnicas de massagemm, técnicas de exfoliação, drenagem linfática, ayurvedra, técnicas de shiatsu, pressão, manipulação de membros. Atendi clientes, vendi produtos de beleza, fiz resevas de tratamentos por telefone e presencialmente. Criei procedimentos. Produzi cartões de fidelidade. Aprendi sobre talassoterapia e tratamentos alternativos. A parte mais agradável, o contacto com o cliente, aprender diariamente. A parte mais difícil, a comida na cantina."
good,"you start with the morning meeting. there you find out how many rooms are occupied and how many rooms are leaveing,what your focuse for the day is. you get to share a few laughs with some of your coworkers. the most enjoyable part of the day for me is seeing smiles on other peoples faces"
good,Hotel and hospitality.Customer service.My postion is very laid back at times and very busy at times.I have been with this company 1 year.I am currentyly looking for another career.
good,175 room hotel situated in the Napa Valley. Guests are treated well with staff going above and beyond for guest comfort.
good,I loved what I was doing but I did not like the management of the company. when there was a problem they did not want to hear it from you expecially if you were not in the management department.
good,"I work the front desk. We check guests in/out. You have to work 8-10 hours a day standing in one spot with only a 30 minute lunch break. Management does not like to promote from within the company, which is what Marriott endorses. Instead, they will hire from outside."
good,"Check the job listings, process any new hires if we had any for the day. Assist the associates with any questins that they would have. file all documents and assist the HR director on what ever she needed me to do."
good,"this was most structure hotel I had worked for so I was able to learn alot. typical day morning meeting daily plan and check emails respond go out on sales calls. come back and document all sales and what happened on sales calls call backs and problems, work happy hour."
good,An amazing learning opportunity! I joined the company during a time of growth and had the pleasure of working with a dynamic team of leaders who displayed the utmost level of professionalism at all times.
good,I liked my job. Sure there were issues that could've been taken care of better . Overall it paid the bills.
good,"Must meet sales goals to advance from within the company, nice co-workers, must stay on the phone as much a possible to close sales opportunities."
good,"I worked their on a part-time basis as a banquet-Hall Caterer. We had to set-up the hall according the clientels specifications. Sometimes it was an outdoor even, and, others the catering was out-inside one of our several halls.We had to serve the food, drinks, deserts, and other needs that the clients wanted. Then we had to brake everything down at the end of the banquet/party."
good,I work at a hotel answering internal and external phone calls. I also hep with checking in guest and changine resavations.I enjoy working with people and helping others i love my co-workers and enjoy working with them.
good,Typical day is okay until you have holidays or a special event and then you long hard days. No weekends off
good,A learning facility that always had workshops that Marriott supplied the types of food that was requested.
good,There is a lot of traffic flow because it is a well known and used business. It get stressful to meet goals if customers only come in for a specific reasons and nothing else.
good,"Customer Service is the best part of my job, Teamwork with co-workers, I learned to multi task for every department"
good,"Working night audit is a life altering shift and stressful being the untitled manager-on-duty. After a year, I realized manager didn't appreciate the good work enough to exempt me from the new set of Marriott tutorials on the Marriott Way, thus forcing me out of a job. I enjoyed the hotel and all the co-workers. Marriott runs a good ship, but over manages your life."
good,"This job is good for getting extra income and the management I had where I worked were really good, but most of the problems we have come from our franchise ownership company aimbridge, who would often not provide us with the materials or personnel to do our jobs correctly because they were trying to save as much money on overhead as possible. Marriott as a whole has some good policies, but often the day to day aspects of how the property is run is often determined by who owns the property."
good,Do not recommend working with a franchised hotel. The hotel has undergone multiple general managers and it has not improved through out the years. My direct supervisor is the reason I stay. She cares about her subordinates.
good,It was very fun and it was a pleasure working there. The management could’ve been a bit better and more respectful. Could’ve been managed in a much better fashion
good,This company always has an issue with their payroll system and employees pay. It is a constant battle with HR regarding your pay. That makes for a very stressful situation when you are not paid for the time you have already worked.
good,"O ambiente entre funcionários do mesmo nível hierárquico flui, porém a gerência não aceita ideias que possam melhorar certas atribuições no ambiente de trabalho, além de exigirem muito da pessoa sem prestar o exemplo."
good,"Marriott seldom promote african americans into management at the larger hotels. They mention in the beginning that they promote community oriented activities but when I asked for more information on the subject matter-management seemed lost. During the a suprise audit my name (along with 3 other employees) was mentioned due to me providing awesome customer service. We passed the audit! However,all employees received a $50.00 gift certificate but I only received $25.00 because I was part-time."
good,"Starwood International owned Westin Hotel. When Marriott took over, quality and staffing declined. Level of products and services has suffered. I would keep my position, but we are unable to staff appropriately."
good,"I was thrown into this position with little to no knowledge about the business.  I accepted and enjoyed the challenge most of the time.  If only I had a mentor-like-figure to ask any of the many questions that came up.  Instead, I spent a lot of my personal time at home doing research.  I worked more hours than anyone and was not appreciated until I left and they realized just how much I did there."
good,"A typical day is very fast paced and non-stop, you wouldn’t even dare think to sit down. Although you can get some nice food if you have some time to spare which is always great. It’s always very busy and there is lots to do. It is a very demanding job as it is rather understaffed which means you have to do a lot more work than you should. When I first started here I didn’t enjoy it so much and then I came to love it   however, with not many staff and poor management it has become a far less enjoyable job, I cannot imagine working here for the long term, although it is a good job to earn a fairly good amount of money."
good,"Managment is horrible here"
good,"I did a lot of cleaning of rooms and as inspector, inspected rooms for rent ready. I worked well with my coworkers and immediate leads. We always got into the spirit of the Holidays. The hardest part was the housekeeping carts and the set up of the property."
good,"When a project took too much time, they would add more project managers who would just book more meetings which slowed down the progress.  Also, old outdated data systems that slowed down progress with new technology."
good,You won’t make a lot of money. But the people are nice and the benefits are great. Especially the health insurance. If you want decent money then be a manager or chef or something like that. This is a service driven job so most make money off tips. It’s just okay.
good,"The incentives can be beneficial if you don't mind being a robot, and repeating the same thing over and over again. If you take time off, you better have atleast PTO available or pray that your shift can be traded to someone who need extra hours, other wise you will be written up."
good,The location of my employment had poor management. In the end they hired family and friends of management and they forced people out in the positions they wanted including me.
good,the most enjoyable part about the job was when we had a lot of stay overs. we as housekeepers we never got any help from the housemen. the management didn't care if you was hurt. just as long you finished there rooms.
good,I was hired for a front desk agent.  Instead I was put in a back room answering phone calls because I “ had a nice and pleasant voice”.  No training or mention of becoming a front desk agent.
good,The job is ok but it’s the management that’s unprofessional and not caring . You only get 27 hours of emergency time and if you have kids you know that will never work they basically don’t want you to miss no days unless you are dying
good,"Most times  my liquor cabinet had been opened prior to my arriving.  I rarely had a sufficient bank to open my register.  Management was unyielding in addressing issues.  "
good,"illegal conditions; no break on 8 hour shift. too much work for little pay. when I had training it was so unorganized I was sitting there for hours bored with nothing to do. only one person at the desk so cannot do anything, better hope no emergencies happen, you’re all alone! especially overnight i’ve had multiple bad experiences."
good,They paid pretty low but the job was very simple and slow paced the workers there are definitely under paid considering cost of living and whatnot in the area I was located
good,I enjoy the part time environment more then full time. They are pretty laid back and it is hard to get fired from this job. The employees are very friendly and do not try to stab you in the back to the work environment is good.
good,Room service is a fun job .Deliver the food is the east part and interact with guest.But the problem is that the managers are being there for way to long .Also the people that is being working for the company for long time are a bad example.If you are a server you are nothing that working horse and there is no future for you to advanced on the company.The kitchen make the food for Room Service the restaurant and also the Pizza delivery that is a joke and make no sense .because is the same pizza that RS deliver but cheaper.They cannot keep a good staff in the Kitchen because the pay is bad and they are under staff all the time and they don't really care about the guest that pay there salaries.But the real heros of the Room Service department are the servers that every day with a smile and keep going 24 7.
good,"There was absolutely zero care for the workers, there wasn't any consistency and all the managers were all on different programs. The night shift was great due to the bar-tending staff and the night time manager being the only one who knew what he was doing."
good,Management was very secretive and were not excellent with celebrating employees but the atmosphere of the employees was always fun and hard working. Would recommend
good,"I worked at the Marriott International for 1 yr and 4 months. I got the job thru a temp agency. "
good,I enjoyed working there with my co-workers. It was management that was the problem. They were rude and inconsiderate of other people's feelings and personal lives.
good,"Come in at 5am turn on all necessary stoves and grills."
good,"Marriott is a great company for college graduates trying to gain experience and on the job training.  For well established or management roles, their pay is very low, and the work life balance is non existent. "
good,"I start my day at 8am and end it at 4pm. It's a lot of work, but I enjoy  my job. I have great relationships with my co-workers and the guests, but management makes it incredibly difficult. I have been robbed of opportunities numerous times, and it's hard for me to find a way to grow within the company. I feel unsupported by my supervisor/managers, which makes me enjoy my job less. I"
good,"Was able to learn a lot about customer service and how to accommodate a variety of different guest situations and problems"
good,Needs more security and benefits for employees. Management's needs to improve on managing workers and also guests.Employees will be willing to do whatever I necessary if treated fairly and wright.
good,The management went off of assumptions. I was in the hospital and there was no way that I could've made it into work so they used that against me for me missing 1 day of work out of all the time I had put in.
good,"I was working for the Starwood before Marriott bought out the brand. Under the Starwood brand work was more comfortable. Your managers tended to care, rooms were ready, we had enough facilities to call ourselves a luxury property. After the messy merger with Marriott we lost a lot of departments and prices from rooms to restaurants raised to ridiculous amounts. It became embarrassing to offer a guest a standard room that had a view of a brick wall for around 300-400 a night. Transitioning over to a new computer system was lack lust and very confusing when your own Management team has no idea on what works and how to use it. Before Marriott working for the Starwood brand was amazing we treat our guest like family instead of a number"
good,"Marriott Hotel is a good company if you are at the beginning of your career and you do not have experience. They provide training in many areas, however, staff need to ask for it. It provides both full-time and casual contracts. Is better if you have your own car as is quite far from main road where you have public transportation."
good,I always felt like travelers are good people to be around. Love learning from them and hearing their stories.Always a fun environment to walk into every morning. Everyday had something new to learn. Good environment with great coworkers.Ive learned patience goes a long way. And a smile can really make someones day!
good,"As a female chef, it was hard to progress in a male dominated atmosphere. The pay for a management position was well below that of other management positions in the area."
good,I enjoyed my job but at the time I was going thru things as far as child care.. if I can get hired again I would definitely work there again.. it was unfortunate what I went through.. they made it seem like they were understanding to my disadvantages but they really were not...
good,Acepté este empleo por tratarse de una apertura. Queria probar el desafio.
good,The people you work with can be great.  The guests can be great as well. Work load can be overbearing and the company expects you to devote all of your time to them
good,"It's hospitality, that's what you expect. Schedules can get brutal, work/life balance is harsh, higher management is a lot of show, pay is kind of garbage. On the upside, they give you a lot of leeway in problem solving, management is supportive when you need it, coworkers are usually pretty fun, most of the gigs under management are easy, but busy. Better than retail, for sure."
good,Responsible for all basic front desk duties.  Decent benefits. No 401 k.  Overall pretty good management.  I would recommend working here as a step to gain experience.
good,I was hired under the impression that the Marriott was going to give me a set schedule after the 90 day period and that all ended being a lie. They've been requiring a single mother to work all nights and haven't lived up to their promises.
good,"Interesting work environment, the mix of security and hospitality  is a very hard mix.  The lack of job advancement is a the biggest disappointment within the hotel. The lack of team work is also a very big issue with in this industry!"
good,working on your own overnight is not as easy as management made it out to be. I had run back and forth from one kitchen to the next to do room service orders  while making breakfast buffets for the hotel
good,Interesting workplace. Manager was very dramatic. The turnover rate is high because a lot of people don't like the manager because of unnecessary drama.
good,"meeting people from all over and welcoming them so they can feel at home .making sure they are comfortable and have everything they need to make their stay great and relaxed as possible .the hardest is inspecting all 107 rooms and trying to make sure they are perfect .and not having the support from higher management  or help on a  busy day to have them on time ..it was very hard to discipline .i  take a lot on cause of management , housekeepers come in when they want and i have no say so just work with what i have to get the day completed"
good,"The new GM at the store we could do without but the rest of the job is great. Before that I had no problems at the job at all. The people were nice, coworkers become family."
good,Its fun work pleaces and always busy and learn new things everyday. People there are very helpful and when you ask for help they help you and work with your work days.
good,"Marriott did not explain that even though you are full time, they only give you hours based on the sales that the hotel accumulates. So you are not guaranteed 40/hrs a week which can result into one's check sometimes being short. The managers sleep with Human Resources employees and have nasty attitudes towards their associates. Some managers also beat up on homeless people to teach them a lesson about coming on the property. The Renaissance Harbor Place Hotel in Baltimore, Maryland to be exact."
good,The hotel was not doing well financially so cutbacks occured including raises were at a low.. No GM at times able to handle guest services and productivity changes ignored.
good,I enjoyed working here the place was so off track people kept quitting because people treat people not so good over there and I worked 70-80 hours and I get paid every 2 weeks and only got 5 something on my paycheck I don't think that they're seeing that we have children and families to support and they was not seeing that and still made me work so many hours and I wasn't able to get home to be my kid and my kid wasn't able to eat until 10: 11 at night everybody didn't want to work there because people are getting mistreated and we wasn't getting our laundry and stuff until 5 or 6 at night they were always running out of supplies and never getting the supplies when we need it so our customers were getting upset because they wouldn't get in the service that they were supposed to get and the reason why I had to leave there is because my babysitter accidents and incidents because he is in a wheelchair and they did not see that it wasn't my fault and they still a tenant to make it my fault when I told them from the very beginning that my babysitter was handicapped and then I have anybody else because they hired me so quick on
good,safe and professional work environment with excellent compensation for leaders. poor compensation for hourly workers. this property lacks realistic direction
good,Front Office Manager was not communicating employees' errors instead she would talk to other employees about a certain employee which would start a rumor and I think that is very poor management and only creates workplace conflicts. Also she passes on work to staff and leave early most days.
good,Management was outstanding at first but within two years they opened up a new Hotel in which resulted in poor management in our  hotel. Management did not care about our requests nor communicated properly
good,"Working at the Westin is very customer service heavy and dealing with entitled guest is very tiring. Dealing with power hungry and insecure management also does not improve team moral. "
good,"One of the most attractive hotels I have personally worked in.  The challenges that developed were in part due to a Union that stiff armed itself in to the hotel and certain departments had to be part of the union, while others did not.  The union didn't do anything for my department except take money out of my pocket.  Management refused to help us because we were union and they were not.  It was very ugly and very costly to me on a personal level.  Staffing was excessive, management help was next to zero.  Great potential, but much work is needed to help it achieve its true potential."
good,"This was a very fun place to work.  The staff that worked for me had a very teamwork spirit.  The Management staff was very political not "
good,The benefits are good.If you want to gain work experience it's a good place to start. I've seen many people move up in the company. There is always work to be done.
good,I love the guest interaction; I consider myself a people person.  I made some lifelong friends working at the hotel.  Management has changed frequently since working here which is unsettling.  A typical day would consist of counting the cash drawer at the beginning and end of shift; running an arrival report and ascertaining that special requests were handled for the guest; checking guests into their rooms; keeping the coffee bar full and clean; filling the guest market and keeping the hotel secure.
good,"The job is extremely demanding but keeps you engaged. The workplace environment can become quite stressful whether it is the customers, employee, or management interaction."
good,"There is nothing like working at a hotel. People from all walks of life work there and stay there. Very interesting, challenging and fun. Certainly glad I had that experience."
good,"The company has great benefits for full time staff, I have to say that the diversity of nationalities of the staff at the hotel makes the work environment very pleasant, you get to learn from so many different cultures, "
good,too many complaints regarding housekeeping and rooms being ready for check in in a timely manner. poor management unwilling to pay for quality reliable help in running the hotel efficiently. Management unwilling to go to outside services to improve customer satisfaction.
good,"Doing valet at the Westin/Sheraton hotel is a very good job if you need to make extra cash, but as of lately, service has been a lot slower at the current hotels."
good,Working at the front desk as night auditor allows you to meet different people and there are lots of recurring clients since it is located a the airport.
good,Very low chance for advancement. It's the hotel industry so you have to be there for while to move up. No room to move up. As a company Marriott offers a lot of great benefits.
good,"The work is good."
good,I would recommend working at a different location.Occupancy at this location rises and fall all of the time. You depend on the weather to plan your schedules and business levels.
good,"Okay hotel for someone who is new to the industry. Management was unprofessional. The GM at the time did not like to assist guests in person or over the phone. Operations manager told me I'd never make it as a guest service agent downtown - that I wouldn't be able to handle it. "
good,It was very quick-paced. It was very competitive. It was a lot of workers there. Everybody was rushing trying to see who would finish their work first.
good,"a typical day of work is greeting guest, answering phone calls and checking them in. "
good,This call center is horrible I won’t  let no one work they are un organizations and the supervisor are always gone .. they don’t care the worker health
good,"The perspective I gained while working at the Springhill Suites I do not believe is the most accurate on which to base the brand as a whole. In fact I think the negative attributes are the result of changes and instability at the ownership level; which is further supported by the heightened sensitivities of its GSR/ITR stats. Within the 3-4 months I was employed the property had 3 different GMs as well as a 80% turnover rate. In hindsight I see that it was a self-perpetuated challenge to the morale, operations and overall potential of the property."
good,"Fairly easy job, coworkers easily get along together. Management and supervisors however are very rude and disrespectful to their employees, very unprofessional"
good,"– Dealing with bookings by phone, e-mail, fax or face-to-face and completing"
good,Managers have to work crazy hours and really don't get paid enough.  Hourly associates don't have it so bad but everyone who is good usually gets pushed into a managerial role.
good,Working at Hotel Marriot was a good experience for me. Managers and the team were always available to helped me understand what exactly my job description was at the moment.
good,high turnover. Could definitely use improvements. Listen to the front office staff and equip them so that can efficiently service guests. Mass firings.
good,Slow. Room service cook so never was busy. Poor menu in my opi ion for high end hotel. Needs to improve on menu. Definitely needs to improve on pay also.
good,"I liked working here. So beautiful right on the water. Outdoor spa on a second floor of a retail shack. Minimal services. Facials and massage. Very easy, we just take the linens to the hotel laundry and that's it. We straighten our area and day is done."
good,There was no communication when I was worked here. Management seemed to take sides a lot. Mostly toward employees who had been there for years. The use you and once something happens and they can use you anymore the let you go.
good,"I enjoyed some parts of working at the Marriott, the team were lovely. But the long hours and the constant push from managers to upsell wore on me so I didn't stay there long."
good,Fun work environment. Friendly employees. Fast Pace. I like all the employees that I worked with. I like dealing with guests'. Beautiful Hotel. Friendly people.
good,"Realice mi practica de 2 meses por lo que no se mucho  de la empresa, el departamento en el que me desempeñe tenia un muy buen ambiente laborar y trabajo en equipo. Aprendí a utilizar Opera, hacer cargo a tarjetas de crédito, realizar y tomar llamados de clientes."
good,Handling too many number of guests is a normal day at Le Meridien new delhi.LM New Delhi teach you from the basic to the advance level. The teach you to treat one and all guest with ease at once.
good,"Bonne ambiance entres les salariés, cependant les managers sont pas vraiment agréables."
good,"a good place to gain experience will a lot of superior to show the direction."
good,"Lots of expectations from supervisors who haven't even done the job. They never had to reach the same requirements yet get advancement for knowing or being related to someone. Coworkers were the biggest pro about the work place. The actual job itself wasn't enjoyable, being told we had to pretend to be at the hotel so the guest would ""believe"" us then get yelled at by the guest because we lie. So many loopholes and not very structured. Worked here for a year and became severely depressed. Everyone I know that works here wants to quit."
good,"Great place to work, but they are not always that understanding. And the pay is not as great as it should be for the hours that some of us work. But overall I like my job. It pays the bills."
good,Nice place to work for an entry-level job. People are very friendly and helpful. Management can be strict sometimes. Benefits are very good. Employees get discounted rates when staying at other marriott hotel brands.
good,Daily tasks include all aspects of digital marketing for a variety of hotel brands and properties. Organization structure lacks growth potential so I am seeking opportunities elsewhere.
good,"This is a union property so it is very difficult to be fired so you have job security, however you do not get a retirement plan which is ridiculous.  Other benefits are good, like healthcare and vacation/personal days."
good,"Typical responsibilities include vacuuming, dusting, laundry, mopping and waxing floors and changing and laundering linen.Also cleaning windows and furniture."
good,The hours are good for a seasonal job. It was a great experience to work in a hotel full of wonderful people and guest. I would consider going back and working there.
good,"The Marriott International account is probably the best account to be on with PeopleScout. Compensation, Benefits and Advancement opportunities are less than mediocre."
good,I was a bellman at the westin in DTLA for about a year. My coworkers were great and helpful. the Captains were good people and the work was very easy aand tips were good too. The only downside was the management. extremely unreasonable. none of the workers respected her. she has terrible people skills and not willing to work with her assoociates. good luck requesting a day off with her no matter how much time in advance you give her. aside from her the job is not bad and at times pretty fun.
good,"Other than head chef  the management (senior sous - junior sous) ridiculous, lazy, annoying, stressful, gotten rid of loads of chefs work load tripled, not hiring anymore expect you to go above and beyond and still not good enough. No time to do proper cooking all bought in and chucked out as quick as possible kitchen has no money and direction. Rubbish menu no ala carte."
good,"Coordination of the Housekeeping operations, prepare and assign room attendants boards, inspects rooms, evaluate room attendant performance, train new employees, make schedules, purchasing and inventory,  investigate complaints regarding housekeeping service and take corrective action."
good,"When I first started working there it was a safe secure place to be. but since then all accountability have been lost. Upper management has over reached and now the work loads are impossible and they do not seem interested in expanding the staff or work facilities, just the guest count."
good,Great job to gain experience but the people are really cut throat. I was paid well though banquets but the rest of the hotel was average. It's room for advancement if u have the ambition.
good,"Good company"
good,"Challenging work environment"
good,"We get blamed for unhappy guests when we never have help from management and are so understaffed. We have to do everyone else's jobs plus our own making it very difficult to make connections with guests, be in a good mood & do our jobs correctly."
good,I was laid off because of new central office opening in Orlando. This hotel had many management challenges and the work/life balance was not the best. The turn over was also very high making it difficult to properly staff and manage traning.
good,The typical day at the Sheraton Hotel was somewhat busy. I learned a lot of new things when dealing with financial matters. The management of the hotel was discombobulated but somehow did what they needed to do. The hardest part was communication because certain departments felt more entitled than others. The only enjoyable part about the hotel was the very few coworkers that were actually considerate and did care.
good,my time at the westin was short lived due to management incompetence. i did not want to with their again although i know many of my colleagues were at least base line satisfied with their jobs. not for me
good,"Innovative and associate focused company determined to take care of all guests and be the leading company in the hotel industry. Where as it is any amazing company as an associate to work, work life balance for management is not a focus making it hard to stay with the company."
good,The routine of repetitive work was okay and I picked up a lot of work experience but the pay wasn't desirable and job stability wasn't guarantee...
good,working with checking guest in and out. faxing and answering the phones. You learn how to please the guest and make them feel comfortable with their stay.
good,"booked hotel reservations.  Found the best hotel rate for customers.  Learned how to interact with people on all levels, daily.  The best part of the day was making sure customers were satisfied with their final hotel rates."
good,"A typical day was organized to start, but then as soon as there were ""too many customers"" it would become more hectic. In addition to this there appeared to be a lack of communication between the senior staff."
good,Ok place. Pretty fun place to work not that much staff so the hrs would be alittle off An that could cause confusion other then that great place to work
good,"I got to learn may things in this hotel. All the staffs in the front office encouraged me whatever the work my superior gives . "
good,Great team members to work with. I really enjoyed getting to know my coworkers. I really enjoyed getting to know the residents. I loved the work environment that I was able to have during the time I was there.
good,Everyday you get to complete the same tasks. Management is great and co-workers also. The hardest part of job would be you stand all day but you get used to. A perk is you get employee discount on hotel rooms.
good,The people at this company work really well together. No one who is higher level act like they are better than you in any way. We are all equals and help you out in whichever way they can to help you move forward. A lot of opportunities to move up
good,"I learned how to be a proper server and how to handle certain and specific situations."
good,"The hotel world is very stressful, requires long hours, and pays very little. Opportunities to advance are plentiful but they require work to be your entire life."
good,"Trabajo rutinario, comida para empleados previo descuento de 3 Pounds al dia en la nomina."
good,"- Supervision of the bar and restaurant operations. Administration work."
good,Throughout my time working with the company I was able to grow professionally feel like that experience has really helped me become an ideal employee.
good,"I really like working for Marriott, and I think that sticking with a company show how dependable I have been. But the management has been on the decline for many years and the business seems to be running out of money. The turnover is very very high. There is no support for new employees. And older employees, like me, have to work through bad situations with our own determination. Overall, the culture is great and I love most of the people I work with and the guest that come into the hotel. But it has been hard to feel motivated and do a great job or even be there."
good,"For the most part, management lacks any talent on all levels and caters to the lcd and very petty. Many very important things are overlooked, it a constant uphill battle to make sense of their decisions."
good,"Clock in and read the notes passed down from the previous shift, count the drawer and witness the previous shift's drop, print all documents needed for the day, such as arrivals and the next day's departures. Greet/Check-in guests. This job has taught me patience, communication, and problem solving. I would say the hardest part of the job was running the hotel all by myself while attending to the guests needs, checking in the late arrivals, and dealing with reoccurring emergencies. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers due to their great attitude and story telling."
good,"I arrived at work at 6 a.m. once I clock in I start the coffee stations I brew 8 to start my day. if I'm working at night I stock my beer caddy and my wine seller before I start anything. once I'm done with that i serve food and wine too my guess. I cook at night time and the bartender as well on top of being the server . My nights are really busy from start to finish. in the a.m. I'm severing and top of giving the best customer I can.  In the mornings its more of a heavier flow. in the a.m. I'm taking orders and making coffee filling ice for guest in the hotel. I'm running around non stop from the kitchen to the lobby from taking phone calls. I talk with front desk most of my day to unsure if guest have free breakfast are not. so I'm always making calls back and forth to them.  I'm in the lobby talking and connecting with our guest. making sure everything is okay with there food and making sure there stay is much better once they come eat. after the bistro closes we clean up for our night crew, stock and prepare for the next days to come. "
good,Working for Marriott is fun at times. I enjoy the work schedule and the benefits that we have.The GM is great.  The staff is really good and down to earth. Management can be better.
good,I learned a lot at this job from cleaning the rooms to laundry to security to even helping out in the bistro. I loved the people I worked with.
good,"Great benefits pay varies... Management was not so good one of the reasons why I left, guests not so great either but that's part of the hotel business .. I  would always noticed a lot of workers depressed going into work as you walk into the workers courters you notice everyone either has a frown or smudged face. its quite funny actually you could definitely pick out the new workers from the general work population its always the same they're happy and excited for a good  three weeks then turn into a zombie like the rest of us. the only joyful people are the owners. This paragraph is in no way trying to scare you from working here there are great perks and great benefits and maybe tolerable management if you are lucky unfortunately for me it didn't transpire well."
good,I do not really know what to say on here because I didn't really like my jobs in the hotel world. I would prefer to have my own space with company associates to work with in a private yet public setting.
good,"The staff is only friendly to guest, behind the scenes employees are rude, disrespectful, and childish. I am speaking about management mostly, they have their favorite employee and if you can not fit in with their ""crew"" then you get fired! It has nothing to do with how well you do your job or your work ethic."
good,"Terrible management leads to high turnover of good employees and there are no real opportunities for advancement. On the other hand, there are very loyal guest who loves the staff and keeps coming back because of the staff."
good,"learned a lot about hotel business"
good,Supplies a steady income but not enough to make a living. Teaches alot for those who are willing to learn but a hard company to move up in. Management could be more caring of their employees wellbeing but can only offer what corporate allows them to.
good,"The hotel I worked for was a freshly opened babe of a Courtyard. Our opening staff worked amazingly to try and make the hotel the best it could be. However, the managing staff slowly turned sour and working there became quite troublesome. They barely listen to requests for time off, schedule changes or pleas to leave early due to debilitating pain of the employee (menstrual cramps, migraines, autistic related hallucinations.) The working staff themself is wonderful, so if you do work there, at least you'll have friends."
good,Polyvalent dans tous les points de vente de la restauration.Pas d'opportunites de developpement.Pas beaucoup de chef de rang beaucoup plus de manager.Collaborateurs pas tres efficace et mal veillant.
good,"Buen lugar para aprender, los puestos son exigentes, siempre hay nuevas experiencias."
good,"Serious, productive, unfriendly co-workers, jealousy, and demanding"
good,"There was not a typical day working there. Everyday there was something different to take on. What I learned was that due to the demand of availability, there really is not a compromise in schedule adjustments. My co-workers were decent for the most part. The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to reconcile the numbers from the day while dealing with high volume of guests at the same time. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,Job was simple. Quit due to housekeepers were stealing from the hotel and the guests and no one was doing anything about it.  Didn't want to be involved in the drama.
good,"work under pressure ,low technical support,not proper production planning, one person have work in multiple job profile"
good,"Okay place to work, expectations is no where near what expected when going to a Marquis property. 70% of shift running food and picking up glassware as there isn't enough support staff."
good,I've personally developed my work ethics dramatically. From coming to work on time to working 60+ hours a week during the cruise season. They really give an opportunity to improve yourself and project your potential to upper management.
good,El estar día a día en contacto con el huésped y estar abierto a aprender otras culturas.
good,"working side by side with operation for process improvement. Love the holiday parties, and got to meet so many interesting people"
good,"Very corporate job, The management and training I received was great. This was a good place to do a school internship. Lots of hours and not that great of pay."
good,Enjoyed selling events and Marketing. Great team of servers and chef. Pay was terrible considering the work load and expectations.
good,"My night began a little bit before 11pm. Getting there before 11pm would give me a bit of a head start on the evening. Get a shift change briefing, and GO!!! Be it checking in guests, handling guests calls or issues, or my check list. I ""prefer"" to work with management personnel who know what it means to be ""on the front line""; who will work beside me if necessary; who are genuinely interested in who their employee/team member is and recognizes how hard he/she works. The hardest part of the job was not being able to always accommodate my guests needs, concerns or issues, and in a timely manner. As with most jobs in this industry, the most enjoyable part of the job is the guests. Meeting new friends and taking care of the old ones. Last, but not least, is the people I've worked with. If I'm already sharing a smile with a co-worker, it's going to still be there when a guest approaches and shared just the same. As with any job, you have down times, and what better way to spend that time than making a new friend or simply getting to know someone, or just listening (personal or professional). I'm a talker. I can put my grandmother to shame."
good,a typical day at work would be me coming in a recieving a detailed sheet of hotel rooms that needed a walk through to insepct everything was safe and ready for guest to occupy rooms during there stay whether it was cosmetic or matinance that had to be done
good,Not knowing what has been done about functions ahead of time. Little time to react to errors made by others. unnecessary stress. Disappointed after years of service. Lack of understanding of the value of my dedication for the work done.
good,Management regularly checked in with us to ensure we were providing the best possible customer service to Westin guests. Getting to exercise while making a comparable living was very enjoyable.
good,"one of the williams day marriage it was really got full in dinning area,with in a time i was alone and my team mate joined he was confused a lot then i guide him cool down,which all guest were in good mood and not complained anything. they do understood the situation, the day which we were not expected the same. i really enjoyed that day as challenge, which wont be again in the work place..."
good,"Verified and recorded daily cash deposits, prepared and distributed billing for all airlines, provided resolution for customer inquiries and provided exemplarycustomer service in all aspects of the job.  The management team actively interacted with employees.  I had the best co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was meeting the very demanding deadlines.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the very demanding deadlines."
good,"Marriott was a good place to learn, but trying to reach out of the box to talk to people took a long time. The cubicles were stuffy and it was hard to network"
good,"A Quick start for the career & a great personality development."
good,"No room to advance in this company. Co-workers were very pleasant loved the people there. The management was very poor. I would express my concerns with different issues through text/letters and did not get any replies. No communication between manager and employees. No communication between front desk staff and back of the house workers. Spa is very clean and tidy, very visually appealing. However, the spa is extremely tiny. No waiting room. The job was very easy and a typical day at work went smoothly for me. Nice clients, nice co-workers, manager had a ""my way or the highway"" mentality. Do not make suggestions or try to add your own pizzaz to a service. Manager was a boss, not a leader. Do not expect guidance, reviews, mentoring, advanced training, or coaching from manager. I am a fan of the Aveda products used there. Overall I would give it a 3 out of 5."
good,"Co-workers are helpful and want to work together to achieve goals. "
good,"Busy, and quite fast.  my co-workers are nice and willing to train me on what I don't know.  there was no hard part of this job.  I enjoyed going home feeling I accomplished alot"
good,Company itself is a good. However i worked for privately owned Marriott. General manager was a horrible boss. The hours are good if you are going to school and its very flexible.
good,fast pace. how to work on heat pumps exc. work with a good group of people. unplugging clogged washrooms.learning new things
good,It's really an ok place to work! Management is very laid back which has its good points if you like working like that. I prefer having a manager who is strictly by the book that way things seem to run smoother.
good,"Fun working with everyone, alot of different cultures and learning new things daily."
good,"My only complaint would be poor organization and communication between management, other than that, good part time job for young people. Fun environment."
good,"I appreciate Starwood but they have made it so difficult to make bonuses and incentives. Opportunity for growth is good, but the pay isn't worth it to me."
good,"I worked as a Room service order taker for 5 months,  enjoyed the job and my co-workers.  The pay for this job is really low,  they didn't tell me until after i was hired how low it was.  Management is poor. . Lots of gossip between the manager and the employees, never had a requested day off or a weekend.  Management does not put the employees first on anything or even seem like they care ."
good,"Marriott is a great company to work for, the computer system is outdated and slow. I have enjoyed my time working with the company, and look forward to growing within Marriott."
good,Greet guest with a positive attitude and ensure the restaurant is ready for business. Manage the deposits and employees all have there work assignments for the day. Placing food and beverage orders. Hiring qualified individuals for expanding business. Great work hours but weekend sometimes..
good,Co workers were always great but management didnt seem overly concerned with the workload.I learned multiple thing working here including light maintanace and plenty of constumer service. I cross trained multiple times.But there was no advancement opprotunities. I felt over looked quiet a bit.
good,it was an ok place to work while in college. not interested in staying afterwards didn't really work with my career goals.
good,"It was a very interesting job,it is fast spaced environment, I learned "
good,I loved working for the Marriott in college. The schedule fit with my class schedule. Lots of great benefits such as discounts on hotels and such. I enjoyed it.
good,it's nothing to write home about. everyone is their own boss. hours are very far and few. it pays the bills and I guess that's all I can ask for.
good,Environment is relaxed at times. Employee morale is definitely at an all-time low. Not much business at hotel so that means less hours available which means not much money to be made.
good,"If you have good management then its a great opportunity. If not then you may find it harder to move up. Flexible schedule means that you will never have a consistent schedule. When occupancy levels drop over the seasons, the 40 hours you usually get as a fulltime employee will disappear. Managers suggest that you save PTO for slow months when hours are cut. However sick days and vacation days are taken out of the same PTO. Hourly pay could better. Promotions are nonexistent unless you know someone."
good,"I would arrive at work, and I would check to see how many arrivals we had for the day. We usually would have a lot of business travelers so they requested a room with one bed most of the time. The hardest part of the job was when a guest need couldn't be attended to. For example, some days our hotel would be oversold on rooms with a single bed, and that would annoy guest because we would have to put them in a room with two beds. I would always apologize and show a lot of empathy, as well as try to give them Marriott rewards points just for the inconvenience. Most of the guest appreciated that I was trying to help them and that always made me happy that they were happy."
good,Se trabaja a través de una ETT y lo malo es que se trabaja por días y no se tiene mucha estabilidad laboral ya que nunca se sabe cuando habrá trabajo.
good,A typical day at work here was busy and sort of stressful. I learned how to balance trays and carry them without dropping any food. Management was good because they always lend a hand if it gets real busy and they also love to work.My co-workers were also good because there was no finger pointing when someone messes up. The  hardest part is doing the dishes after every event we served. I enjoyed this job because it had some to do with food and I love cooking and anything involving food.
good,"i learned many things including sales, responsibility, being comfortable handling money and learning how speak to people in a business manner."
good,"As a room service attendant, I was required to take orders (upselling where possible) and deliver as requested. As a mini-bar attendant, monitored levels of stock in room and date of expiry, restocking as appropriate."
good,This is a positions that requires that you self manage. The organization over all is great but the grant that we worked on made the job incredibly difficult and much more rushed than it should be.
good,"Diamond is a great manager, and the Marriott is a great company to work for."
good,"I worked as a chef or cook for marriot industries which included locos bar and grill and also huddle house.The job was fairly easy , although if the crew before your shift didn't prep it could make it somewhat difficult or you'd play catch up if you have a rush of customers."
good,"Qualifying leads and building relationship with clients, prospect for new accounts and clients, provide site tours for clients and brides, detail and service all events."
good,Met many interesting individuals and it was first step into food industry as well as customer service.
good,"Only can speak for my experience at this Marriott.  My workers were wonderful, team players! "
good,Möte av kunder på plats eller via telefon. Jag har lärt mig att förstå hur kunden tänker. Det fanns en tävlan som varit positiv på ena sidan samt en negativ med stora krav på att lyckas.
good,"Although I am fairly new with Sawgrass, I have been part of such a fast pace and growing franchise. The hardest part of my job was trying to get my work done within a 40 hour work week. Working in events, its very hard to juggle a normal work schedule (9-5). I enjoyed networking with companies and being the reason why their event turned out so well."
good,"White lodging runs this property and they like to save a lot of money by not spending any. They think they are saving money, but they are really making it hard for the associates to do their job. Front and Back of house managers do not know what is going on all the time and are not there to see what happens. Most of the time they are in a hurry to leave to go home and not help others out. No one is a team player and you always have to watch out for yourself, because upper management does not care if you are there or not they just want you to do your job or have someone else pick up their slack to do the job."
good,"A General Reservations Agent is to answer inbound calls and assist customers looking to make or change a reservation. The job was target oriented, and as a part of the job a GRA must try to get every booking possible. I found the most difficult part of the job to be trying to sell a booking to a customer who was clearly uninterested in one."
good,overall my experience at marriott was positive. i wish i could have grown further in the company.
good,The discounts for the rooms were great. The guests were awesome along with my co workers.
good,haven't worked there in years. but when I did it was just answering phone and dealing with a lot of unsatisfied customers.
good,Very hard to have a personal life when being an on call manager in the hotel industry.
good,typical day includes sitting at a station and answering many calls worldwide and reserving hotels for the customer. i learned how to be more patient with myself. management were a great help throughout the whole training time frame and there were always more than one there to help . hardest part of the job is being able to sit there and talk on phones for 8.5 hours long. most enjoyable was being able to help out the customer to their satisfaction.
good,I was the night audit person which meant I ran end of day reports and distributed to correct personnel.  I was also responsible for checking in/out of customers for their vacations.  I enjoyed servicing this clientel because they were always very nice to me.
good,"Starwood is a great brand with exceptional individual hotel brands.  "
good,"It was cool."
good,"A day a Marriott is fast paced for the most part, that's what I like about the job. I come in contact with a wide variety of people and that gives me the ability to learn how to adapt. Adapting would also be what I've learned to do the most, not only is every culture different but everyone within a culture is different as well. The hardest part of the job for me is dealing with things that I feel can be changed but no one takes the time and effort to do it. I understand that management has a voice but as the people under management should be able to voice their options. A company is only as good as their employees. Happy employees are good employees."
good,"I loved working for the Residence Inn because there was always something that needed to be done so found a way to make myself stay busy until my shift was over even if that results me doing a job that isn't always mine. Every morning I would cook complimentary breakfast Monday through Friday from 5am to 9 am. When breakfast was over I would breakdown breakfast by sanitizing the breakfast station, hand wash all dishes being used, clean the oven daily."
good,"Fast Past"
good,The GM is a control freak who does not appreciate input from his team and does not allow personal growth. One of the hardest people that I have ever worked for in 40+ years in the job market.
good,"I arrive at 5:30 for setup. Breakfast starts at 6:30. I meet and greet each guest with a smile and pleasant conversation.Sometimes I find myself giving advice as I am maintaining the refill and cleanliness of the buffet area.There are quite a few races I come across being in the hotel industry and I've learned that we are all human and everyone wants to b treated with respect.The management team is nice but I look forward to seeing and working with my co-worker because we laugh,joke and share but the best part is we all respect one another.The hardest part of my job I would have to say is when the workers in my department have differences and I'm stuck in the middle.The most enjoyable parts of my job is that I get to meet all types of people and learn different things about what they do in there culture and my co-workers."
good,"The typical day consists of tending to the guests many need and going above and beyond what would be typically expected. I've learned my different aspects of serving and how to handle and solve any situation. Management is more hands on, and will help out whenever needed. Co-workers typically have been there for many years and are vary familiar. The hardest part of the job is the constant demand of flexibility of scheduling, and being able to wrap a personal life around it. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the guest and getting to know them better."
good,"Management not that good"
good,Provide legendary service and make coffee. Hardest part of job is remembering Starbucks procedure . Best part of the job is getting to interact with customers.
good,"You will do very high volume and get to create elegant dishes and be able to create these on your own if they pass the chefs approval, but you don't have any training, so it's sink or swim and unless you got experience or a solid strength and focus you can get the job done"
good,"Work as a breakfast chef, good place to learn about hotels, manager were good most of the time and they were helpful when you had a question."
good,A typical day to day working and I have learned lots of things in my working its really a tough job n enjoying also everyday looks a new type of work n I do best of my best and its management is good .My co-workers are very helpful and also a tough competitor but another part it was very nice and gentle persons .
good,"This a great company to work for. There are many opportunities to grow and to continue educational development while working with Marriott. Unfortunately recent events has cause the property to lose some of their well-seasoned managers which has impacted the work/ life balance in a major way. This change also came at a time when the building is going under renovation, the business has picked up tremendously, and the company is trying to restaff for the associate to prepare for business. This has resulted in 6 and 7 day work weeks and 12-15 hour days which makes it hard to accomplish any outside chores. We are fortunate to have a very dedicated team that tries their best but some of them are starting to feel overworked and unappreciated. It will be a long journey ahead for the property but this is a strong company that has overcome many obstacles in the past and will make its way through this one."
good,"I cant complain to much about working at spring-hill suites, overall great co workers and working environment. If you do your job you will not have a problem."
good,I like all I do meeting guest and maintaining standards set .I attend to vendors and taking inventory and general kitchen operation.
good,"love working here, very  fun but no pay raises or career advancements"
good,Cooking and preparing meal for customers on a daily basis. This was 13 years ago.
good,"standing for long periods of time, poor management that is clueless about the operations, enjoy meeting customers from all over the world"
good,"Working at the Residence is very unpredictable. Your days will never be repeated, as things are constantly changing."
good,My first entry in the corporate world was from this Hotel. I have worked hard to gain more and more both practical and theoretical knowledge from the organization.
good,i really enjoyed my time as an employee of Residence Inn such a friendly environment and the hospitality was exceptional!
good,"In Starwoodhotels ho cominciato ad occuparmi di tutto il processo di selezione e di formazione del personale."
good,Starwood Metro Market Sales team concept has not been executed properly at this time. They still have a lot of work to do with the MM. The overall company is great if you are outside the MM.
good,"On a typical day at work, I would set up and close banquet events as well as clean different areas around the hotel. During setup, I would have to take the clean table cloths and put them on the tables. The glasses and silverware would have to be cleaned and set out in specific order, so I would have to arrange them. I would converse with the staff and guests, vacuum the halls, take out the trash, and set out the chairs.   "
good,"i was told in the interview process that i would recieve a raise after 90 days as well as all the overtime i could work. both things were false. my manager was NEVER there and everytime she was she was writing me up for taking downtime. downtime was something they encouraged us to take when there were too many employees working. they stressed that taking down time had absolutely no penalty to you, and then wrote me up for it. "
good,Everyday was a busy day with new and different tasks. It was never a dull moment. I learned so much. I loved the team here.
good,"Booking hotels and planning vacations was great fun and I loved when people got excited about their upcoming trips. There were some people who were not as pleasant, but we learned how to deal with that."
good,"Most days are the same, come in prep, get busy, slow down, clean up and go home. In the midst of this the Chef will definetly go out of his way to ensure all of his line cooks are taken care and will teach what he can given the time constraints. The other line cooks all get along like they're family. The most stressful part of the job is dealing with the masses all at once"
good,"An typical day at work would be a 1st or 2nd shift, which is usually 7am to 330pm. My day would start with an front office meeting to inform each staff member on the daily itinerary. After the meeting is over I than proceed to my office which is an extension of the front desk department to start my daily task. I am responsible for all external and internal calls regarding the hotel, responsible for emailing and faxing guest billing concerns and handling all problem solutions within the hotel. What i have learned from management is to take advantage of the opportunity when it presents itself. I have a great relationship with all my coworkers. The hardest part about the job was the scheduling on weekends. The most enjoyable part about the job is satisfying the guest with the notion of seeking the opportunity to go above and beyond customer service."
good,"A typical work day for me at the Residence Inn consisted of me exchanging used linen for clean linen, disposing all of the trash, and neatly stocking and organizing the carts at the end of the day"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is fun
good,"Depende muito do gerente de cada setor, no meu caso o meu gerente foi bem compreenssivo, aceitando a minha religiao e foi bem flecsivel com a minha escala de trabalho,bem como de toda equipe.foi uma esperiencia muito boa pois aprendi a trabalhar em equipe."
good,I was hoping to find excellence in a stable work environment. I needed a change.
good,"Starwood Hotels is a good place to work, at least at first. They make quarterly policy changes, I mean major ones, that effect what you get written up for to what kind of schedule you'll be basically able to qualify for (yes, you have to hit several very difficult goals and other matrix items to pick a decent schedule). Too many hurdles and loops to jump through to make any good regular monthly commission bonus paid out as a inbound sales rep (very challenging no matter how loyal you are or how hard you work at it). Overall nice culture at the Austin, TX location."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships I build with my customers and the loyalty they bring.
good,"Ability to utilize my administrative skills, work independently and provide assistance to staff."
good,Low pay and no guarantee of hours. Comfortable work environment.
good,"A typical day of work at the Marriott usually consists of arriving at 3pm. I check the guests in and inform them of all the amenities that the hotel offers, we then valet their car to a parking garage close by. I am responsible for making sure that everything is stocked including snacks, towels, business cards and other front desk supplies. My trainings have included front desk, bistro, bar, valet, and banquets. As a banquet server Ii have learned to set up for events, carry trays, serve guests and clean up at the event's conclusion. Set up can include putting out tablecloths and place settings, arranging table placement and putting up a buffet. As valet I have learned to park cars to designated spots and to retrieve them in a timely fashion. At the front desk I have learned to welcome the arriving guests, provide information service, receive and process reservations, Filling of the arrival and departure register, dealing with complaints and handling them, communication and coordination with other departments, and doing check in & checkout. The hardest part of my job is that the schedule comes out 1 day before the schedule starts and late hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with different types of people and learning in a fast paced environment."
good,Le Parker Meridien is an excellent place to learn both the good and bad. Hospitality is an extremely hard industry to work in. Le Parker Meridien shows you the best of it and the worst of it.
good,Enjoy working for marriott very like minded people guests are fun
good,Very employee friendly. HR department is very fast paced and my team is very helpful.
good,great bunch of people to work with and the work was great. they are willing to work with you to make sure you have the right skills.
good,A typical day it's most likely any day or every day.
good,I usually start my day with a daily meeting with my staff to discuss the events for the day. From then on i start helping my team assisting guest.
good,"Mu shift started generally at 3pm until 11pm. I has to supervise the entire operation of the hotel and had total responsability of it once the General Manager was out of the place. I learned to gain respect from co workers, specially men, as being in charge was not an easy task to overcome daily, thus being the hardest part of the job. I enjoyed learning about every department in the hotel and its importance for the whole operation."
good,I take care of the pool and anything else that is broken. I change light bulbs and power wash sidewalks when needed.
good,management very poor desision making and very poor communication between different departs.
good,"I worked in the sales and marketing department and management acts like they are there for you and support you but it's all a show. They'll fire you at a drop of a hat, stab you in the back before you can turn away and turnover is continous in my department I worked. The pay sucks and they don't pay you what your worth. Working with other employees was really great."
good,"While being employed here I learned brand standards and how better to interact with people. My immediate co-workers made this job worth while. We were a postive and hard working team that helped one another every shift. I enjoyed the company benefits which included healthcare,401k, and discounts on travel with the company. The most challenging part of the job was lack of qualified management staff."
good,"Working at the greenbelt marriott at first was fun because your learning new things and materials. After a year and months working there it really has been down, part of the hardest thing to do is to stand around not doing anything."
good,"Depending on amount of rooms sold, most days are routine, very structured with lists and guidelines to follow."
good,"If you don't mind micro management this is the place for you! I've been here since we were corporately owned by Starwood. Once this property was franchaised out they seem to monitor every little thing you do. It took awhile to get used to but hey, every company does things differently right?"
good,"Great co-workers. Decent menu. I was promised to work directly under a renouned French Chef. Unfortunately, it turned out that the chef was never to be seen..."
good,Rewarding when customer give recognition for how they were treated. Great opportunities to make build customer relationships and returning customers. Great hotel stay benefits offered to employees and star points for discount hotel vacation stays.
good,It was a nice company to work for. Nice staff.. great atmosphere
good,"I joined Marriott after working for a smaller company, I learned a great deal of knowledge and experience in sales and customer relations working at Marriott as an Account Executive. It certainly is a different culture with quite a bit of internal processes compare to a smaller company. Great sales training and available online classes."
good,"Enjoyed job, team of associates and guests. Balance between work life and home life was extremely unbalanced."
good,Its great to work for a company with employees with so much experience in the hospitality field.
good,"With over 60 conference rooms and 2 ballrooms, the hotel is in a great location in the heart of Times Square for great functions, events and expos. I have attained a beneficial experience working with the Events Department."
good,"Working from home was a definite plus, however not having a supervisor for one on one basis made learning your job more difficult. 90 % training was done over conference calls."
good,"I liked working there it just had some bad qualities as well. I was told when i got hired in 3 months you will be become full time and earn benefits. Well when that time came around they didn't have the hours to give me. I was sorta confussed because i was told one thing know you are going back on you ""promise""! I was a little upset because i did enjoy working there and there were soon going under and upgrade and a new restaurant."
good,Company started out great was bought out by another company and everything went downhill. Has some great employee benefits most of the management teams were great.
good,"While I can't say this was my least favorite job, it was far from the best. The job was monotonous and the days dragged. Dealing with entitled guests on a day to day basis was enough for me to go bald."
good,"The hours were not flexible at my location, the pay did not compensate me for the energy I dispersed and after voicing my frustrations management overlooked my concerns."
good,I love working there .but it was not mange right went the manger of my shift.but love my job.its a great company thats why i was looking for more work at the hotel's like the Marriott's company.
good,it is a great place to work if you like dealing with public and helping people and I do but the benefits and pay are the worst in the area. management changes every time wind blows. the computer systems are from back in 80s but what I understand all of the Marriott's are on that old system ?
good,"This is A great Company with the right General Manager in charge, it can be a great environment.  My experience was didfferent and I really wish it could have been different. I experienced job unfairness and favoritism was at its max while working under a certain management."
good,El ambiente fue un poco pesado por el compañero que tuve en la pastelería por eso no lo disfruté mucho la estadía allí laboralmente; pero fue una gran experiencia a nivel de aprendizaje y crecimiento laboral.
good,"Great if you need a second job or just some extra money. Hours aren’t bad. Work was kinda gross at times. Boss was knowledgeable about almost everything regarding hotel maintenance. Taught me a lot about plumbing, electrical and lawn maintenance. Not a bad place to work."
good,Beautiful hotel chains and a great experience..Marriott hotel has grown with class and elegant looks and beautiful representations of different cultures in different countries and states.
good,"They hire managers/directors based off of ""who you know"". These people were awful at their job and they left not long after. It was a continuous cycle of trash leaders. There were capable in-house applicants who constantly got overlooked. The property I worked at paid well but sometimes the guests made you question whether it was worth it. I had worked at this property 6 years and I enjoyed my first 4. I was only hanging on the the paycheck after that. *this was my experience at one property.*"
good,The rooms are old and dated. The longest days are because we're short on linen. The new management has a lot to do to make sure the hotel is successful.
good,"Declined to answer this question,it a alrite company.I feel like I can decline answering this question it a a hotel down town,in the hart of mobile, with a crystal ball room in it"
good,"Working hard in a stressful environment. I don't mind working hard however I will not work hard while being harassed, sexually harassed, and mistreated by staff and management."
good,"My manager was nice but the "
good,"Those that i worked with were phenomenal at their jobs.  I learned so much from everyone I worked with which contributed to such a productive work environment.  However, the hotel overall is very short staffed which stretched everyone very thin having to work OT just about every week.  The hardest part was having to find creative ways to explain to guests why room weren't ready in a timely fashion, the HVAC system was consistently failing, outdated room designs (specifically the bathrooms), amongst other issues.  Prior to my exit, the hotel was, and is, in process of making some major improvements in staffing and infrastructure. I'm grateful for the position I held there and for all I learned. I would recommend it to anyone looking for employment."
good,"It is a relatively easy job if you just pay attention during training. You get the hang of things quick. It is however, a very tedious job. Once Marriott took over a lot changed as did the moral of the employees. Starwood cared about their employees, Marriott its all about number. That's how I feel toward the end. Is one of the reasons I decided to leave."
good,I did housekeeping and management was a mess and a huge turnover rate so lots of overtime. Some people had lower-pay “fun” jobs that they liked though
good,The property unfortunately has no structure or training for empowering employees to go the extra mile.  Micromanaged by GM & DOS old school method....
good,Marriott began using a new booking system before it was anywhere near being ready to be launched and before employees were give proper training on it.
good,"Started as a starwood then bought by Marriott. Many small changes to the workplace culture. Poor hands on management with obvious favoritism. Was a fun place to work in the beginning. Because management was barely seen you took on responsibility of dealing with issues, which as a positive made you proactive."
good,You have to follow a script and they are too hard on you for a service industry position. Very strict management is unfair . People leave managers not jobs .
good,If your looking to get discounts for hotels this is a plus. Huge con is the non set schedule and work stress. Plus with the amount of pressure and hard work minimum wage is a slap in the face. You’ll have to work here for at least 6 years before they take your seriously for positions advancements.
good,My Review is simple if you have Great Workers they Should be rewarded especially those that go above and Beyond the call of duty I am one of those guys
good,I enjoyed my working days there except with the managements. I love all the people i work with and most of them are kind. I also enjoyed working with diffrent kind guest.
good,"The people you meet are typically great, I enjoyed speaking to many new faces every day."
good,"I enjoyed the job because I was able to move about freely. I drove the hotel van picking up and dropping off"
good,The community was awesome in the Glassboro Marriott but when it was busy the work would sometimes become overwhelming. Each position was straight forward but the pay could have been a little better.
good,it was good to work there I got advancements that  I hope will help me out The co workers were all good workers  for the most part some of them had to kind of be pushed to work
good,"People where great I think, there are to many cheifs not enough Indians. Older employees tend to point out new members faults or make up faults to family members who happens to be  management for job security and better days o. Schedule. Ethical standards do need to be addressed."
good,"I worked here for a little over 6 years. After my 2nd child, the hours became too much. I had to accommodate my home life over my work life. with any job, there's going to be issues. The issues here weren't awful."
good,"Typical day: Arrive for scheduled shift, Log into your computer (Is a different computer each day), Begin taking calls, log out/in for two 15 min breaks & 1 30 min lunch, log off and go home. "
good,"I don't love the ""airport"" mentality where we will be so oversold in the hopes that we are even at the end of the night. This is very stressful when you are constantly walking groups."
good,Salaries could be improved. Not great for millennials. Workplace culture is ok. Would suggest someone recommending you for a position rather than blindly applying via the website.
good,weatin hotel owned by marriott. merry go round of mangement companies runing operations and continually hiring new sales people. staff in banquets a very experienced crew.
good,"Love my position, didn't care for the micromanagement. I'm a independent worker, expectations not clear. Loved my AGM the general manager leaves something to be desired."
good,"It's an ok place to work for and everyone is very friendly."
good,good place to work.  they were very flexible with hours and had great training. we did gt employee discounts when working there for hotel rooms throughout the world.
good,"♦ Prepared daily reports and updated profiles of the guests"
good,"Daily work usually boring"
good,"don't have much to say was very deceived by my manager, loved the hours, the work was good, but people were promoted who did not deserve it and long term employees were constantly overlooked."
good,"I liked working here, it was a temporary job, so I wasn't there long.  The pay wasn't great, but the work was easy and the environment was relaxed.  I would recommend as a side job."
good,"My only complaint really are my co-workers and the manager. Manager is a micro-manager and almost not on site. The serving area is unorganized that it is almost unfair for the other servers. The location in Ypsilanti/Ann Arbor's turnover is very high and it affects the work environment immensely. Chef changes too often that the quality of food is  of course affected. Unhappy customers because of food affects the servers and get a lot of heck cause of it. Not only that, it affects the whole company because of this turnover rate."
good,"Mijn functie was zeer allround. Eigenlijk was ik in mijn functie zowel CFO, hoofd administratie als financieel medewerker. Geen enkele dag was het zelfde."
good,It was an okay experience. The managers are unorganized and don't communicate with each other which cause it to be chaotic. The staff is divided due to the managers. They do provide lunch frequently throughout the year.
good,I worked in a fast pace environment that allowed me to be responsible for more than other peers. I was able to accomplish a lot during my time but there was a lack of advancement.
good,"Its a fun place to work. I learned how to set up and break down meeting space. The management was horrible, bad communication between employees. The most enjoyable thing about coming to work is my co-workers."
good,The company focusses heavily on associates benefits which do not apply to contractors - Contractors are heavily used and very expendable. OK as direct hire
good,A typical day started at 6:00 am - 2:30 pm. I was responsible for bussing tables and running food. I occasionally helped out as a server when needed. I found that the 2 veteran servers who worked the morning shifts pretty much got away with doing whatever they wanted up to and including refusing to do what management asked of them. Management made no effort to correct this behavior and it became difficult to work with them as others were left to pick up the slack. the hardest part of this job was the management.
good,its a easy job get i get out after helping others but easy if u want hours there their but the pay is lttle and no holiday pay scott enterprises but easy job
good,It was a really good paying job you would just have to make coffee and serve people food and which I enjoyed talking to the customers but the management was very poor leaving the servers with no supplies or anything to serve.
good,"It is a relaxed environment. Management is very friendly and the training is very good for the newcomers. Staff is also very helpful too."
good,"I enjoy working with most of the people and guests. I would like more interaction with the groups and building relationships to make the sale, but my current position does not offer that. I would like to grow with the company, but does not seem to be an option at this time."
good,"I loved the people and the culture. We made fruit smoothies for guests, there were self motivation books for guests to buy and also beautiful clothes and swim suits. The management was a little disorganized and the leader was unhelpful. She and most of the management are no longer there. I wasn't making any money or getting enough hours which was causing a lot of stress. I decided to move on. As a whole Marriot was a great team and helpful but at Agave they didn't share the culture as expected."
good,It is a good place to learn the ins and out  of the front desk and how the hotel runs. It is a place to learn from your mistakes and keep growing. It is a fast paced working environment that you have to know how to problem solve quickly in.
good,"I loved the job and the people I worked with. We shared a great deal of laughs, and really worked well together and accomplished a lot of great things in my time there. I feel it is not the same for the current management. There is a total disregard for the oneness in our dept."
good,Job and workplace was fun to be involved. Management at the time was not communicating and employees suffered. Other than that it was fun to work there.
good,"The best days are stress full and other days are calm and quite "
good,"If you're the type that's always looking to pick up hours there are plenty there. you can also work multiple departments. You can be in food/beverage, rooms, and banquets. The possibilities are endless really."
good,"Unless you are a salaried manager, you are an hourly paid manager.  In theory, this is great!  You can earn overtime if you work it.  However, overtime is never approved and not permitted.  It's great for work-life balance, but challenging to complete all necessary duties in only 40 hours...so be prepared to get a lot of lectures or conversations about how your work isn't getting done on time or isn't ""enough"" to satisfy senior leadership.  Makes it tough to keep going back every day since you can't really take pride in your work."
good,"Being an employee for over 7 years with Marriott/Sage. Has had its perks up and downs There is constant change which is normal. But when it comes to management here at my property, it has come very political and hard for advancement. But you take the good with the bad and make the best of what you have!"
good,A typical day at work is he come in clock in get ready for your meeting or stand up you meet your crew for today usually have a couple of last before you get into the meeting joke around then you get to the meeting which is pretty much telling you how your day is going to go when needs to be accomplished by the end of the day and usually everybody's in High Spirits and you usually have a good time just enjoying the guys that you work with.
good,A very clean nice productive workplace and the people are very friendly and well trained and they make you feel like your at home I will recommend anybody to go there
good,"Very understanding and ""too good to be true"" throughout training. After you get on the floor, the support is limited, so you better hope you have a good coach. Doesn't always matter though, it is overstaffed, while also being understaffed, no actual advancement unless you are friends with managers, cramped, but the actual customers and physical scheduling of stays was not terrible."
good,Fairfield Inn & Suites Marriott the manager wasn't handling things as as needed it was always they're favored against someone that just started working
good,"I wouldn’t want to work back at this hotel because it’s was a lot of work . And they wasn’t really professional, I feel it was a lot of favoritism going on and i wasn’t feeling comfortable sometimes"
good,"When I worked at the Hotel it was like I was on a vacation.   I really enjoyed meeting new people from all around the world.   My job at the Front Desk was to welcome guests to the hotel, check them into their rooms and assign keys.   I also took payments, gave directions and suggest things to do in the area.   Not only did I check in guests I checked them out as well.  I would help them out if they needed any toiletry items.  Exanple:  tooth brush, tooth paste, comb, shampoo..etc."
good,"Company is ok.Only problem is promotion is not done through employees performance, "
good,"Too much personal involvement, very difficult to advance. Too many  employees with longevity whom are not willing to accept changes"
good,Hotel has high expectations for their sales managers with unrealistic goals that change constantly.  Poor benefits and no education reimbursement.  Lots of turnover in the 2 years I have been with the company.
good,The work environment is face paced and super stressful. Different departments did not work well together. Their training program is not that great. All the systems were extremely outdated and slow which always lead to frustration. The work schedule SUCKS and the pay was horrible for the amount of work you have to do. One positive thing is that most coworkers are nice.
good,"Very hard work, not enough time in a day to complete everything."
good,Managers were helpful and friendly and so were other staff members. The work was fast paced and tough at times. Enjoyed the social interaction with staff and guests.
good,Employees are nice and try to be helpful.There are too many meetings that seem to be focused on wrong priorities. Staffing is poor. To better serve customers there should be more staff.  Training could've been better with starwood to Marriott merge.
good,"I also don’t have anything to put here. "
good,"No life and work balance if you have children so sad because it’s a good company have very good benefits, you have to love and passion what you do to help and support the staff, managers need to support the departments to make sure the Guest is satisfy but unfortunately some of them doesn’t"
good,Incredibly busy location. Management is okay but turnover rate is incredibly high. There is a lot of pressure with not much being done to set employees up for success.
good,Serious work life balance problems.  Management expects you to do multiple tasks at once and despite managing the tasks(i.e. staying late to get it done); you are still held accountable for things that you could not finish on your 12 hour shift.
good,"It is face paced, good that offers benefits. It can work on paying its employees a little better. Also, it is a good to have free lunches and offering medical, dental and 401 K."
good,A typical day  at the hotel is very busy espeacially on the weekends.The managers were great people to work with they were team players the hardest part of the job when fellow employees do not pull there weight.
good,"Never the same day twice, very fast paced. Learn something new everyday. General Manager takes time to teach and help associates grow in their field and helps them advance."
good,"long shifts - night shifts. can be boring working through the night working up to 7 days without a day off, usually work 5 off 2 unless short staffed, learned reception duties, good benefits and discounts"
good,Early morning 5:30 am to 9 am.  Meet morning patrons on the course while doing morning manual labor with the team.  Good people.  Enjoy being outdoors early in the morning.
good,"I'm currently working at the Marriott but due to company changes my position may no longer available,  for myself and my coworkers.  That is why I am currently seeking a position within your company."
good,Lack of personalities from management and certain staff members.  No advancement.  Lack of respect from management. Poor work ethics from a number of emplyees
good,Challenging workload. The department in always understaffed but plenty of growth opportunities. Strong job and company culture. Not great life and work balance.
good,"Marriott was a good place to work, I really liked the management but the pay was low. The job was difficult because we were very busy during the summer hours and I worked about forty hours a week."
good,"At the hotel, I mainly performed day to day tenant needs as well as guest room maintenance.  I learned how to work on my own.  I also discovered the importance of completion of tenant requests in a timely manner.  The management was rather strict and sometimes difficult to interpret what expectations were.  It was a culture of teamwork.  You were offered opportunities to work in multiple departments always learning something different.  The most difficult part of the job was meeting management's expectations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the variety of opportunities that were provided."
good,"Was part of the Starwood Hotels for 22 years and in only few months since Marriott took over /Merged the legacy Starwood i realized this is not a company I would like to work for. Dont care for the management style and how they have the IT services structured. "
good,At this job I learn to stay to may self and to do my job. I learn to be very friendly and nice to customer and to help when I was need.  I also learn when working at a job like this u don t really have friends u just do your job and go home. And u have to watch yourself and stay away from the gossip and drama.
good,"Great Property and stuff for Guests to do"
good,"I really enjoyed working for TownePlace Suites, I learned a lot and developed a close connection with the other employees and Tenants. The Oppurtunity to work in Family oriented organization was a pleasure. I would definitely recommend this a place to work....."
good,Depending on the location or property where you work at the environment and opportunities to move up the chances vary. Marriott promotes empowerment and encouragement but when upper management is too comfortable to provide the right tools or follow the rules for others to succeed it becomes not convenient for them.
good,Depending on time of month some days very long.  Deadlines have to be meet so working weekends or holidays can happen.  Communication not very good or after the fact
good,Management were hard to be found if present. Employees were not working as a single unit or not showing at all. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job is communication between coworkers and management.
good,"I worked at this job to learn about the hotel business. I enjoyed being in the area and enjoyed working with young people. I enjoyed learning about the varied cultures, that the guests represented. Much work is done behind the scenes so that when guests feel comfortable and at home."
good,This company provided daily/monthly accounting/audit duties to aprox 25 hotels.  They were trying to send all work to India.  There were aprox 25 people from India on site to learn.  Over half of the staff left so the company turned to temp staff to fill in until the new India Accountants were trained.
good,Management team is the worst. Constantly late with no sure schedule. Tells you to go above and beyond but they are too lazy to do the simplest of task
good,"Opening and building a kitchen from scratch is one of the greatest experiences to be a part of.  I had the pleasure of being able to do it with one of Delaware's top executive chef's. Hard work and dedication has proven to be one of the best assets in the River Rock Kitchen for myself and with my vast knowledge and experience, I soon was able to lead all banquets as head banquet chef while running the kitchen for breakfast and lunch.  Night shift is typically heavier staffed with kitchen help and staff, but during busier times in the day there was a lack of assistance and I was often the only one to handle all day services including banquets.  The toughest part is running dayshift as the only chef, and being responsible for unloading and organizing all product orders that came in simultaneously.  Under different Executive Chef's cultures have shifted with staff members.  For the most part people come in and do their job, but there are always stresses while working in a kitchen, especially busy ones.  Keeping your head down and getting the job done while providing high quality standards for customers is always my number one priority.  The most rewarding part of the job is receiving accolades for a fantastic meal and seeing plates come back clean after a customer finishes their meal."
good,"Great staff, people come in eager and ready to learn as well as help each other. Hardest part of the job is the lack of communication between departments it can turn a simple task into an issue."
good,"I suggest they have better staff at the workplace or better management. Organize the workplace and better scheduling, and management should be more respectful with their staff."
good,"Virgin Active is a great work place the only down side is that when you are part of the sales team it's shift work, so if a customer decides to walk through the doors at 9 pm and you finish at 9, you will be there until 10.30 pm tour them around go through prices sign them up etc."
good,"I liked my time here at the Kingsgate just thought that management could be improved. There is a definite separation between managers/supervisors and the rest of the workers there. The relationships between coworkers though are incredible and I made some great connections from working there both professional and personal. The job is one where you are interaction with individuals from all walks of life. It is very important to remember that here in the area we are surrounded by 7 hospitals so the majority of our business is coming from patients and their families. With that in mind they offer a shuttle service but there is hardly a driver most shifts. This responsibility falls to the front desk along with their responsibilities of answering phones, checking guests in, managing the gift shop, taking room service orders, making hotel reservations, and really anything else that a guest could need or a manager asks for."
good,"It was a great place to work,Friendly staff"
good,it was fun and when it was busy it made time go by fast we ware short staffed alot becuase of one of the managers but the other made going there bearable
good,"*Managed customers SPG accounts."
good,"Vetuisté de la structure. Management peu positif; cependant, bonne formation constante du personnel."
good,"I have been working in this building for thirteen years.. And I can truly say this place is not the same as I first started it has went down in a bad way... No strusher,  no strong leadership.."
good,"Bottom line they need to hire a lot more people.  The hiring process they use right now just doesn't seem to work well with a hotel's needs and seems to work at a snail's pace. In a couple departments it's ridiculous.  "
good,The benefits and hourly rate is the best but the management is horrible the human resource is also corrupted because they always side with the manager and act like they are there for you too if you can just make your money and go home it's the best but if you have an experience like mines then you can only hope the management don't pick on you I was there for 3 years the Detroit Marriott at the Reniassance
good,"the job was okay , a lot of work drama. enjoyable part winning  the work games , hardest part the management pick there favorite people in let them break the rules."
good,you get to meet everyday different people from different back ground.the people are kind and very respectful it was always about team work to get things done. perfect job for going to school and working.
good,"It is a good company to work for, however management tends to be disorganized. They are great at working with you when you need time off and hours are flexible. However, you do a shift bid every few months, so you never know what hours you will be working. Pay should be higher and those who meet the criteria and rank high consistently should be given bonuses."
good,The check in experience is very stressful especially if its a busy night. Or if there are numerous of group check ins. The front office managers try to convey the utilization for the night but that doesn't help much.
good,This was a very good job. The money was excellent. Sometimes I would get $150 tips. The only negative point was having to work 13 or 14 days in a row before getting a day off. I loved the staff. Everyone was so friendly
good,I was only their for a few weeks to assist management when they were in a time of need so I can't make any big judgements. Staff seemed happy though..
good,"The company recently merged with Marriott International at the end of 2016. Since then, there has been little to no room for any advancement. The new merged company has been whittling down the old corporate structure and most employees are in somewhat of a limbo if they ever had any intention of promoting."
good,"I have been at the Le Meridien since 2012. I have friends there. it is relaxed. but my problem is that it is non union and there are always protesters there, and we also do not get annual raises, and the food they serve us is of poor quality."
good,You take calls for people calling to edit or make a reservation. you also get coached every now and then to get an update on how your doing. You sit in a different desk everyday.
good,A typical day would not be possible to define as each day is a challenge when dealing with guests that drink or come off of a long flight and are cranky.  This is a daily occurrence.
good,"Although new faces come and go, here offers a nice variety to sure please you with personal comfort you can rely on, amenities to help you adjust, a hot tub and a pool to help reduce travel stress."
good,"It did not seem like the westin employed very good management, They also had no management position at the restaurant. I had to work very short hours."
good,Was a very busy place to work which I liked. Teamwork was bad though. Every man for themselves. Everyone was under a great deal of stress because of it.
good,There are a lot of turnovers making it hard to be efficient because there are so many new hires consistently.  It is a franchised hotel and does not have all the amenities of a Marriott International hotel.
good,Promotions were given out based on who people were related to not based on effort and skill.   Shift availability was poor and those with out children were not allowed to work the day shift.
good,"This is a really good place to learn and grow.  I've had a good experience working here. Employees also get discounts in outlets and rooms in all Marriott hotels across the country, which is a great perk."
good,"Very busy work place, but lack of team work due to lack of staff a normal shift for me was 3;00p.m.-2a.m. due to no workers and traing temps service worker who had no clue"
good,This hotel is mainly busy Monday thru Friday. Very slow on the weekends. You have to find away to give great customer service most guest are all busy and no fun
good,Good job but would have liked to feel more appreciated lovely Christmas parties and free lunch though also free use of pool and sports facilities including gym sauna Jacuzzi and steam room
good,"The Renaissance VINOY is a historic hotel run by marriott international. Unfortunately their methods of employee value, and keeping the positivity alive at this resort for their employees is at a slow death. The employees are miserable and stuck in an endless repetitive circle with barely any acknowledgement for their successful guest intereactions. Any other Marriott run resort would provide amazing acknowledgement and awards to those who showed hard earned effort. For the Vinoy however, this place is lacking the effort of growth, postive reinforcement, and appreciation for those employed there."
good,n/a- I choose not to take the time to fill this part of the survey out. there is no other way to get past this except to enter a description.
good,Nice place to work if you are just starting out in your career. You would enjoy the culture and its a good place to learn the industry.
good,"I had a lot of problems with starwood, there was another person with the same name as me and everything kept getting screwed up with pay and other things. other than that starwood is a fun company to work for."
good,"Worked as an Art Director for the pop up gallery company Limited Edition during Art Basel. The drive was very far and traffic was very bad. Mostly alone, and always on the go."
good,It was a pretty easy job. Worked around a lot of people. The staff was friendly for the most part but it did get stressful some days. There was room for advancement.
good,Working as a front desk agent I enjoy meeting people from all around the world. But the hotel is under staffed and management do not know how to manage. Employers do not seem to be the priority to them.
good,"With the added convenience of being attached to the airport, the Tampa Airport Marriott sets itself apart from all other hotels.  Guests can fly in, having meetings or functions and fly back home, without having to step foot outside.  A typical day involves meeting people from all over the world and assisting guests from all different backgrounds and cultures.  My co-workers are like family, as I typically spend more time with them than I do at home.  The hardest part of the job is never knowing what to expect.  If a flight gets cancelled, it can turn a slow day at work into a very busy day within a matter of minutes.  The most enjoyable part is learning every guest's ""story,"" where they coming from, where they are going, and making a connection that Marriott emphasizes.  I've learned to have patience through stressful situations and never stop smiling, regardless of the situation."
good,Working at the Evergreen Marriott is just your regular work day on a daily basis.I am looking for something more challenging
good,"It was fun working in the kitchen at the westin hotel, i just wish we we would have been able to have gotten more days off. But its a cool place to work, very suttle environment."
good,"I loved working here, no I wasn't always on time but I worked on it and I thought I did my job wasn't to sure why I was fired. Now this was 7 years ago I don't think the same people are there. There were a few people who made my experience weather joyful but there were some who didn't and i do not know how sure this is but I was told some coworkers were looking for reasons to get me fired and was making my duties a little difficult."
good,I enjoy working there because i got to meet people from different states and country's which was a nice expensive for me. Some of the team member's were nice and other were rude.
good,"Typical day at work, Clocking in and seeing how many more guest are arriving before I start my overnight audit, I would wait the latest till 4 am to start my overnight audit. I would block rooms for the next morning for the new guests who are V.I.P and make sure no one touches there reservations. Preparation of daily reports and distribution as directed. Accurate preparation of VIP, complimentary, house use rooms, and out of order lists. Prepares a summary of cash, check, and credit card activities. Summarizes results of operations for management. Prepare of End of day procedure. "
good,Learned a lot about all different walks of life. It was very calm and easy. Not much energy needed. Interesting place to work at.
good,"Huge opportunity for personal growth , but slightly decepointed in management and professional opportunities given , noticed sexism , very hard to develop professionally if a woman with an opinion."
good,I actually work at a Franchised Courtyard so I can not review Marriott International. My franchise that I work for is alright. I received a promotion only after working with them for 7 years and threatening to quit. I spend a lot of time at work and not very much time at home so I need a change.
good,"Property lay out is too open to the public, Security seems an issue."
good,"Being a guest service representative I was responsible for checking the guest in and out, anticipating and meeting the needs of our guest, and making reservations. I learned not to take things personal, and how smiling while you speak makes a difference in the tone of your voice. Management  and my co-workers at the time were good. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly guest who could not be satisfied. The most enjoyable part was the benefit of great room rates for our family vacations."
good,"• Front desk, answering phone and switchboards"
good,"I was the only staff on property doing security and the audit. A typical night was mostly quiet and alone, except for event nights, sports teams, and conferences. We would hire security but at this job, you did meet a lot of people to do some networking with. we did reports, schedules, a lot of time management setting up conference rooms and banquets."
good,Nice place to work for people that is interest in the hotel business. Especially for recent college students who are trying to get their foot in the door.
good,Beautiful new property that has a long way to go with organization and proper training guide for the front desk. Front Desk continuously failed the Q.A due to the consistent turnover at the front desk. The management were not on the same page with instructions. The new employees had to self train and were told to do their MyLearning traing at home unpaid.
good,some days were physically demanding and others were slow . I learned that you should take pride in whatever you do good  place just low pay
good,"a typical day work "
good,agradecido por la oportunidad de aprender nuevos conocimientos en el area del mantenimiento
good,l'ambiente era tranquillo.tutto funzionava.i clienti difficili
good,"normal day at work, friendly co workers, everyday is a learning process, enjoy working in the garde manger side.needs more manpower in the kitchen."
good,"Unfortunately, I did not work for this company long, I will say it is very fast paced and the training was not that good. I was a front desk clerk and night auditor."
good,"In this place they dont consider your personal time, you work to many hours, the people that work there are fun. i was expecting  to learn a lot but always we did the same thing"
good,There was continuous training and the pay was almost entry level.  The turn over at the company is very high.  They are constantly adding more and more training yet the pay structure is nowhere as it should be with all the skills.
good,"As an employee of the Marriott City Center in Salt Lake City, a typical day started at 8:30. Each day I made door signs for groups arriving the following day, and buffet labels for meals as needed. Other tasks included making files for incoming groups, printing daily reports, maintaining printer and copier equipment, and any other tasks as assigned."
good,"Roles included controlling beverage stock in cellar making sure bars are fully stocked for serving period. Receiving invoices daily through post, handing to relevant members of staff to check and then paying them. Receiving all delivery notes and invoices from the kitchen, maintaining cost control spreadsheet for food and relaying performance analysis back to the head chef. Experience of Oracle support system and Micros, also gained experience of using PeopleSoft to pay invoices and coding each invoice to the relevant department."
good,Positive associate interaction and communication is given and recieved from the moment I walk in from the associate entrance to all the way up until the moment I walk out when my shift is finished. We start off with teamwork and finish with teamwork. From cleaning tables to getting the extra things for customers and getting refills for customers before they asked for it was all about paying attention to details.
good,"clock in would receive inbound calls from customers concerned about their AT&T products, i would quickly answer any and all questions that they would have for me, take their payments, and assist them however possible."
good,"In terms of a typical day It would consist of setting up the meetings and the food for the customers throughout the day. For example one day me and group of five people had set up a charity dinner for Loros for 192 people, it was very hectic. we had to set up and give out the starters, main meals and deserts."
good,"Casino area great just low compensation, They can pay more for all the work and time that you invest.Good overall. Not a lot of benefits,"
good,"Great place to work, wonderful associates, very educational in any field. Great management team, really value employees"
good,Fun place to work. Opportunities for growth weren't as frequent as expected but they were discussed. Great place to interact with a wide array of people including the occasional celebrity. Management could use some people skill training because they could be disrespectful to both staff and guest which isn't proper use of good customer service.
good,"Overall and average place to work with average pay. You have the opportunity to slowly move up the ladder. Managers were very unprofessional, uneducated and careless."
good,I liked working at the Marriott and being a part of great customer service. I worked the overnight shift until about 7am. I placed billing receipts under the doors of every occupied room and set up the breakfast buffet for customers the following morning. It had a great variety of things that customers really enjoyed. There was only one manager trying to handle everything in the entire building. It was too much for one person to handle on their own which took away time from addressing customers needs. During my shift if a manager was needed to confirm certain things it was almost impossible because she was working so many hours in a day.
good,enjoyed my time at this location only left to grow within the company. had good managers as well as a good staff. Part of the same company as the previous job.
good,"if you do what your told, stock product for service and can work under pressure well, this job is for you. I handled the daily routines well, but when it came to working under pressure, cooking hundereds of dishes a night, getting the dishes out to the customer in a timely manner, I struggled"
good,"Management does not connect with employees personally. "
good,I had the pleasure of working with so many great people.  The ability to be a part of a variety of events from weddings to major corporate events was a thrill.
good,"This being my first full time job post military, I don't have a lot to compare it to outside of my Navy experience/ However, I can say that  working at my particular property has been educational and enjoyable for the most part. Unfortunately there is very little room to advance and pay is laughable."
good,"Hotel let go of all long term employees and replaced with cheaper, new employees. Daily free lunches for all staff members.  Just completed a entire hotel renovation"
good,It's an ok place to work and the people are great! Don't get much support from management. They say they will help you grow; but I have yet to see that happen with my career.
good,Needs much better leadership from it's management team.  They have a good work culture but are not honest with their open door policy.  Their priorities are off.
good,"You get people from all over the country that stays there and you get to engage them in conversation and find out things about them to help their stay be as pleasurable as possible. Hotel location is in a prime spot for tourist, which gives me and others opportunities to use our knowledge of the city to point tourist in the right direction."
good,"Duties included all variations of customer service. Point person from the initial client introduction, writing contracts, taking care of the group while on property, to making sure that all billing was correct. Full knowledge of guest rooms, meeting space, food and beverage, audio visual components to maintaining the Westin and Starwood Property standards."
good,Marriott is a great company you meet people from all parts of the world which is great the staff is very friendly my typical at work is checking people in and out of there of there room and assisting our guest with any concerns answer all calls and making reservations i would have to say the most challenging part of my job is standing all day
good,"En mi humilde opinión, la falta de gestión entre los distintos departamentos con la gerencia, hace que todos los profesionales de este recintio en concreto, sufran sin necesidad de un ambiente tenso sin motivo alguno a pesar de la gran carga de trabajo."
good,I review my day by starting on my daily checklist and helping check guest and help out at the bistro. im really independent and dependent .
good,"This Marriott hotel is a very business oriented customer based hotel. The restaurant at night can be busy at times, but is typically on the slower slide. Working here has increased my skills in reading guests cues in order to create a personal and comfortable environment for them to enjoy their meals."
good,I learnt alot as my previous property was business hotel so working in Leisure hotel was little different. My colleagues are very supportive.
good,The hardest part of the job was taking inventory.  Got to meet different people from all over the world. Enjoyed working with my co-workers and management was fair.
good,Very busy days and nights. Hotels is always busy with high occupancy levels. The Marriott model is a proven one and wiorks well so I have learned a great deal from being a part of it. Management is capable and involved.
good,"Give their housekeeper alot of work that they wanted completed in 8 hrs and wasnt able to leave until finished.They also wasnt fair with most of the employees, it was certain things we couldnt say because we feared for our job or being wrote up. The GM was very rude to some employees , he came in some mornings and wouldnt even speak when the employees would speak. It really wasnt a very pleasant place to work."
good,"Very good place to work, Good Management, Good location, good Service. Most of the employees have a lot of years with the company."
good,My first experience in USA.Working for Marriott has been very good experience.Meeting people from all over the world learning different cultures and learning about what they are visiting for. Learning about many different conventions guest are staying with us for.
good,"We were micro managed even though our scores were high."
good,The best part of this job is the guests. It was an extended stay hotel so you become friends with everyone staying there and it makes it feel less like a job. The downside is that you can tell the company just sees you as a social security number with a negative red number next to it. The employee turnover rate was so hi that I stopped learning new peoples names.
good,I really enjoyed my time working for Marriott. I worked for this company through a temporary company and I wish that my stay here could have been longer.
good,"serving breakfast to the guest at the hotel. cleaning, smiling, making sure the gust have a great experience. "
good,Growth within the hotel is imminent as long as you are willing to apply. The staff is iffy and well diversified and the management is not what it seem. Ultimately keeping to yourself is the way to goes. Trust is not so trustworthy at this hotel.
good,love working there but i am ready to start in my career field.
good,"Great place to work for. However, my restaurant was consistently in transition. Made it hard to know know management styles and instructions."
good,"I did my college internship with Marriott when they offered me my first management position.  I learned a lot about how to manage different types of people.  My co-workers were very nice and we worked well together, the general manager taught me so much about budgets and running a business. I enjoyed meeting people from all over the world.  The hardest part was being open every day and never closing-I even got snowed in the hotel for three days with the guests during a bad winter storm."
good,"I loved the discount, and I had some really exciting moments. It's very stressful to try and be perfect, so I wish it paid more to make it worth while. But that's the nature of the hospitality industry."
good,I secured the hotel by watching cameras in the main lobby at all times making sure everybody was id correctly in signed in
good,"Fun place to work. Great employees. Co-workers were loyal and always had each other's back, good support system. Management at time was not so great, but that has changed since then. Being connected to Galleria made it convenient to shop after work."
good,Occupancy forecasts are inaccurate so it's impossible to judge if you are going to have a busy shift.  Also competing with another venue in the hotel. (a 5-star restaurant.)  Not enough help from management but will change when staffing becomes more efficient.
good,"Usually worked the 3P.M.-11P.M.,37.5 hrs. a wk.,on anyday of the wk."
good,"Great the guest, answering the inside and outside calls,Checked the occupancy for the day, theme like technology. "
good,"I worked in the very busy restaurant which is there is no time for you to relax. I learned a lot about the menu, Italian food and wine selection. Management not really understand with what you need. The people who work are not helping each other as a team. The most enjoyable at work when we have event in the hotel, which we can participation."
good,"A typical day at work is your normal restaurant work."
good,"Long work days sometimes 80 hours a week. Outside standing the whole time. Heavy lifting, and lots of standing and cleaning. The cleaning get a little out of control."
good,A typical day involves a large amount of customer interactions.  I learn how to overcome objections and resolve customer issues.  My co-workers are very supportive and excel at multitasking.  The hardest part of the job is being responsible for preforming multiple roles simultaneously.
good,Capriottis is a great job for entry level positions where you can have fun while performing your job.
good,Temp Job only had  it for 6 months...I would recommend anyone to work there great staff
good,"Westin Fort Lauderdale is a great place to work, there is room for promotion, you can do whatever it takes to make the guest happy."
good,i can work any jobs i have experience in  cleaning maintance vaccun ship floor clean window clean toilet and carpet shampoo
good,"I always arrived at work early to organise the office for the day ahead before I had to switch over the phones at 8.30am.  I found it not difficult in the position whereas I was a property manager previously as well as supporting the property management department and on occasions sales department.  stay back at work to complete my work.  "
good,"Begin 2001 ben ik als kamermeisje hier begonnen en doorgestroomd als supervisor. Drie avonden per week controleerde ik de kamermeisjes, nam de telefoon aan, zorgde voor administratie."
good,"busy high paced environment. answering house calls, prompt response time is crucial."
good,"Checking guest into their rooms. Answering phones and booking reservations. "
good,You learn a lot of things that become very handy in real life situations and future employments.
good,"Not sure if anyone has a lot to say about their first job."
good,"Average work environment.  Difficult operationally.  "
good,"i can solve each and any promblum, everythink i learned in engineering deparment everythink i did, i work with six co-workers,still not came in across, oprating chiller plant,boiler,wtp & attend the complient which is enjoyable part of the job"
good,nice property but needs a better team at the Riva Restaurant.
good,Great company until last year. Inexperienced new manager.  Excellent benefits.
good,"I have enjoyed working for Marriott"
good,Amazing benefits but no opportunity for professional growth
good,"Long hours.  I worked 14 to 16 hour days, 6 to 7 days a week."
good,The best thing about working for Residence Inn was the Managers were always checking in on you to make sure you were doing ok and if you needed help they were always there to help or find out a solution to help.
good,good place to work. Nice people good co-workers. I learned how to manage people from here.
good,Do more with less is how Marriott is now. Select Service hotels are to achieve high marks and performance while associates are doing more and with less staff to do them with. Maintain high guest standards while running one person at a hotel desk is a bit daunting at times.
good,"depending on the day and how busy we are it's pretty boring."
good,"The best things about this company are going to be your coworkers and your benefits.  The people in Marriott are largely friendly and fun to be around and you really get a sense of family after working with the company for a while.  The benefits are phenomenal: dental, OPTICAL, general, spending account, etc."
good,"I love Marriott as a guest but working for the hotel, not so much. Customer service of course isn't always easy but with all of the chaos you deal with at hotel jobs isn't worth the small pay."
good,A lot of work went into the building (30 years old) and renovations.
good,"I really liked the work environment. It is clean and friendly. Everyone works as a team. However, if you work in certain areas you are not given a break period. After a 5 day work week, with no breaks, you can get very overwhelmed "
good,"Marriott is a good company to work for, their benefits are fantastic but be prepared to work all different kinds of shifts. If you are a student and looking for extra cash this is a great job."
good,This was a very busy sports bar that I was transferred to within Starwood Hotels from the St. Regis Fort lauderdale.  It turned out to be a bad fit for me mostly because it was staffed by transients and it was a late night job.
good,hard working days. not getting enough for rest and all other fun activities
good,"•	Responding to all requests for information/enquiries quickly"
good,Daily answer multi phone lines. make reservations. daily invoices. payroll for all departments. training
good,"	Demonstrated competencies in providing leadership across all maintenance  activities including Scheduling preventive maintenance, organizing manpower for shifts, , drawing cost estimates for renovation, defining technical specifications, procurement, mobilizing & managing manpower, machines , materials. "
good,Short term job while I was taking classes. It wasn't really my type of field
good,Worked many 16 hour shifts while higher mangers would go to lunch and have alcoholic beverages. They would not pay non English speaking housekeepers fair wages and work them harder.
good,"Fun and energetic place to work.  Learned a lot about the corporate structure.  I loved working with most people, but found it hard to change the mindset of others being a team leader.  Really enjoyed being able to talk to many different types of people and fixing any types of problems that guests might have."
good,"Great company to start off for, but after 2 years of promise to evolve from a PM MOD to a better work life balance schedule, with no change in sight...clearly this company likes to keep you in spots that works for them."
good,"to work hard,  easy, its a very funplace there are lot of things to learn for fresher but salary is very low..."
good,What seemed like the dream job quickly turned into a nightmare. Favoritism is an ugly thing.
good,"Hardest part is standing for 8+ hours in one place. "
good,"Marriott in Bengaluru also known as Bengaluru Marriott Whitefied has 10 Banquet Halls.It has a Banquet Manager & 3 Banquet Executive including me.In the month of May our Banquet Manager had to go for a cross exposure to Pune Marriott for a week & one of the executive met with an accident & had gone home earlier.We were just two executive looking after all the banquet events.Banquet was running really busy.We were having almost 7 to 8 events in a day.But unfortunately the next day of our Banquet Manager left for the cross-exposure the other executive also fell ill & i was left alone.I alone took care of the Banquet Events for next 7 days which turned up to be really busy.It was the biggest challenge for me but i never gave up.With only limited associates being with me, i ran the entire show sucessfully & smoothly overcoming all the hurdles with proper plannig,hardwork & smart work as well."
good,the day will be determined on the amount of people staying at the hotel.  can be very busy or a little slow.  Fun environment
good,"The hotel was kinda in a bad spot at the time, undergoing renovations so they could keep the Marriott name. It was very old, and very outdated. Management was good as were co-workers. Never knew what your schedule would be 7-3, 1-9, 12-6, and could be called not to come in because they over scheduled."
good,"A typical day for me usually begins with setting up the buffet line for our breakfast service followed by replinishing items such as plates, cutlery and food items when necessary. I would also clean tables too. My day usually ends by cleaning up the tables, removing the food items from the buffet line, preparing the food items for the next day. I learned how to organize my time wisely, the importance of team work and communicating with a variety of worldly guest. The most enjoyable part of my job is the time i spend talking and getting to know the guest."
good,This job is one where the turnover is very fast. The hours I worked were not conducive to a mother with small children and although I thought I could do both I found it did not work for me.
good,Horrible management. Puts blame on insubordinates for managements mistakes. Not recommended. 
good,"Worked here for a winter. The spa definitely needs some updating but it works. You get to be in Vail and its great. The only thing is employee housing is awful, if you get stuck with awful room mates you are stuck with them. "
good,the best company but my kitchen was un satisfied.. i learn well indian cusine but i want to learn more cusine.. my co-workers are not friendly..the hardest part of the job is making misa.. and enjoyable is service time.
good,"Each day consisted of checking guest in and out, verifying payment methods.  I learned that most problems can be solved if approached with an open mind, a show of genuine interest to make guests happy while remaining calm and respectful.  I enjoyed working with co-workers of all ages."
good,a little bit good but some fellow workers are not good to work with. sometimes you can have a lot struggles with peoples in the rooms
good,"I am just finishing up training but a typical day at work is doing shift work (paper work), checking in guest and checking out guest. Answering the phones, helping guest with special request, greeting guest, counting money, and giving a warm greeting. I have learned how to work the computer system. The managers are nice. My co-workers are all different. The hardest part of my job is standing all day. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with guest. "
good,"Learned the safety and food handling rules, displayed exceptional customer service and quick delivery for each guest"
good,"I love the work environment, but when after a few months you begin to realize how political the call center is. There are a lot of supervisors who are on powertrips and have let their position go to their heads. They are in the position to really help associates, but chose to ignore them instead. I happened to have 3 amazing supervisiors. I got sick several months ago and my supervisor at the time was really supportive of my getting well. I am actually leaving because I can't afford the health insurance."
good,Working front desk involves following a checklist of duties throughout every day that involve checking daily paperwork for any billing issues or errors in reservations.
good,"1. I have joined as a fresher in the hotel, and I felt so many discrepancies in the kitchen department because of the no planning and improper communications with the associates."
good,"Very productive, very challenging with over 5000 properties world wide, to manage their network connection to Internet and Marriott Websites. Enjoy working with team members and site contacts to assist with troubleshooting not just network problems, With most all problems that sites encounters."
good,Training is not a priority for management nor line staff. Lack of adequate equipment makes the job very difficult.
good,"Management run here is vital. I have heard nothing but GLOWING reviews of corporate run Marriott's. I worked for a management company, They are stingy on pay, the management leaves a LOT to be desired. Many broken promises to staff, backstabbing CONSTANTLY among managers. This does not make for a professional working environment, and it is hard for staff to be great toward guests when the management breaks promises, and behaves like 12 year old girls fighting amongst each other. Loved and liked my coworkers. Sure, there were ones you did not get along with, but, hey, that's just the way it is sometimes. Hardest part of job? Achieving high guest scores with little training from managers it seemed were more focused on disputes with each other than training staff. Most enjoyable, the people I worked with."
good,- Great Staff.
good,"I loved to work at the marriott the guest made my day and it was fun work, but the managers had very bad attitudes and made the job harder than it had to be. I looked forward to the guest they made the day go by very fast. I hate i had to leave and join the Army"
good,You have the ability to do your job with limited supervision if you understand and access the tools given. The Westin has created a family atmosphere where there is encouragement to get to know the people you work with. They offer programs to assist you in your development within the company. Within my department there are opportunities to implement new ideas if proven more efficient and effective. Teamwork and communication is vital with each department.
good,"Let me start by saying that I only worked at the corporate level, so I don't know much about the environment at the hotels."
good,"The St. Louis Marriott west is a place that is okay too work for, but not career material. I am the type of person that does their job and go home, I never really socialized there but the co-workers I did know was pleasant to be around. My job is very easy all I have to do is keep hallways clean and make sure the housekeepers have what they need to clean rooms. All in all the marriott is an okay place to work for."
good,while working there there was a lack of Managers and people that care. Company has been taken over new management and is doing better now
good,I learned that is not so hard to please someone that stayed at our hotel people in general just want to be heard . The was great they would help with any problems that came about.my co-worker where also great to work with.There was no hard part of my job i enjoyed everyday.The most enjoyable part of my day was to a smile on each person.
good,"cubicles, computers, custom service, co workers fun, management was horrid."
good,When I first begin work there I really did enjoy being there but then I notice that there was a lot of favoritism. The human resource depart have there favorites and they are very unprofessional. But the company over all itself was a pleasure to work for.
good,"On a daily basis at marriott it always work to do you meet new people all day and everyday.I have learned that working hard always pays off in the end the managemenr team is great they always do everything they can to help or make your job comfortable my co worker were very nice and helpful as well and love working as a team.i feel that times there were challenges but as long,as i kept a positive mind i got the job done and the most enjoyable part of the job was always meering new people and make sure the guest were satisfied."
good,work mostly out of office at home or a coffee shop. management pretty much trusts you to work on your own without supervision. Clients are fairly easy going/not too demanding.
good,Focus on positive guest response by all means. Meeting new people.
good,I've worked for several hotel chains over the years and I would say that Marriott ranks third out of four behind both Hilton (Hampton) and Holiday Inn Express but ahead of the Budget Inn. I did not get a sense of the company direction nor did I receive support from management on many levels. It's probable that this hotel was the exception and not the rule and as it pertains to the brand I would deem my employment as more of a financial necessity and less as a career opportunity.
good,"Coordinate the activities of the dining room in a restaurant. Locate a table that is the right size for the guests; take the guests to the table, and assets with the menus."
good,"I loved working for Marriott and was the best at it (front office). I enjoyed the daily challenges and interacting with all kind of people. My fellow co-workers felt like family. I especially liked working for Courtyard because it made me well rounded in all departments. Working in a limited service Hotel tends to have you working outside your department. It's hard work but mostly enjoyed. Working for Courtyard help me to be the best in Hospitality/Customer Service. It definitely showed once I explored other companies because the professionalism wasn't the same. Marriott enhanced my work abilities be implementing care,concern and knowledge."
good,Sometimes it can be fun when there are others there but when you are on your own it can be a little boring. If the right team of workers ar there is it a great place to work
good,Marriott offers travels benefits where I was able to capitalize on for my honeymoon. I also was able to save some money in my 401K which is used for my mom's hospitalization.
good,"Marriott is a friendly, family oriented business.  It would be a smooth transition for anyone wanting to work in hospitality. It has its perks also like discounts on rooms for example."
good,It’s a decent place to work ir has a great employee base and also the guest are amazing only down falls is the management is changed every few months which causes employees to have to change there work routines
good,Employee's need to be taking care all around when rude guest give disrespect. More and easy incentive should be given also team meeting should happen more.
good,The company is international there are many hotels around the world so it depends  how lucky you are in each workplace. The salaries are average  and the workload same
good,Very consistent and a good place to work.  Marriott takes care of their associates and their training is a great place to work.  Hospitality experience is top notch!
good,"We had a great team during my term."
good,"IT Dept needs continuing improvement,  the systems can be very slow to respond and thereby a balancing act with a customer on the phone who is in a hurry."
good,"Good time there, enjoyed work at the front desk. Was a revolving door of new managers, new baristas etc but the work was fun and the guests would always keep things interesting."
good,"Typicall day at work, lots of smiling faces, team work is great. Free edible meals everyday, management wants to help you succeed, they help in your development toward the future for longevity with the company."
good,"I highly enjoyed my position at the Residence Inn in Bangor. I feel as though their was a lot of favoritism that made my job uncomfortable and unwelcoming at the time. Certain people got to do whatever they wanted because they were close with the general manager, not really a good setting for a work environment."
good,"It was a fun environment, that offer great benefits and lasting friendships. Management was very hard to deal with, as a nothing was ever good enough."
good,"Typical day at work is handling inbound calls from Elite customers, assisting with anything from booking reservations to account maintenance, or guest complaints. All the while multi-tasking by actively listening and communicating whilst navigating a variety of programs and systems, to achieve what you need."
good,"More training, better and professional trainer"
good,"It was okay, wish that had better management but after my time of leaving they received new management. In the future I may consider employment there again."
good,"I was content working for Marriott. After working at two different locations, I moved up to training new hires. Training new hires gave me a sense of importance."
good,It’s not the place for me they have no clue what’s going on and how to run the place. I advice anyone going to work this company please do your homework
good,"Vieni rinnovato se hai le giuste conoscenze,io non le avevo!"
good,Very low stress and easy job to have while you go to school. I'm able to do homework in down times and don't run around all day like I have at retail jobs. Overall it's been good.
good,Flexible job with a work from home option.  Not a great salary for the amount of time and energy devoted to this company.  Benefits are good but expensive.
good,I dont have anything g I want to change Marriott was great I have no complaints about anything I work and stay there if possible anyone would love them
good,You can do better. If you are looking for a full time job this is not the job for you as a front desk agent. If you are looking to be part time then this is a great space for you.
good,It is a good site to work but lacks more gifts from people to managers
good,"great place to bar tend i highly recommend. fast paced high class enviroment with live entertainment. makes for easy money making "
good,"a typical day on reception includes checking in and out guests."
good,It's ok you meet great people however you also meet people you wish that you did not. The hotel I was was ok with a management till the new GM arrived which turned everything around.
good,"Cool place to cook, but lack of communication in the management section. Everyday is the same thing, you prep, you cook orders. Rarely busy besides on the holidays."
good,For most of the time it felt like a family environment.  It was common to have outings.  Towards the end it felt much more corporate and bottom line oriented.
good,"This job has some amazing people in house, though some are unqualified to be in their position. The bad part is how critical the property manager is about lowering the employment costs. It's not fun to be at the bottom of this totem pole."
good,"The job was decent, but when they have changes, your position could be in jeopardy.  Overall, company is consistent.. yet some things could be better."
good,I started off loving my job until management started showing their true colors. I was often bullied tried to talk to see what I was doing wrong to receive that sort of treatment. Nothing was done.
good,I Worked for company over 8 years. Great opportunity for advancement and growth. Training and development was a key factor with Marriott as well. Company believes in incentivizing.
good,working there was fun but that job put a lot on u and your body.there will be rooms that will take at least 1 hour to clean cause how the customers left it but it was a ok job
good,Marriott was a high pace Reservations center.They do offer pay raises and Benefits. This job offers a work at home options and transfer to home agents or building employees any where in the U.S.
good,"i was at the marriott for almost 6 years, at first management was good and it seemed that every employee was happy to work there but new management came in and things changed a lot and employees weren't happy anymore including me so i had to make a change."
good,"I'm hard working, dependable and leadership quality! "
good,"Greeted guest, registered, and assign rooms make and confirm reservations"
good,"Great Place to Work, learning, traveling is unlimited. You can move from position in to the company. The most enjoyable is the people you work with from different nation, culture."
good,it was a great experience I did inbound and outbound calls I met wonderful people in the process they have fantastic training easy going great work schedule
good,When I started at Marriott I was only looking to come in and start from the bottom and work my way up within 2-3 years. However when I got here the opportunities were endless and I've been able to advance quickly due in large part to the training and leadership that I have received.
good,The Sheraton upper managers don't know what they're doing. They rely on their staff to make it look like they can do a great job. Management protect each other that's why they get to stay there. The only way to advance in your career is if you become your managers' favorite. All of the good managers all left the company. They're blaming the high turnover on Marriott but it's really poor leadership.
good,I love this place it's pretty relaxed but there is so many problems with drama and cliques and people not wanting to be a team. It's really stressful to work there.
good,"Beautiful place to work, there was some team work not much. You get to meet to people all the time. It was a clean place to work. This is a good job for a people person."
good,"There's people been there ten years or more of coarse they have earned there place but I'm used around them, feels like whatever shift they won't cover is your hours days n evening can't structure personal Life"
good,"it was a nice experience, i like it the people are there really friendly. it's a good environment to be around with. i enjoy the valet program it was wonderful working for them."
good,Stable company for work but would be nice to have more benefits and regular work hours. Management is weak. Hospitality level is ok. Salary is not competitive.
good,"Great job. positive environment. hardest part is feeling like you work for a company that don't respect the reasons for their employees needing to take off time. You would be told to trade your shift with someone, use PTO if you have any available, or emergency hours which may cause a write up."
good,the  managers  that I had took care of me and always made sure that I had a successful day the property I worked in was franchised and the owners never funded us enough to have an up to date hotel thats 90% of all the problems working there with different and more dedicated owners it would be a better experience for both employees and guest.
good,Training is good for the job-Everyone helps each other out in learning and growing; Employees are great and everyone is motivated by monetary compensation which isnt exactly a bad thing; Could use more employees that are knowledgeable in a certain field and  motivated by providing excellent Customer service
good,But your own hotel is run by a different company and the company I work under for Marriott is a joke. They do offer benefits and you do get paid time off. During winter schedules get cut because business is slow.
good,There are multiple departments that you have to learn in order to be in the hospitality industry that gives you the chance to learn and advance in many ways.
good,Great Airport location to shuttle guest to and from hotel. Great co workers who are all team players. Nice guests The convenience of restaurants  and interstate.
good,Good for an entry level because people can learn a lot of culinary skills and knowledge. The drawback is the long working hours.  We work for 14-15 hiyrs a day and the salary is very low.
good,"clean "
good,A hotel environment where in you can learn a lot of things. They provide a work/ life balance in our schedule. The management annually give us recreational activities in which we relax and get to socialize with other employees.
good,"Good company overall, better than some. The hire too many people with no Hospitality experience, so that culture is not as strong as it used to be, which is crucial."
good,"When everything was working properly it was agood place to work at, just as long as you kept to yourself and stayed away from the drama that was going on"
good,Fair place to work kind people tough staff and accepting hours pay can be better way better for the work that was being done day to day on a full time basis
good,"Early morning and you needs a ironing the pillows cases and folding the towels. No bins. Because only some people have black bins for their staffs. The key only 8 am but you start 7.15 am very hard work.  If you arrives 7.45 am : no towels, no nothing and wasting your time all the day.. down stairs to the laundry. "
good,I work for a franchise property so it would not be fair to review Marriott as a whole when I was not managed by them.   I will say that the role out of new systems to franchise properties was a disaster and there seemed to be a lack of care with guaranteeing success in the transition.
good,Smoothly ran job but you take so many calls per day with no break at all what so ever so if that's what you are looking for go for it some of the supervisors are rude.
good,"Fast paced alot of hours and weekends"
good,"I really liked it when I first started out, but as time went on we had guests who all felt entitled with their Marriott Rewards Status from Silver to Platinum. They all thought they deserved the world handed to them on a silver platter."
good,"This company has great intensions, but failed in my onboarding and ever making me feel a part of the team. They take a lot, but give very little back in the form of support."
good,Good place if you are looking for consistent hours and good benefits. The benefits are probably why no one ever leaves. The work can be difficult if you are not properly prepared
good,"Marriott Hotels , Marriott Internationalâ€™s flagship brand with more than 500 global locations, is advancing the art of hosting so that our guests can travel brilliantly. As a host with Marriott Hotels, you will help keep this promise by delivering premium choices, sophisticated style, and well-crafted details. With your skills and imagination, together we will innovate and reinvent the future of travel."
good,"i enjoyed this job as a sales representative , i provided guest with a premier customer service by assisting them with finding hotels , making reservations and dealing with guest"
good,"Joined the company in search of more work-life balance and the promised ""hospitality""-centric culture.  The work environment became very stressful very quickly, coworkers overwhelmed, constant process change, high employee turnover within team, and limited sense of control.  If leadership acknowledged higher compensation is not everything employees cared about, it would have been a great place."
good,I started off in management straight out of college. It was hard adjusting and being a manager to older people. No real order was kept in the hotel which made it difficult to enforce rules and new policies
good,"The staff needed help but didn't care enough to help you grow, this was due to the nature of the hotel transitioning to another company and ownership."
good,"not a bad company, it is just whos in charge of the Departments at the time. This job can be very stressful, because of the turn over rates of guest and Managers."
good,Nice place to work for a new high school grad. It was fun and fast paced. Management was a little rocky and it was hard to get things done on any given day but overall okay.
good,Company is losing track of taking care of its employees. Employees that have been with the companies left due to the lack of communication with the new changes and lack of care for the employees. At least this is the issue with the branch in Utah!
good,I loved working for the hotel. It is very fast paste and i loved working with the employees. We got new management and things started to turn for the worse.
good,"Working for a franchised location can go either way. I worked for Columbia Sussex and was not a fan. However, I was task forced to two separate properties to help out when my Hotel was well staffed and the other lacking. I thoroughly enjoyed working at the other two properties, but that may have been that they had better Managers and Directors above me that were happy to help me learn rather than being task forced and made to go through the motions.  I had to ask for a promotion after having been completing the same position for almost a year and the manager was just like uh, okay. So that was difficult to work for someone who did not actively search for ways to motivate their managers in training or other agents."
good,"Working at Marriott Memphis East is sometimes stressful and sometimes slow. The front desk manager is a little difficult to deal with. Both in regards  to her personality and her scheduling. If you don't have another job or go to school she will schedule you based on what the company wants and not what you want. For example you could work 5pm to 11pm, then have to work 7am-3pm the next day. They will want you to display an over the top personality with every guest. This was a problem for me having a more reserved personality . Also be aware that you will only have one 30 minute lunch break and you can't sit down at the front desk. There will be a script they want you to say for every guest because of the auditor. She wants you to say this for every single guest on top of being bubbly and over the top. This gets very irritating and she is micromanages everything and is constantly looking for someone to do something wrong."
good,The General Manager was horrible at making sure the AGM is trained. She also did not work nights or weekends. She also did not like to be bothered by the other employees when she was not there!! VERY BAD!!
good,"I have worked in the kitchens of a few Marriott properties. My overall perception of the company is very good. They offer good pay, good benefits/vacation package, and outstanding travel discounts. "
good,The hardest time of working in this fasted pasted place is that you have to have your rooms done in a timely manner. I really enjoyed my co worker cause that's when teamwork came in to play
good,This place is a good place to work and make money but sometimes the calls are not the best. Prepare to be micromanaged like you've never been micromanaged before. I would recommend it.
good,"as a executive banquet chef most of the time i do all the cooking and prepping with the help of one line chef, nothing much to learned there is no room for advancement"
good,Taking reservations by phone for customers globally.  The company has very strict guidelines for attendance.  It has changed substantially since merger.
good,good working for the marriott on 2 seperate occassions was interesting i noticed growth in the personel but did not see much growth in management the seemed to be stuck on the same track which has proven time and time again to not benifit the employees what so ever
good,Wasnt a bad job just not for me i can bot sit behind a desk all day i need to move around also when i was there they were making lots of changes so very un organized.
good,I was very uncomfortable with the fact that when you started your shift you had to go through a sea of people to find an open area to work.  I would have preferred to have an assigned station that I could go to each shift.
good,"pm  rooms,projects checklists and ice machines,and meeting room power drops,as well as room calls and guest request.walking building for burned out lights"
good,Good job had everything that was  needed to get the work day going loved the tine aline and working great place just bad management the gm. Was very young and mouthy to the housekeepers it like he didn't care about them at all had no heart
good,I was live sound technician here for an internship and it was an ok place to learn live sound. Pretty small lobby. workload was difficult because all sound equipment was on the other side of the hotel and tough to get it to the lobby.
good,"Cada dia  era un reto y un aprendizaje, no solo en lo financiero y contable, sino tambien en lo personal."
good,I worked as a guest service employee I made contact with I guess if they enter the hotel IHOP assist them with your bag and different locations of the city that they needed to know about
good,"First job out of school, learned a lot about working for a big company, how day-to-day works at large company.  Management was great, culture was great."
good,"cleaning all assigned guestrooms including dusting, making beds, soiled linen removal from rooms, and retrieval of clean linen from linen closets, vacuuming, bathroom cleaning, inside window cleaning, replenish room with supplies. Maintain proper usage of cleaning supplies and equipment. Follow departmental policies and procedures and services standards. Report necessary maintenance items, and follow all safety and sanitation policies."
good,"Very great hotel to work for. Very friendly team to work with. The tasks are alot to do like customer service ,daliy  breif, answering calls,bookings,"
good,"Learned how to purchase and order for the hotel this includes food, beverages, plates, and much more. During the internship I also prepped food, opened the kitchen, created a menu, and help improve customer satisfaction as needed."
good,"The work here was slow paced but also have to move fast in each room. Low maintenance from management, no one micromanaging. Great place to learn who you are."
good,"For a call centre type job, it seems better than most. There's great perks for working there and it is a pretty decent company for people to work at."
good,"I loved the team I worked with in the Marina Kitchen restaurant.  All of the veteran employees there were supportive and team oriented which was great!  There were a few bad apples on the team that got away with everything, that was a challenge to work with on some days.  They have the best employee cafeteria here of any job I have every had!  Be careful because they are a tad too corporate about some things.  I never got into trouble in school, but felt like I was in the principles office here unnecessarily on occasions.  The management team could use some work on being more supportive and training the team for further development and improvements in service.  But overall, it was a good place to work.  They serve the best food at top quality ingredients and that made us proud to work here."
good,Gets very busy this time of year with all business starting to pick back up. More banquets and parties are booked and I help do plate ups for these parties.
good,"During our Construction Project Renovations Phase's, Marriott Staffing worked well on assisting and organizing during Live Hotel Operations, General Manager and Director of Engineering were contacts on Project."
good,"Marriott has great medical benfits. You can literally pick any hotel in any country, state, or city and choose to change departments anytime you want. They are very flexible. However the culture at this company is to work everyone as hard as possible to ensure the perfect experience for the guest but they have no consideration for the employees. We arent even seen as second class more like 10th. Not every property is the same but they are not too different from one another. Smaller properties are less stressful with less people to work with. But larger properties are tirelessly busy and they expect you to give your life to them every second you are there and when you go home you worry about the next day instead of thinking of yourself because that is how they train you when you work there."
good,"Overall not a bad job but my one frustration is that given our job their I like to know who I'm working with so I can adjust myself based on how they work, but there was higher turnover due the sporadic hours."
good,"Working within the hotel,  you are given the chance to meet various business owners, interact with people in person as well as on the phone.  You have the ability to travel at a good rate."
good,"it is an okay job but I'm looking for a career,  as of current I work as a prep cook, I'm looking to do more, learn more, & be more with in a company."
good,"I had to do check ins and check outs. Take complaint calls and get the right person on the job for the complaint. Do reports everyday for your shift, and I had to make reservations for our guests."
good,"clean the hotel room individualy and fast , you have a specific amount of rooms to clean and need to be cleaned the right way. all houskeepers have there own rooms to clean to team help"
good,It was a good experience nice people good Good atmosphere I have fun with some people learned a lot of stuff alone the way lotta people is willing to help out with different things always kept my head down and worked for
good,its alright thats about it im going to spam now to meet the stupid character limit now but seriously the job is just ok dont look to grow here its not worth it.
good,"Marriott overall is a good company to work for. The benefits and perks are good and it is easy to relocate and find a job. You can certainly have a good career as a Marriott employee. I feel like most properties I've been to or worked at are poorly managed and often disorganized, but there are many oppurtunities for growth because anyone can become a manager."
good,"Marriott does not make sure that their hotel managers do a great job. In fact, a lot of these managers are inept. Many of the designs of the hotel are ridiculous and have no thought behind it."
good,if  id could keep in touch with the Marriott that I worked for I would probably got back but since I haven't been in that field for a while I  mean cleaning hotels but I would like to do that again.
good,Its super easy and pays well for what you do... Although its also really easy to mess up and ruin your chances at things within the company. You spend a majority of your shift sitting at a desk behind a computer screen waiting for people to call.
good,"My time here went very well as long as you are hard working and willing to do what is asked time here can be great. Very nice management and team of employees, made things run smoothly."
good,bonne expérience de travaille et très bon salaires
good,The Pay rate wasn't enough to live in the are comfortably productive days depended on the events that were happening that day. You must know how to drive a stick shift.
good,The pace was very fast and you are required to meet goals and get treated poorly if you don't meet goals even once and unless you apart of the social circle at this location there is NO room for advancement.
good,The Marriott was such a different atmosphere than what I was used to. I spent over 5 years working at the airport that the adjustment into hospitality was quite a challenge that i was ready for.
good,It's a great place to work if you don't like people looking over your shoulder every minute of it. Over all I liked working there and the atmosphere was great.
good,"I worked for a franchise, not the actual Marriott company. "
good,got there set up dining room for breakfast took orders from patrons waited on order from kitchen served patrons there food collected payments cleaned restaurant went home
good,Saya ingin bergabung di perusahaan bapak dan ibu yang sayang hormati dan ingin bekerja
good,It was a nice gig. I would recommend it as a second job. Management was unprofessional my experience I hope other locations perform better. Thank you!
good,no thank you. I do not want to write a review. It was a great job with open hour and a lot of overtime. You get vacation and personal time off. It is fast pace and a lot of upselling.
good,"as in any company there are its ups and downs. A typical day consisted of reading and responding to emails, taking in coming calls making reservations."
good,Overall the experience with Marriott was very good.  Associates are hard working and friendly.  The management team was professional and worked well with each other.  The job was challenging and rewarding.
good,"I was working with Laz Co who had a contract to operate the valet."
good,"Loved the job but it had too many glitches. I can't speak for all positions at this hotel, but the hotel housekeeper position they are overworked and underpaid. Like all hotels, they are big on perfection but do not back it up with the correct support. You are basically forced to stay and not only finish your 20 plus rooms but also your fellow employees. Some said they worked from 7am to 10pm with only one lunch and no breaks and doing this kinda work you need your lunches and breaks. For this being a high-end hotel they sure don't treat employees well. Im at a new hotel now and it is much better."
good,Good benefits but felt like I was back in high school with employee clicks.  Not the best environment if you are looking to work in a professional atmosphere.
good,"Lots of opportunity to sell vacation packages and time share memberships.  Beautiful property, its fun to meet interesting people and at this location you will."
good,"If you are a new hire to the Customer Engagement Center you may do better than someone who has been with the company for years. Since the big merger those who have been with the company feel betrayed, abandoned by leadership and management and we are leaving as fast as we possibly can. Overnight the company culture, always centered around ""being human"" changed to 'quote them the policy or the terms and conditions.' Before the merger, if you worked in a customer care capacity there was never a time limits on calls. We worked until we got our customer taken care of, and were very proud of it. "
good,"This was first events-focused position I worked that was in a city-hotel environment.  Much easier to keep tabs on than working in a resort setting.  We were fortunate to have such a hard-working, dedicated long-term staff."
good,"your typical day at the Marriott began with prepping in the a. M. For the restaurant the lobby and any room service orders that came in typical shift starts at five 6 in the morning goes till 2 p.m , you feed breakfast in begin p. M. Prep for the dinner service. Skimpiest begins around 2 p. M. And runs about 12 a. M.. set shift consists of prepping everything out for banquets private events restaurant the lobby and any room service orders that might come in for the evening busyness depends on Hotel capacity. the compensation and benefits at the Marriott are okay. Once you in with the Marriott it is a solid job it's a stable job it will always be there if you put the effort into it room for growth is slow but if you're willing to put the time and do it it'll be beneficial in the long run. because of the fact that it's such a giant company there's a lot of management that intertwine with everyday functions as well as corporate rules and regulations which at times make it tedious but if you can get over that and they're a big fan of corporate Marriott would be great"
good,"I need a job. I was a maid at a hotel in OHIO, It  is what it is. Minimum wage needs to we raised. There was a single mother working there who clearly did not support her and her child."
good,"The work scheduling for the hotel was completely arbitrary and followed any nonsensical methodology. If you like working 7 days straight to have other weekend be a 5 day weekend, then this may be a decent fit for you."
good,"Im ex manager HRD in company quiry and Hotel, Restourant 5 stars, and now need job this compeny here, 6281278000108 I want a joint this company, thanks before"
good,Good company. Sales office does not compensate well. Hotel compensate well. Great 401K and great opportunities for promotion from within. Interviews are hard and very structured.
good,"Disappointed with the management, Completely Inefficient, There is no work life balance. No Disciple present in the certain brand. I have mix feeling with the company."
good,I enjoy leading my team to deliver the best experience a guest could have during their stay. My team has always achieved the goals that I set for them. I have enjoyed meeting new people from all over the world.
good,"Clean linen dry towels and a very clean room , A typical work day would consume of confusion today but stay focus in the task at hand always always having in the back of my mind I wanted to keep my career moving foward."
good,It seems like incompetence is rewarded and talent is thrown to the curb. The sure fire way to be promoted from within is to win via popularity contests and not talent. There is no room for advancement within my department so if I want to move up the ladder I would have to leave my hotel and possibly the company. If I want to stay within the company I would have to possibly transfer to a different state and apply for a hire position. The culture within the comany towards engineers is corrosive at best and we're understaffed and overworked.
good,"I enjoy working here because  I love making people happy. I enjoy going above and beyond for my guests, to ensure they have a great stay. It's all about the guest in my book!!"
good,A typical day at work would require me to assist the local residents with their daily procedures.  The hardest part of the job was unexpected complications at the end of my shift.
good,"I was houseman for Marriotts. I also assisted with front desk. Bellman, valet, houseman, shuttle driver was my position. Liked the job but I was on call. I wanted FT but no openings at the time."
good,i would clean up after they served on the buffet restock what was needed to use for the next day wash dishes and replaced them in proper places. i would work in the laundry on days they did not need me in the kitchen
good,I was a housekeeper.! You work your butt off to clean up to 14 rooms. You cannot be slow. Must work st a fast Paced to get done. Manager was a man and cool
good,I liked working here. It was very laid back and coworkers were easy to get along with. My managers were also very friendly and always made sure that I was taken care of.
good,"There was no flexibility on days off, and people were always coming in late to relieve me. The management changed 3 times in the 2 years I worked there. They were very inconsistent and there was favoritism. I feel I did a very good job there and was not rewarded for it. I went above and beyond and I was never compensated for it."
good,Needs to focus more on the associates needs. There is a lack of communication within the teams. There needs to be better culture so there is not a high turn over rate.
good,I really liked working for the Marriott hotel. I was about 17 when i worked for the Marriott it was a great first job i learned a lot of how to clean rooms and makes beds that looked inviting.
good,"I loved my position as cafe cook,  my customer service representative skills were greatly appreciated, I loved cooking for the company, I would of loved to still be working for the company, but sometimes you get over aggitated at your higher ups for not understanding that sometimes you get tired especially when you are a senior citizen.."
good,"it was a great place to work "
good,"I was a consultant at the time of my employment.  "
good,Marriott was a nice enjoyable establishment when i started. I was a temp that thought it was about a construction job. Well that wasnt the case. I ended up in the kitchen and learned all the menu items as well.
good,There is little to no structure and discipline at work where there should be due to consistent mistakes and fooling around. I really do not like the franchise (Columbia Sussex) that owns the property I work at. They are very wishy washy on what they want to be strict on or not and they do not provide paid holidays!
good,Everyday is a day is a new day with new cars that has to be washed .I love how the paste goes super fast during the afternoon makes time go by fast and keeps customers happy
good,"Marriott gave me my first bartender job after I graduated from bartending school. For that I will always be grateful. I truly enjoyed my job., my coworkers, and especially meeting the hotel guest from all around the world and quite a few celebrities."
good,It was a good place to work and fast pace. Working a lot and standing on your feet most of your shift and taking care of all guest issues were the most important
good,"Entry level hospitality industry for a small city location.  Work schedule and tasks were well balanced for the level of difficulty, nothing was inherently too hard but some"
good,its lack of comitcation and they dont really work around your school schedule and you have to work full time. the pay doesnt match up to how much you do there.
good,"Positive: work from home, flexible hours, fun events, emergency hours so you can leave at any time. "
good,Una empresa muy grande con deficientes en salaries jordanas extenuenates
good,"Review guest list, assign room to guest. doing laundry, keeping front area clean making coffee.help with specialty coffee. The hardest would be if rooms were not complete,  Management was great."
good,"I arrived at 8, had to turn in reports to franchisee by 9:15, Balance previous days sales for all departments, submit employee time for the day before. Write checks for deliveries, prepare the bank deposits, submit new hire paperwork, and verify references, conduct safety training and new hire orientation. Make a trip to the bank to do deposits and do change orders for the following day. When necessary, be a third party observer for inventory audits for each department (restaurant, hotel, housekeeping, bar and gift shop)."
good,Book hotel reservations and handle requests. modify or adjust pre existing reservations. Handled loyal members point accounts and unlocked online accounts
good,"Poor staffing levels and limited training.  Lots of perks - free meals, staff lunches.  Crazy schedules and uncontrollable overtime.  Some very talented staff in spite of conditions."
good,"Busy property, but great staff and a true ""family"" feeling. It's a convenient location as well, which makes it easy to recommend restaurants, spas, and shopping to guests."
good,I have worked for them for less than one year. I have had several skin break outs. There is constantly no laundry or mixed up laundry. I feel you cant get your work done effectively because they place too many rooms on you.
good,"It can be stressful ..management can be hit or miss depending on the issue.,definitely some favoritism..great pay and good benefits ..can be a catty environment"
good,"Overall it was a good place to work and a good company to work for. The benefits could be better, but if you invest your all into the company the benefits will be good."
good,Stressful and not a seniority rules company which Is why I'm currently looking for other employment opportunities elsewhere...I would like a job that focuses on ability to preform the task at hand.
good,A typical day at work is cleaning rooms The hardest part of the job is getting all the rooms done in the amount of time you get so if you have 10 gone and five stays you have to be done by that is a six and a half hour day. So it is a fast day I get along with all my co-workers and managment
good,This is a good company and helpful to associates has plenty of benefits and is a equal opportunity company though management styles vary from property to property
good,"compañerismo entre los colegas, buen ambiente laboral a exepcion de algunos jefes, comida y otros beneficios extras"
good,"Just looking for something new"
good,"I had few issues with the job and didn't mind going to work. I needed more money as my lifestyle evolved, and that's why I left the position. Management team was generally professional and approachable."
good,Management has a quick turn so new mangers and supervisors monthly. Servers and employees are not paid accordingly from standards. Employees are upheld to high expectations but do not get recognized for hard work.
good,In a day you would have to clean up to 20 rooms or more. They do provide lunch so thats good. For me it was a hard job. the hardest part is moving fast. Management could be better
good,Manager wasn't very well at talking with her employers but was nice on occasion a typical day would go about 10 hours a day. Was very negotiable about pay not particularly about over time at all.
good,"the work environment was ok, just a lot of slave work for no pay, if you wanted to moves up there was a lot of run around's with the organization within the company"
good,"How to stay calm"
good,Marriott International is a great place to work with many avenues to advance and expand your career. A fun environment. Like any other hotel/hospitality service provider... long days can be had and challenges need to be overcome.. but the culture and lasting relationships can be amazing.
good,"The compensation at this company is average, which can be said for all hospitality industries. Culture is good, and inspiring customer focused. Work-life balance is poor due to woking odd hours."
good,the days are very long they typically start around  8 am and will end 630pm to 7pm . Housekeeper/ Room Attendants have 18-20  checks out daily and average of 15 stays
good,"Work day is fine. Coworkers are fine. Management leaves something to be desired. Discounted lunches are good."
good,"This job taught me a lot about cable and what it is to be a member of a team, it gave me the basics about customer service vs the companies mission and how to balance the two."
good,"Management kept a culture of hard work and friendliness. An overall welcoming atmosphere made it a joy to go to work. Sometimes there where interdepartmental problems that would persist and be sluggish to resolve. Most of the managers where helpful in solving these problems. The hours are irregular, my scheduled time can range anywhere from 9am to 3pm. Hard to maintain personal schedule. The amount of work to do varies day to day, sometimes there is so much to do that I don't leave until 1 in the morning, other times I sit around for hours with nothing to do. The work is simple, not very engaging. I learned much in the time I was there about how to interact with different guests."
good,"we was just transitioning so I wasn't there long."
good,"It was an ok place in which to work. My work schedule changed every week and that made it difficult to plan a life. I learned a lot from my supervisor and he advanced me as he was able. The raises were in small change and infrequent but my immediate supervisor always went to bat for me. The workplace culture was that many employees did not do their share and were annoyed when I asked them to do more,"
good,Fun and exciting place to work with opportunities.So etimesbt very seldom youreabletogoon trips. Training is ok and once you get the hang of the system
good,Competitive place to work. Must be willing to work harder than others. Compensation is not the most competitive. Must have multiple jobs to survive where you live
good,I am unable to provide a review for Marriott due to not working for the company very long once transition over to Marriott Hotels from Starwood hotels.
good,"It is hard to review Marriott international because I have always worked with Starwood legacy hotels. Once we were acquired by Marriott we went through many changes, some good and some bad. I can say that many Starwood legacy employees are now moving on to other Hotel Chains due to the Marriott way of doing things."
good,I've worked for 2 Marriotts and they were completely different my first location was THE BEST management was friendly honestly like a family (some differences but what family doesn't have them) but people were honest forgiving and always willing to help and teach. New location is sad no hours gossip everyday TERRIBLE pay and even bounced checks like come on. I'm not going to let this location ruin my spirit for this company because i have faith in Marriott itself based off of my 1st property.
good,this company is great to work for if you can handle the daily rush of guest coming in and out overall i learned a lot and if i can work there you can work anywhere
good,"Great job if you are just starting out in the 'work field' being exposed to both management and direct public."
good,the workplace is a comfortable place where most people get along but management to certain departments lack the leadership. The assistant general manager is amazing this person helps out how ever they can.
good,Marriott as a whole is a good company to work for hands down. the discounts were well appreciated by myself and my family and friends who got a chance to use it
good,"It's not a great place to work and also not a bad place to work. It paid the bills, but still was fairly low pay. Some great people there. Typical corporate hotel job."
good,This was a spot that the US NAVY sent to to do some intern Chef work at a hotel in Downtown Honolulu/ don't remember much as it was a while ago 20  years
good,"Pretty good company to work for and I learned a lot within the hotel corporation; I opened the bistro most mornings and served hot, gourmet sandwiches and breakfast items along with being a bistro at Star Bucks coffee  located within."
good,"It is slow paced, very collaborative and long distance to commute but there is no advancement opportunities. Also there is no days off with a stagnant pay."
good,"Management is supportive but there are not many opportunities for advancement. In addition, compensation and benefits could be better. Overall a good company to gain experience, but not to grow in."
good,Great place to learn to sell but unless you are a consistent closer you will not make it very long in this position. But I think everyone was supportive and wantded to see you succeed.
good,The company i worked for was very poor disorganized and unpleasant but it has nothing to do with marriot incorpated in general because the company was franchised out by a company named Sabraton Lodging
good,"Overall, benefits at the place are terrible when you work in a place that you don't get any sick day is just terrible, to wor in a place like this actually."
good,Due to the recent changes this place has started to lose its coolness.  When I first started this was one of the best jobs that i ever had.  Now this place seems to suck the life out of people
good,Overall a good experience working with W Hotels.  Very cookie cutter with no ability to think outside the box.  Everything is instruction based with a manufactured experience.
good,I enjoyed my position and the people I worked with but the manager made it very hard to do the job to the best of my abilities.  I was on call 24/7 and was not reimbursed for all the time that I commited to the job.
good,"A typical was started by completinr the prep list made. Then, completing service. Afterwards, we have to make a list of things that neede to be orderd from the main Kitchen. If you were one of better employees you would then be sent to another outlet for evening duties."
good,"I worked for the Sheraton, not the Marriot. The Sheraton was not very flexible with hours, but did not hesitate to offer them. Management was decent when they needed to be, but had a lack of value in leadership. The co-workers were great and the work environment was good. Great way to expand on customer service skills."
good,"Getting the weekly schedule in a timely manner is low on managements priorities, so there's usually only one maybe two days you can plan in advance for the coming weeks. They were good about working around school schedules and what not. Management is kind of wishy-washy, and don't always follow through. Coworker relationships are pretty good, very much family natured. Really hard to work with customers that the company has turned into monsters with a free reward program and wanting to please every customers complaint no matter how wrong they are."
good,"My experience was a special one because of a partnership between Marriott and the GE Healthcare Training Facility."
good,Friendly hospitality and customer service is a key factor to any travel experience. Staying at this Hotel is a good opportunity to relax and re energize for the busy week ahead.
good,great place to work when every one was on the same page sometimes our chef was missing in action at critical times which made the work environment sometimes very difficult but as a true cook all obsticals and difficulties were manageged the tipical day you didn't know until you walked threw the door I learned trust your own instinks cause sometime it seemed other coworkers were setting yiu up for failure the hardest part of the job to me depended on me and how I handled myself the most enjoyable part of the job was when the team clicked on all syliders and got the job done the right way
good,"every day in the kitchen i learn someting new, from how to make prep to how to serv the dish, good chef around that hotel and good organizacion of everything."
good,I was a housemen for a Marriott Residence Inn. It was a lot of work. I wore multiple hats there. I did a lot of different things that wouldn't fall under the umbrella of housemen. for that reason alone I think compensation should have been much hire given the fact that I was doing cross dept jobs in addition to my own tasks
good,"The better shifts are from 7am-3pm. Any shift after that is 3-11pm or 11-7am. The pay is $9-10 depending on how long you stay. I would recommend this job or any hotel job to students. "
good,You must have meetings to try to sell more room inventory but it doesn't help. You try to improve but some sales are hard to make with clients who have cancer or leukemia. Sometimes there were not any clients.
good,"I did my job and many other that were not my job and didn’t get paid for the extra work,"
good,Great place to work however I’ve head to many dramatic stories of both regular CSRs and Supervisors. Plus the company down sized and a lot of good people lost their jobs.
good,"This company offers lots of locations to work. If you want to submit a transfer, do it! They will speak with you about opportunities and your skill set."
good,"Typical workday consists of forecasting, revenue management, driving sales, maximizing revenues, controlling costs, guest satisfaction, associate satisfaction, & providing a positive overall guest experience."
good,Fast paced environment. worked on about 18 rooms per day as a housekeeper. It was difficult to finish rooms on time but I managed with practice and experience.
good,"Other than the lower pay (which is a standard it seems in the hospitality industry), I had no issues with working for Marriott. They seemed to have a good direction and communicated that effectively."
good,"Although I met many people with various personalities, I would not work for this establishment again.  At the time it was franchised owned.  The corporate did little to take care of their employees. Work became mundane.  There was no room to grow and tasks were limited.  I felt I had so much more to offer"
good,"Enjoy my position and the company.  Each day is a new day with different challenges and rewards, it is fun to see the team come together to make each and every guests stay an experience."
good,"Cultural diversity of co-workers. "
good,Aplicacion de trabajo en equipo para que la calidad suba en general .
good,"I liked my job however I didn't see any growth potential.  I liked my manager, however the hierarchy was not good in my opinion.  I don't see many opportunities to promote."
good,"Deben de tomar mas en cuenta a los asociados, hacerles saver que se lea valora y tenerlos como piesa importante del equipo a lograr metas."
good,"I do not recommend this place to work. I was not allowed to sit down ever.  Had to answer the phone and be judged on the speech given.  Never felt appreciated for anything.  Used the oldest program for a computer that there is, DOS.  Not user friendly at all.  Did not like this job or the management"
good,This is a great place to start if you are early in your career. You have access to multiple departments and each can lead you up the chain of command.
good,"Process all guest check-ins by confirming reservations, assigning room, and issuing and activating room key. Process all payment types such as room charges, cash, checks, debit, or credit. Process all check-outs including resolving any late and disputed charges. Answer, record, and process all guest calls, messages, requests, questions, or concerns. Coordinate with Housekeeping to track readiness of rooms for check-in"
good,"Una comida por parte del Hotel a empleados"
good,This job was very difficult. The managers were very nice and helpful. Not a job i would recommend if you are expecting. Great opportunity for all people.
good,Took inventory of used items from mini bar in guests rooms. Restocked items and charged guest for items used from the bar. Great part time job while attending school.
good,Make sure they are in order..They told me i would only be working 8hours i had to stay most time 3 hours over .Make sure you are precise on your working conditions
good,"Customer satisfaction, Interpret customer feedback, Call handling. Managing customer data Customer service listening to customers managing expectations Telephone etiquette Email handling Resolving problems"
good,Clean rooms after the guests leave. Management has been with the company a very long time. Hardest part of the job was getting everything done within the work hours.
good,Great place for learning and development for professional as well as interpersonal skills. Fantastic company with a huge portfolio of job opportunities and benefits.
good,I learned project and time management working there the experience was beneficial being that I learned how to properly clean. I atarted out handling light issues but they offered me the position as supervisor walking in the door
good,I Enjoyed working there i wish i didnt leave. My peers were nice the staff were great overall good company to work for id recommend it to anyone who is out of a job
good,The Westin offered similar benefits to Mammoth Mountain with out the affiliation. The location was great. It offered corporate work experience in a small town.
good,"Mi trabajo consistía en atender a los clientes del hotel, realiz cheks-in y salidas, asi como informarles de temas turísticos en la ciudad."
good,"It was a good place to work. Cool staff, coworkers and free food. There were long days and hours. The overtime was average and the job not so difficult."
good,"·	Demonstrated ability to multitask, prioritize and resolve problems and communicate effectively in a fast pace environment "
good,"I am a punctual and reliable person who works well under pressure. I am able to work both in a team environment and on my own initiative. I have a friendly disposition and have a good sense of humour. I have been in a position of trust, handling money for others. My goal is to work for a reputable employer and to grow professionally as a professional housekeeper."
good,I worked at Starwood and at not Marriott so I don't want to comment on what it is like to work at a company that I don't have experience with.  My Starwood experience was positive.
good,"While Marriott International is a great corporation, the hotels I worked for were a franchised Renaissance. The survey reflect mostly working for Colwen management"
good,Great company the employees seem to be friendly.  I did not stay because the commute was too long and costly.  No assistance with transportation.  It would of been good if not for the cost of commuting and the time to commute.
good,Job is hard work. Can accommodate my availability. Staff is professional and great to get along with. job is demanding and requires a lot of detail and hard work.
good,"Company is very supportive of their associates, however it feels like corporate culture overtakes the brand identity"
good,"what i've learned in my work is patience and be hardworking person."
good,"●	Created Daily Recaps & Balance journals"
good,I've never worked here so  I am not sure what to say about this company. I'm sure it will solely depend on the position Id work if I were to be hired.
good,typical day at work included being able to inventory and checking checklist from the other agents. Checking guest complaints and resolving the issues at hand. I was able to make reservations and in house guest.
good,checking people in and out great place to work management great all employees team player very clean and quiet work environment great place for advancing to different Marriotts
good,"Starting on your first day, you can expect outstanding benefits as a full- or part-time employee, including:"
good,"the management was very poor, bad communication, unfair."
good,"I learned how to be independent and how to solve a problem during work time, how to handle the guest, to ensure that daily operations are run smoothly,need to be warm, friendly, proactive, savvy and professional when dealing with guests.The work culture is fun but a quite short of break lunch.The hardest part of job is when dealing with the guest however need to find a solution to overcome this problem."
good,"Worked in several departments of hotel, many hours as expected with this type of position. Good advancement opportunities if you are willing to put the hours in."
good,"I was not with this hotel long enough to really give a fair assessment."
good,"I enjoyed the environment of the Hotel/restaurant life, but the hours were inconsistent and I felt the pay did not match the quality and difficulty of the work."
good,"Transport guests safely to and from the hotel, clean and maintain the shuttle van, clean facility common areas, assist with linen/laundry services, assist guests when needed."
good,"Company provided sufficient resources in order to correctly inspect room by room, allowing the day to go by quick.  If it wasn't for the company i would not be able to do my work efficiently.."
good,"gives alot of rooms to clean at a time "
good,"Temporary position hired threw temp service steady on my feet position kept me active cleaning bathrooms guest rooms. On call to attend guest needs, customer service ready."
good,"the job was a good pace job very friendly people and different cultures also, only thiing is they are not understandable when it comes to family issues"
good,"one of my first professional jobs. a great place to work and career advancement. benefits and perks of working there, great discounts and flexible schedules may need to work late at times."
good,"very challenging and rough"
good,That was my biggest issue. Management. Things weren't being corrected and I didn't have the proper materials to do the job both correctly and efficiently.
good,This job was a tough one. Housekeeping is not something that I'm wanting to do again. The aftermath of the physical labor is what pushed me over the edge.
good,I worked at this hotel and the athmosphere is classy and highend. I would recommend people to stay at the hotel but i am looking forward to a need job experience.
good,Brand and concept is very interesting Management is weak
good,"loved my job, people,gm,agm. family owned all kiss butts, none worked on the floor so had no idea what it was like. tell ya what to do not knowing how it worked or how it went. head of catering(son in law) always messing things up, food late, forgot, wrong, not enough, but tel lya how to do it. I could go on but won't. but I still loved what I did."
good,"I was pretty shocked at the lack of support for the employees where I worked. You would assume that because of the high quality of care the Ritz-Carlton provides to their customers, they'd at least extend some of that to their employees. Nope. No benefits."
good,"Long days of 8 hours or more, on your feet. Taking drink and food orders. The management is very professional, the company is all about it's customer service."
good,"Place for comfort, employer support, great benefits, you meet different cultures. Busy environment, place for growth, flexible with schedules, warm inviting, always greet people with a smile."
good,"I liked the work as it was hands on but the team I worked with it felt like every man for himself, I met a lot of people I met Tom cruise when he was filming mission impossible at raf witttering so that’s a bonus but the work I did I never got the gratification I should have done"
good,This workplace can be a good starting point if you are interested in hospitality. A typical day is long; we get 15-22 rooms a day to clean and maintain. There are some days we have everything we need to the job correctly and in a timely fashion; then there are other days when we do not have everything we need and that is what makes the day longer and more difficult. Management is okay but could be better in some areas.
good,The hotel is a great place for entry level to learn and grow in the hospitality industry. Large hotel with many options for learning the trade. Great for young work force.
good,"An environment run by the associates, not management. A toxic environment. Not compensated for the extra responsibilities they give you without asking. A clique, high school atmosphere."
good,"Very busy day preparing meals,setting tables.learning how to fold napkins.good management, team work.serving eight hot plates. Great,people..friendly."
good,"I would avoid working at this property as working as a Guest Experience Representative, because it lacks a good work life balance. On the plus side, the staff in general are amazing. They make you feel at home with family."
good,"Had to plan alot of upcoming events for various vendors. But when 9/11 happened, the future of the hotel diminished. Lack of events were being planned and the hotel suffered."
good,"the workplace that we have in Marriott alforsan hotel is warm. everybody is easy to approach with and the management cares for the associates. the management made us feel at home. like for example, every month they give a lunch treat in the buffet restaurant whoever is going to have their birthday in a particular month. the management also organize sports and activities for the staff. whats nice about my job as a restaurant reservations agent is that it is not shifting. the job is not that stressful and grueling. what I also like about my job is that I was able to learn and be expose on the operations of the all day dining restaurant because we tend to help as a support in the restaurant whenever its fully booked and busy."
good,It was a job that I didn't enjoy very much. Some of the other employees caused drama with others. When working you would have a crazy amount of rooms to clean and people wouldn't clean all of their and leave them for other people to do. They liked to pick favorites there. It just wasn't a good atmosphere to work in.
good,Great Company to work have to make your own growth.  Learn as much as you can while working at this company.  I enjoy working with everyone!  Looking forward to work many years with this company.
good,"I learned a lot from my job and meeting different faces of our guest, some are really nice and some are just okay, i still need to make them feel welcomed. I had the chance to placed for a different jobs such as Food and Beverage Server, Room Server, Pool Server, Restaurant Server to Supervising the employees, I found it hard but like what all my college's told me, i make everything look so easy because i always smile and make them happy."
good,"Working at the Westin South Coast Plaza was a fun fast paced job.  I liked being part of the sales and catering team.  My favorite part was tours and the free buffet. I supported the sales and catering team by typing up contracts, answering calls and giving small tours. I also produced reader boards and coordinated service with banquet departments and vendors."
good,"we need more guest coming,so interaction becomes more efficient,as a GRE i love to interacted with people solve their queries lead them to place where their comfortable,and i want my guest to be comfortable and want them to come again and again to my hotel and approach"
good,"Never a dull day at the Marriott. We were short handed for most of the time but pulled through our events with flying colors. The kitchen is fast production and quality food. The hardest part of the job is you are fully detached to this job, there is no outside life or free time. The most enjoyable is there is always something new to do, your never in a rut and you feel like you have accomplished so much in a small amount of time."
good,"Not flexible, job was very simple once you got to know the computer, working with management was kind of difficult. Never a set schedule always scheduled all different places."
good,"I love the hotel discounts, but due to the Marriott merger, auto-progression is not available currently. I have worked at starwood for nearly two years, but I believe I would work better in a different environment."
good,"great place to work"
good,"it was my first international brand to join, and I owe it a lot"
good,I had to catch 3buses and 2trains was a very challenging commute only to come to wrk maybe 4brs a day and was around only Spanish people made it hard to communicate at times
good,Indian Realty Expo - is a property show where all the companies in India show their properties to their customers in UAE and its a easier way of interacting with their customers. Our main job was to greet the customers and take them to their desire stalls.
good,"Did an 8 week placement at the Marriott in Malaga, did a 10 hour shift and wasn't allowed a break or anything to drink is 30 degrees heat. Managers weren't very nice however this could be because I was on an internship."
good,You make the best out of it. People are nice and some of the managers. Overall the best part of job was care rallies where they give out trips.Pay was pk.
good,I was expecting to work full time but since they had a high turn around rate my hours were cut and I had to work more late night shifts because new employees needed to be trained during the day
good,I enjoyed working up at the front desk with the marketing team. i did not enjoy working in the pre arrival department with the manager there. LK is her name and she was a BEAST!
good,"Typical Day = no two days are the same"
good,Always assist my co workers for teamwork. Day starts fast pace. Love interacting with guests and always go out my way to help them. I learn how to get along with people from different backgrounds.
good,"The first days at work are always hard especially because you have not mastered the IN's and OUT's of the job enviroment. No job is hard to do but small encouragements can bring down mountains. A Small ''Thank You'' always does a miracle n not just the money."
good,Many of the guests are reasonable especially when the are there for work but in some cases where they are there for leisure they throw  caution to the wind and get drunk and give employees hard time
good,"Starwood is now Marriott so many things are about to change. Starwood and Marriott are very different in the way they conduct business and I do not foresee Marriott International adapting very many of Starwood's practices, policies, or procedures."
good,Springhill Suites was an OK place to work at long hours not enough staff. Hotel manager was a great guy Enjoyed working with him while I was there not sure if I would return
good,"if youre looking for an entry level handyman job, they will train you. overall decent place to work. not much to complain about overall, but it can always be better."
good,Productive and fun workplace with pool and there is a swimming pool at the rooftop where we can pass our day having fun.Actually the hotel is located near the haza bin zyaad stadium.
good,"When I worked at The Westin, it was the largest hotel in downtown Indianapolis. The job was very fast-paced and stressful, however there was good teamwork and camaraderie amongst operating departments. I was proud to for for The Westin!"
good,working as a cashier..handling cash and reservations...happy at work but got sick because of smoke...a very nice place to work with a very good and kind manager
good,work was good had stuff to do mostly all the time worked smart not hard and we all was good pay was not enough .and that about it as fare as the job was.
good,"This place is as stressful as any hotel job, May not be the same now sense the hotel was new and still growing. a career can be found here if you have the patience."
good,The property since my employment there has changed ownership.  Under Marriott International the hotel operated like a traditional airport hotel.  Has multiple operating outlets and is staffed competitively.
good,"Not a bad job for a part time extra job, varied tasks, helping guests, check in/out, food & drinks preparation for room service and bar, some cleanings tasks, some admin work, general security and monitoring cctv etc"
good,"Hotel life is unsociable but the team you work with get you through. Many perks to the role including staff benefits at other hotels so you get to spend time with loved ones. Makes up for al the hours,"
good,J'ai passé 2 ans en alternance dans cette structure. L'expérience chez eux a été formatrice notamment sur le point de mon intégration dans une structure professionnel.
good,"In some areas Westin is great but it's not the Westin name you work for it's the management company and how rigid they are, they say they consider the employees but mostly it's the bottom line for the owner they are concerned with."
good,"Everyone on our team had a great personality and we got along together great. That's the reason I stayed as long as I did. However, 9.15 is not enough for the amount of responsibility we deal with on a daily basis"
good,employed of the month every other month they chose  one employed every other month from front office department and housekeeping department and engineering department
good,"I started working here in college. They were good to work with my schedule and they offered training in management. I enjoyed working with the golfers, both members and guests."
good,"I did benefit a lot from working there, learned a lot, met so many people, special team work and management tricks. Had a great leader who helped me big time."
good,Great Place to work. The discounts are good. The work life balance is okay. They give you the hours you need to work. The pay is okay for the job. Room for advancement
good,"It was understaffed. Some people were very nice. Must know how to multi task well.The hotel went through a full renovation, and it looks very nice. The benefits were also great."
good,"laid back place to work, with minimum supervision. Great job for a retired person. sometimes the stress of learning a new position can get to you and that can be worked through."
good,I loved working at the convention center and the Marriot. I got to meet a lot of different people and make a lot of new friends. I love working places that I feel safe at and those two places I felt very safe.
good,The hotel was operated well with young managers who worked hard to provide top notch customer service.  The perks and discounts were wonderful and the employees had fun mostly at work which is a rare thing.
good,"Building a great Team is one of the most vital keys to success in a work place. I learned that when you enjoy your team, your job becomes more of a hobby, ad something you look forward to doing. When you are happy with your team, it shows when assisting guests and everyone else you come in contact with. This property had an amazing team."
good,"Checked rooms after housekeepers cleaned them, and then would send them back if something wasn't done correctly."
good,"Nothing special about this job, a lot of work and the pay was not so great. The hotel where I was working was in bad shape, needed a lot of repairs and maintenance."
good,Comfortable and gets you by. A lot of hard workers go unrecognized and those who are recognized don't deserve it yet get promoted. Not somewhere i would want to retire.
good,"The property was difficult to work at, since there was a lot of deferred maintenance. Things were not kept to an acceptable level at times.  They pinched too many pennies."
good,"Nice place to work but they will work you a lot. They will put you to do multiples jobs at once per example if you are a housekeeper you will have a lot of room to clean, they will make you help other co-workers once you dive with your job. Additionally they may put you to do the laundry on top of everything you already did."
good,Checked guests in and out during my shift and also closed out the books for the day so every thing would post for the day and reports are ready for management the next day
good,Everything that I don't know as an employee I learned it here. They made me who I am today and teaches me those things that I thought that I can't do.
good,"Solid culture, innovative and fun, engaging, work life balance maintained, solid professionals, caring, supportive, investing in personal development,"
good,"Looked after me while I worked there, had good wages for doing a good job. Was sad to leave the job due to family circumstances. Would recommend any one to work there"
good,"good place to work. same company, white lodging. great  manager. worked with great people. worked with all departments. enjoyed working with everyone."
good,"Best part of the job was virtually traveling, hardest part was weird hotel customer service problems like bedbugs or dirty rooms, etc. There are a lot of different people who work there, so everyone seems to be largely accepted. Management is seriously lacking in many departments. There are only a handful of dedicated, knowledgeable managers, that also have their employees best interest in mind and focus. I learned about a lot of different countries, hotels, and types of travelers. I learned how to resolve many unexpected problems."
good,I had started my career as in the begining it looks perfect to grow but less chance to grow as the management was good in regards with the brand as again it was mixed international culture.
good,"Ok friendly and out going steady pace but can be busy."
good,"nice place to work, the GM was a fair and hard working woman .Departments were well organizes and ran. employee turn over was great the pay rate did not match work load of each employee .front desk was under staff"
good,"first time in hotel and restaurant industry, learned a lot how to handle different customers, how to satisfy their needs and exceed their satisfaction"
good,all the work mates where spot on and i didnt wont to leave but had to for my own reasons and would love the chance to go back but in a different job role
good,Experience bien pour débuté mais niveau salariaux très faible.
good,"This was my first sales positon. Assisted timeshare members exchange their properties on an annual basis and renewed membership with company. Dealt with all types of properties, but towards the end became a specialist with Marriott Timeshares."
good,"we are proud of being a Diverse & Inclusive Organization – we have people from all over the world working in our offices, and we extend this to our recruiting practices.  We are a meritocratic organization and an equal opportunity employer.​"
good,"Professional, great pay, clean environment. Lunch is provided in the cantina for free and the hotel is a beautiful environment to be in. Upper management of the hotel was very kind even though I was a temp. No training is offered, its a jump in and learn as you go type of deal. I would still gladly work for them again though."
good,"I enjoyed working at a Hotel. At the time, was a very different position to hold. Best part was meeting a lot of interesting guests, including a recruiter for my football Team Pittsburgh Steelers. Even got team apparel sent to me from him. Highlight of my experience working there. I started working night shifts, thats pretty much where I lost interest."
good,"My first hotel job, ""Meet me under the clock,"" great location (Union Square).  Learned so much and was able to advance with the organization quickly.  Got lost in the shuffle during training, completed internship, but offer/relocation was not appropriate at the time."
good,"New company just took over and benefits are up in the air. Job security is a question due to new owners previous history, Currently we lost our medical and 401K benefits."
good,"Some days are busy, but most of the time you are just standing there waiting for something to do.  Not best for someone who is looking for a fulfilling job."
good,"Management was lazy, Management stole money and tried to blame it on employees. They did not pay us sick leave even though we were entitled to it. Their family was at the hotel using hotel ameneties. I think this was very unprofessional"
good,"Wasn't really there long enough to form an opinion, but it is a good job if you like talking to  people over the phone and enjoying the perks of some free travel."
good,"I don't have any idea why a job service would need me to write a review about a place that I have formerly worked at. Well if this will get me more job opportunities than I'm all about it. Spring hill suites was a nice place to work. I enjoyed working with many different people, from all walks of life. I would never have left, but I had to move out of the area. The commute was just too much, the amount of money spent on gas was just too much."
good,Good environment to work in. Very busy. At the time the benefits were good. There is opportunity to grow within the company. Great education reimbursement program.
good,"Starwood is a good company to work for. Unfortunately, management is not always straightforward and open. They can at times show favoritism which creates a stressful environment. Overall it's a good company to work for."
good,"The location is downtown and you have to pay for parking and walk 5 blocks."
good,"I enjoyed the job"
good,Die Tage sind unterschiedlich aufgebaut. Arbeitszeiten sind unregelmässig. Die Kollegen sind nett. Gelernt habe ich mit Stress umzugehen.
good,"It was a few years ago when I worked there. Great property, with good benefits. While working there we went through many changes with management and structure. Created an unbalanced environment at the time. Could be better now?"
good,"Good to have for a second job. Company is well respected. Employees at this particular location can make things difficult at times, but overall an OK place to work"
good,Patrolling the interior and exterior of the property. making sure guests and employees are safe. logging in patrol hours and securing locked doors in and around the building.
good,"This job gives you the advantage to have an earlier day if you are a hard and quick worker."
good,Great place to work love the environment great people to work around everybody a team player you learn a lot great pay love seeing all the new face a and the guest
good,"This is small scale industry ,fresher get good start ,getting good technical knowledge.Slary wil be less but fresher sgoot start & learning fesilities"
good,En poste mais en quête de nouvelles opportunités professionnelles.
good,Tons of really cool people. We were in the middle of a change in managers which changed our work environment. I didn't really enjoy the atmosphere after that.
good,"Starwood was a good place to work at first but then I could not keep up with the demands that they told us we had to do. A typical day was usually very stressful with all the guests calling in and trying to make sure everything is right on their reservation, But we usually got maybe a 1 minute between calls. The most enjoyable part was either the listening to other peoples calls or doing hot topics."
good,The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Louisville and is a lovely building. Departments seemed to work against each other instead of working as a team that could make everyone's job a little easier.
good,fine place to work for some good some where bad. everyone experience will be different. pay was fine good discount schedule was fine everything was fine
good,"Fast pace environment need to work fast n clean rooms for the next guests make them feel at home"
good,Nice place with nice people. The workers are all so sweet for the most part. the guest are very nice especially the regulars. the biggest [problem is just that the hotel is in poor condition and sooooooo outdated
good,"Regular communication with employees of the hotel. A typical day for me is screening candidates, sending them emails out, moving them through in the hiring system. Tracking down their performance review deadlines, annual bonuses. Communicating closely with department heads and assisting them with their staffing needs."
good,It is a very nice hotel.  It has a lot of amenities and services.  I enjoyed the staff and working with other departments.  The work culture is diverse and accommodating.
good,Fun job high call volume flexible schedules full and part time positions weekly pay apply and see for yourself if this job is a good fit for you located in an easy to access area lots of on break options
good,"When doing valet is typical everyday, Because you work with different people with different attitude each day. What I learned was to have patience and make sure to get the job done."
good,"A typical day started with getting my bank, setting up the bar and"
good,"It's a very nice hotel to stay at and the golf course is very nice. All in all it was a good experience, I learned how to deal with different customers and problems."
good,"In addition to the casino within the resort, River Cree had a variety of food and beverage outlets (although Marriott only operated the buffet restaurant), so moving through different outlets is next to impossible."
good,The marriott was cool internship I thought it was fun and i learned alot. the people where very nice and they took time instructing and helping me out.
good,"i went for work experience, didn't enjoy it but everyones each to their own. The staff who i was working with were quite rude and i felt quite isolated."
good,The hours were nice so was the managment making sure we had break and we were safe and okay. They were very strict and did nit care on what you had to say. I would say work here but make sure you do not get pushed around
good,Hard job but not a good compensation scheme. Many unpaid hours ...
good,"There is a great culture at the Marriott. You really feel a sense of pride when working here and that isn't a very common thing to find. The pay could be more reflective of the workload, but that isn't likely to change. At times I would work several different positions in a day over the span of a few months, but be paid the same rate for them all. They really need to reevaluate the term ""reasonable request"". Other than that, the benefits are wonderful. Hotel discounts are incredible considering Marriott has over 30 brands and 5500 hotels worldwide."
good,"Muy buen lugar de trabajo, es como una escuela."
good,The job was easy but on certain days or weeks during events or holidays the hotel was sold out and under staff and it made things especially hard for the housekeepers. The housekeepers were fun to work with and for the most part we helped each other out. Every month we celebrated whoever had a birthday that month with a card and lunch provided from management! I like the job but on the days people checked out things got rough because either not having enough supplies or employees.
good,"Unique aspect in that you are bartender/front desk/housekeeping (if the attendant is off for the night, since 24 hour bar/hotel). Granted, you are not paid to do all of these positions. It's a way for them to 'give you more rounded experience' but what that really means is 'run with a skeleton crew to cut costs without paying you for the other two positions a hotel usually pays for'. Moxy attitude and what keeps guests coming back is that millennial feel, the risque all night bar environment, etc. Then the corporate feel slowly eeks its way in and those who want to choke out the real ""moxy"" feel make it feel more and more corporate. I left before it got to the point of just another gimmick millennial hotel in front of corporate facade, because that's where it was heading."
good,"Good place to work if you can use 20 or more programs at once. good pay ,hours so so, advancement good, training was good but need to have more time on call floor before working on call floor. Trainers  were not helpful,very rude."
good,I earned money in tips even without day off you will be happy too.but the sad part is they have problem that time in labour over quota also thats why they cannot provide a employment visa.
good,"Latino Steakhouse is amazing restaurant, and it's very interesting to work there. The main problem is salary. I want to change company just because of it. I know and I am 100% sure i can grow more, because I am interested in every kind of job. I know everything about  this restaurant, and I am gratefull to my team because they helped to learn everything."
good,"Large Company but too large for personalization, almost considered a number or one of their many properties. Starwood expanded rapidly thus personalization lost in the shuffle."
good,"Was a good place to work prior to Columbia Sussex bought the property."
good,Loved the job. A few minor bumps here and there and didnt like the fact it had bed bugs but the job was easy booking hotel reservations worldwide did not like working until 2am
good,"The Marriott Syracuse Downtown has a lot to offer as a hotel in Syracuse. There a lot of great things about it, like an inclusive work environment, extra curriculars to be involved in as well as free lunch. However management is really still getting things together and isn't quite there yet and depending on what shift you work, the free lunch they promise may not be provided. They are unionized. And the pay is fairly decent. Overall I would say it's not a bad place to work."
good,La parte más difícil. Lograr en 7 horas ordena limpiar organizar más de 16/17 habitaciones
good,lack of recognition and involvement from higher management with employees...
good,"Hotel très beau, bon esprit d'équipe."
good,"I had a good experience learning, however the management should learn to look after its employees to enable good customer reviews and satisfaction, the management should also learn to leave its employees on their offs and not repeatedly call them to give them a work list. The authorities should be able to train their managers well so that the managers can train their subordinates."
good,The hours were long and lack of communication with management.  The benefits were great and affordable.  I learned how to manage individuals with different personalities.
good,"I worked for the sales office in NYC in midtown. I have never seen a company as disorganized as this one. The management here are like chickens running around with their heads cut off. They have no idea what they're doing at all. There is zero communication about anything. Seriously, they are so lackluster. "
good,i liked my time working there while sometime it felt a little over worked all in all its a ok company.Meeting new people was my favorite part of the job and the discounts come in handy when traveling .
good,A typical day would include checking the pool and spa chemicals and making sure the refrigerator temperature logs are being complete. I also am responsible for delegating out tasks for the engineering team. I really enjoy learning new things and challenging myself.
good,"I like the job as far as what i did.I will say I dont think "
good,"They have a good pay for staffs, and they place heavy priority on training and development."
good,Park cars get cars do paper work repeat. some tips. try your best to stay awake. pray the person who relieves you comes in on time.
good,"They are a good Company to work for. The staff welfare is very good however the job is demanding. "
good,I really liked the culture that Marriott Brought to Gaylord. It allowed me the opportunity to really expand my horizon in the hospitality management sector.
good,Amazing benifits and a fun place to work. Always great employees and amazing managers and good money. Good security and cameras
good,"I was advised I would be assigned a set of accounts, but had to cold call potential clients on a regular basis. I enjoyed the hotel business, but cold calling was not for me."
good,The typical day begins with me reviewing all transactions and compiling data in order to complete the financial statement for that given day.
good,"Working in the events department meant that everyday was different, with different customers attending different events. It also changed from day to night with business meetings and conferences in our small function rooms and school proms in the larger rooms in the evening."
good,Didn't care for the work environment and constant pressure to continually badger customers to commit to reserving rooms.
good,"Minimum of 50 hours per week is required. Constant change in the office. Big Company, took over Starwood hotels so many opportunities for growth internally."
good,"Its a great place to work, but if you want to be a manager, pay is not great. Lots of rewarding work with the right team. Great people to work with"
good,You work from morning to night but you get to enjoy yourself with the people and the work life. You work hard and you enjoy hard too. I had a great time working there n i miss that life
good,The Marriott is a great company to work for when fresh out of college and is suitable as a first time job but there just is no opportunity to progress further.
good,Make sure everything was up to standards.. food comes out on time & still hot.. &Amadeus sure I make the quest happy while they enjoyed their breakfast
good,"The hotel is good, it has everything thing that a five star hotel requires, but all the basic requirements only. Draw backis the management. New ideas are never accepted. No implementation . Work culture very old fashioned. Although I was a manager but the associate has to pay for there meal in the caféteria."
good,Good place to work for. but did like their environment. management was very bad. co-workers were good to work with. the hardest part of the job was late shifts.
good,"This was my least favorite job. They had favorites and allowed friends to have special privileges. The overall job can be fun and easy, the people made it hard."
good,Working as a front desk receptionist was definitely a learning experience. Your job is essentially to make guests feel like they're at home when away from home. The employees I worked with when working for this company have become friends.
good,While working for the company it was a great learning experience and worked for some amazing individuals for the duration of my tenure.
good,"Average job, not challenging. Co-workers are nice however will minimum hotel experience. Does become difficult to try new processes when everyone knows just what they have done in the past at the property."
good,"This was a part-time job while in college. Great location in downtown Richmond, easy to make money due to location. Recently visited the restaurant, has gone down hill since I worked there when it opened but it was a great job none the less!"
good,I feel like housekeepers should get paid more because it's hard work. Overall it was enjoyable and the staff was excellent to work with.
good,"under performing hotel and resort management company. mission statement is lost on guest, customers, and associates. Management team is paid fairly though."
good,The company is built on providing associates a safe environment to learn new skills and take risks on revolutionary programs and initiatives.
good,The benefits are amazing. Work can be a bit messy. There's $5.00 parking and free lunch. The opportunity to grow can be a pro and a con at the same time.
good,"My typical day at work starts with our morning briefings, where we share each personal tasks and meetings which we have planned during that day. i would not exaggerate if i tell that each day you really learn something new, as firstly you meet different people being your customers and if there are some issues appear during the event process, you learn each time how to be more flexible and train your abilities to manage unplanned issues. My enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers who are at the same time are my friends, so having a good time facilitates my job."
good,this had to be one of the best job i had i was able to do what i love and thats cook and the looks on the guest faces in the morning and to see the clean plates.
good,A typical day at Springhill Suites was always to expect the unexpected. I learned how to deal with different attitudes and to be very patient with unsatisfied customers. My co-workers enjoyed having me around being that I am a peoples person. I think the hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy a customer. the most enjoyable part was making sure that the room was cleaned and ready when they arrived.
good,"I have the best co-workers, i had met so many great people througt the years, the hardest part of the job is the hours other then that is all good. The most enjoyable part of the job is when u see the guest emile after helping them."
good,Obviously I love working here since I have worked at this company now twice in my career. I was her for 2 years and left for a year and than came back and I am still here.
good,"Loved  the High Energy , work place , Co-workers & team members made the job rewarding  .  Love the diversity of Job responsibilities given to me on a daily basis , rewarding being able to mentor , train & prepare others in increasing roles of responsibility  ."
good,the environment was high energy and fast pace. It was frequently very loud. I really enjoyed working with clients and providing solutions to any problem that came about.
good,"working 11 hours"
good,"Great job to meet to people, lots of attention to detail required when booking a reservation or checking guest in or out of the Hotel. Always be available to the guest and show great hospitality"
good,"Todos son trabajos que requieren mucho esfuerzo, horas, dedicación y no están bien remunerados . Pero son trabajos que en cada momento los he cogido porque me gustaban. El ambiente de trabajo varia mucho de un trabajo a otro , lo importante es que tu sepas bien que objetivo tienes que cumplir en la empresa ."
good,"good place too work....a lot of favourtism....not enough hours...great benefits though,always good at granting request off"
good,"A typical day at work was non-stop busy, which is a good thing. I learned that the guests are always right. Management was loyal to the employees. The hardest part of the job was when i had to tend to multiple requests on different floors of the building on the weekend because it is very busy on the weekends."
good,"Positives: Supportive Department Heads, Many Wonderful Repeat Customers"
good,"Great employees!!! Good working conditions"
good,"Your review will appear on the site after it has been reviewed and approved. In some instances, this can take several daysWould you like to review Four Points?"
good,"It is not an organized workplace. So many employees have left for better opportunities so we do not have enough employees. Our equipment breaks down so frequently and we're continuously fixing them, which slows us down."
good,"I have worked at the Residence Inn Marriott for over 3 years.  When I started we were Marriott managed and a little less than a year in we became franchise.  Marriott managed hotels offer excellent benefits packages that somewhat make up for the low pay.  Franchise hotels do not.  The culture is great, although I would say that it probably varies quite a bit from property to property depending on management.  The pay (at least at my property) is not great.  They have not given raises with the increase in minimum wage and therefore new hires are offered more than long termers...not ok.  Management has been great in working with my school schedule in addition to my internship schedule when I needed an internship for school.  Love my coworkers, although I'm sure each team is a bit different.  I will say that you learn a lot working in the hospitality industry."
good,"Great work place"
good,Not Appropriate. Not Appropiate. I am not going to Jeopordize Myself at Someoneelses Expense. Are We just on a Fishing Expidition Here ?
good,"I enjoyed my job, the higher up management was not fair to all employees.So co-workers were fine to work with.The hardest part of my job was letting the guest down. Helping people."
good,I truly loved working at the Marriott World Orlando. I have gained so much experience and also enjoyed with meeting different people from all over the world.
good,"the thing i liked about marriott sodexho as a cashier was that i met alot of the employees purchasing meals, i was able to stock the coolers to my discretion, order supplies and help in the kitchen as needed."
good,"I loved working at the Westin! Management was great, everyone was friendly, and I enjoyed working as a PBX operator. Every job had it's ups and downs but we made the best of it!"
good,Good place to work. The people are great and its always something new. If you want a laid back but fast paced job this is for you
good,"I've not had an opportunity to work longer at Marriott but from I've seen, it's not the best place to be at when you're trying to fit in from an IT perspective. It's basic and would shun you're creativity if at all you're a developer. Otherwise, it is an alright job and one wouldn't complain."
good,"I worked for this company only for two weeks, I told my manager that I couldn't work full-time until after July 1st. She agreed and told me thats perfect. She didn't listen and gave me 72 hours in less than two weeks. I am still a high school student so that wasn't possible for me to do. She also put me down as part-time but I was working full-time hours. Good people other than that, very understanding and my co-workers were amazing."
good,"good benefit"
good,"The company is great place to start out or for some of us end up during tough situations. Overall with proper management it's a great company. The culture was the most valued due to closeness of employees to one another. Unfortunately, the compensation is below minimum wage living standards even in prime-location where hotel is sold out every single day and business is blooming."
good,"The Renaissance Resort in WGV is in fact a very nice place to work, discounted rooms at Marriotts' all over, nice property. The work load is decent depending on the area you work in. I would say the main thing wrong with working there is the amount of negativity and gossip that goes around the hotel. Its known that there will always be some gossip around the workplace but this is a whole new level. People here will spread nasty rumors about you or others even if you haven't said more than 5 words to them. Nothing stays a secret, if something happens to you or someone else, word is spread immediately like wild fire through this place. Overall I would say that the benefits of working here do not out weigh the negatives. It sucks going to work knowing your co-workers are talking about you or someone else. It sucks going to work feeling uncomfortable."
good,Working at the Marriott  was a great experience. I was to develop my customer service experience through the food and beverage side of retail. The management was very easy to work with. My co workers were easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all different types of people.
good,My first job in Texas. Very fun place to work. Great advancement opportunity. Managers were kind and helpful. Enjoyed all customers and met some returning customers.
good,"Collection calls inside and outside office. I learned how to multi task. I enjoyed my co- workers they were very friendly. The hardest part was the outside collections, having to go to customers homes to collect. The most enjoyable was meeting new people and being able to help."
good,"As an employee one must be present both mentally and physically, this job is very demanding. Also, one must be able to multi-task and communicate clearly."
good,"Is a open lobby area,which easy access to the airport.A lots of walk in guest a busy place as well.is good to work in place where you can meet a lots of nationalities in different world..So much fun"
good,"This was a voluntary job I did for a few events. It was not a job I had to work, but I gained the experience necessary to enhance my social skills in work situations."
good,Limited training to learn needed job requirements.  Coworkers are friendly.  Guests are interesting.  Managers are supportive.  There are a lot of reports and accounting tasks that they require.
good,"Rondines externos , internos , resivía proveedores llenado de Bitacoras , monitoreo de cámaras de seguridad"
good,"good job during the summer. Culinary experience is minimal. work right near niagara falls, and can see it while you cook!"
good,It's good place to work if you love speaking to guest and having a nice conversation with them. I would mostly recommend this job to College students because u have some free time during the day where u can do homework.
good,A place where you meet different people and interact with different ways of life. you always had something to do. I enjoyed going to work and the people are fun to work with
good,Each day there is always something different. I am the training Petty Officer for my unit and instructing is rewarding.
good,pretty good company for a contract food service ..typical restaurant/salaried position low pay long hours. Trying to please people
good,I liked working here but I hate the fact that we had to do sales something I am not very good at. It was stressful because if you did not meet your goals there on a daily it was something to be concerned about.
good,It's been a long time since I've worked at this place. It was stressful. I know they don't exist in Lancaster anymore. That's all I have to say. Met my husband there.
good,"We request your comments on any aspect of the draft policy, including where it needs to"
good,"one of the most important thing is the communication and in Le Royal we have that."
good,"Une entreprise qui est très exigeante dans les tâches, un syndicat non présent pour les employés."
good,"The hotel offers many accommodations to its guests, so the job keeps you on your toes. There was always something that could be done so the job, itself, kept you in good shape. Work activities and functions held, often, to show appreciation for associates' hard work."
good,Business people are the worst to deal with. Marriott has too many rewards and ways of sucking up to business people that they think they own you.
good,"A very great place to work, I look forward to arriving every shift. The management is very efficient without hounding their employees"
good,"Executive Chef Responsibilities"
good,The job is not too demanding the only issue I have is that it is very difficult to move up in the company. They also do not Appreciate hard worksmanship
good,all the management and co-workers were nice to work with i enjoy my time there would work there again. i enjoy servicing the guest as well.
good,"The pay was good. I met a lot of nice people and gained a lot of experience working with diverse people."
good,"Middle Eastern culture oriented work place that invests in people and product on daily basis."
good,To work as a team. I really loved this job opportunity which was one of my first jobs. I had a really great experience working with each supervisor and team member. the hardest part was leaving work due to the extraordinary environment was so exciting to work each day.
good,This was a very easy going and high pace job. I learned a lot of patience. One of the most challenging places you'll ever work if interested.
good,"I don't feel comfortable making comments about my current employer, especially since it is a privately held hotel...I couldn't get out of the review."
good,"The Westin Charlotte is a great place to work if you need a job. The overall staff at the hotel is pretty down to earth; however, because it is an advanced hospitality industry company, the amount of micromanaging performed can ware you down. "
good,Typical days is you get a morning rush from there it dies down around 12. Best shifts are given through ranking system which is mostly ran through seniority not merit. Its ok. Valet management has some issues.
good,My work in Dubai at Lemerideien as a supervisor is quite fun and challenging. I'm teaching the staff the ( SOP) or standard operation procedure  so they know about the standard and how to handle the customer complain and needs. We have lots of challenging in the hotel because most of our guest is VIP. We need to have meeting with the manager before we go to the operation so they will know whose going to serve the VIP and how to handle it. After a long busy day we have feedback to the guest how we serve them and most of them is excellent review. its feels happy.
good,"nice place to work, however needs to train their employees more about the Japanese Hospitality and its approach which i find it to be warm and helpful."
good,my opinion of a typical day at work is doing the best that I can do. I have a great general manager who does not mind showing me as much as possible foe me to grow in my career and what she teach me I try and pass it down.
good,"It's a great job at first but you may need to stay within it for awhile if you really want a raise/promotion. You also need to be willing to stay several phone calls back to back and the repetitive use of a keyboard at a small workstation. As long as you follow the rules and policies, it is easy to progress through the company."
good,Marriott is committed to anticipating the needs of it's guests and creating and experience that is enjoyable and free of hassle.
good,"I didn't stay here that long, I had to open the steak house. Very busy, Average steak house food ( Steak, Potato and Vegs ) Nothing crazy"
good,variety of job opportunity for everyone.  great compensation package and great group of hard working people.  great location and great place to meet great people
good,"Trabajo monotono"
good,Great Perks working for Starwood Hotels. Easy job. You have your whole work day planned for you when you come in. Requires isolation from co-workers for the most part. You are on your feet all day and push a heavy equipment cart throughout the shift.
good,"It was pretty smooth. I enjoyed working here. I was able to get in and get out. The job itself is easy, very friendly environment"
good,"Marriott has taught me what I know about customer service. The training was top notch, and gave me the confidence I needed to do my job."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced. I learned a lot about different cultures and customs for different countries. Management was empowering and always willing to teach me new skills. Co-workers were kind (for the most part). The hardest part of the job were the extremely long hours with not many days off. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different people I was able to meet and interact with.
good,My fellow employees were great to work with and great team players. I acquired a lot of knowledge on Mexican cuisine. The hours were great as well.
good,"At time's they gave us overtime, which was good for the pay check. At time's when I got done early. They had me help my other employee's. Helped the laundry person at time's, when needed."
good,"Transport guests to airport assist with luggage and promote hotel. Respond ot guest inquiries and maintain a safe and secure environment for guests,hotel associates and property."
good,"Not Available"
good,Everyone is positive you will always be greeted and welcomed into work. Staff members are very helpful and work as one unit.
good,Sales meeting every morning strictly about numbers. Meeting was supposed to be 20 minutes. It lasted a lot longer than that on an average day. Nice place and nice location. Great team. Learned a lot about account management. Most enjoyable part of the job was lunch. It was very good on most days.
good,"A typical day at work would include being in uniform, on time and clocking in. Then I would proceed to the kitchen to begin setting the breakfast line for guests. Throughout service refilling food, refilling drinks, and satisfying the guest with casual conversation. Management was a little mixed up when I worked here, although when I did leave, new management was hired. The hardest part of my job was being the only waitress with about 30 guest at a time, however it was possible and I did feel great about accomplishing good service. The most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying guests"
good,"The people I worked with were great.  The pay just wasn't good for someone supporting a family.  I liked it as a part-time, in between, job."
good,"daily routine"
good,"The hotel is an older property, however it is a charming small place with large rooms and a great staff! However the GM and AGM are horrible, not having the experience themselves to train/guide or prepare other future leaders.  Playing favorites with associates, not investing in managers. Unfair treatment with associates. I believe that this would be a great place to work and strive if it were managed properly."
good,"A time share property that is very focus on the owners and guest. While this can be a challenging environment, majority of the owners and guest are great. A good place to learn about the hospitality industry. All the departments work together well to build a great experience for the owners and guest. The company needs to improve pay and benefits to help with employee retention."
good,"Great team. "
good,Good place to work. Fast paced with no room for errors. Rostered shift work is not conducive to raise a family. Lovely 5 star hotel with 'all hands on deck' through department collaboration.
good,"Analysing, coordinating, liaising, managing, enhancing, help make everyone achieve their outstanding is my role. I learned patience, sharpened problem solving skills, how to handle different transitional phases for a huge company which are all on the edge."
good,"As a front desk agent, there are many challenges to be able to live up to the standards and principles of the Westin brand. You will review several reports daily, make preparations for incoming guests in order to create a great first impression at check in. You will also provide exceptional service for in-house and departing guests as  well. Must possess efficient organizational skills, be sure to pay attention to detail, and to have patience. The hardest part of this job is making sure to follow all brand requirements while making each guest interaction ""personable"". One of the few downsides to this job is the low chance of raises."
good,"Would perform work needed on outstanding work orders ,pool upkeep ,grounds upkeep all aspects of maintnance including electrical ,paint drywall hvac ect"
good,I appreciated the opportunity but I dont want to be in the kitchen anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111
good,"If you are think about getting into the hospitality business, I would definitely develop thick skin as soon as possible. My co-workers aren't really bad which helps especially when it comes to the situations we encounter from guests on a consistent basis. Some of the things I've encountered has been sense of entitlement, I've been threatened by guests, guest have sent false information to Marriott Customer Care about co-workers so they can get a free stay. The worst part is you go through all this for $9 an hour, and it doesn't help when business is slow at times (cutting of hours). The enjoyable part is getting $17 or $19 rooms if you go on vacation."
good,"The Westin was at one point a really exciting place to work, until management changed. From the point on things was not quite the same."
good,Long Beach Marriott is a family oriented place to work which brings you a great comfort level. On the down side it's hard for growth.
good,"Was ok working there because of the  supportive management ."
good,I was hired with no experience on maintenance but since they hired me i have learned everything it takes to maintain the quality of a hotel.
good,I am still new but the company was sold.  It does not offer much of a  s far as environment.  Very gloomy.  Executives ignore employees.
good,This was an awesome experience. The General Manager was very pleasant and also hired me for a permanent position. My coworkers were easy to work with. And my supervisor gave understandable directions.
good,"A hospitable, presentable and hardworking team player who possesses a high standard of personal appearance and hygiene. Always focused on making sure that every guest is served to the highest possible standards by having an outgoing polite and professional attitude towards all patrons. Constantly working hard to ensure that guest expectations are met and that their time being served is a memorable experience. I naturally enjoy talking to people and is much experienced in overseeing the smooth running of a busy dining area, and a creating a unique relaxed style and atmosphere. I am now ready for new challenges, and am now seeking for a suitable position with a reputable and exciting company."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management, not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. decent amount of red tape and politics"
good,"Able to meet people from around the world, good benefits including room discounts, Good work/life balance, Great co-workers, supports career growth, hardest part, sub-par management, could be a lot better, most enjoyable, making people happy and satisfied and co-workers who are more like family"
good,"One of the greatest places to meet new people, work with a great diversity and also have fun while you do your job. Everyone here treat you like a family and they welcome you to do your best."
good,I've been with this company for almost 12 years. I loved all the different people that I got to meet on a daily basis. My co- workers are very supportive and we all work together to get the job done.
good,"More challenging and financial result oriented culture, which makes every employee strong. Very good learing tools for self development. More career opportunities around the world."
good,"My night starts by checking to see if All guests that are registered for the day has arrived because I cannot start the audit until ALL guest has arrived.  Balance the bank from the previous shift, make sure if there was a drop made for overage/shortage it has been adjusted as such on worksheet. I have the Best team to work with because everyone comes from different area of town.  We run the gambit here students to lawyers."
good,Good company to work for. There is a lot of pressure to sale in the management team. As a administrative assistant there was a continual work flow.
good,Marriott Int. is one if no the greatest hotel company to work for. They offer opportunity for growth and treat their associates as valuable and appreciate their outstanding commitment to service.
good,Stressful place to work.  Get into trouble for little things / things that aren't your fault.  Pay is not great but decent benefits.  Work environment can be stressful at times and not too bad at others.
good,"Marriott was a place that made you pick up your pace and help to manage your time. Marriott, made it more to where team work makes everything faster better and time manageable."
good,"Learned about housekeeping supervisor duties, fun staff to work with and an renovated hotel. Located on the water, the largest hotel east of Montreal with 352 rooms"
good,"I consider a day for me full of excitement, seeking and learning new things, and to become an effective and efficient employee for my employer. We work as a team and that is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Getting a call from an angry customer and being able to talk to the and get  them to calm down and explain to me exactly whats wrong, then doing the best I can to help thwm with their situation, once we move on to the puchasing of a hotel room, I then sale the room and make her really want that particular room, which she then purchaes it because the room sounded so enjoyable and being able to turn her angryness to laughter and a smile"
good,La empresa me dio la oportunidad de ponerme a prueba a mi mismo y demostrar cada dia el manejo de situaciones con la confianza necesaria y poder expresar libremente mis opiniones.
good,"It has to be a job or filed that you truly love to work this job"
good,this was a place to have for just a little while not to grpw off of and try to advance. there aren't any advancements in this place for you to grow and have a productive placce of work
good,This is one of Marriott smallest properties. This particular property gives you a homer feel to it. This place creates a immediate problem solving and fast room services.
good,"I worked at the courtyard Marriott a long time ago. I just remember the typical work day was to show up and clean floors and elevators. brings towels and etc., to customers at their request. I wasn't there to long, because I join the military shortly after graduating high school."
good,"When I arrive to the Front Desk, I was aware that the position was not only for Front Desk Agent bur also, Concierge. Since this moment, I have decided to develop an address book that we could mention to the different customers of our hotel. Every employee could be referred to an online folder with the different details of all the services found around the hotel, in the city and in the close geographic zone. This advantage helps to provide a common and manage service to each guest. It was my duty for the time past at this hotel, also, the Front desk duties as Reservation and Planning, Welcoming Guests, Planning of the Clients’ requirements and activities, Organisation, Management and Planning of the Clients’ arrivals and departures, Invoicing and Cashing and End of Day Closure and Night Auditor."
good,"7am - 7pm"
good,I really enjoyed working for the Marriott at Sierra Vista.  Not only did it provide me with an income but the experience that I learned was also a plus for me. I thank the establishment and opportunity for this experience. Thank-you
good,"supportive management and development. Intelligent, hard working professionals. Good place to work, summer Fridays and casual attire is acceptable."
good,"A typical day at work here was very pleasant for the most part. Some days are slow, others very fast paced. A learned a good deal about management and being able to work and practically run this facility, unsupervised. The co-workers were all great, especially the senior Front Desk attendant. The hardest part of this job was without a doubt learning the DOS based software used to keep track of the guests- past, present, and future, and their expenses, arrival and departure dates, etc. The most enjoyable part of this job for me, was the interaction with all the different types of people, from over-the-road truck drivers, to upper class business men from surrounding companies and afar, to rail crews from states away."
good,Job Responsibility’s make sure dining area is perfect for the guest’s experience. Help my server and take care of the guest when the server is not able too. Also clean the table and reset  whenthe guest’s are finished eating. I also worked attending and serving during weddings and private parties
good,The work is more than what a typical night auditor does at other properties because we are required to do some of the  accounting departments work as well.
good,"This volunteer experience was my first taste of a work environment. For a few hours a day, two or three days a week, I would aid at a very small gift shop at a hotel. A typical day at first was organizing and straightening up the merchandise to make it look good. That would be followed by cleaning. Eventually I would get to take over the cash register, considering there was just me and my boss and my boss couldn't always be there. I believe I eventually got the hang of it, but this volunteer experience is so long ago and for so short a time I can't remember anymore. My boss was nice, friendly, quiet, maybe a little shy. We didn't really talk much. Considering the rest of my job was straightening and cleaning, I'd say the hardest part of my job was easily working behind the cash register, regardless of rather or not I figured it out. I do believe the most enjoyable part was, ironically, the cash register. It was fun to be presented with a challenge and it was nice to get away from those mundane tasks."
good,I enjoyed working as my job kept me busy daily with new things each day.  I assisted other housekeepers with supplies they needed to replenish each guest room. Also cleaned all public and employee areas while assisting the housekeepers.
good,Poor Management too many ego's but no one was willing to help or teach. Wanted  so much from me but yet didnt want to pay for the hours worked. Some team member would talk about you behind your back and would also teach improper things in order to make themselves look good. So all and all I learned a lot of what not to do which has helped me to be aware of my surroundings and be more selective when looking for a job/internship.
good,"Being in the supervisors roll a typical day is making sure operations runs smoothly, as well as training of new hires and time deadlines to meet requirements involving, staff and guests."
good,"The front desk is the eyes and portrayed attitude of the hotel.  You must be able to think on your feet and be extremely customer oriented or you will not survive or thrive in the business.  The hardest part of the job is informing the guest of bad news, i.e. the city has caused a water main to break would you like to be sent to another comparable hotel or take some bottled water to use until the problem is fixed. Or would you happen to have another form of payment as this one just isn't agreeing with the system.  No matter what you say you must word it in such a way that the customer doesn't get angry at you...you must remember that they have just arrived at their destination and NEED to rest with no obstacles in their way!  Management is usually very relaxed as long as you are working within policy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the comradery that is gained with the co-workers on your same shift."
good,"a typical day at work would be me getting in to work to prepare food..chopping slicing etc."
good,"•	Provided quality service to customers inquiries, while building great rapport"
good,Good to work for. Great benefits and job security. You have availability to switch shifts and have company approval for workplace suggestions.
good,"typical day at work includes being at the front desk as much as possible while performing your daily tasks like organizing the desk, answering the phone, and making sure guests are satisfied by accurate check-in and payment methods.  I have learned a lot about running a hotel as well as customer service.  my co-workers and I have a good relationship we work well together. management could be better as far as regulating and noticing items about the hotel that needs to be considered.  I would suggest the managers stand tall instead of trying to impress or make everyone happy.  the hardest part of this job is being down graded by guests. we are all people and most of the time your treated like a servant.  the most enjoyable part however is getting to meet those people and work with such kind and generous people that you will never forget."
good,I love working the weddings & other events you meet a lot of diverse people. the only draw back is the slow season during the winter months
good,"Make sure you think long and hard if you go from a full service hotel to a smaller select service property, it is very different but a good learning experience"
good,A typical days works work consisted of making sure operations ran smoothly for for front desk employees and customers checking in. I also made sure our staff readied our rooms and handled escalated customer service issues.  I was allowed great interaction with hotel guest and how to help them in less than ideal circumstances with patience and determination.  The most difficult part of the job was trying  to help customers to whom there was no pleasing and limited advancement with in the company. A great staff and customer interaction on a daily basic was the best part of the job
good,"was a good learning experience and  was very active and fun environment fast pace working. working with good people, managers were very understanding"
good,Westen brand is a brand that separates the experience from the other hotels chains its a quality hotel with good brand items you expect to have
good,"They had pool Tables and other fun things to do doing the month .Free lunches .A typical day was walking around the hotel, checking and making sure everything was secured."
good,everyone that I work with are nice. The hardest part of my job is working my way up the ladder. I learned how to multitask and that is an important trait to have while working in a productive kitchen.
good,"A typical day at the Marriott consists of a brief morning meeting. After you are responsible for preparing your cart to ensure you have the necessary supplies to complete your rooms to the hotels standards. I have learned time management & organization is key to having a successful day. Management & co workers are very resourceful, energetic & all around good people to work with."
good,"Worked as a banquet server, it was  very part time, I worked  2 days a week , since I had a full college work load, I worked with some very nice people. My main duties were to set up the banquet halls under the banquet managers request for the guest. then worked as a server and took guest food orders and just made sure they were satisfied. Hardest part of my job for me was holding the serving trays above my shoulders"
good,Cleaning hotel rooms is sometimes very easy but sometimes hard . No matter the condition of the room you only have so many minutes to get in and out. Hard on your body and if you have a crew member who is slow you have to pick up their slack before you get to go hone for the day. And they kept the slow ones on. Sometimes I was at work for 11 to 12 hours and threw my back out working there.
good,its a good company and they do care about their staff too. they provide trainings which is really great advantage for us.
good,"I was forced to pump my breast milk in the laundry room (with people coming and going).  If someone came in or the phone rang I had to stop pumping even if there were others that could have helped --they didn't.  My milk dried up and I ended up having to feed my baby formula ($40 a can!!) I wish I knew my rights!"
good,The Residence Inn Warren is not organized. For the first 3 months I was receiving the wrong pay rate. My orientation and first day of work was the same day. They require you to do a lot of work that is not in  your job description while being stopped every 5 to 20 minutes by front desk issues. poor training system.
good,"I have learned how to be patient with guest who aren't always nice, My managers are good at there job for the most part but their scheduling sometimes interferes with my school schedule which can be frustrating at times. My job isn't hard at all and I actually enjoy my job but i'm looking for growth and I feel my job hasn't done their part in helping me achieve that."
good,"Project supervisory position."
good,"my skills will benefit all I work on boilers , chillers , presser, motors , and various other machines and electric. looking to continue to excell"
good,While i did not dislike my job certain things made it less enjoyable than i would have cared for. certain staff members left way before my shift started leaving me with an increased work load multiple times. i was also unable to get all the training i needed in order to fully do my job as per its description.
good,"Busy at times"
good,"As a whole, It's a great company. I worked at the Fall River, MA contact center, they give you an extensive 3-4 week training, 1:30PM - 10PM M-F for the 4 weeks, which you must maintain 100% attendance to be eligible to continue."
good,"Great building and location to meet  customers from around the world, you can build up great customer service skills and see how the hotel works"

good,Marriot Corporate is awesome franchises can be dangerous.  This property is a franchise who will try to minimize your pay in order to enhance the pocket book of a selfish money hungry General Manager.
good,Great company to work for. love my co-workers. love meeting different guest and I love taking care of them. great benefits and very approachable management.

good,working at the Marriott  was an ok experience for me. sometime hard but overall it was ok. I had some ok times working for the Marriott hotel. the experience was very challenging but also fun.
good,Easy work in the evenings but for very little pay. Like the job but certain individuals made it difficult to prosper within the company. Would have stayed if I had got better pay for the experience I have.

good,My co-workers were the best. They were super supportive and always ready to answer my questions. But the thing that was the hardest was our new management company HEI. Its just hard to be excited for work when the overall management company was difficult to deal with and it doesn't value its workers. I have seen the biggest turn around ever at this place and the main complaint was the management company.
good,a typical day a work I learned how to manage my life and balance a professional and personal relationship with other people and the management teams could use sensitivity training and my co-workers try to stay in a professional setting for the most part but the are issues the hardest part about the job is the consistency in the money and treatment of staff and the most enjoyable part is the different opportunities to learn
good,"The working condition was good but less team work,it makes me to take certain steps individually.Learned basics of H R Department.My old co-workers were good as compared to the new ones.The hardest part was i came to know about the real competition in our sector.but somehow now am realizing that those days were really beautiful."

good,"Managers have to work against all odds, manager dont have the right support from the HR department. You are just a number on line if they need to cut labor. You can not balance you private & work life. The upper management don't know much about the middle management duties, but they act like they do. To me the CEO don't know what happen in the hotels, very sadness. I love what we do for the guest to make them happy & to make sure they have great memorable experiences."
good,"The job is relatively easy and they go around school schedules. The managers take the time to actually know you. For the most part, it's not that busy so it's a good way to get comfortable at the front desk."
good,"	Managed guest complaint and carefully resolve in an expeditious manner."
good,"Busy property with 179 rooms. High demand, sometimes pressure but, it comes with the territory. Great team to work with.  Would be to reach the full service status of working in a bigger property."

good,"A typical day starts with business review meetings; respective days include various other strategy and execution meetings, daily tasks, correspondence with clients, etc. The day may end between 5 and 6, depending on business levels - some days can be very demanding of time management.  I've learned an immense amount about revenue management, event planning, managing people, and the hospitality industry as a whole.  Management consists of effective and ineffective people and positions; immediate supervisor is one of the best mentors and managers I have worked with.  My coworkers are smart, hardworking people who work well together.  The hardest part of my job is balancing care of guests/clients with the interests and responsibilities of the hotel's goals.  Best part of the job is seeing goals achieved."
good,Pretty much doing whatever they wanted me to do. If they needed beds done I did that or taking trash out or just whatever needed to be done.
good,"* Develops your skills through the training they provide"
good,"I expected more. Working for Marriott was okay - maybe I was at the wrong place, at the wrong time. It's already a thankless industry, the hardest part was working 16 hours days for 2 weeks straight. I learned a lot about myself, and what I can and am willing to take."
good,The typical day at the Marriott is arrive at 3am set up your station I learned that I would prep my food for the next day and come in it was gone off my cart with no explanation. Management was not good at all it was as if they did not want you to eat their food. I had good co-worker it was a diverse atmosphere. The hardest part of my job was learning how to cook to perfection but once I mastered it I was confident. The most enjoyable part of the job was pleasing the customers and doing my work in a timely manner.
good,"A typical day at work involves provision of all food & beverage within the Ottawa Marriott for all banquet and meeting spaces. Servers are responsible for setup and take-down of all events where clients have requested any food or beverage."
good,"Had it not been for my super visor, this gig could have been a LOT worse. I was hired on as a housekeeper, then transferred over to laundry which I did for a while. Then I suffered an injury that rendered my ability to work in that department for that moment. They had me then work in the kitchen. Without a doubt, this should have been where I was put all along. I quickly adapted and learned valuable new skills that most everyone up to that point had never really tried me with. He put me under his wing which I benefitted from greatly. Before that point, the most I did was microwaveable dinners. After that job? I was preparing full out breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. They offer a great team atmosphere at least in the kitchen. They allow you to try different things with the food they serve and see how it's liked. For example, my supervisor and I concocted parfaits by mixing yogurt, oat cereal, and ice cream dipping sauce whether it was strawberry or blue berry. It became such a hit, that we had to routinely ordered those items. The management in the office could have been better but all and all it wasn't a bad job. I'd go back."
good,I enjoyed my job title and enjoyed being a supervisor for housekeeping. my co-workers were awesome to work with and we got along great. I had a great team of housekeepers Really enjoyed having my sons birthday party at the pool. really nice..
good,"As a steward my duties were, clean dishes that returned from banquets, as well as the pots and pans. cleaned dishes from ""spin"" restaurant and also did overnight cleaning, cleaned and disposed waste from both the banquet kitchen and restaurant kitchen. The hardest part of the job was always being the only dishwasher almost all the time, it was alot of work."
good,"I liked this job but didnt want to make this my career. All in all, the management was good, treated employees great. They even increased employees pay. I worked well with my co workers."
good,"My growth within this company for almost 4 years has been helpful to improve my abilities ansd skills."
good,"Marriott, being a global brand has lots of potential for people who are looking to travel with their job, as it is relatively easy to transfer from one Marriott to another in a different country."

good,"• Assisted with planning, tailored event set ups, and take down of all small and major specialty events."
good,"typical day at work"
good,My typical day can consist of calls only giving the guest information about the hotle the location of the hotel. I learn about people over the phone how to have more patience and understanding while talking with them on the phone. My management is fair and supportive. The hardest part of my job can be when the hotel is sold out and the call volume is very high. My co-workers I enjoy because of the diversity I get to work with. I most I enjoy about my job is my co-workers & the guest I talk with and other co-workers from other departments that I get to see and talk with during lunch.
good,"Pros : Free Meal, Employee Recognition Awards, Good Job Performance Incentives, Supportive Management / Open Door Policy, etc.."

good,"not co-operative management, and always below staff expectation and guest expectation."
good,This franchise of Marriott international is poorly managed.
good,"I loved all the different people I met everyday. That was the most exciting part of my job, working with the guests and fixing any problems they had. I also enjoyed my coworkers, they were friendly and we all worked together to make our guests' experience wonderful. Management was sometimes lacking seeing that at times we didn't have a manager at all and when we did they weren't sure what they were doing. Also, this Marriott was part of a franchise called LBA so they did not run the same way as a normal Marriott hotel would have been ran. Also, if you were at the front desk you had no breaks because no mater what you were the only one up there. So you were standing on your feet for eight hours straight without eating or going to the bathroom."
good,"I had fun with a few people but overall everyone talked about everyon. Even the managers. After trying to move to a different department and them telling me I could, but then I never was I decieded to let it go."
good,"Cleaning of guests rooms, Cleaned bathrooms and dusted,mopped, sweeping, changing linen, stocked amenities. cleaned 16 rooms a day. There was nothing really hard about the job. I enjoyed working there for i love cleaning. Management was nice and very caring. I learned how to set up a very presentable room to ensure the guest stay is wonderful."

good,Work daily was interaction with guests and potential guests. Enjoyable job
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Working for the Marriott company was good. I had never worked in a hotel setting until I started at the Marriott. I learned how to really deep clean, fold linen a certain way that it was fancy. The hardest part of the job was cleaning rooms that had been completely destroyed by guests. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting all kinds of different people fro0m all over the world."
good,"Nice People to work with, glad I had the experience. you need to be able to work alone. will help you with communication skills and customer service"
good,My day at work was always fun. I learned how to be a great team player. Management always gave you a helping hand when you needed it the most. My co-workers was amazing we always helped one another. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the rooms on time because you might get one or a few really messy rooms. The most enjoyable part of the just was getting really big tips.
good,"The hotel is dated. They are always understaffed, however the staff that they do have are dedicated to the hotel and go above and beyond."
good,"events managemnt"
good,"Company was not Marriott international, the property I worked for was a franchise"
good,"Not organized, coworkers were okay but the hotel itself wasn't as organized as it could have been."
good,"Typical day at work would be an mostly full house checking out and all linen should be completed in an reasonable time period, which I was the only laundry attendant, but I learned how to work a system that would allow me to provide what is needed in all departments, my co-workers were good and I had no problem getting along but I do not have a problem with getting along with anyone, hardest part of the job was when the majority of the guests check out at the same time which triples the amount of linen to be processed and most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone is having a good day and the smiles are more visable"
good,"Great place to work however management is not consistent or  properly structured. I learned that standing up for what you believe in makes a huge impact. Co-workers were like family, we genuinely cared for each other. Hardest part of the job was taking orders from certain managers who I lost respect for. Most enjoyable part of my job was keeping a smile on guest faces."
good,The hours were not good. And its a very cut throughout environment. The pay is terrible.
good,Great hotel and just renovated. Scratch kitchen is always a plus. Not many hotels have its own pastry program any more.
good,Very team oriented.  Plenty of opprotunity to grow and advance.
good,"Entrevistas no idioma inglês para avaliar competências "
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,Management in other departments were always willing to help teach and help you learn other things . Some of the hardest days was working the crazy hours being understaffed. Working over 50+ hours a week was a bit crazy at times but always pushed through it and the people I worked with made it easier.
good,This job in general was difficult. The co-workers didn't speak english or understand anything. This job was mostly just cleaning hotel rooms. The hardest part was having to clean every room before you can leave. This was the least job I enjoyed.
good,We would serve Customer Breakfast in the morning on the weekends.The hardest part of job was had to make sure you kept refilling food items fast. Enjoyable part was my coworker i worked with who helped .
good,I learned about other parts of the world and better sales techniques.
good,"An interersting place to work. I was hired on as a supervisor over 15+ temps, given responsibilities to inventory and stock the gift shops, inventory manifest and order room essentials for housekeping, inventory and order new laundry necessities, maintain quotas of incoming inventory and outgoing inventory. I had a blast, loved the micro-management of inventory and implemented new and desirable techniques for managing inventory and time on machines."
good,"Travail facile sans aucune responsabilité, sans aucune possibilité d'avancement"
good,"A typical day at work for me is quite simple. I neatly put linen onto a cage and deliver them to landings for room attendants 3 times a day. I receive phone calls from housekeepers for various request and try to get back with them as soon as possible. I stock supplies from coffee creamer to bottled water for guest. I do random projects ranging from wiping down the elevator doors to vacuuming the hotel hallways. Management is really cool, they're always within reach so if a employee has any questions, a supervisor usually has the knowledge to assist. For the most part the co- workers are easy to get along with but sometimes they can be negative due to long exhausting days in housekeeping. They're isn't a particular hard part about the job as a houseman; we do the little things that makes up the whole picture. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is interacting with fellow co workers and completing all tasks assigned of me."
good,"El trabajado se desarrollaba en un gran ambiente de trabajo, aprendiendo el trato y manejo de herramientas informaticas de empresas turisticas. "
good,"regardless of what unforeseen incident occurs, they only wanted you to cater to them regardless of how serious of an episode occurs in your life."

good,"Works hard everyday to put out great products, but is always willing to go the extra step that guest and employers require and need."
good,"As head server, I was able to train and schedule the serving staff as well as be instrumental in planning and organizing events for VIP guest.  Was also where I was able to greatly increase my knowledge of wine."
good,"Offers poor compensation, but opportunities for growth and promotion. High paced, customer service oriented position."
good,"I started off as a part time room attendant during major renovations which involved long and hard days cleaning rooms to get them ready for resale.  I eventually became a full time room attendant and was allocated my own floor.  I was responsible for the cleaning of the rooms, corridors and service areas.  My next position was the Laundry hand and this position included guest interaction as well as with other associates.  If I had a problem or was not sure of something the Supervisors and the 2IC always approachable.  Most of the housekeeping staff were easy to work with and I was happy to help out when it was needed.  The hardest part was when I had to fill in for the public area cleaner as well as make sure that I did everything that was needed to complete my daily work.  The most enjoyable part was getting to know everyone there."
good,Challenging fast-paced environment with many opportunities to learn the various departments and work with a diverse group of individuals.
good,I typically arrived at 7 A.M. to get some work completed prior to the team arriving.  It was a job that required a lot of time management between the administrative duties I had to perform as well as attending the department head meetings each day.  I felt spending time on the floors providing leadership and guidance to my team including my supervisors and managers was paramount in obtaining the departmental goals.  The greatest challenges that I faced was the attempting to obtain qualified staff in such a difficult market.  This caused many long days for our team.  The other challenge was rebuilding our Linen par levels  within the budgetary guidelines that had fallen prior to my arrival there.  The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving positive letters and notes about my staff and being able to share that with the team during our morning stand-ups.
good,"Loved working at loews, but the management team can be mean if they don't support you then you out very fast . the worst is the human resorces the director there support no talent and judge based race, you easly can loose your job if she don't like you or support you"
good,Being at the Westin was a very different experience. I enjoy the fact  that I opened a hotel and built with it from the ground up. The idea of what it is becoming isn't as pleasant as I hoped it would be. I've learned that in a new hotel setting things and people are always changing. Management can definitely be better and so can the team of co-workers. The hardest part is measurement. Measuring the levels of good encouragement and sitting aside the minor from major. I really enjo the guest the most. The guest is what makes i all real.
good,When a restaurant is understaffed and you have to do 3 jobs everyday you get burnt out
good,great place to work. I learned alot and I continue to learn each day
good,"Working with two manpower in HR department, handing most of things have learned so much"
good,Nice place to work and be able to make effective changes. Company leadership can be overwhelming at times. A lot of people to report to.
good,"My shift co-workers are supportive and team players always willing to help. I would mainly do room calls which consisted of basic maintenance including light electrical, some drywall, A/C, painting and basic problem solving with small appliances. I also did preventative maintenance on Air handler units, exhaust fans, ice machines and Heater fan coil units. The hardest part of the job was that we have been understaffed the entire time I have been in the engineering department. Understaffing prevented us from being able to complete all of our tasks in a timely manner."
good,learned how to manage kitchen. how to deal with orders when its a rush. hardest part of the job is to deal with guest when your live in the counter. i was a apprentice chef in continental cuisine
good,did not enjoy working for this hotel. would not work for them again
good,"- Would gather all need to know information from my co-worker of the previous shift.  Went over the check-ins for the day and would work with housekeeping to make sure all rooms were ready and let them know about VIP rooms.  Greeted guests (at all times).  Checked in guests and gave them a list of the amenities and services, plus any additional help they needed (restuarant recommendations/ reservations, things to do, etc.)  Answered phones and made reservations.  Re-stocked the market with food and drinks."
good,"Once the Marriott was taken over by a new company and new managers, it has been poor staffed, unorganized and trouble with communication."
good,"The Marriott Springhill Suites is a great job for a college student. However, hotels are never closed and require its employees to be available most of the time. The company has competitive pay at the entry level. Benefits are average but served me well, even as a diabetic. Although you have to deal with the ups and downs of upper management (as with most employers) the general employees are all very efficient and extremely kind. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable part of the job; The guests! This is because you never know what type of day an individual is having. To be honest, it can be an adventurous job. The easiest way to succeed at this job is to always be kind and generous. The way to be the best at this job is to know the system well enough to correct mistakes without flaw. What I have learned at this job is that you can not let criticism ruin your mood. I have learned that the best teams have knowledgable, stellar leaders. I have also learned that companies have a trinkle effect; Meaning that everything starts at the top and that the leaders must be the example for the employees under them. This has been a wonderful six year experience for me here, however, there is not much room for advancement which leaves me no choice but to move on from college life and to pursuit a career."
good,"very busy place, excellent training and wonderful management team"
good,"As a banquet server, I set up and tore down banquet events.  With a fine dining atmosphere, I furthered my knowledge on how to set tables as well as buffet lines for food and beverage. I also learned how to read BEO’s (Banquet Event Orders). I was trained as a bartender."
good,"Fast paced but you will learn many things about sales, hospitality and creating exceptional events."

good,Marriott International is a good company to work for. I've learned during my short time there so far that our guests are most important seeing the they are the reason I am employed. Co-workers pull together as needed. The hardest part of the job for me is standing for an 8 hour shift seeing that I haven't work a standing job since in my early 20's. Takes a lot to get back used to.  The most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job is getting the benefits of having a full time job and being able to travel and rest in the best hotels at a great employee discount.
good,"Je suis très contente d'avoir pu travailler au sein de l'hôtel Marriott Aéroport E. Trudeau."
good,I liked the hours and the fast paced environment. You have to stay constant with cleaning the rooms otherwise you fall behind. I was one of the best housekeepers because I had great time management skills.

good,There is always something new and its a fast paced environment on some days.
good,There was no set day banquet functions could either be a breakfast starting at 5AM or a evening function starting at 5PM.Management was very good at taking care of employees you work hard and long hours.The hardest part was the hours.The most enjoyable was the different people you met.
good,"Most days going to work was great and stress free, other days was like when is this going to end. I learned to have a lot more patience for people. Working in hospitality is a lot of work especially i a 4 star hotel. Throughout the hotel management is great in my department not so much it was just to divided culture wise. My co workers some was okay others were rude nasty and no help at all. Hardest part was knowing you did all you could do and still not get appreciated. I enjoyed going on my 30 minute break and when we had town hall meetings it was a breath of fresh air."
good,I learned how to keep the customers coming back to the store.
good,"Coordinated small corporate events of up to 50 people per event. Handled billing, catering needs, room set-up and managed room blocks when needed."

good,Great hospitality company. Management is good and co-workers nice.
good,"Not a fair company. While is true you can grow with time, you still greatly under paid"
good,"Upper management is great and hands-on, beautiful property and engaged employees"
good,"I loved my job from the very first day. I still do. The job itself. Not the places I worked in. In Romania customers treat employees any way they feel. If they're mad you have to listen to the worst cursings you could ever imagine. Job itself is interesting and addictive. There's always a challenge, and you have fun and meet all sorts of people and get to hear and see a lot of interesting things, which makes time pass very fast in a very pleasant way. Unfortunately salaries are small in Romania and life is hard for everyone."
good,"Prepped breakfast, kept breakfast items stocked and coffee made. Front desk operations and took care of whatever the guests needed."
good,"the valet manager is awesome, the rest of the departments have high turnover rates. The Westin Tampa demands a lot from each position. They are always understaffed, unlike other locations. It's impossible to get fired from there so the understaffed workers are bad at times too. The guests are becoming lower end and the valets get stiffed a lot. You get nice discounts on hotel rates through starwood."
good,"We never got paid for our overtime so that was a negative. Daily duties were similar to what I do now. Group sales, check ins, reservations, concierge of my town."

good,"I am not sure what I learned new at this job, since it is one of many hotels I have worked in, but a new and different computer system is the thing that stands out the most..No typical day here either, though many repeat guests made the beginning of the week something to look forward to. Even though the staff and management at hotels change frequently, I have made some enduring friendships with people I worked with here which still remain six years later.  The hardest part of this job was the constant standing and having to take a reservation on the phone with a line of people in front of me trying to check in.The most enjoyable was the relationships created with the regular guests, who we were on first name terms with and we asked about each nothers kids etc."
good,"I was working 16 h per week, then I got pregnant and I had to leave"
good,"Some of my colleage are not cooporated,no team work,and in management is not giving proper tools ,that is why ,some promblem are not able to finish in target it will again create another trouble"

From there i would go back to the kitchen and make sure that lunch specials were started and prep work was being done.  if banquets and parties happened to be going on that day this is when i would start my work by typing up fire sheets and recipe lists. trucks and deliveries cam in between 10am and 1 pm and would help/delegate to make sure truck was picked up and rotated properly.  about 11 am on days of ordering i would put all my orders in to the computer or phone calls. "

good,the Marriott has a great employee package and the coworkers I have the privilege to work with are great however the management teams they put in place on many properties are less then spectacular.
good,set up breakfast really nothing to it. I enjoyed the job the management could be very unpredictable at times.co- workers were very helpful that is  where all of my training came from. The hardest part of the job was  just remembering everything that needed to be re-stocked.The part I enjoyed the most were the guest. I got to meet a lot interesting peolpe

good,"Everyday is a very productive day at work, i learn how to deal with other people which I like to do and it's fun to meet new people. The management is okay, they listened to you when you have some concerns about your job. I enjoy every time i go to work and there is no hard part of the job, however it is part of the job if it gets harder, challenge your self if that happen so that you gain knowledge."
good,Good hotel benefits. The management is the worst I have ever seen. Bad hotel reviews due to unqualified people running the place.
good,Dinamic job. Customer focused. Demanding work style. Fun co workers and job type.
good,"Management and staff is very friendly and easy to work with, but the facility where I worked was in need of major renovation and the ownership was very shortsighted and irresponsible, so the property was poorly financed, wages were too low for work load and unfortunately the staff and guests suffered. I enjoyed this line of work, though, because it required me to provide a very high standard of customer service, and enjoy challenges like this, to be knowledgeable, well organized in work and in thought, to treat others with compassion, and to feel pride in my work. My amiability allowed me to create rewarding friendships with our guests. It’s really a great feeling when a guest is happy to see you and enjoys the service you especially provide."
good,Feels good to know your job can help many people to change their living situation and learn new skills for a better job
good,it was good pay lots of hours good work envirment  always busy  wish iwas still there
good,Great company to work for if it's corporate. Franchise Marriott's are a different story. It all depends on who runs the Marriott property. Overall a great team work environment.

good,The job aspect at the Richmond Marriott was ideal for anyone working in the hotel business.
good,Learned alot from working with people with different personalities and aspect of life.
good,"Great place to work.  Excellent team members.  I learned over the years a positive and friendly attitude is the key to great customer service.  The hardest part about the job for me was the work schedule, and the number of hours on my feet.  Working 3 different shifts in a 5-day work week was very hard."

good,"A typical day began with reservations, check outs, problem resolution and guest satisfaction. Then it would be administrative duties - handling deposits, AR, group sales and meeting room reservations. Every day was an opportunity to connect with the guest and improve your strategies of providing the best service. I worked with a great group of managers, from various departments, whose primary goal was to have the best hotel in the area. The hardest part about the job was making sure each associate was consistently providing the best guest satisfaction and empowering them to handle problems in the best way possible. The fulfillment was watching each associate grow and become better than they thought they could. As a staff we had a lot of fun but we had so many enjoyable moments with our guests as well."

good,"Un día típico es bajo mucha presión, el movimiento del hotel es muy fuerte, el cliente es corporativo en casi un 80% por tanto es muy exigente, se debe ser muy rápido y eficiente sin perder la calidad en el trabajo diario. Aprendo mucho ya que al ser parte de la cadena Starwood seguimos los estándares de la marca internacional. La parte más difícil es que hay mucha presión y estrés, se generan muchas horas extras por la carga laboral y no hay un horario establecido justamente por la variabilidad de la ocupación, lo que mas me gusta es que he encontrado en mis compañeros personas muy experimentadas y profesionales, de quienes he aprendido mucho."
good,Cleaned and sanitized vacant rooms to occupant-ready status.
good,It was a great learning experience I learned alot and it made me a good worker

good,"Great company to work for."
good,"Co Workers are great , management could be better. Great place to work"
good,"A typical day at work: my assistant GM refuses to keep the schedule consistant. She often schedules agents to work a PM shift (2-10:30p or 3-11:30pm) to have them back for an AM shift (5:30am-2 or 6am-2:30pm). After numerous times of asking her NOT to do that, it still continues. Hard work, dedicated, non complaining agents get the short end of the stick, while agents who lag on the job get promoted. Suggestions from agents that have had managerial experience at their previous place of employment often goes unnoticed, while the ""teachers pets"" get all the benefits, bonuses and praise. No opportunity for advancement or even a consideration to ask the senior agents what their goals and expectations are for their future. Actually, she doesn't go by seniority since we are not a ""union company"" (her words not mine). Im interested to know what she bases her decisions off of then?"
good,"A typical day of work would be answering phones, checking guests in and out, covering shifts if there are call-offs, handling up-set guests in a professional manner. "

good,"This was my first hotel job and I found it completely satisfying on my end. I met some terrific people and knew it was a job in which I could be very successful. Although the property had some serious management issues, my staff was open to improvement and worked with me to bring a relaxed, professional, yet fun, atmosphere to the workplace everyday."
good,Lonely work environment. Very professional and strict management.
good,"learned a lot and good experience, would be pleased to work for them again"
good,"Overall, the Hill Country Marriott is a great place to work.  As a part-time employee, I would have to say the benefits are not so good, but I suppose that is basic for most part-time jobs.  Right now business is steady, but the pay is a little less than I expected for my experience and education level.  The most important issue is that of all the top-rated spas out there, this one is poorly maintained and is out-dated by about twenty years.  "
good,"le travail me permettait de me trouver face à une situation qui se marie aussi avec la profession en tant que gestionnaire,la collaboration etait fluide et agrable"
good,at this job it was mostly a learning expierence and i was learning every aspect of the hotel from sales to banquets and it was very educational
good,"A typical day of work starts by  9 am but working time may go more than 12 hrs."
good,"Its a good company to work for but the time to get in a position where you can be more financially stable takes several months. I work from home which I love, but you only get a 30 min lunch which doesn't give you a lot of time to prepare, relax and eat without rushing. You must be self sufficient which is a good thing. I have to work a lot of overtime to get my paycheck close to what I'm use and its time consuming "
good,Never the same. Always somthing new with the guest that would call in. Learned that every call was different and that we still had great conversations.
good,I loved this job. I got to meet many people every day. This job you learned to think quick and had to have good customer service skills.

good,"I loved everyone I worked with, however, the hotel was bought by an investment firm and that changed everything. When I left the GM said that if I ever needed to come back, the door would be open."
good,"you do hotel reservations daily, handling up to 100 calls. Management is ok, and so are the co workers. Hardest part of the job is getting sales, easiest part is helping people"
good,This company provides a great opportunity for learning the travel industry.
good,Check guest in and out and make sure that their stay is as comfortable and stress free as possible. stock the marketplace and answer phone.

good,Busy during the majority of the year i had to deal with clients on a day to day basis as far as room sets
good,It was ok just I like to work with my hands. Hospitality is not for me.
good,Lo mas importante es ser responsable en tu trabajo y dar lo mejor de ti día con día.
good,"Being at the Marriot company, it tought me how to interact with many diversities of people in and around the enviornment. For the most part, the coworkers I worked along side of were very helpful, kind and did a great job at making me feel welcomed, I believe the most difficult aspect of working for and with this company was the shift I worked. The overnight shift is not easy to do when you have other obligations during the day. What I enjoyed most about working at Marriot was the people I was able to meet, as far as the incoming guest and coworkers and the continuity."
good,Greeted guests and served tables from time to time. As a student i barely had the chance to get any hours.
good,The job was ok i met new people and helped everyone with there stay. Most of all i enjoyed making them fill good and welcome when they stayed at our hotel.

good,"very fast pace work place, where loyalty and reliability are not longer appreciated with the new management. Co-worker were friendly and there was an relax and conciencious atmosphere."
good,It is a very easy going place to work. It does get pretty stressful during the busy season. They want you to be very empathetic to guests even when the guests are yelling at you over something ridiculous. Its hard to stay calm and collected in those situations. Its expected of you to go above and beyond and all you get is a thank you. My coworkers are the reason I stay.
good,"Manage a staff of 18. Run the day to day operations of the golf shop , as well run all the golf outings that come to the golf course. Work closely with other departments to ensure a outstanding golf experience for each golfer."
good,I learned how to sandblast glass and put the words on the items as they were needed
good,maintained upkeep of hotel premises.tendered to hotel guest needs
good,"It's a great fun, I made friends from day one and still continue to enjoy. Since I took on the managerial job I improved my people skills significantly; it's amazing how every staff member has different view, opinion and motivation. The biggest challenge I find is to make people do what I want and have their respect for that."

good,for me everyday was different and i learned that very quickly management was very firm and particular about cleaning my coworkers did not see each other as much but for the most part they were friendly the hardest part of the job was we had time limit and i am a perfectionist i enjoyed working there because i met a lot of interesting people
good,only worked at the company a couple of months before i left to had a baby. From the time i was there everything was ok
good,• Ensure great customer service.
good,there is not much to say about this job. At the time I worked here the management was not the best.
good,"A good entertain well to guest,I learned to much things how to handle the guest,how to talk nicely and good services to them.The management here so good there helping the staffs what the problems,and they answer immediately what needs or lacks of the staff.My co workers is excellent we are teamworks.My enjoyable part of my job ill do very good services to guest and they are happy to me,and the best of that my experience here are all my guest are coming back always here."
good,"Physically demanding and mentally taxing when managers fail to correctly perform their duties. There is the work ideal that you have to do more with less. My co-workers are great, and one of the reasons that I come back every day."
good,The hotel is 641 rooms with different types of restaurants. The working hours pass quickly as we have a lot to do. The team is good.
good,"A typical day is unpredictable, which makes it interesting challenging to work at the Banquet and Catering department."

good,A typical day of work here is uneventful in and of itself but the people are a lot of fun. It is high time for me to move into a different line of work or a better position in the area of hospitality.

good,A typical day like I said for the Hampton Inn was waiting for our guest
good,It was a very fun job but I never had time for family or friends because of my work schedule so I just didnt feel comfortable doing it.
good,I prepared meals for college kids and staff daily. along with catering events for the community. The manager could have been better but the assistant manager was great. The job was hard at all just getting alone with the co workers was the problem. The must enjoyable part of my jobs was laughing and having fun and enjoying cooking.
good,I worked in the F&B department. We went through a lot of changes and stingy owner froze pay increases.
good,"place could have seriously had some remodeling done, coworkers were great and management was agreeable"
good,"Oversee all operations and maintenance of a 278 room hotel with full restaurant and bar. Hotel was being sold soon so management was not in place for an extended period of time. I enjoyed the associates that worked there, most were team players. The hardest part of the job was trying to juggle all task with only 3 team members. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we completed a task in the assigned time frame and watching our scores reflect our hard work."
good,Every day I was able to interact with the guests and exceed their needs. Very enjoyable building relationships with the guests and other Marriott employees. During my time at the front desk and during my time in housekeeping there were multiple opportunities to learn new skills and have new experiences. There are always opportunities to assist in other departments. The hardest part of the job was working with a zero budget and not having the tools needed to complete the job successfully. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and building relationships with the guests.
good,"just cleaned room, little room for advancement. had a good upper management staff."
good,Typical Day: Understaffed

What I learned here is that you can work without the supervision of your chef de partie follow the recipe always about the management they are helpfull in times you need them.My co workers are helpfull too. Hardest part is when functions have the same time schedule with each others. The most enjoyable part is that when we are done with our work in a day and time to rest and wait again for the following day."
good,Marriott is a great company to work for your efforts will determine your advancement
good,on travail en équipe dans un milieu de divertissement culturel

good,If you want the experience of Bell Captain this is a great location with good leadership.
good,"The Marriott is an okay place to work depending on what you are doing and what department you are in. A typical day at work in the restaurant is standing at my host stand, when people come up to the restaurant I sit them."
good,"Productive, hard worker, dependable, responsibile, and team player. Learned what was in demand for the company to be profitable. Management were trying to hard to make what was expected from a good hard worker. Co-workers always felt it was never enough satifaction. Hardest part of the job was to make you daily and weekly quota. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking, and help guest to fulfill their dream vacation, and using their star points that they had earned."
good,My duties were to aid the cooks in preparing the pastries and desserts for the food court at the Mariott ad that entailed my baking and creating these pastries mostly alone. I learned how to use many different kitchen appliances. The management was reasonable.
good,It has given me a great opportunity to manage and resolve a wide area of customer service issues. I like being able to be in touch with people from all parts of the world. I can be speaking with someone from Australia one moment and the next with someone from Germany.
good,They created an fun enviroment work place for their employer. They treat their employees like family.
good,"I have worked here as a breakfast attendant and it's not a tough job but it has a high turnover rate. So, it can be stressful constantly training new hires. However, the company offers benefits, treats the employees to lunch sometimes and if you want to move up in the company, just work hard and talk to the managers about getting you where you want to be."
good,"Aside from some of the employees working at the hotel was great. I was able to serve at wedding receptions, rehearsal dinners, business parties, meetings, and much more"
good,Employees look out for each other and provide for a welcoming work experience

good,it was an ok job for the moment but i couldnt see my self doing for ever the pay is not so great an i didnt get 40 full hours
good,Personal poco profesional y muy imponente poco interés en el personal y carencia de beneficios
good,"Marriott is a pretty good comany to work for. but moving up or trying to get a raise for your time there is a waste of time. Was there for almost 5 years, minimum wage went up and now I barley made .73 over."
good,The L.A. Live property still has a long way to go in terms of enforcing and cultivating a healthy and positive work environment. There is clearly a lack of respect for diversity.
good,"The only thing i didn't like is that we all had to share laundry, um i thought they should have a laundry person fold laundry, not us who work the front counter. I guess they were trying to save money. It wasn't a  actual Marriott it was Fairfield Inn by Marriott."
good,Great place to network and meet new people. Company provides great benefits and a decent discount. Easy transfers within the US as well as international.
good,I clean hotel rooms. Some days I have up to twenty-two rooms to clean and i cannot leave until the work is done so some days are longer than others. The manager is kind though.
good,"Seasoned staff who need support. Very busy, with multiple events going on at the same time. Many opportunitys to learn new tasks through multiple responsibilities."
good,"The managers don’t do nothing other than complain and breathe down my neck rushing me EVERY DAY. I hate my job. It pays well but, I need something different. I need something I can enjoy."
good,The job itself keeps you on your toes. You'll learn a lot working at a hotel. Teaches great customer care. The pay for what's expected could be better.
good,"Overall a good place to work at ,Great Guest,I was happy coming into work.They pay attention to the employees with their concerns and needs and wants."

good,"Nice place to work with nice employees.   The Maintenance Manager was more interested in going to lunch and getting in his morning workout, more interested in having the maintenance employees completing the work so he doesn't have too."
good,"Job wasn't hard at all,  it was fun with the employees that we had just management & pay. I worked there my senior year of high school, it was great then lots of pay"
good,Nice for a start or for experience. Fortune 500 with corporate office in MD. All locations are different. Some cultures are more flexible and friendly than others. In the position before I left I was miserable. In my first position I was happy and thriving
good,"Great staring opportunities "
good,"This workplace is good for learning the job, but you can't going for higher position. Very slowly going to higher position. And the Management is not nice."
good,I make sure my job gets done in the most correct way possible as told I’m well on time and I don’t miss days at work unless it’s important or emergency but I would love for you guys to give me a call back
good,"Good pay and benefits, but no quality of life, especially during the summer  - no weekends."
good,"Overall good experience. Great starter job for college students and retirees. You have to have a lot of patience and a great attitude to deal with customers. Booking a room you wouldn’t think was difficult, but there are a lot of unhappy customers."
good,"The good thing about this brand is it has a very good and strong working culture, where they took care of the employees. They provide a lot of online trainings which i think very good & beneficial for employees"
good,Marriott is a great place to work if you want to learn a lot about organizational transformation. This company also provides the opportunity to gain exposure working internationally. Many of the department's are now allowing remote work which is also great.
good,Guest depend on us to provide great customer service yet we contradict that statement by operating as sales and numbers instead of meeting guest needs
good,Overall good environment.  GM was a bit autocratic in approach and leadership.  Other department heads were professional and had a clear understanding of their roles.
good,The job was organized and unprofessional. They didn’t like to work with there employees schedules. People stayed sick in the environment. There where no communication skills.
good,"Was a nice place to work at, a fast paced environment with seasonal ups and downs, needed second job when work got slow, around summer and fall months."
good,"They pay is my main grief, but the hours are flexible so good for a little while. Free lunches sometimes, and vendors come in for lunch that you can purchase. HR doesn't do much to help employees out and departments are very cliquey."
good,Temp job was hard to take time off and wasnt allowed to give doctors notes if your child was sick but they offered overtime and had great hours to offer. I wish i had childcare back then as i do now because it was a solid job.
good,"Unfortunately, I left my position with Marriott because my manager was condescending and disrespectful, and no one in my department cared nor did they feel comfortable enough to speak up. This is a huge problem across Marriott and something needs to be put in place to make sure people are not being mistreated by managers who think it's okay to talk to grown people like they are 5. I was also disappointed in the fact that Part time has no benefits but so much money is wasted on doing Galas and giving away merchandise to employees. I mean, all of that stuff is nice, but I'd rather have some sort of health insurance or better pay. Just my thoughts on that. Benefits are really only for Full Time which I think is said seeing as though the narrative is that Marriott has helped so many employees out of bad situations. If that's the case, basic necessities should be priority of giveaways that only come on special occasion."
good,"This place would be an awesome place, but let’s get real without proper holidays for full-time employees and better wages and no pension plans how does anyone consider it a long-term employment for full-time?"
good,The company does offer great perks but management is needing to build better relationships with employees who are working their hardest while other are always slacking ff
good,Good to learn and experience a job title also opportunity to develop out self and knowledge. Staff is also very good and supportive but some people can be heritet you
good,Good pay and benefits in the job itself. Dress code is casual at all time. Vacation times are limited depending on what department you are in. This is a fast paces job.
good,Its good working at Marriott but sometimes it’s hard to ask for a request day off coz I go to school weekdays I hope they can fix this kind of problem
good,Challenging with acquisition and merger . great to learn new thing on urgent basis. great managers and leaders at Vistana . Currently very unstable as far as job stability due to mergers
good,"My managers were great and so was the team i was on. I left my job because there was oppertunity for advancement with this company. However, now matter how hard i worked, they give out a base amount for raised that  isn't helpful or even noticable on paychecks. I've been with this company for a while now and i've worked very hard to try to excel, however they don't reward a go-getter attitude. For the work i am doing, i am not fairly getting paid for."
good,It’s a good place to work. However sometimes there is a lot of events going on with little staff. It can be really stressful but the environment is good.
good,"Good Team productivity, Staff is courteous, Hard working efforts by all, Customer service is very good, and they seem always positive. "
good,"As with all companies you have the good side and the bad side Marriott is no exception to that rule. I feel like I do have job security however I feel that there is no room to grow. The tasks that we are required to complete and the compensation does not equal up. It can leave you sometimes feeling like you're overworked, underappreciated and underpaid. The culture can also use some improvement as well."
good,"When I first started everyone was nice and patient. They're very lenient with people who are starting out especially the chef. There is a limit to leniency and I suggest learning as much as possible as soon as possible and be as neat as possible even when others aren't. You will get fits here and there from the chef and there are times you just have to let go and there are times you have to say your defense because he is the type of person that will kick you even lower when you're down. "
good,The job I do is great except for the hrs and the pay. The managers have lack of communication in some areas. My manager likes to nit pick on the weaker person and it’s not right she’s very sneaky
good,Marriott is a great brand. I worked for a franchised Marriott and the hotel was in a suburban neighborhood. Not much around but the hotel was kept clean and the employees valued their work.
good,At the Marriott every day was different. You met new people everyday and you could learn a little about them and what they did during their meeting. The hardest part of my job is getting accurate information from the client to make their meetings successful. The crew that I worked with was great and we had a lot of fun working together.
good,"The supervisor is very kind and understanding to ALL SITUATIONS and will work with you as much as possible. Your work alone so it’s a very relaxed but fast paced work knowing no one is over your shoulder all day. However, they don’t pay enough for all the work that needs to be done. And they need more English speaking workers to train new employees"
good,"Most people there were nice and friendly to work with, with only a very few exceptions. Other than that, it was nice to be able to transfer to any other hotel within their portfolio and grow into other positions as they first look for inside candidates before going to the general public"
good,The company offers great benefits but each hotel runs differently.  I liked to stay busy and work with different departments and at full service that is not possible.  The hardest thing is finding good management that works with the team and doesn't leave early or come in late every day.  Since most managers are on salary the less they work it's better for them since their pay doesn't change.
good,"I believe this company is a GREAT company that cares for their employees overall! The reason I am still here after five years is that Marriott offers a flexible working schedule, great benefits, and a good working environment."
good,"Before the merger with another major hotel chain, my company was an excellent company.  It treated employees well.  The local managers were and still are very good."
good,The Marriott is a good company tp work for  when there is work available.  As of today I have not worked there in a month and I am still currently an employee .
good,"Since merger with Starwood it has gone downhill.  Scheduling your shift used to be very simple if you were in the top 5% of production; however, they have required hours to be worked that have not been requested and do not work for a life/work balance.  "
good,"It was a good experience, but very demanding work.  I enjoyed the staff I worked with immensely.  The banquet/special events side of the hospitality is very fast-paced and comes with many challenges, which we worked collectively on."
good,"this job is very easy, and rather boring."
good,"The Marriott St. Louis Grand is a challenging place to work. It is often described as a hotel that ""if you can manage here, you can manage anywhere."" This is a union property, most of the associates do belong to the union, and it is hard to manage these individuals sometimes. However, the pay is great for a hotel, and the opportunities for advancement within Marriott are endless."
good,Fun place to work with people who are really nice and enjoy serving their guests. The environment is really good when your working with people who love their job.
good,"it is not about the name of the company. it depends on the management, or the leader you are reporting with. it is not about what you do, it is who you work with."
good,"It was a family type of environment, but with change of a CEO, the culture turned to nothing but lay offs, and how to save any money. This company is still going through changes and will not slow down any time soon."
good,Un lugar muy cambiante con respecto a ambiente de trabajo debido a la constante rotación de personal.
good,Needs a lot of help but overall good service and great prices. Management needs some improvement and supplies are a little out of date. Not a lot of advancement in career wise or pay wise
good,"I enjoyed my job at mystic Marriott for many years. "
good,"Working here I was surrounded by both positive and negative energy often. The employees were very positive and helpful as some of the management, other parts of management were drama filled and choose favorites. I worked well with other and on my own so this job was a good fit for me because some nights you're left to your own and management isn't around much. That being said this restaurant is no longer open and new owners bought it."
good,"JW Marriott là môi trường làm việc mang đẳng cấp quốc tế, năng động, chuyên nghiệp. Các bạn trẻ hoàn toàn có cơ hội việc làm đa dạng."
good,"The Marriott is a melting pot of different ethnicities and cultures that all work together to reach the same goal, and that is to improve staff service overall to create a warm inviting experience for the guest and loyal SPG and Marriott members."
good,Just as a person I need to be constantly moving or doing something to not be bored.  Waiting for calls to come in killed me and made the time go by slower.  I may be biased but I would rather work somewhere that I wouldn't mind showing up everyday for.
good,"high energy high impact fast-paced semi stressful but fulfilling needs  however, management needs to do a better job at respecting the employees and appreciating them.Otherwise it is a nice place to work i enjoy when we work as a team.  A typical workday starts at 6am and ends at 2:30pm"
good,The workplace environment was very controlled and quite boring either due to high volume of stressful work or complete lack of tasks with no inbetween
good,"I enjoyed working on all shifts. The day shifts were great to make sure everyone had a satisfactory stay. The night shift was fun to interact with people as they were coming in. The audit shift was usually slow but there's always something to keep you busy. I really enjoyed seeing the guests faces when I could ""make their day""."
good,The hotel was very busy and the management team was very supportive of the teams efforts. The hotel was well kept and did a great job attracting talent. I was challenged and felt that my ideas were heard. If there was growth opportunities I would have stayed.
good,Loved working there. Had been there for four and a half years. Decided to leave because of the Exevutive Housekeeper and the assistant. Felt i deserved better than things they would do.
good,The one thing I didn’t like about this job was not knowing a set time I would get off. I would start at 4 and leave anywhere between 8pm -3am. There lots of people that work but not many want to see you successful
good,Good place to start learning the cooperate world. Making connects is easy but need to be on top of your work at all times.Friendly people but always looking to replace people with someone else within the company if mistakes are made.
good,"Esperienza che ha dato e tolto tanto."
good,Management was great. Employers were really helpful and fun to work with. Would get free lunch and breakfast. Rides if necessary. Get to swim in the pool.
good,I worked my internship at the westin hilton head island resort and spa south Carolina. i enjoyed learning the  culture and management styles.  i worked as a service express agent in the front office.
good,"I enjoy staying busy, serving the customers and assisting my fellow associates.  My position is hard work and not for everyone.  One of the best benefits of the job is discounts for room stays and the ability to share discounts with family and friends."
good,if you like working with multiple cultures then this is the place. they work day goes by fast because your always moving . never a dull moment . some management are impossible  to work with but if you know how to deal with people this is the perfect place
good,A lot of turnover due to management.  Great place to work.  The hardest part of the job is the unfairness.  Pay is very competitive in certain situations.
good,"It was a great location to start with, the beginning was rough but after time it because a beautiful place to work in. It was like a little family inside of the hotel."
good,"They promise through hiring and training that advancement is readily available and easy to achieve, but upon completing training and qualifying for advancement there was no new training available. Advised basically that wouldn't happen for another year when it was made to sound like a fast process what with bringing people in that had been with the company less than 2 years and had already advanced to top tier level. Very underwhelming and the overall pay level is not enough to even sustain a single one bedroom apartment for a year on adjusted income based rent."
good,"working at the westin was a great place to work because it helped me work on my people skills and keeping a complete conversation with the customers, but i just love keeping the customer happy"
good,some people there make it an hostile environment and its not flexible for people who are single parents or have sick children but it was ok. I wouldn't be able to work for this company again because the time and my family life don't mix together it was either or and I'm a single parent so my kids came first and I lost my job because of this.
good,"All the reviews are quite accurate. I appreciated the training and guaranteed full-time work. I loved working with the manager in charge of my team. Actually, many of the managers I came in contact with were excellent and incredibly helpful. "
good,"Good place to work if you're learning the industry. Some people have been here for over 10 years so some positions are locked up. Benefits suck, too expensive for minimum coverage. Overall it's a good place to work but not a place to spend the remainder of your career"
good,If you are looking for a job that is not a revolving door. This is not a place for you. Only get a 3% raise per year. Half your benefits don't start till after a year of working here.
good,you work hard but it's worth it the pay is great. easy going environment. the job does offer plenty of down time some days. only downside is that your hours aren't guaranteed
good,Great place to work. Lots of advancement opportunities and get training resources to set up for success. Organization puts a large emphasis on work life balance and team atmosphere.
good,I have been here almost four years with several employee achievements and awards and being promoted to management after only 6 months. This was a great place to work until recently
good,The Marriott is a great place to work.  There just wasn't enough room for advancement in the department I worked in and I wasn't willing to switch departments.
good,"Starwood Hotels is a great place to work with opportunity for growth."
good,"People that work there are great! The benefits are not good and the Human Resource Office need a lot of improvement. Management also needs more improvement, having supervisors that do not know what they are doing is not okay."
good,"This place is always a trip when you go to work here.  You never know what is going to happen next or who is or is not going to show up.  They cant get good people here due to the gratuity being low but they think its good.  But when you question them on that very subject there say they cant compet with the other hotels and resorts.  But we are getting 14% of a 24% service charge.""  You can do better.  Some people here are good to work with but there are always those that have a chip on there shoulders.  Alot of people who come into this place leave before season is out.  That is the truth!!!  Use this as a last resort."
good,"I worked six days a week including Sunday."
good,"data engineering enterprise integration and architecture  finalization on vendor selection, resource management and client business expectation management risk and issue resolution regards."
good,its not bad you get free snacks and drinks but personally id go for gransteadt because you get 18$ a load and 12 for flagging and the food is amazing.
good,"I was a security guard and most days were slow. Management did not seem to be a big part to the Westin. I saw many managers change in the dew months I was there. My manager did do much work, even if he actually managed to show up for his shift. The job was not hard and the pay was ok. It was a steady 40+ hour a week. job, but do not expect a great job here. Management is below par and in small depts. like mine its very hard to move up in your dept."
good,"Schedules are never the same each week, and you can get scheduled for any shift. Not much of a work life balance but I good company to work for. The room discounts are a great benefit."
good,Overall it's a good place where to work but the managment should take care much more of the employee and not just pretend to do so. They should focus on hiring more people and with the right competencies and attitude and not whoever is applying.
good,"I learned a lot about purchaser , because was a first time work like it, but like cook is no the best experience."
good,"I worked for this company for over two years. Although I advanced through the ranks very quickly, I was overlooked for major promotions multiple times."
good,"Through hard work and relentlessness, I have climbed the ranks within the food and beverage department. I enjoy learning, meeting, building relationships with guest and staff for the years I have been with Lodging Hospitality Management."
good,I loved all the Guests I came in contact with and the relationships I built while working there. However I wasn't earning enough money to pay all of my bills. And never really got to spend time with my family.
good,"management in fnb department has problems.very under staff, missing a lot of work equipment , work environment needs a lot of improvement. pay is good when its busy period"
good,"Great Manager, I am looking to work closer to home and not be in outside sales."
good,I love working for Marriott and don't want to leave this company however every time slow season hits they cut hours drastically. Great company with great benifits. The management has been different at every property I worked but overall good.
good,"The job description is not accurate.  Not only are your job requirements sales conversions (Reservations) but you are also expected to do marketing as well.  You are forced to market for Hertz Rental Cars, Marriott Rewards Visa cards and the Marriott Vacation Club (timeshare properties) as well.  Management will harass you if you do not force that marketing information into your phone calls.  Regardless of whether we've determined from the tone & situation of the guest's we are assisting with their reservation, that it's inappropriate to market the other services to them.  Interacting with a great variety of people is wonderful, but having to bother them with the additional marketing is not pleasant.  "
good,"Was a casual workplace position which usually involved me working events, which were incredibly busy. Was a fun workplace environment with friendly staff."
good,"it was pretty hard to work in that kind of environment because people were just easy come and easy go typically hard working job so no wonder, I learned to lead people and did supervision that gave me a lot of lesson to be a future leader. the management was a little bit hard to work with because the communication was not really effective. It was good to learn in a kind of tough situation and give me some strength but at the same time it was sort of stressful."
good,they wont allow you to a fair explanation its base of favorites even if you work hard and bleed for them. so expect much if metez is still running the place.
good,"Promote your work,build a team to create a good services,be patient to the guest,provide a good attitude,be responsible to your work,enhance your cleanliness and be approachable."
good,Super hotel. Très formateur. Très bien payé. Des clients top top
good,"Honestly speaking, this place was not a bad place to work for. They provide a friendly staff, free daily lunch, parties for the employees, and they encourage positive attitudes. However, I could not say the same for my boss. I didn't feel that he displayed good leadership at all. His ways were very discouraging and unpredictable."
good,"Very fast paced call centre with very little down time if any between calls. Bonus incentives and team incentives. Very competitive. When targets are hit, able to advance to next department but can take a few months for that to happen after you have reached the goal"
good,Marriott was like institution for me more than work place I learned almost 75% of my current skill in Marriott. The only this which Marriott was lacking is their salary scale which is too low.
good,"I work at a franchise property, but I think the standards they set are top-notch and they love to hire from within when they're able.  Hospitality at it's finest."
good,Good experience that helped me improve my proffessional skills working in a prestigious 5 star hotel. I improved my people skills as well as my hability to problem solving
good,"Lemeridien was eventually bought out by Westin(Starwood), much more into precise details with guests and employees. Slower paced yet equally demanding"
good,What a Great Hotel and a fun place to work. Working across the street from the AAC kept us busy with all of the games and concerts. Very Beautiful Hotel and great memories with the staff.
good,The Westin Ottawa was generally a good place to work. As a manager the expectation was to work long hours which is hard on family. Management is friendly but the is a lot of politics involved.
good,"Hotel Sun N Sand started in 2009 and taken over by starwood company, le meridian management in 2015. Great hotel great staff but not so good management."
good,"Working here was fun and challenging. Enjoyed filling in different areas of the Hotel from Housekeeping to The Bar, to The Front Desk. Enjoyed meeting and greeting our guest."
good,"I'm enjoying working at the Westin but as I am getting to see behind the scenes I feel that most employees are being significantly underpaid. There are many opportunities to grow within Starwood but in order to get promoted most employees will hop properties until finding the right angle up towards their desirable position. This is reasonable, though for being such a profitable industry, you think some of the key positions would pay a little more. I'm still relatively new though so we'll see how conversations warm up within time. So far, great people and I love coming to work each day."
good,although i have rated this low in some areas i did enjoy my time here however i felt that there wasnt much support or training and no chance of progression.
good,change sheets shave clean bathroom towels put clean towels and put soap chanpo coffee envelopes pass vacuum   keep my work area clean and tidy
good,I worked a Lobby bar which all the guess would see when they walked in. It was fun serving them as well as hmeeting and hearing the stories they had.
good,"Aprendi mucho...cada hotel aunque sea la misma cadena tienen procesos diferentes.Se me capacito turno de la mañana, tarde y noche."
good,"Prefer not to say it"
good,N'étant que saisonnière attachée au service vente et marketing j'ai pu observer l'esprit d'équipe que faisait preuve l'équipe lors des vente.
good,"they don't hire within, not much communication but to much micro managing. workers are not recognized for exceptional working habits. compensation is very low for the hours put in."
good,But if I want to grove up in my career I need to move on cause at this point I am not learning anything new.I just need something else in my life and career
good,"Great hotel portfolio, endless opportunities for on-property advancement.  Exceptional client loyalty. Benefits to book business with Starwood is never-ending.  Fantastic group promotions and reward program to drive outstanding results."
good,"Morning breakfast operation is heavy. Difficult part is to handle waiting. "
good,Hotels are 24/7 and you are expected to be the same. Very hard to get promoted and recognized. I wish I had chosen something else.
good,"A typical day here includes checking in and out guests, resolving guest complaints, and having a fair amount of knowledge of computers. Altogether the job is decent and I absolutely love the customer interaction. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of team work involved and for a good portion of the day you are on your own. Overall I think this would be good for a starter job if you are in your early years of college."
good,"The company is undergoing major changes and with those changes comes good and bad. Management can be a bit sketchy. Work load isn't much, you can balance if your in school or if you having another job. Good benefits."
good,I was required to make sure that all of my guest were happy. Was to make sure that their food came out in a reasonable time. Made sure that they had everything they needed.
good,"worked at marriott for 10 years, experienced restaurant, cleaning rooms and promoted to supervisor and met a great amount of candidates."
good,I have learned a great deal about people while working here. This environment has greatly increased my customer interactions and skills. Working as a team is essential to getting the job done quickly and accurately. You get to meet a lot of very interesting travelers while working in this job. If you are a person that likes to work nights then this is the perfect job for you. What I found the most difficult is the opportunity to move to days as quickly was I wanted.
good,"Greeting guest for services.  Coordinate and prepare for any special events such as anniversaries, birthdays, pre-weddings, honeymoons, etc... I have learned the operations of ordering for a spa, schedule appointments for individual services and groups. My management team are great and my input is very taken into considerations for decisions.  We have a great team that work on making the spa our number 1 priority. the spa is very small with very few amenities. Everything."
good,"This is great place to start ur career and promote ur self ."
good,"Marriott On The Falls is a great place to work. "
good,In my short lived experience the people you work with make the Marriott a great place to work.  The management and job to life ratio needs a lot of improvement as they like you to give 14 to 15 hours a day to work without managing over work effectively.
good,"I was let down by management. After my 60 day review I knew they wouldn't give me a permanent contract on my 90 day review. All I heard from Senior Night Staff was 'that they didn't need another team member'. I worked my hardest between my 60 & 90 day review. Amazing company to work for, just be careful with who you work with. I would definitely work for Marriott again but not at Newcastle Gateshead"
good,"how to clean room in a reasonable time usually have a good day at work I enjoy working there, the people are nice and friendly."
good,"Days at work are unpredictable, It can either be a productive day or a non so productive day. The hardest part of the job is keep up with all changes that are being made."
good,"Weekend a little bit more presure than normal. The hardest part of this job, when we find ourselves in short staff and its everything on rush, and rush never brings good things, i had an accident between double doors, like after to pass my afternoon in the hospital, nothing serious but anyway painfull."
good,"Although new management has stepped in which may not be entirely agreeable, I admire the workforce here who has great dedication and friendliness. Due to the demand of business the opportunity to work many hours is available. The pay seems to be fair and the benefits are a perk."
good,"While getting hired at Starwood was ""just a job"" originally, it has become the start of my career in Software Testing. The corporate culture is decent enough; I have good coworkers, and I have been able to learn a lot in the time I've worked here. The hardest part of the job is being able to afford living in an ever-growing city that attracts tech companies in droves (Austin, Texas) without having to move into a management position in order to receive a competitive salary."
good,I had limited opportunities to grow within the company. I believe the managers do care for employees but need to be more organized when it comes to mandatory training.
good,"A typical day working at the Marriott Rewards call center involves answering inbound calls regarding the Marriott Rewards program or account information. They have great benefits, including: health insurance, vision and dental insurance, 401k, tuition reimbursement. The hardest part about the job is that you get yelled at for program issues that you have no control over and it is very hard to get time off even if it is for big events like a marriage. The most enjoyable part about the job is the co-workers and the sense of satisfaction you receive when you help someone."
good,"The people who work there are wonderful, but  the guest and the expectations of what they rely on you to do can be exhausting."
good,"day to day duties is picking and pulling paint to meet our quotas for the day."
good,"Work overall isn't bad at all.  Management can tend to be nepotistic and quick to give action with thoroughly identifying any issue.  Co-workers are manageable though communication could be better.  The job is too demanding so there's not much I can say that's hard about it but, the most enjoyable part of the job would be the to see the smiles on the face of good people as they walk in."
good,I was pregnant while working here . a typical day at work would be 15 to 20 rooms to clean at my own paste. the hardest part of this position was cleaning room after birthday parties and after football games. the enjoyable part of the job were the customers and how much they loved my ability to do a great job while pregnant
good,This was the fun job I had. Wasnt to stressful or to easy and always things to do. The staff was great to work with. Most of the staff we worked together and acted like we were family. Always had laughs on stressful days.
good,Great place to work during busy tourism season in the local area. Less busy during slow season so hours are very slim. Tasks are routine and don't change much. Great place to get a start into the hospitality business.
good,"Starwood is a solid hotel company to work for though really depending on the managed hotel you work at. Corporate direction is generally disjointed and they have a tendency to rush to market with products before ensuring they are a seamless for either the guest experience or for the ""field""."
good,"It took a long while in waiting for the final call from Marriott, which squeezed the time in the following operating process. Too many policies."
good,cleaned 16 rooms or more some days we ran out of lined and couldn't make up the beds had great mangers  very nice helpful co workers hard part was not being able to clean the properly due to no cleaning supplies.
good,"Fast pace work, learned a lot about the day to day operation of a hotel, helping the guests was very fulfilling, was proactive in supplying the hotel store, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have the guest have a good stay and to help them with fun and enjoyable things to do in the city"
good,Marriott Hotels is a good company to work for & grow in professionally. I really like the opportunity to advance in the company overall & the culture which sutures advancement to all employees who seek to do just that.
good,"Fast Pace work environment especially, during the summer months  with all local attractions opening Busch Gardens and Water Country USA. During the winter months the business is mostly business travelers."
good,"My daily tasks as a leisure assistant are to monitor the gym for Health and Safety Issues, chatting to the members making sure they are happy with their programs and general membership questions, also selling additional and new memberships for the gym. I am also responsible for the swimming pool area to make sure CH and PH are at the right levels for both the pool and Jacuzzi. I also have to do backwashing on both of them to clean out the system ensuring that the correct balance is in place and recorded. "
good,If you are new to the hotel industry this is the place to work. New Management team and associates. Great place to start if you are joining the hospitality industry.
good,"Marriott was a fantastic place to work when I started; They stuck closely with the ""Treat your employees well and they'll take care of the customer"" creed very closely. In recent years that has been the case less and less - benefits have declined drastically, and outsourcing is now very commonplace. Our products have suffered because of it."
good,Overall I've learned a great deal about customer satisfaction and service at the Marriott Cleveland East. I've made many friends and a typical at work is never completely typical all the time there is always something new to learn.
good,"Required to maintain, clean and refresh bedrooms for guests. Hectic pace with little downtime."
good,"There was a lot of restructuring going on at the time in the department I was working in, would take time to get things in order from shift to shift so that it all shifts would work together as one team"
good,The job was fairly easy. For the most part the biggest benefit was the significant hotel discount provided as an employee of the company. I found that scheduling was fairly flexible. At the Sarnia location your only task was to make reservations so for the most part it was fairly easy and customers were content.
good,"Great company that believed and picked the best of the best. I just did not fit into the reactive side of sales. They really invest in the employees and develop of them as well. But the sales job is not for everyone, the hardest part was the information overload that was given."
good,The most whimiscal experience I'v ever had in a hotel orgization.  The hotel guest were some of the most talked about celebrities in pop culture.  There was always a party at the W.
good,"Corporate marriott run, which is great if your looking to move up the ladder, easy to learn new departments are advance in the field. Downfall is guest come and go with one night stays very fast paced and not customer service based"
good,"j'ai tout simplement étais utiliser par l'entreprise, embaucher en cdi dégager au bout d'un moi sans réelle raison, mais a coter de ça c'est une entreprise qui tourne, cuisine pas très élaborer mais de très bon locaux, personnelle simpatique."
good,"The beginning if the day i would report to my office to read the daily reports. If nothing was urgent i would walk every floor of the hotel checking safety devices, and ensuring doors are locked. I would then meet with my DOS for any briefings that was needed, then pass that information on to co-workers. At this point i would check all training records to ensure everyone is up to date on their training"
good,"Is  a fun and graet place to work, fun, equal oportunyty. for every  one, good benefit good pay. vaccacion safety place to worck."
good,"They had work at home positions, but not anymore. They also will hold grudges in some cases against employees who make mistakes."
good,"A day at work involves, preparation for daily activities at the beginning of every shift. This entailed: making sure all equipment and tools were readily available and in proper fashion to be utilized for both guest and fellow associates. I was able to grasp information quickly and strengthen my skills of multitasking and making personal connections with other people. The managing staff, lack somewhat of daily responsibilities and ensuring that their employees remained satisfied so that we can promote positive working environments and product quality. Co-workers relied on each other in a team manner to make each of our jobs easier and produce a higher standard for new associates and guest we served. Often times I had to stay further than expected time to perform task as a result of lack of discipline enforced by other associates."
good,"i've been working for 10 years and 5 months in this comapany."
good,"I start my day by greeting my co-workers, check emails and handle any guest issue that is hot on the table. I look for safety issues as i make rounds throughout the Hotel. I learn something new every day. The most important thing that I realize at my job is that everyone wants to be treated fairly. The hardest part of this job is that I cannot not make all guest smile. The most enjoyable part is seeing a sincerly satified Guest."
good,A typical day was a sold out hotel with several events going on and groups in house.  I learned how to manage a hotel during a sold out situation while still performing to the best of my ability when things were fast paced and chaotic.  My coworkers were always available to help.
good,"My day started out with returning emails, calls, and setting up appointments. What I learned from working for Marriott is that it's more than just putting ""heads in beds"". It's building relationships with people and helping out with a need. Management was average. There was never a straight direction unfortunately. Too many changes month after month. "
good,Wages are nice for the back of the house but favoritism falls in favor of the front of the house. Which creates at times a hostile work environment.
good,"difficult employees, never felt like i fit in, Chef was a great teacher"
good,I acutally partner with Marriott at a company called towne park
good,"Very enjoyable place of employment, fast pace but well worth it.every day was learning how to deal with all types of customers  happy or mad..property upkeep and maintenance is my specialty so thats never a strain on my daily routines.."
good,"My typical day at work would be deep cleaning three guest rooms. This contains removing all linen are replacing with new. Vacuuming/ shampooing  the entire room. Washing windows and walls. Pulling out all furniture and vacuuming behind, wiping down cords and phones. I learned how to pace myself to get all my job done on time. The management at the hotel, well it could use improvement. Some managers do not know how to speak to co-workers. My co-workers are awesome, all team players. The hardest part of the job for me is having multiple managers telling you different things to do. I have 4 managers, one will say do this, then another will say no don't do that do this. The most enjoyable part of the job is my break time with my friends."
good,It is the typical hotel life. Do not have set schedules. You can be working 3-11 and then have to be back in the morning at 7.
good,"some days its your average job with its own twists, other days its back and forth running, constant work, long hours, and everything were able to get done revolves around our guests and their timelines."
good,i am on my feet but i get to move around and talk to people. that is the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the guest. the work environment is up and down. i like the rush and i like the down time to get little things done.
good,"Good Job. Good Management. Long hours. Low pay."
good,"7am-3:30pm Weekdays "
good,"Everyday was a new challenge, it would be hard to expect to keep your the plan for the day. You would have to choose the priority when projects came up unexpected."
good,"I have faced always stff shortage in westing while working.  I have to manage 2 to 3 executives staff work by myself."
good,The Westin Diplomat was an excellent place to work.  Typical workday included a morning meeting everyday so that all shifts would be updated with the night's agenda and to plan the day. I learned customer service skills and how to  maintain a 1200 room hotel.  Management tried to keep us all in the loop during our busiest times.   My co-workers were like a big family and we were able to count on each other during the toughest days.  Hardest part of the job was working the overnight shift and the most enjoyable times was everything that our human resources did for us to keep the moral up.
good,"Firstly,that is my first job in hotel industry i learn a lot of knowledge in the hotel from basic until my end carrier..But not realy like with the management because of some issues that i cannot written here..the hardest part of my job is in room service because to much of clearing n complaint from my boss..the best part of my job is in the bar really love that job very much because when i serve the guest i feel that the person that i serve is not my guest is like my family or my friend..."
good,"A typical day included getting assignments, preparing and stocking my linen cart for the day and getting started with my assigned tasks.  "
good,I enjoyed meeting all of the different people that checked in and I learned a lot about the behind the scenes of hotels.
good,"Supervision of PM attendants, scheduling, office coordination, and ensure the needs of the guests."
good,"• Greet and serve guests while processing food orders in a high volume restaurant"
good,"Typical day of work are usually entertaining the members most especially the hotel guests whose coming in and coming out. I need to give the best service on my work."
good,"Being a waiter would be very busy specially in a hotel and you have to deal with different kind of people. The best part is working with equally hardworking colleagues  I learned that no matter how busy it is, you have to focus on what you are doing and bring the best and optimum service to the guest."
good,"The obligations of the job did not amount to the pay that was desired. In addition, the hours available to employees were not acceptable nor fair. However, the people at the job itself is what begins the enjoyment and the available incentives."
good,"A typical day at work would be to answer inbound calls about the member's frequent stayer program."
good,Overall it was a great place to work just no room for advancement.
good,"-assist guest check in and check out"
good,"For the size of the hotel it really isn't all that bad. I prefer a larger hotel/work environment with a higher volume of customers and more co-workers. There were many times where I was one of the few employees on property and I had little to no one to talk to. "
good,"This job requires a lot of focus and multitasking skills. Because this Marriott property is located on airport grounds, it can get very busy and overwhelming. Guests will be guests so you have to remain calm and collected. You have to be able to calm yourself and the customers/guests when need be. The work keeps you busy and everyday feels like a little adventure."
good,"This place has many great employees, known to have the ""friendliest staff!"" "
good,"Worked front desk- constant customer contact"
good,"This location was under new management when I was hired.  I started at the front desk working some morning shifts and then some evenings.  Checking in guests and checking them out after their stay.  I was responsible for making sure guests had proper transportation to and from the hotel and airport so staying in contact with our shuttle driver was important.  After a few months of working we had another shift in management and i was trained on how to do the night audit, so i became the evening lead.  This was the most difficult part of my job, as the manager would purposely over sell the hotel to secure a full house.  Dealing with tired angry guests was not fun, but I was able to find hotels we would ""walk"" them to and we would compensate them by paying the hotel stay and secure their transportation with our hotel driver."
good,"During the early mornings things were usually a little slow. There were two regular busy times during midday. The customers were usually polite and patient. Management was very stern and demanded restaurant perfection, the slightest mistake was looked down upon on. My co-workers were very particular on every aspect of the job when it came to serving and taking the customers orders. Everything had to be done one way every single time. The hardest part of the job was keeping down the delivery time of drinks and food request to the customer as well keeping up with helping coworkers and the care of the other tables without forgetting all the separate responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how excited the customers were to receive that customer service for their needs. It keeps a positive feeling in me to want to keep up the polite and attentive service."
good,"I work with the casual restaurant,"
good,"I enjoyed my job very much. I like to interact with Guest and make sure they have excellent customer service."
good,"Professional work environment."
good,"The magement is awesome, always an open door policy. I feel this is the best place I have worked"
good,"management was a conflict maker..not good..back then..I woul only go back if they had a good management team,but last I heard it was a guy who use to work at a diferent department that had nothing to do with security..they need to get profesional's involved.."
good,"My days were fast paced. I worked with many different groups of IT specialists.  Further education on the job training was always available. I learned so much about other environments, networking, Windows and Linux while operating the mainframe which included the TPF system for reservations. Our shift always helped each other to get issues resolved. My fellow associates were the best part of my job. The hardest part was executive managements' decision to outsource the entire IT division to other companies. I have learned many skills while being employed there and I hope to find another company that needs my skills."
good,"Typical day included working with kitchen staff, receiving and/or shipping guest and hotel merchandise.It can be a fun environment and can also be really busy.The best part was being able to put a smile on the guests faces."
good,"I love the people i work with very nice and family oriented in immediate department. "
good,I mainly just took incoming calls. I learned to speak to people over the phone and provide customer service. Management could have had more interaction and co-workers were easy to  get along with. The hardest part of the job was handling unhappy customers. I really enjoyed giving good customer service and in the end providing customers what they needed.
good,"Starting out was fun awesome I had a blast wanted to help everyone made new friends. A year into restaurant did not have the same feel good friends left new people coming in (They don't carry their own weight making it more difficult to work). Chef started acting different and more annoying. "
good,"very long hours but good place to work."
good,"I start my day off by checking phone messages in the morning and returning any calls that need to be made. From there I go and do Cashier duties. (count banks, give change, & do deposits) from there I'll check to make sure the Kitchen staff is doing ok and dont need help. Check emails, and then start my Accounting duties. AP and AR processing, gift certificate, direct bill applications, credit card authoirzations, face to face customer service. "
good,"hi.."
good,Friendly staff and easy to get along with others. A normal work day would consist of completing all prep for the next event and lending a hand to other areas of the kitchen that needs help.
good,I enjoyed my job but It was hard to get allot of hours because of lack of business .I felt there wasn't team work and it was hard to get things done because of lead team .
good,"The Marriott group of companies has a fantastic culture and set of values. The property was absolutely beautiful and the staff were all wonderful people.  Unfortunately, I found upper management to be lacking in professionalism.  A leader is suppose to lead by example and I felt that the Marriott culture was fraudulent at this particular property.  I have worked with/for much more respectable Managers."
good,"The Marriott Residence Inn in Mission Valley was a good experience. My co-workers were great! The hotel had just been remodeled, so it appeared to be fresh and new. They offered lots of perks to the guests, such as happy hour, and a complimentary breakfast."
good,"Marriott overall is a good company, they take care of there employees, and have a great corporate culture. The only drawback is that in order to move up in the company you have to be able to pick up and move. There isn't a lot of turn over, so the only way to get a job at the property you want to work at, you have to hope for someone to get fired or die. Its horrible to say, but true. I want to be able to stay with Marriott, but I don't want to have to move all over and destroy any lifestyle I may have."
good,"I worked with a wonderful group of people. Each person was dedicated to providing a strength to the entire of crew. There were always shifts available if you were willing to work as bonus. Upper management went through transformations, which could leave you lost if you couldn't adjust. Overall, a pretty decent working environment."
good,"My day consisted of ordering, inventory control, distribution of supplies, overseeing daily operations in lounge area and all duties required to manage the the Beverage Department."
good,"This was my first time working in a hotel, and I definitely learned a lot about hotel operations, but after I realized I didn't want to work in a hotel anymore, I had a hard time advancing. I enjoyed the people in my department and a couple others, but communication throughout the hotel was difficult at times."
good,"I learned a lot in my time with the company, while learning all aspects of hotel industry"
good,"I was serving food ,cleaning the canteen ,doing salads ,taking teperatures.,selling chocolates"
good,speed you have to have speed to do 20+ rooms in 8 hours and you have to have proper training when doing this job....i didnt enjoy nothing about the job and wouldnt go back to it.
good,"logged into the phone all software programs needed to assist customers properly, i learned new programs such as peoplesoft and dealing with property management especially overseas was a pleasure. the hardest part would have to be working with angry customers for incorrect charges and nothing you seemed to do made them happy..Happy Customers the rewards and bonuses for conducting good customer Service"
good,I am working as a banquet Captain usually a day start in reviewing the BEO of the week and start up putting our goals for the week
good,Experience was very knowledgable for me. There are things that I learned that I can take through life.
good,"Preventative maintenance and repairs made daily...made weekly schedule...attended weekly management meetings, inventory"
good,"securing building,responsible for the safety of property,guests and their belongings,cleaning rooms,doing floors."
good,Monitors all the billing payment
good,Many guest interactions. Answering and directing phone calls to appropriate destinations. Improved multi-tasking. Hardest part of the job was the inconsistency of scheduling. Most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity of peoples encountered on a day to day basis.
good,"I am working in the team of housekeeping in a Grosvenor house as a desk coordinator we are the controller of team, I am working in different shift morning nor afternoon shift,I've learned that you need to be humble in this job, stay happy, strong and be patience,I want to thank my management for promoting me as a desk coordinator and belief in my ability its a big pleasure for me to work with them, the hardest part of the job is when your alone taking the messages and calls are pouring and you don't have any choice ""just to put them on hold"" the most enjoyable part of a job is when the guest feel the warming welcome whenever they call in the dept."
good,Maximizes hotel sales and revenue and minimizes operational costs
good,"A well ran kitchen,good people,I love that enviorment.There is nothing else I want to do but be in the kitchen."
good,The Westin was whatever you would like it to be if you were well connected...
good,the company is ok company . you get to meet alot of people. the management team in housekeeping is not a great team to work with.the overall management twam is ok
good,"The Marriott is a place that emphasizes teamwork. We all knew our positions, yet jumped in if needed in other areas. The management was kind and considerate, but sometimes failed to do what was promised."
good,Hospitality is a constantly busy field to work in from beginning of shift to the end.
good,"Supervise production of more than 8000 meals every day for more than 50 flights (British Airways, Air France, and Swiss)"
good,"Good, fun place to work with very good pay. But I was casual so shifts weren't always available"
good,A typical day at work would include various bookkeeping duties and supervise cashier. I learned supervisory skills and human resource functions. Management and co-workers where supportive and cooperative. The hardest part of job contract ended and the most enjoyable part of the job meeting new people.
good,worked in high volume kitchen.making indian curry and tandoor foods for banquet functions.
good,Lieu de travail et environnement très agréable
good,"Answered phones, I learned how to be a little more patient with people, co-workers are very patient, toughest part was learning all the codes for the reservations, most enjoyable part was spending time with co-workers. It can be stressful dealing with guest complaints about the internet especially since there are a lot of business travelers and they need to be able to connect."
good,Its a good company but is not challenging enough. The work day is busy during the day and slower at night. The co-workers are nice and team players the staff is very pleasant.
good,"Worked for Marriott while attending college, and worked for them full time after. A fun company to work for, though very challenging at times, especially with a rotating, unset schedule. Overall a great first full-time employer."
good,Check in/out guests. Prepare for meetings or group arrivals. Scheduling and payroll.
good,The job was great being able to assist and check in guests. Management was great to work with. Was not able to work a full and part time job any longer because of my husbands shoulder surgery in 2009.
good,"my work was the front desk checking inn customers and checking out customers,"
good,"Friendly fast paced enviroment, that was family oriented."
good,"I spent seven good years with the Adam's Mark/Marriott. There were several large groups that over the years, I got to know and look forward to seeing time and again. Different departments called upon me for assistance with small projects to help their department run smoother."
good,I was not happy there do to management. A messy job with employees and manager. I was standing on your feet for long periods of time. Pay rates where horrible.
good,It's great to be a people person and it's great to travel for discounts I love to dress and impress and meet people worldwide it was my favorite job!!
good,"Marriott was a good place to work, with nice pay, weekly pay, room for advancement, very diverse, can be a bit unorganized at times, changed managers, supervisors, and office personnel quite frequently. But overall a very good place to be employed."
good,My work/life balance is pretty good. I work morning shifts during the week most weeks although sometimes I am asked to work weekends. Pay could be better especially for someone with previous experience.
good,"For about thirty years they are like my  family in joy working for them I have good Days and Bad"
good,"A typical day would be to check out memos and emails."
good,"Its not the same company now that a Marriott is not running the show.  The original philosophy of its founder is still talked about but not in practice.  There is to much focus on the bottom line. Work/ life balance is not balanced as their GMs are asked to do more with less every year while the company cuts benefit for all management, especially GM's and higher."
good,"Working for Marriott, you learn the art of hospitality and what it's like to welcome people to their home away from home. Whether they're there for business or pleasure, you're given everything you need to make your guests' stay more memorable."
good,You go in work your hours and thats it. They don't really set themselves apart from other companies. Free lunch is ok and the HR department do try to make it that everyone feel welcome but the building is old and its kinda of disheartening to always hear guest complaining about the place you work at.
good,"The job was interesting every day to say the least"
good,A typical day started by checking emails and then a morning staff meeting at 9am. I would then set my assistant up with his PM works for the day. I learned more about customer service and quality. The workplace was a calm and friendly environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to get my department in order because of how the previous chief engineer left it. I enjoy doing repairs and helping our guests.
good,Its a fun job to be at I just need something that pay more for my family it does not pay that much I have 4 kids an homeless I need some more pay for me family
good,This company truly put employees first. I have never worked for a company that stood so strongly behind their values. Would recommend a career with Marriott.
good,"Good work/place balance. Great health benefit. Overall it was a pleasant experience. The company is, for the most part, ethical and seems to care about their employees."
good,Assist team did not seem to help out a lot. Some of them were rude and didn’t seem to want to help other coworkers nor guest who stayed at a Marriott.
good,"Just because people are given management roles, doesn't mean they are able to do their jobs or know how to do their jobs. The work is fast paced and a great place to learn to do large banquets and production."
good,Marriott International does not care for their employees as they used to. The hours and treatment of their employees was cery unfair although the pay was good
good,"I worked at the Marriott Waterfront in Baltimore in 2001 and the job started off great. The employees were good to get along with at first and the benefits are good. I received a pay raise not long after working there and I  liked the fact that the employees wear uniforms. After a while I saw favoritism against certain races of people and they actually had the audacity to call me in to work after the 911 crashes and said they would pay for a cab for me to get there. Temp employees from foreign countries were looked at like ooh la la while most US born citizens were taken for granted. The benefits were good and so were the breaks. I hate their policy on when an employee gets fired, corporate will put a Do Not Rehire code beside your name and you can never work for any Marriott again or any hotel under their management. Bad policy!"
good,"The position is perfect for a college student looking to do homework on the job"
good,They provide great training experinces. Work load can be a little too heavy at times but most of the time you have other people helping you make it a success.
good,"The job paid reasonably well, but tips were pooled which makes no sense for a valet job. You were scheduled to come in at a certain time and had no idea when you'd be able to leave. You're lucky to have a single day off. They also extort their drivers in the event of an insurance claim. Would not reccomend."
good,"Good Company, love working in Marriott. Good benefits, good pay and they give you free mean. that's awaesome. Love the culture, they do recycling. love"
good,"Nice people to work with in a friendly environment, they are there when help is needed.They give you a warm welcome here at the lovely property; its a great place to work at."
good,"Some great managers, some not so great. Not paid enough for the duties/responsibilities I had. Felt under-appreciated. Good benefits. Not enough opportunity for raises even in a corporate run facility. It's even worse at a franchise."
good,I enjoyed my time at Courtyard. However shortly after my year mark the leadership team made a decision I found highly questionable. A 10yr team member was let go over a situation that management said the team member was in when they were not. I seen them loyal mattered not to the managers
good,work is monotonous and boring; culture and management is decent; pay is low and working hours are flexible; to move up the ladder can be difficult though
good,"Marriott was fair and treated their employees good. They made work enjoyable and the competition was fun. There were bonuses, gifts, blankets and awards. They fed the workers on a regular basis to make sure they ate if we were working long hours. The work place was a place where I  met a lot of interesting people that came from everywhere and advanced to different departments even to different facilities."
good,Fun to work can work any where in the world. Payment very comparative excellent management system open door policy. General manager and very friendly including Mr. Marriot and his son as well came to visit the hotel he come to the kitchen to housekeeping to the front desk every place to greed the employee.
good,poor management. you get blame for their mistakes. there is no communication from the management to the staff. management is very disorganized. they oversell rooms purposely without realizing that guests can be upset if rooms are not guaranteed for them.
good,The job required alot of you. The building was beautiful and the rooms. We needed more staff in my opinion to fill up our closets and to have laundry ready.
good,"I work front desk"
good,"Challenging to advance"
good,"It was not bad working there, but they did not have enough supplies to do the work and they promise that you would get supplies but did not. The manager was a great person."
good,"I've learned just about everything in the building besides management"
good,it is a good place to work. advancement is available. Most of the management is very hands on. work and life balance is a challenge because of how busy it gets.
good,"Laid back work environment, but many changes in management, the property is 30 plus years old and needs renovations, communication from management is poor"
good,"It was ok working there but the mangers are very rude and never make you comfortable. Overall, the guest and some employers make your day and job more easier."
good,"Un día típico muy estresante en realidad ya que se realizaba diferentes actividades para apoyar al equipo de ingeniería."
good,TCS was badly missmanged. Marriott was much better organized and managed. TCS placed unreasonable deadlines on us and had a tendency to micro-mange their employees.
good,"the place has lovely staff, great benefits, and hours. If I could go back I would in a heart beat but it just wasn't the right place for me to work. looking for a more hands on job."
good,Our banquet manager was real friendly and understanding . Good communication with staff  always recognized how well we worked . Making sure we had our lunch breaks on time . Great manager
good,"Crystal City Marriott is a great place to work, but the management is very poor. Some associates are being over work and treated fairly. Associates are being fired left and right without throughly investigation."
good,"the guests are great at the Fairfield I work at . there are some issues with hiring ..they are in need of an inspired head of housekeeping! I like working there very much I do feel Im underpaid  for everything I do,and all my responsibilities."
good,"Courtyard was under a native's corporation and had better benefits with said corporation. The change in managers in different departments (e.g. front desk, food and beverage) was very fast leaving the staff to deal with different management skills and approaches from the said new managers that not all employees liked. If you learn to deal with this and be a flexible employee none of this is a problem."
good,I was in a department full of females as I am a male. This was no concern for me as I just stuck to doing my job never much minding my coworkers. They had an issue with my work ethic and I would end up in trouble for things they were doing themselves or things that shouldn't have been done and the supervisor whom was also a female did not help my case but made it worse. I was basically a male trapped in a sexist situation and I chose to leave and find employment elsewhere.
good,So many issues in the hotel. People don't respect each others. The administrative team they do what they want and they don't take care of the employees.
good,"I loved my job, don't get me wrong.  The hours were terrible, but that is only because they were very late in the afternoon/ night.  It was difficult dealing with intoxicated patrons at times, but they were mostly greats conversations.  Worldly customers tend to have interesting stories."
good,"fun experience, poor management. lack of scheduling. working with my co worker/ friend was fun. The manager was very drained all the time, lack of motivation. very tight."
good,"Worked full-time for the Marriott brand and it was an amazing job with rewarding days each and everyday. Found a job elsewhere and they let me stay on-call, which was great! Decided to pick up a shift one month and was told I no longer work there. Disappointing to say the least since no one communicated this with me. Tried to reach out to my former Director, nothing. Tried to speak and reach out to HR, nothing. I went from being someone to being nothing to them. "
good,Good compensation and benefits applicable only if you are full time. Flexibility with schedule. Fast paced. The hardest part of the job is to be able to manage your stress on a very busy day.
good,"The job itself is like any other gift store, just stocking items, greeting clients and helping them, and operating the cash register. You get multiple breaks, so that's good."
good,"Great on floor team to work with. Management is unorganized and under trained. Lots of staffing issues. Lacking in job security. Inconsistent disciplinary procedures, GM seems to play favorites."
good,"It was timeshare so the challenge was being able to book the ""owners"" dream vacation and the availability was not there. Another struggle was explaining the additional charges as as maintenance fees as well as renovation fees. "
good,"Environment doesn't change, a lot of restrictions as you deal with credit cards which prohibits cell phone use of any kind in most of the building and more restrictions. Easy to move up if you can stay focused and not bored out of your mind dealing with meaningless calls. Benefits are one of their strengths..but they really micromanage going a minute over on breaks or lunches."
good,"Buen trato a trabajadores, respeto y en general buen ambiente de trabajo, dietas a cargo de la empresa al igual que la ropa de trabajo, resumiendo se trabaja bien pero necesito trabajar indefinidamente."
good,"Working with young children and teaching them to play a sport was very fun. It was fast paced and always enjoyable. I learned how to approach people, help children and teach kids different techniques and games to do with volleyball."
good,"My specific situation may be unique, but I find that I'm not adequately compensated for the amount of time and effort that I put into my work. I enjoy the work that I do, but don't find that I'm able to always maintain a good work/life balance."
good,"My father taught me to always perform my responsibility at 100-110%; at 100% you will most likely please your employer, at 110%... you will exceed expectations and if the employer is wise enough , they will value your service and pay you accordingly; regardless, of whether or not you are valued...one will be happier at knowing you have done your best. and working at 110% will have taught you lessons in life of yourself and of others; he also said that it was my responsibility to find ways to enjoy my job by challenging myself to make it more than just work."
good,It is either extremely busy or extremely slow. One day I can be off for a week and the next I could be working 12-19 hours per day. the most challenging part is the work-life balance.
good,I loved working at Starwood Hotels.  I had lots of friends at work and everyone worked as a team.  They offer great benefits. Also working there you will be working at a beautiful site.
good,"Marriott is a decent place to work, they have many opportunities available. The call center is too small for the amount of employees they have, the training could be improved immensely and the pay in horrible. I did love the people I worked with and the job itself was pleasing."
good,"The Company/Franchise  doesn't seem to care about this particular hotel. The building is old and a lot of the rooms need major remodeling. I don't blame management as they try to do as much as possible. The pros are good people, good management, easy to get in contact with if their is a major problem. Pay is competitive amongst other hotels. The cons: building needs major renovations done, corporate doesn't seem to care or see this. Health Insurance options are extremely limited with no dental or vision coverage. Century Healthcare who is the health insurance company provided/Healthcare Highways has probably the worst customer service I've encountered."
good,very fast paced and busy. Demanding depending on the department. I refuse to write anything further for a review. .........................................
good,Its cool place to work at but management isint that great an they don't wanna pay good. The hard part of the job is getting along with the housekeeper
good,"It's great managers and if you need help they are there to assist you. But high turnover because of salary range and not so much room to grow.  They are concern about your health  welfare though so you can take 15 to just walk around and stretch as calls are non stop since you are making reservaton sales worldwide. "
good,"Working for the biggest hotel company in the world provides you with many benefits and opportunities for mobility. You can work literally anywhere in the world if you put in the time and effort. "
good,"At Aloft I have the best manager I have ever had at any job, but there are only two other employees in my department and we have to be at work by 5 AM"
good,"Management is really easy going, as far as schedule. "
good,It was great to work some of the employees at Springhill Suites. I was able to provide guest services with problem solving and community spirit while employed.
good,Great place to work with great hours. I loved working there but the management was extremely poor. The AGM was rude and inconsiderate. Make sure you stay on them about requested days off or they will completely disregard them. I loved working with the families and soldiers that would come through.
good,It great place to work if u can deal with wishes wash people great place to get a start at housekeeping in learn things in take it to other level but also a lot work
good,"The job itself is fun, meeting with happy hotel clients."
good,"It would be nice if they provided more training. As with all companies some departments foster strong team work, while others work against another department making the tasks at hand more challenging than necessary."
good,"This was not particularly my favorite job, but one that gave me a wealth of experience when it came to multitasking on the phone with customers.  Good conflict resolution skills were developed in all optimism."
good,"a work day at the Marriot intense and fast pace ,always learning something new, different cooking techniques, working with new tools of the trade , management was the best that I have worked for always teaching, grooming, and preparing us for success ,the culture was to take you to your most highest place , the hardest part was waiting and being patient for promotion , because of the amount of talent that was present.the most enjoyable part of the the job was seeing a smile on people faces when they taste something that you created and they like."
good,New executive staff is needed in order to make this property great again. Other than that the place is great to work for as long as you fall in line..
good,The large size of the hotel with a lot of check ins and check outs on a daily basis. Large work load for the staff.  Great source of experience for those looking to build on a career in hospitality.
good,"offer good benifits.you get to help residents and there famlies.resident functoins.have 12 lakes,dog parks and play grounds for kids to play.community pool and kiddie pool."
good,"My typical day at work would consist of helping customers book hotels for Starwood property. I learned how to sale rooms to customers by simply speaking with an up beat tone, that way the customer can feel more comfortable speaking, and buying a room from you. The management team was very helpful. We had meeting every week about what we could do to better sale the hotel rooms, and have the customer satisfied."
good,Aquí fue donde mejor estuve ya q la persona que me contrató me pagaba súper bien por satisfacción de mi trabajo
good,AT&T overall was not too great. Management seemed clueless at times when I had questions. Lunches would be extremely short
good,"This is a really great company, however management was a little unorganized and rude.The overall atmosphere here is very friendly, just a few bad apples."
good,I enjoyed the job but I needed more income to provide for my family. I would love to work for Marriot again but on a part time basis. Iwould recommend this job to anyone
good,"Learn managing time and different people nationality language, Harder times,when our goals is not in the right target."
good,"This company is a very good start to call center work. I think mostly because you deal with people over the phone that know what they want, and the company takes plenty of time to help you grow as an associate rather than forcing you onto the sales floor when you're not ready."
good,"My job duties include Customer Service and Sales. A full knowledge of the travel program, and Saratoga which is the navigational system. Providing the best options for the guest/member to utilize his or her points for travel. Have a full knowledge of all hotel brands worldwide."
good,"-Encouraged growth through training as required by the hotel"
good,"cleaning bedrooms between 9-13 making sure all dirty laundry is removed from carridores, and that the corridore is clean and vaccumed at end of shift. Also covering front of house and cleaning function rooms after use."
good,"been working here a year. cleans rooms about everyday, some days clean public areas or do laundry. Hardest part is being really sore after a long hard day. job can be really rough on the back and sholders.best part about the job is the team I worked with. all very nice accept one person. there all like a a big family."
good,"Marriott Vacations Worldwide is a top national employer, ranked in Forbes 2014 top 10 Travel Companies to work for, and offers a competitive benefits package, a generous work-life balance, well-balanced employee coverage, and travel discount benefits."
good,"Its was my second job,During this job I learnt if you are a hard working you can achieve anything, Customer preference will be your first priority,The best thing i learnt here is how to handle a pressure."
good,"Always a very busy environment, some issues with management but overall a good place to work. They could concentrate on the dress code a little better."
good,Come to work and  check emails for any changes then proceed to the floor to check on and assist associates. Go to daily stand up to relay any updates or information about the hotel
good,"•	Worked as PeopleSoft Production Support Admin and took care of day-to-day activities like migrations and support to the DEV, TEST and PROD environments."
good,"Guaranteed customer service"
good,Very busy environment year round. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication and zero accountability.
good,"a typical day at westin started with taking water up to the floors that i was assigned to, through out the day i take calls to deliver supplies to the housekeepers on my assigned floors. i would take the trash and recyclables out and clean the main areas of my floors, by vacuuming the floors, cleaning up the main traffic areas. Some days i would work in the laundry area, there i would load and unload the washers and dryers, and fold the linens."
good,A typical day at the Marriott is somewhat productive because some days are slow. I like when we have large groups staying because then i know there will never be a dull moment and i will always be busy. My co workers are great! Very caring and always willing to help. Management is not horrible but could absolutely be much better. They go above and beyond for guests but not nearly for their own staff. The hardest part of the job i would say is feeling confident in what i do but the most enjoyable is reassurance from guests through the positive feedback
good,"Love working with co-workers, great atmosphere to work in platinum members, stay a lot so you get to know them individually and create  a bond. Fun times and professional at the same time.Managers are caring and help in every way."
good,The associates at this location were great and the only thing keeping the Marriott flag flying. Ever since the new GM came over from Hyatt and brought his people in the morale went down the toilet and there is no respect or appreciation for anyone other than his ex Hyatt people. Many of them are ineffective and inexperienced in their jobs and they make this location feel like a sinking Titanic. Wouldn't reccomend this location to anyone. The GM and his team care about nothing more than themselves and it shows. A bunch of rude phony people.
good,"This hotel was low on staff, for this reason they toughs you right into the fire and with out any job training put you to work by yourself. Management doesn't help you with sorting things out. It more or less self management."
good,"This company offers a handful of benefits. Co-workers are great, and  you will always learn something new! A typical workday is consistent"
good,The General Manager was very fun to work with.  He gave plenty of room for employees to grow and expand their knowledge. He knew every employee by their first name and walked around frequently to see how everyone's day was going.
good,"I loved working for the hotel. However, it more a convenient job while I was in school. Once I completed my studies, I had to leave for a full time position with more money and regular schedule."
good,"Good place to work. Everyone is friendly. Lots of hotel competition in downtown Denver, so business isn't always booming."
good,"The Starwood Hotels and Resorts call various call centers welcomes an overwhelming number of new hires every month, with a class of near thirty new recruits walking through the door every other week. One would fantasize that these open positions are due to upward movement within the company, however, the fact is that most employees only last a small handful of months before being terminated for various reasons. The culture of the company itself is amazing, and has a ""you can do anything, go anywhere,"" sort of vibe while working, but the management is often absent or unhelpful and it seems as if the company relies on the zealousness of the new hired to keep its head above the water."
good,"Great place to work, friendly people and a positive work environment. there is no hard part to the job. its a full service setting and great experience. Human Resources is awesome!"
good,"I worked for Marriott years ago, before the ""online"" application process. I worked for them again and made several attempts to transfer without success. Here is the issue. A ""transfer"" isn't a ""transfer"" on the employees part. You have to apply for a new or even the SAME position all over again. You interview like your a ""new"" employee and are treated as such. No follow up or feedback! They also use a ""recruiter"" who forwards the applications to the hiring managers. The ""test"" you take to see if your match is ok if you test well. Some people don't so they may be missing out on good candidates. "
good,I'm hard work good skills of cleaning rooming and work in college community of Philadelphia pa job:the mailroom and good with artwork and going to school ITT TECH  college of Philadelphia
good,"Pretty slow days, didn't really learn anything different from my previous jobs as a front desk agent. Managers were nice and love my co-workers."
good,"The management was very professional as well as helpful in training. All of the other employees were helpful and fun to work with. I learned to interact with guests, problem solve, and communicate well over the phone with guests. The hardest part of the job was dealing with specific guest issues at certain times. The most enjoyable part was working with others and interacting with people on a daily basis."
good,No comments..I learned a lot from this place. I enjoyed working with my colleagues but not worth it when it comes to money matters.
good,This hotel can be an awesome place to work for. For someone just getting started in the hotel industry. There are many departments that you can choose from and they most higher internally. An if in the right department you can be promoted.
good,"My job consisted of taking care of account recievable and payable as far as the direct bill was concerned,working front desk, checking customers in/out of the hotel. Doing hospitality for breakfast and dinner."
good,"-Im a part of corporate sales team ."
good,"information about the job Is not provided fully"
good,"We would interact with all different kinds of guests everyday from all over the world. It was always interesting to meet new people. We are always busy, so there was never time to be bored. I learned how to be organized, structure and how to lead my shift. My coworkers are all fun and genuinely kind. The hardest part of is when a guest gets angry and yells at you. Unfortunately, the hotel is located between the 405 and 101 fwy. There are always complaints about noise and we always get yelled at everyday. It's not easy keeping it together while getting yelled at everyday. The best part is working with my team and getting to know knew people. You never know who you'll end up meeting on a random day."
good,"Durante os quase três anos de  trabalho nesse hotel, eu aprendi a lidar com pessoas de diferentes culturas e nacionalidades."
good,"On average, my work day consists of answering between 50-100 calls from all over the world. I've experienced working in an office setting and from home as well, primarily interacting with coworkers through email, Microsoft Lync, and participating in multiple conference calls and trainings. I would say the hardest part of the job is handling escalated client interactions, but I do think of them as learning experiences and find new ways to deal with these issues. The most enjoyable part of the job would be hearing the excitement in a guests voice when a call goes smoothly and you've extended all your positive resources to make a memorable experience."
good,Excellent working experience with Hashoo Group. Learned a lot from highly professional management. On job training of employees and train them how meet the deadlines and time management. learned how to lead your team to meet the over all objective of the organization.
good,I expected to still be working but I had an on the job work injury which caused a lot of my hours to be cut and than I got fired .
good,to many meeting not enough time to trained personel. to many cut on staff with expextation of the same result. to many peoples micro managing
good,"I did security, it was a fun job to do. I work third shift I would lock down the place at night and open it up in the morning. Had to deal with a few drunk once in a blue."
good,Working here was part of my work placement therefore i was not paid. I had to opportunity to work in three different kitchens which was great experience. Due to the clash of different personalities the warm and welcoming environment was not there. However as its a high star hotel and constantly busy its understandable.
good,This place is where I learned a lot and I know that everything I learned will be useful in my future endeavors.
good,"Easy work, sometimes stressful due to high volume, management can be unfair and very political. Coworkers are great, and the pay is good. The insurance benefits are too expensive."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"12 hour shifts treating ill or injured patients in a clinic environment, working alongside nurses and a doctor providing a high level of care for each and every patient, good place to work, great team."
good,A typical day at work is low on staff which leaves the ones there to work harder. What I have learned is if you show you can do something 100% that is above your pay rate they will keep using you sometimes without promotion or recognition. My co-workers are awesome and we work well together but the problem will always be the disconnect from management.
good,The days there was long and stressful and very time consuming you really can't have a personal life there cause the job is demanding and depend on who you're working with it will be a long day
good,the job varied from day to day most days I spent my time turning over dirty rooms other days I inspected others performance in the rooms they turned over. management was hypocritical but good. my co workers were just that co workers. Hardest part of the job was preparing for the busiest day of the week sunday where you were likely to get there at 9 and not leave until 7 or eight in the evening. The thing I loved most about the job were the guest talking with them and ensuring that I did the best I could to help them through to the next day.
good,At typical day at the Marriott is very fast paced. It is essential to be able to multitask; from screening calls to handling guest needs it is very important to be able to manage multiple tasks.  While there are instances where guest are upset it is a priority to fix every problem and make sure each guest is happy and leaves with a smile on their face. My co-workers are great people and they are very easy to work with.
good,"Se trabaja bien, agusto."
good,The thing about it was management played favorites and those people didnt have to work as hard.
good,"-mon - sun schedule"
good,"I use to have every day more than 500 cover for lunch and dinner "
good,"es tranquilo, por lo regular la regla base es que debes ser amable hasta con los asociados, lo cual te hace no tener problemas con los demas."
good,"This was my first job out of culinary school and I came into a very chaotic environment and the reality of a large commercial kitchen, something that culinary school did not prepare me for.  I was given many opportunities to do more than many people that were there much longer.  Some of the managers were very challenging to work with.  I was never treated poorly, but many were.  There were never enough people scheduled for the amount of work to be completed in the hours we had available.  I learned a great deal about what I want and do not want in a job."
good,Five supervisors in one year's time.  I loved the job but it was too difficult to get anything done with a new supervisor coming when you least expect it.
good,"In a typical day, we get a list of rooms to do for the day. We have a certain amount of rooms to do in a time frame. We have a supervisor that will look back into he rooms to make sure that the rooms are up to standards. I learned how to be a supervisor, housekeeper, laundry worker, and a houseman during the time I have worked there. In my opinion, the management needs more work. The days that I work, the management doesn't seem to do anything or they make others do their job for them. I like my co-workers. Most of which are family or friends. They care about one another. The hardest part of the job is the manual labor that is expected to undergo everyday. Sometimes for over eight hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers that I talk to everyday."
good,Good travel and people experiences from all over the world!
good,"Typical workday is a few meeting everyday -- you need the contact with others."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people and spending time developing them as well as myself. All of my co workers on second shift were enjoyable to be around, this created a happy environment.My most enjoyable part of the job; was training the employees and engaging with  our guests. The hardest part of the job, was enforcing the standard operating procedures."
good,"Lots of room for growth and advancement, you just need to be in love with the industry.  If you do not like the hospitality industry, it becomes a dead end job"
good,"-Fun place to work, but staff is often short-handed and work can quickly pile up.  "
good,"a typical day at work is a very stressful, busy day."
good,"There is never a dull moment working in the hospitality business. I have learned to have empathy for people and that a positive attitude goes a long way. Management is fairly easy to speak to about concerns in the workplace however, they are not so efficient on attending to those problems. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the public on a daily basis that can be quite draining. The hardest part of the job can be the most gratifying part of the job as well when you make a difference in the guests experience visiting the area."
good,Gran Compañía hotelera con buenas oportunidades de promocionar a puestos superiores.
good,"Una muy grata experiencia, buenos compañeros de trabajo, un lugar muy cómodo para trabajar justo enfrente de la playa, estabilidad laboral"
good,with this company u can get a chance for picnic and marriott points but in this company a lots of work here so u cantable to do this minimum 11 hrs and max 18 hrs
good,Marriott is great. It is a bit behind the times regarding social media.
good,"as a first job and being very young it was all exciting being new. would keep to a tight schedule to get rooms cleaned on time, very friendly place to work"
good,"A typical week at Marriott is unpredictable! I love anticipating the needs of each ""discoverer"" that stays at the hotel. I've been learning a lot about navigating computers systems, the down town area and ensuring guest satisfaction. However, the hardest part about my job is the unpredictable nature when it comes to occupancy which directly effects work hours. My schedule each week is different and often doesn't meet the minimal standards of full time hours. I am the financial supporter of my family and am looking for more security and opportunities for growth!"
good,Loved the atmosphere with my co-workers and hotel guests. Each day was a learning experience 
good,Enjoyed the 20 plus years i worked with Marriott however ran into a hotel that didn't work out for me.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo con algunas fallas administrativas, insumos no del todo de la mejor calidad, pero con buen uso. "
good,great job love the people learned alot fast pace good mgt.the best part is seeing the guest happy
good,"The moment you arrive on shift at 6:30am high stress lots of action until 11am then job slows way down till about 2:30-3pm. Really didnt like that, had to find a way to keep busy. Cleaned the drive and front of hotel area. The hotel is located in a business park so most of the guests were Chevron world headquarter employees. the days i really enjoyed would be the days we held events in our massive ballrooms. those days you would be busy your entire shift and it was fun. Drove many hundred thousand dollar vehicles and the tips were good. "
good,"taking order & room delivery is my regular work"
good,"Mostly I start work for dinner service. We are working in teams of 4 and we are serving to 6 tables . We serve  the starter , maincourse,desert and coffee. I have learned how to serve silver service and plated service . Also i learned how to serve drinks ."
good,A typical day at work- busy
good,A very fast phase environment. Meeting lots of new people and offering customer service to them.
good,I was very excited to work for Marriott and I thought it was going to be great for my career. It turns out that if management does not like you you will have a hard time advancing.
good,A typical day from me was blowing the boiler down checking the chiller taking rooom calls I learn alot how to go about things how to prepair myself how to fix appliances how to deal with the guest management I learn two management my work detail and my time my co worker some work harder than other and some took it easy the hardest part of my job was getting help when you need it the most enjoyable of my job was helping a guest with a problem and fixing it and seening a smile on his or her face that made my day every time
good,"Good place to work if you like smaller hotels. Its always busy so employees are usually guaranteed hours and pretty good money. From the opening, management is focused only on the profit margin. I see this often and often at the expense of guest service."
good,"As a customer I have always enjoyed the hospitality industry. I love to travel see new places, stay at hotel and dine out. After my job in an office setting I wanted to give the hospitality industry a shot. I came to realize I appreciate the industry more as s consumer of the services. I believe a specific person is right for these types of job that require patients and understanding for the demand of the customer service and hours. I am happy that I got to explore this side of the industry."
good,"poor compensation, good company values, my location is privately owned, overall good company, private much different from corporation, would recommend corporate"
good,"Well i enjoyed working for this company at sometimes as a housekeeper yes it can be overwelming but i enjoy doing something im good at i worked a 8 hour shift throughout the week weekends are the days you will have to be ready for because the hotel is very busy.I learned to communicate with people,make them feel like there at home i also learned how to be detail-oriented.All my coworkers were hardworkers,friendly,outgoing,we were like a big family we were teamplayers.The hardest part to me was when i first started you have a certain amount of time to have the room cleaned and alot of things to do in that 1 room so that was pretty challengeing for me but i got the hang of it.I enjoyed meeting all the people i met working there helping others to make them feel like ther home while there working."
good,"Helpfull, customer services all the time!...If Icould go back I would like more pay."
good,At this job I was constantly meeting people and had to provide great customer service. I also helped with training and had to cross train on multiple positions. The co-workers were great to work with.
good,"I was first employed with Marriott on a full time basis but am currently employed on a limited part time basis. The company offers good benefits, has a professional management staff, provides bonuses and free lunches periodically. Employees are treated with respect."
good,Just an awful experience working for Marriott. I loved the rest of the people that worked there but had many problems with my department and most came from the manager.
good,I would have liked to keep this job but was unable to because of threats by another employee from another department. Personell was unable to get witnesses.
good,"Loved my job. Everyday routine of daily billing, accounting, upfront customer service, phone service operator. Strict rules but very rewarding. General Manager truely believed the ""customer is always right"". But did not back up her hard working, dedicated employees."
good,I enjoy working at marriott the pay does not cover my cost of living. Marriott does not challenge my abilities and makes for a boring day
good,Helped in every department - took care of the sales part of the hotel business
good,"I spent almost a year at the Marriott, I started in a full-time position and later went to part time due to slow season. I learned a lot about balancing time with work and to achieve things swiftly to ensure the guests were taken care of when needed or demanded."
good,"Great environment good people to work with stay to yourself come to work do your job cut alot of hours, great at giving back to the community and the company."
good,They could pay a little more. The management was helpful ABC's reasonable . The uniforms and work environment  are hot especially in the food and beverage dept. .es
good,Plenty of opportunities. Great benefits for individuals and families. Ever expanding company with limitless possibility. Happy I was able to leave and come back 6 months later.
good,"Я работаю в компании Марриот уже 1.5 года,в отделе службы безопасности, шикарное руководство СБ,делает все что возможно для своих сотрудников,но увы заработная плата настолько низкая и не оправданная что опускаются руки....."
good,Been with the company for 5 years . Easy job able to move around in the company and also has a few benefits . Definitely a good place to work at !!!!!!
good,"Some employees were a pain to work with just made it more difficult to work. Besides that, the rest of staff was great & helpful. Company in general is awesome had great benefits(depending on property). Pay was okay but could have been better for the work and stress levels you deal with. Would definitely recommend to work for company in general."
good,"Great training class, technical issues once home employed. The trainers are amazing and depending on your manager you will love the job. Wish everyone luck in the future!"
good,"For me while being in college, this job is a great source of experience to work with different people coming from extremely diverse background, interact with them and get to know them. I work part-time during weekends up to 25 hours a week. However, they are very watchful for the full time employees not to get overtime. Definitely not a job to see your future with. Coworkers are fun."
good,Amazing place to work because you are constantly meeting new people from all over the world. The salary was very competitive and always chances from moving up and raises.
good,"People work here their entire careers, with work life balance being a priority. "
good,on a day to day I do my audit side of things as well as front desk agent duties. managers could be a bit more personal. My manager who went back to her old property didnt even say or make it a point to say good bye in an email or say that we would still have her support which she never showed.
good,"Very organize, team work, well understood organization, good benefit, good incentive program, flexible job placement and easy access complimentary room availability"
good,"My experience at Marriott was pretty good, I cannot really complain. I enjoyed working there with people from different origins and background.  I really had a good experience."
good,"Could be a good place for career beginners. Again, sales & marketing are better departments salary wise, culture wise and exposure wise. other depts are like any other organization in my opinion."
good,There where always opportunities to learn and grow with this company. I was able to move around to several positions in different departments during my time here.  I was always given a chance to advance.
good,"Overall its a very fun job, but there is not any room for advancement in my department. I enjoy being the around the people i work with and they are great people."
good,"Over this period, I worked in Garde Manger section of the kitchen, made salads, sandwiches, wraps, fruit cups, fruit & other displays, fruit yogurts, plate-ups and BEO orders and did prep work. I also made sure that the plates looked presentable and cleaned the kitchen. "
good,I am happy that I got golden opportunity and right plateform to start my career. I leant a lot and I am taking a lot of leanings and experience from here . I am having my best memories.
good,"everybody works hard and everybody gets the job done and etc. great work areas, nice lobby, great hotel rooms. great designs around the building. Great people"
good,"It is a great place to work if you have an interest in the hospitality industry. It is an international company that is well known and respected. Unfortunately I studied psychology and is in grad school for MSW clinical practice, so I need to move on."
good,Good place nice environment great benefits good food good schedule and flexible lots of hours just not to much option for advancement unless you have a degree or education.
good,"I have learned a lot in the job I currently hold. Like paying bills, balancing the check book, managing authorization forms and making sure al of the requests of the guests in house are fulfilled. Not only that but those guests coming and those that have already left. It is a lot to juggle from making coffees, handling two phone lines, paying bills, guest complaints, unpacking and packing packages, re-stocking the market and keeping inventory of all of our items, ordering all of the office supplies. The job becomes even more difficult and stressful when I don't have the support of my team. Because of hospitality being very family like managers tend to turn a blind eye to the lack of support and lack of work needed from certain employees. The guest suffer, the operations suffer and the whole status of the hotel suffers when employees are not help up to the standards of work that they should be giving and by far the worst thing about Marriott is the pay, they pay nothing to their employees and I am ridiculously underpaid for the amount of work I put in and everything I do. Entry level pay at Marriott is a joke and if you are applying for entry level learn what you have to learn in your first six months and run. I can't maintain myself on that salary not even to pay one bill."
good,It was quick paced and a job for those who love to talk on the phones all day there were very few dead moments. It was a lively place with all kinds of people calling in many making simple or easy to handle tasks while some wanted the impossible.
good,I enjoyed working for this company especially with the hotel discount benefits that I treated my family and I to when we had time. Unfortunately I couldn't work there for much longer due to my health injuries.
good,"A good place to work in the city, very busy during weekends. Friendly management with good workplace culture. Good benefits and a fantastic team! The hardest part of the job was the overnight shift rotation."
good,"Not much opportunity to grow, always an excuse even when you are most interested only certain people will get the opportunities without even requesting it. Even when the most effort is out as an individual might not be enough."
good,Marriott is a great company but has undergone some changes in the past two years. It is growing a lot and overall is a good company to work for. They are also very socially an environmentally conscious.
good,I love working with team and learning new stuff from my coworkers such as cultures . the hardest part at job is when I don't  know the environment  of my work place . the most enjoyable part at work will be friendly  understanding one other.
good,"I like working as a housekeeper at a hotel, you meet new people everyday from different places all around the world, working in a hotel you see different types of things and you never know what your day is in for."
good,It's easy and relaxed base with a variety of calls and guest generated through the day with some great co-workers. Managers have good intentions to their employees
good,"Competive environment with potential growth. Lots of areas to train in such as front of house, restaurant and housekeeping. Very large resort and multiple brands to evolve in."
good,I don’t have much to say but I would appreciate the opportunity to work for Marriott . It’s a pleasure to work for such a nice company. Looking forward towards it
good,Estoy súper contento en la compañía y en el hotel me gusta mi orario solo q el clima ya no  tanto quiero algo tropical es por eso q quiero cambiarme a Florida
good,"JW Marriott Grande lakes overall was a great place to work for. Benefits and pay are great. Co-workers are great as well. Management was terrible though. They were more concerned about what the employees were doing that actually caring for the guests. Beside poor management, Marriott is a great company to work for"
good,"Work place culture is great"
good,"As an intern, I learned something new everyday. The employees were kind and welcoming. I enjoyed learning the new recipes and their techniques to southern cooking. The hours were long but it was a fun working environment."
good,IT WS AN OK COMPANY TO WORK FOR. I could've done without the management. The hotel in general was very discriminative and prejudice towards customers and employees.
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. I respect what the company stands for. The main issue that makes working with the company was consistency with management.
good,"very busy job, lots of A/R cleanup.  The people were really nice to work for and with.  You can't move up in the company unless you have a BA in Accounting."
good,It's a good place to work but pays too little. Talking to guest and trying to resolve issues or taking care of their need is fulfilling. They work with my hours as much is possible.
good,Benefits and discounts offered to employees are great. Coworkers are friendly and the guests are usually pleasant to deal with. Management can be high strung due to lack of staff. over all a good place to work
good,High paced work environment. Very nice hotel.  Upper management made it difficult to  reach potential.  I learned a lot about the manager I wanted to be.
good,Bedding  cleaning the TV wiping the door the jilousy vacuuming. Changing the. Amminities  towels bath mat  wash cloths  clining the furniture  dusting. Clining the wire the light  in  be  good to the customer
good,"I was very good in my work and responsibility but the salary and management was not good, in Lapita by Marriott."
good,"Houston, TX - "
good,"Trabajar en el Hotel Marriott Aguascalientes fue una experiencia bastante satisfactoria ya que a una corta edad logre madurar en un entorno de arduo trabajo. Mi estancia en esta empresa fue muy satisfactoria dejando una muy buena imagen y desempeño durante el tiempo que labore, serví al cliente y diriguí un grande equipo de trabajo"
good,Working with  this job was a fun work environment for  me but the work got slow I wish I could go back I learn a lot bout coking at this job and met some great people
good,"A typical day is building sales leads and communicating with your sales leaders. Entering anything they need into the system along with doing any research or organization as needed. I learned organization and communication on a professional level along with sales related experiences. I learned new programs that contribute to the sales process. If you are not already in a management role then you must go through as an admin first then you're eligible for a sales manager role and have guides and assistance to get you there if that is your goal. Sales managers do not get commission. The additional compensation comes from overtime hours. They do give you all the tools you need to become a sales manager. 1 hour lunch breaks and ways to ease the stresses of the day. Workplace culture is friendly but when you're too busy then sometimes it's non existent. Like any workplace. Unless you manage your time well, you'll be on the phone or on the computer. Hardest part of the job depends on the person. Some is organization and others are communication etc. Some days you really don't move from your desk and if you're okay with office hours, then this job is for you. Some paid holidays and weekends off. The most enjoyable part of the job are the connections that you'll be making with all kinds of great people and if you really love sales, you'll be learning a lot of skills and best practices within the hotel management industry."
good,"Nice area, property needs an update. "
good,"Not a bad company to work but much like most hospitality companies you have to be willing to work stressful hours and deal with all kinds of different people. Management/Supervisor may be your biggest problem but if you and your manager(s) can come to a mutual work understanding you will do fine. The turnover rate is extremely high because most employees leave within a few months because they are treated poorly. GREAT BENEFITS however, you get extremely low rates for employee stays around the world!"
good,The ST Regis Hotel is a great environment to work at!. You meet a lot of great people and learn a lot of new things. There are a lot of different aspects that you can take into hospitality that you learn here at Saint Regis. They just don't know how to pay a good salary for how hard they work you.
good,"awesome co-workers,i had great hours and i had fun working as a team."
good,"Management there was amazing, the job itself wasn't much fun though.  Consistent hours but hard to get time off.  Good starting pay and does not require any experience."
good,"It was a nice job, my co workers were also great to work with. The hardest part of my job was accounts receiving for three properties, my most enjoyable part of my job was accomplishing all the work that was required in the eight hour work shift."
good,Ser puntual en hoteles siempre es importante ser muy puntual para tener las habitaciones lista para los clientes
good,"Great place to work, new Director of Operations is making much needed changes....looking forward to what lies ahead. A typical day starts early and ends between 2-3 pm. Co-workers are great. Most enjoyable part of the job are the hours."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajos y muy buen compañerismo, se aprende mucho y de muy buena forma."
good,"Constantly having to find out where the manager has walked off to, dealing with others ""favoring"" over others.  You don't get paid enough for everything you do.  Most enjoyable thing was guests telling you how much they appreciate your help."
good,"Overall, I love my job and my daily responsibilities. However, the hourly rate doesn't meet my needs and there isn't any benefits that comes with the job besides discount on hotel rooms"
good,"The only thing that kept me going each day was the people I worked with. Front line management was great! Their managers however did not seem to want to do much as far as making today better than yesterday. Was recieving the same guest feedback during my entire duration employees there and did not see the least bit of change to improve. Housekeeping team had a hard time keeping up with the pace the front desk moved at, causing guests to have to wait for rooms well after check in time."
good,The hospitality career is a very friendly reception and treatment of guests and/or strangers you treat as your friends and hosting them at your home/hotel. It is 8 - 10 hours on your feet per day. Your coworkers become your family and friends while keeping it professional. The hardest part is keeping everyone happy and the feeling of responsibility that you have toward all your guest and coworkers. It is very stressful and demanding as a guest care manager being on call 24-hours because the business never closes. the most enjoyable part is when someone tell you that they appreciate what you do.
good,"It was nice. The people are kind, and it was good to work my fellow porters. Sometimes was hard to manage your time on a very busy day."
good,"Marriott International "
good,"On a typical day I work with Fax, multi-line telephone calls, sales, banquets, schedules, Excel, Microsoft Word, Spreadsheets"
good,My days would start at 5:30am and end between 2-3pm. Some days when it was busy I would be there till 5pm the latest. I've learned many stations while working here. My co-workers were very nice and helpful. Management can be helpful at times when they weren't busy. The hardest part of the job was when I would be by myself setting up for banquets. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing the customers were happy and enjoyed the food that I made for them.
good,"the work is really good not too hard, sometimes can get busy and other times theres hardly anything to do. i have learnt alot about the different branding in starwood hotels. management is absolutely awful. no one has a clue what they are doing."
good,great company amazing people great place to learn....great ambiance...opportunities are available....great management
good,Everyday I would count my draws of cash at the beginning and end of my shift. Throughout the shift I would interact with my coworkers about various problems within the hotel. Each guest I interacted I would try and be professional and personable trying to help them while also trying to befriend them as much as possible.
good,"Pros lunch breaks, free food for every shift, travel benefits with the hotels, chances to win prizes sometimes, free coffee"
good,"I have the best people to work with. I have learned a lot about the hotel industry. As well loving to see new faces. My management has  a lot of growing to do. Mainly, because  they do not communicate well."
good,"es una empresa que sabe gestionarla muy bien, muchas facilidades para el trabajador para realizar cursos gratuitos y una empresa donde se puede promocionar por diferentes departamentos, pero el sueldo es muy bajito."
good,l'ambiance est agréable tant comme les clients et employées.
good,"Great pay, training sucks though, they favorite line is fake it to you make::even with their employee. They laugh and say keep it real but talk behind your back,everyone is sneaky!!"
good,"On are computers we had our own instant message account were we could talk to management if we were on the phone having an issue or they had something they needed to tell us. We also could talk to co-workers on it as well if it was a small questioned we needed answered. I like bye computer you could be on a phone call with someone booking a hotel and if your lunch break was about to start you would hit a key so that no more calls came in after the one you were working on.  I did not like however people calling in complaining about other hotel sites that had cheaper rates and we could not get into why the other hotel rates were cheaper.  I thought it wasn't realistic for us to be booking nine out of ten phone calls. I would book on average seven out of ten and keep my phone time around three minutes. The most enjoyable part was helping people who really wanted to go away but had little money for hotel prices. I would search the area they were interested in for example, Florida near Disney world and see if they had triple A or worked for a certain corporation to find them a discount.  We represented nine different hotel chains. I also liked I could email a hotel telling them it was important the family had a crib if they needed one, or a handicap accessible room. My favorite was someone calling to cancel and me actually help them find a better rate to keep the reservation because things our constantly changing in the hospitality business. I learned to multitask well. I would be in Rehoboth, MA talking to a client and I would be googling them directions on how to get to a certain"
good,I had a pleasant work experience while at the Marriott .people were friendly and my superviser was a very helpful person.I learned  a lot about line cooking and catering. The hardest part of the job was creating new dishes on the menus.
good,"have to memories the brand standard every day,5 feet,eye contact,smile,say good morning/evening when past any guest,say sorry even do its customer fault,do not let customer to wait,make them happy."
good,I had a chance to use my Business strategic development skillset to make a lot of influential decisions for their technology and company
good,cleaned 16 rooms aday good teamwork i learned good role playing here
good,I enjoy my work while I'm working with my staff.I learnt how to achieve the targets and to increase the sales as well as how to work for long hours.
good,Basically good place to work. Most of management empathic. Great place to meet all walks of life. Guest flow choppy at times.
good,"	Managed all Direct Billing"
good,A typical day was arriving at 5am ready to greet my guests and co workers. I was a supervisor of the kitchen. I enjoyed learning how to balance being a supervisor to my peers and having a great relationship with them as well. Hardest part at the beginning was being a chef I have never done b.before but I jumped right in as needed. The most enjoyable was trying something new an succeeding in it. Dealing with the public on a day to day bases.
good,great company to work for. great director.  great benefits.  good experience and pay.  excellent education.
good,great industry to gain management experience. lots of room for advancement
good,"Respond promptly to customer complaints.  Communicate and coordinate with internal departments.    Research and resolve guest concerns and problems relating to reservations, rates, hotels, and billing issues.  Follow up on customer interactions.  Distribute hotel and local area information."
good,"Typical day of work began by arriving at 12:00pm and setting up bar which consisted of pulling out bottles every night, cutting fruit, filling Ice every couple of hours restocking bar at beginning of shift and 4 times a day, setting up cash bank and logging into micros before beginning my shift.  During shift I was responsible for tending to guest needs such as taking orders, logging them into micros, checking on food when ready, serving food and bussing tables and of coarse Pouring Alcoholic beverages.  I ran a full service bar in a very busy hotel with very little support from management and ran it successfully and efficiently.  My shift went from 12:00 noon to 1:00 am 5 days a week.  I got along with my coworkers so much that we became family over the years.  All the people I work with including my references I still communicate with on a weekly basis.  The hardest part of my job was the running of food due to the distance of the kitchen from the bar.  With no assistance of a bar back or a food runner, at times, definitely slowed down ticket times and service times at the bar.  The most enjoyable part of my job had to be the diversity of the guests.  I am very much a people person and dealing with different personalities on a regular basis is very enjoyable to me.  Being able to turn a frown upside down, as cheesy as that sounds, at times may be difficult but when it happens it is very satisfying and developed several relationships with guests who stayed at the hotel regularly.  The best thing that came from this employment was that I learned to run and manage my bar as I"
good,"very high end spa"
good,"Your career at Marriott is what you make of it.  There are plenty of advancement opportunities and plenty of resources to take you there.  Management is your greatest supporter, if you have poor management who does not take personal interest in your professional career, then you must take it upon yourself to move forward and up.  Many of my coworkers have transferred between departments and some have transferred to other properties.  I would highly suggest sociable persons who love to cater and enjoy providing hospitality service to start your career at Marriott.  I appreciate Marriott's vision and I am a huge fan of their standards of service. Marriott takes care of the associate so that the associates can take care of the guests.  It is a tough business and you learn to handle and deal with all types of people from all over the world.  It is a great place to start off even if you are not pursuing a career in the hospitality industry."
good,"i hard did notwork in the    hotel before i only work in serena hotels in mombasa kenya i learned more on how to work with workmates,the management was good,the hardest part is when no corperation,the enjoyable is when we coperate"
good,I worked in the sales office which was pretty quiet but a nice environment. I assisted all sales managers with various projects. Answered all calls that came to sales office. Met with customers who were planning events. Completed daily reports for managers.
good,"If you've worked in an office, you already know what it's like here.  "
good,"Always busy, every day different due to guests. Management very"
good,Busy call center. Laid back environment. Great benefits awesome incentives and perks.
good,I enjoyed working at this company to the end. I have met and formed lifetime friendships
good,Co-workers and guest made job. Had opportunity to learn different positions.
good,"I enjoyed working at TownePlace Suites. It is a job I have worked at while attending college. It is tough to advance because there is such a small staff that someone has to leave to move up and there are only 2 managers. The compensation was low but in comparison to the market, its average if not a little low."
good,great company to work for.if i didnt move out of state would haved of stayed.
good,"Fast paced environment, bigger hotel with a lot of employees. Nice people, great cafeteria and locker area for belongings."
good,"Fosse is the system I work with at the desk and it can be very challenging at times. But I learn new things everyday about it. A typical day at work for me is normally very busy with checking guests in, answering phone calls, faxing and emailing receipts, and making reservations. What I enjoy the most is interacting with the guest face to face. I enjoy listening to what their issue or concern is and then doing my best to get them what they need. My co-workers are team players all the time even when the job gets tough. I don't believe there is anything hard about my job. Yes it can be challenging at times but I'm a person that continuously goes until I get it right especially when learning new things."
good,"On a regular day I would have to work in teams, and set up coffee breaks, keep a clean, and safe environment. Here I worked with banquets and I served food and picked up plates, and answered all guest requests. The most enjoyable part of my job was to see overall happiness on a guest face."
good,Cleaning and organizing guest rooms and residences; Preparing linens;Providing service to occupants
good,Marriott has amazing hotels. Running a hotel definately has its up and downs. You get to meet all kinds of travelers and have the ability to make all kinds of connections.
good,I would come into work not meeting with anyone. Handle the remaining reservations for the evening and perform audit. i would then go to the laundry room wash dry and fold laundry for the remainder of the shift. I learned housekeeping skills while working overnight. Managment and night audit very rarely ran into one another at the hotel. Lack of communication with coworkers simply because I worked the late night shift. There was nothing hard about the job in terms of work. My most difficult part of the job was managing a balance with management in terms of my schedule being that I was in school.
good,I was hired by the executive chef. The day I started he was no longer with the company. He was fire before I had the chance to work with him.The executive sous chef ran the kitchens. Good chef and man.
good,It was fun at work and all the employees were very nice. There was times when it was very hectic when i had alot of room to clean.
good,was always fun to go to work for marriott. our managers were always looking out for the employees and thinking of different ways to gain incentives for employees
good,"The working environment is good. You can use the facilities after work. The benefit is pretty good too. You have sick time, personal time and vacation time. Just some of the coworkers wasn't that nice which cause quite a lot of pressure."
good,"Good job with great growth potential and good benefits, worked long hours as a manager. i love the job and it is ideal for me being as i am an extrovert and gain energy from being around the public."
good,"The management team was slight lazy,but it was okay...a lot of he say she say things going on,always understaffed. Everybody doing every else job..underpaid...."
good,"To them, you were the least important. They would lie or do whatever to make themselves look good. We had a new chef who was overly cocky and did not attempt to build relationships with any of us. She was always ""Fing"" up and blamed us for her mistakes."
good,Overall the work environment was great. Not too stressful although the company communication was lacking. This could make it hard to perform some job functions and be knowledgeable to customers.
good,"Very great company to work for. Mangers was always helping and giving you more knowledge . Gained a lot of long term friends, Really great work environment."
good,"Stressful, eventful, fun. You had to be well prepared mentally for the front desk. Keep a positive attitude and always remember that you leave the way you came in because you did not have to take any with you"
good,"Marriott International, Inc. that I worked for was a Private Sector maybe different from other Marriott International, Inc, from what I learned they'd prefer to work for. Private Sector isn't great to work for."
good,"All new employees must be hired by HR department, which takes a month: good luck staffing your department. P.O.S. system is MICROS. No IT on site at all. Ownership is squeezing every last dime out of property while delaying renovation as long as possible."
good,"Productive and fun and miss some of the co workers.Got free meals after food was severed.Had set stlye of clothes to be worn such as black shoes,black slacks,and hotel jacket"
good,The hotel is nice n huge and provide some of the best benefits in the market. they have good incentives as well. supportive staff and management. a good place to join.
good,"Fast-paced, understaffed work environment"
good,"When hotel is slow. Less hours. "
good,"Working as a server at the Marriott can be pretty stressful because you do not know what time you will ever go home. Its a hotel, so people could be in the restaurant until 11:30. . ."
good,"Very nice work culture, nice accommodation, good staff food good colleagues, very less pay,slow growth,high living cost, no time for personal life.long working hours"
good,"i gained a lot of work experience, i had a wonderful and very helpful managers. i loved the work atmosphere and always had good interactions with my co-workers. the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers"
good,"With performance a team member can quickly advance. Great training program, very  thorough. Great discounts to experience the products. Fun workplace with a lot of opportunities to participate in special projects in the community."
good,i work fast when its not very messy dedicated. people always told me im very mature even when i was young. and since i had my oldest i go in on my job not gonna let no one hold me back. just need someone to believe in me. and give me a chance.
good,It was a fair job I liked it . But sometimes the manager feels like she can over power anyone. The work resolve should be stress free not stress added
good,Mejorar el.lavado de prendas en lavandería al igual que costuras
good,"Notre environnement ou je travaille est excellente et tout le monde travail en harmonie !"
good,"I worked at 2 different locations. First one in Louisiana and second in SW Florida. Overall a great company to work for. Employees are all great and we become a small family. Florida is a little more intense. Overall if you have good customer service, organized and can multitask- you can do this job under good management. If you work hard and in the right area, you can easily move up within the company."
good,"I am currently working for Marriott international, I really like the staff and working in a multicultural environment, but in the english line i receive around 80 calls per day, which i believe its to much."
good,Taking calls and making reservations. Also handling escalated calls with customers who didn't get what they wanted or was not pleased with the stay at one of the hotels.
good,Merger is a bit complicated but overall morale is high. Organizational structure and functional responsibilities are rather confusing and under continued change.
good,"N/A as of yet because I have only just begun, but started out making less than what I started in the same position in another city.  Looking for my next opportunity."
good,same as the Sheraton BWI same company.............. I am not sure what else to say its the same. there is not much more its exactly the same as my sister property
good,A place that applies Marriott culture as it should. Taking care of employees and guests. The place has a great team spirit and a culture of celebrating success.
good,It's a fast paced environment and you need to be organized and on top of all the programs. The challenge is sitting and taking phone calls for close to 10 hours a day.
good,"This is not information I choose to share with a website."
good,Too crazy due to size. The staff is very nice! Hard to advance due to size and how critical management is. The property is old should be renovated soon to prevent future complaints. Food and Beverage needs work!
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the residence. What I learned at this job was to stay focused on the task at hand. The management was Great!!! The workplace culture was adaptable , became difficult to adapt to later on , only speaking one language.The hardest part of the job was cleaning the Penthouses ,and presenting them on time. The most enjoyable part of my job was when my rooms were completed i could sometimes clock out early."
good,It was fun to work the coworkers was amazing and always fun and adventurous however the repetition and confusing part of the job were the rules and requirements
good,I have not worked in a Marriott Hotel for a couple years now. But I do remember that the staff and employees were always friendly and inviting. I worked in the kitchen and was never really seen by most of the workers in the hotel. I worked along side the kitchen crew and worked mostly nights. The kitchen was very well put together and always ran efficiently. Sometimes the management hired a bad worker or two in the 3 years I was there. But the main staff and cooks were always wonderful.
good,"Great place to work, Good Benefits, Average Pay, pay depends on growth within the company. Moves up to Management quickly, and a great team of Supervisors to help your growth."
good,A typical day was to ensure that all events were show ready & the clients were completely satisfied. Management was very laid back and allowed you to do the job with out much involvement. The co-workers were part of the best attributes of working with the Westin Perimeter. A great team & family like environment. The hardest part of working with the company was when it was slow that effected the scheduling needs. I love what I do & always looked forwarded to each day I was scheduled.
good,"The experienced working for the Marriott was a great one. Learning about the Jpurney and helping my peers to better improve themselves. Connecting with the host was having a second family. I learned how to open and close the housekeeping Dept, inspect rooms to Marriott Standards. Complete Productivity and washer productivity. Check the GSS scores. Have stand up meetings am/pm."
good,"Starwood is a fun place to work but the management  takes things too seriously and is not dependable. "
good,"Very fast paced. You are constantly meeting new people and are in contact with many all the time. The management is good. Co-workers are awesome and works as a team. Hardest part of my job is pleasing an upset/mad customer, the customer is always right. The most enjoyable part is helping and pleasing guest. Making them feel like they are at home. Meeting new people from all over the world is pretty great as well."
good,"Inspection of Hotel rooms and public areas."
good,"I have almost 5 years working at Marriott with experience in the front office and engineering. I worked as a front desk agent, rooms controller, and front office supervisor. I had to deal with angry people all day long, most of whom were the most disgusting type of people including the management. You want to see the worst in human-kind work at a hotel. My coworkers were great and the only reason I miss this job. Although you worked in a small office and saw them more than your own family, so like most places, it became a little bit like high school. Job Work/Life Balance was never good. You worked first shift, second shift, holidays, and weekends. Due to the nature of hotels you would never know which days you worked and at what time until Thursday evening and the schedule starts on Saturday - this isn't Marriott's fault but a byproduct of the business. Management was most incompetent as they promote based on politics and who you know. Most times a promotion was already decided on before interviews even started. Hardest part of the job was faking it to the guests. Don't get me wrong, there were a lot of extremely nice people and a few repeat guests that I generally got excited about when I saw them but there was also a lot of snotty, upperclass types that treated the staff as servants and scum. Maybe that's because I worked in Fort Lauderdale and that is the clientele, I don't know, but I had to kiss a lot of butt to those who did not deserve it. Plenty of times I would see guests lie and even go as far as threatening to get myself or a co-worker fired just so they can save"
good,"As mentioned above, while the company was family oriented and the ""work life balance was good"", the coaching and feedback from the management was pretty absent. I would meet with my manager once a month, and the discussion was primarily about schedule adherence and attendance. While I understand these metrics are vital to a business, there was no feedback as to how to better myself in call quality."
good,"I would open hskp"
good,Working in a hotel is probably the most dependable and job secure place to work. The hardest part of this job was knowing what and how each guest wanted their rooms. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job culture. I was able to work with people of all cultures.
good,I loved my supervisors and the opportunity to get a bonus each month. It was also very nice when we all got a raise to $12.50.
good,Starwood is a good company and the leadership do care about you but there is very few opportunities for advancement and the benefits are subpar
good,"Work at any hotel depends on what department you're working in, so I will try and keep things general for anyone reading who is not applying for a front desk position. A 4* hotel with a very prestigious reputation requires a very high level of service from every employee, and you will be expected to represent the Marriott's 'brand standards' to a tee. As with any big corporation there are a lot of policies and procedures for everything, although this is to be expected. The only problem with the policies is that you're expected to know and understand them ALL but there are so many and they change frequently. The main struggle employees face is the difficult work/life balance. Unless you're working in some sort of operations or sales role your work rota will usually be given on a weekly/(if you're lucky) fortnightly basis meaning that planning ahead is quite difficult, unless you request every day that you would like to do something off. Managers are very fair in giving such days off, so don't be afraid to ask nicely. Holidays are very different; because there are so many busy periods at the hotel and the unpredictability of the job, getting a holiday request approved requires a lot of research into who else has holiday booked, what the 'forecast' is for the dates, and how many people there are in your department. About half of holiday requests (in MY opinion, not an official statistic) get denied so I recommend booking holidays as early as is physically possible or you will miss out! Combined with this comes the pay. Even the salaried workers aren't paid enough in my opinion"
good,"My typical day starts out with setting my bar by doing the following:"
good,"Customer service. Booked hotel reservations for guest worldwide. Followed company procedures to find the best rates for customers. Excellent sales skills, met company goals every month. Average calls per day 100-200 calls per day. "
good,"communication is horrible "
good,"This job was really fun, yet very tiresome. Management was amazing, and my co-workers at the time were extremely friendly and welcoming. "
good,This job is amazing. If you love to talk to others and love sales this is the job for you. Management is amazing and auto progression really helps with the morale of the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to work from home and get decent pay.
good,"A typical day at work for me would include taking phone calls and working chats/emails. Starwood definitely seems to care about you as an employee however, I do not feel the care goes any further than this. The attendance policy at Starwood is terrible. Pretty much you cannot miss one day of work without being written up or almost fired. There was only one supervisor there I would be able to talk with and she understood everything I went through and helped me with my attendance. I was truly upset because I had gotten my first CAP with Starwood and I worked my rear off the next month to get the write up down to a verbal. I even worked 18 hours of overtime just to save the PTO for Christmas. However, after using the PTO for Christmas I became ill. I had the worst cold/flu ever. I tried to make it to work but I was just to sick. I spoke with my supervisor because I had really bad anxiety over the fact I would be put on a last and final and the response I received almost made me want to quit right then and there. I understand I missed work and I did not have the PTO in my bank however, it was not as though it was a constant procedure for me. This was the very first time I had even been written up and as stated before I worked so hard to get it off my file when it didn't even matter because I am now on a last and final. In order for me to get the CAP completely off my file I have to have 7 months perfect attendance. Starwood does not seem to care about your life outside of work but when you are at work they do support you in almost every way possible. They do want to see you grow"
good,"Overall this is not a bad palce to work, but the room for advancement is not so great. Also the pay could be better as well. you have to be able to adjust to the different type of people you will come in contact with because it's a hotel business. The best part is that you are eligible for discounts on all Marriott brand hotels all over the world."
good,"management  is not the best, I have had a hard time trying to move up being in the hotel that i am in now. Marriott is a great company to work for and you can meet different people all the time"
good,"At Renaissance Hotels we know your passion for discovery is more than a hobby, it’s a career. As part of our team, you can share your inspiration and help our guests uncover hidden gems."
good,"I prefer the daily work from 7:00 am to 3:00 pm and from Monday to Friday."
good,I have nothing but good memories from working at the Marriott at Glenpoint in Teaneck NJ.
good,"lovely Hotel, staff and guest. Great Job, Good pay I have nothing but nice things to say about the Marriott Hotel."
good,Interesting experience which allow me to get to know different cultures and gain interpersonal skills and experience.
good,It was a great company to work for && they had great benefits. the hardest part of the job was dealing with customer complaints being able to assist the guest in a resectful and helpful manner and being able to allow the guest staying at any of the hotels to have a great experience
good,Verified that all credit card paying guests have adequate authorizations
good,"Performed Customer chick-in/out procedures, attended to customers needs and performed end of day audits."

good,"Productive work place with lot's of fun people.We all worked together to get the job done.It was hard some days,but it was satisfying knowing that the majority of the guests and owners truly appreciate our work."
good,A typical day would begin with me checking my production to get my day in order. After that i proceed to prepare the food that needs to be done by the apropiate time.My co workers range from my age to much older than I am. We all get along no matter our language barrier.The hardest part of my job can be management. At times the tend to make decisions that only benefit themselves. The thing I enjoy the most is the atmosphere. The ability to move and work in different areas.
good,It really hard job for me to get up too early to get ready go to work by transportation. I have night class after work and knew how to change myself to balance with work and school.
good,"Been working to qualify for UK work permit, did enjoy my time there and learn a lot I used in my life in the UK"
good,I opened the hotel. Even though it is a new hotel there are many problems that were made by the construction company. But all in all it is a great hotel and company. Just to far of a drive
good,"-Drive guests to and from Airport"
good,Pays good but during Holidays business gets slow and they cut your hours plus send you home early if business is slow only for event service position. Hotel guest and workers are cool/friendly. Loved working there but had to leave due to slow business hours.
good,"I was required to answer incoming calls in the amount of well over 100 calls in a 6 hours period. I was required to make, cancel, and adjust reservations, along with attempting to upsell to reach very specific goals that were set monthly. "
good," a typical work day as a reservation sales associate involves the making, canceling or modifying of reservations to all of the starwood brands. It also involves problem solving and quick navigation of computer programs. My coworkers were all great. Some hard parts of the job were keeping the phone time down while still making the sale."
good,i worked at the Marriott it was different experience different culture the salary not competitive low income country
good,It was amazing to meet different guest and enjoy serving customers with delicious food and great drinks.
good,"great place to work, nice location with great view towards ocean."
good,"I an a hard worker, a good mother and a very open person."
good,"o Manage the period-end closing process, as well as P&L critique for all departments. Analyzing and documenting variances against forecast, budget and prior year"

good,"running a breakfast and lunch buffet shift, payroll, discipline, Schedule, paychecks, educating staff and motivating them."
good,good place to work if you like talking on the phone. they give bonuses for the great work that you do.
good,The environment is one of entrepreneurship. Freedom to explore opportunities that achieves goals individually and as a team. A fun work place offering strong work/life balance
good,"Working night audit or overnight schedule as manager , from 10 pm to 7 am, good benefits but the salary is not enough for living. Management is good and respectful and always there to provide help and support if needed."
good,I worked as a room attendant and cleaned as many rooms as 32 rooms a day. I performed in a fast and productive environment. I was prompt and prepared for ALL duties.
good,i learned how to check in guests good phone educate the hardest part of the job was dealing with the  customers who were angry when they didn't get what they wanted
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the happy customers. The management is okay, they try to work with the employees to ensure they're satisfied. A typical day involves cleaning and assisting customers, it's pretty slow. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all the different personality types."
good,"Working here was great because of the pay, but the long hours did not work for me since I was also still attending college full time. Shifts are usually from 2pm-2am but that did vary since it was a volume bar, so if we weren't busy, we would close early. If you are looking for full time and don't mind the long hours, the pay is very good, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you are attending school as well."
good,Would be a nice place to work if the pay met up hand and hand with the amount of work done. There's a lot of work to do and with this being a cooperate ran hotel the pay should definitely be higher than what it is and not based on seniority .
good,"I'm a happy lady from Zambia Africa.i m a very competent with my work. i can work on my own with my whole mind and soul."
good,Columbus Marriott was an exciting place located in Uptown. It was very upbeat. I was proud to be  apart of the team. I enjoyed my co workers we were all one big family.
good,Après une période de travail de 5 heures consécutives
good,"Company has good benefits and its a good pay for me. I wish they could raise the salary a little bit more for the stressful job that we do everyday as a Front Desk Agents. Managers are very nice, employees are welcoming. Its just the job itself is stressful. Hours is sometimes unhealthy but its an hospitality job. You don't get holidays unless they approved a request off for it. Overall if you want to start a career in the hotel industry, Marriott is a good company to grow and learn about the industry."
good,"1) Short life balance because of shift works."
good,"It was nice to work there, you make many connections with the guest and most staff. While working there I built a relationship with most of the staff,"
good,Quick advancement due to the huge turn around. People generally quit shortly after training. I does not pay very well considering the what is required.
good,i want to develop my carrier so i was waiting for promotion but hotel is good and work also good i always work with fun its is good till now i didnot feel hardest pary in my job.
good,This is a pretty good place to work if you just finished high school and you do not have any major bills. The management team is pretty nice. You have some chances of advancement.
good,"Starwood is a great company and I've been able to expand my knowledge in the hospitality field, I was able to engage with new people each day from all over the world. Leadership is great, though supervisors do need improvement when it comes to helping their associates. I enjoyed talking on the phone and organizing everything for each guest."
good,"A normal day at work first assess the work that needs to be done to know how long I have to take to perform my job quickly and seamlessly .  I learn a lot and develop new skills, I like challenges .  The most that I like to finish my work is dedicated effort and keep in mind that all luy did well to have my satisfied customers and bosses."
good,"Assists the property’s Banquets/Catering Department in the property's reactive and proactive sales efforts with a focus on group and catering accounts."
good,"My property is franchised owned so I'm sure the experience is different from Marriott International.  Wages could be better at this property, but they are very accommodating with scheduling and fair with expectations.  It's all about Customer Service and I love that"
good,My work day consisted of direct contact with customers. handling a 15 line switchboard. Making sure accounts were up to date in accordance with company policy.
good,great place for people oriented job seekers very diverse and everyday was a learning experience and an opportunity to grow and meet new people
good,"I had opening and closing duties since I was a supervisor, usually the first one in for night shift."
good,"I would sit at a desk for my whole shitf answering a phone and with the customer on the other end, I would help them to book a vaction/trip using out starwood brand hotels. I was promoted so that I would have people calling that were our elite members. they promoted people to this that had good numbers and great customer service so that way their returning guest will talk to someone that pesonally deals with their travels. It was very diffecult for me to just sit at a desk all day every day, I never felt active enough."
good,Company treat its employees well. Fun learning environment.
good,"A typical day at the the Fairfield Inn on Time Square involves working with the Fosse system, assisting our guests, (check them in and out, help plan their vacation or celebrations, and explain any questions they may have about their reservations and invoice.) I make sure the hotel runs smoothly, and I communicate strongly with the staff to help resolve any conflicts that should arise. My responsibilities for the day also includes filing, accounting, and answering all correspondence."
good,Nice environment to work in. Gives your opportunity to grow.
good,A typical day of work would include answering the phones and documenting important information. I have learn the true works of what it is like to work at a hotel and how the over cycle works. I do not usually stay at hotels so working here has taught me more than I had expected to learn. My co-workers were always very helpful and genuinely nice. The hardest part of my job was being the first one to deal with a current or previous guest complaint on a daily basis multiple times a day. My favorite part of the job was giving recommendations to guests on where to eat or what to do about the cities.
good,"A very productive and exciting place worked."
good,"	Respond promptly to requests from guests and other departments.  "
good,"There are many jobs at this large hotel, if you enjoy the hospitality industry. "
good,"Mal ambiente laboral (poco compañerismo)"
good,A typical day was when i met with Mr Marriott
good,"I managed the daily functions of the employees, operational procedures, client relations, and secured corporate contracts. Had the greatest GM ever who supported me and helped developed me as an individual. Hardest part of the job was the sales and the most enjoyable part was working with our clients."
good,over see operation of university dinning facilty production manerger
good,A great training program that can offer a lot for their employees. Their benefits are great and the employees are great as well. The work/life balance has something to be desired and not the best fit for me.
good,Go to work at 8am and stay busy delivering whaterever products and/or appliance guest need. Also keeping every station or landing I use during the day clean and clear
good,Lots of changes and room for growth. Need to choose your career wisely as you are committed before being able to transfer to 6 months. Timeshare Sales and Marketing related positions are challenging with performance standard requirements monthly.
good,"Marriott is one of those place hard to find in a small city like Preston, excellent contract, you have plenty of benefits but there is not much of a grow there."
good,"Nice place to stay busy while enjoying the company of others, at the same time being pleased off of the benefit of pleasuring others needs ,all in all just being able to help."
good,I have work in Marriott hotel as a room attendant .The working environment is very friendly and the management team is also very good.I love to talk with the guest and wants to know the review of my work.
good,"During my time as an employee at this establishment I learned a great deal of knowledge about the hotel and its history and my role and title. The company's work culture and management could use "
good,"I have Nothing to say except the pay is very good and the hours for overtime is unlimited."
good,"La empresa como tal es muy buena, por mi parte jamas me hubiera salido de ella, solo que el ambiente laboral esta muy mal, empesando por el gerente Enrriqué  Mejia , que no sabe como llevar un ambiente en armonía con los trabajadores, poniendo en contra los jefes con los empleados."
good,"the job has a relaxing atmosphere but needs better management , i pick up my board that tells me how many rooms i have to clean then go to the closet to get my assisting and get to work while also Linnie guests if they need any help"
good,"This consisted of very early starts, cooking and serving the breakfast items offered by the hotel. Responsible for maintaining health and safety standards and stock inventory and rotation."
good,"Sheraton is the largest industry in the hospitality service "
good,"It was fun you get to meet different people of different cultures and get to learn from different people, The knowledge they have passed onto me which made me stronger with knowledge in the work field.From the help of my fellow employees and guest.And if it was a problem that occured, We always worked as a team wow just to know you have employees that really love what they do feels amazing."
good,"I enjoy working at the Westin for many reasons experience, the people I work with and it is close to home.The hardest part of my job is pushing my housekeeping cart from floor to floor."
good,"meet people every day from different states and different countries"
good,"Over all this is a quality company to work for, It creates a Place to work in total freedom and security with not hesitation of Advancement"
good,"*back to back from 2 blocks while i couldn't eat are drink in ."
good,"its nice working place with good work culture, very free hands will get"
good,1- Serving guests .
good,"I enjoy working one on one with the public. In my field of expertise, I work with and come into contact with people from all over the world, which gives me the opportunity to grow and expand my sense of who I am. I do the best that I can to be a team player and to learn from and to teach co workers."
good,Marriott International is a regional reservation center. I was responsible for answering 80 plus calls per day and provide great customer service and a vast knowledge of the products. I learned how to be patient with people and remain positive even when thing did not look pleasing. The management team was great and I really enjoyed the time spent with them. There was not much interaction with co-worker simply because we worked in individual cubicles. The hardest part of the job was sitting in one place all day. I am a very energetic person and to sit down and answer a phone for 8 hours was a trying experience. I enjoyed the consistency of the scheduling. There was no mystery what time or day you would have to work.
good,"Parking is a great problem with the company's location.  I had to pay $10.00 daily for parking, it became very expensive.tje employee parking deck seems to be for employees that have been there for 3 or more years. Parking is a great issue. Employees park in construction areas and walk about a mile away from work to get free parking, hoping not to get a ticket or boot at the end of the day you can't afford to pay for parking"
good,"Honestly, this was a super awesome place to work. I really loved it there and most of the managers are there to help you get better at your job role and in life if they can. The people for the most part are super helpful as well, like you can ask your neighbor ""hey do you know how to do this or where can I find this"" and they take the time to help. The company goes all out with letting their employees know they matter....well in general. A bunch of OT comes along during certain times and you can make great money. Like all call centers the hardest part is dealing with guests who want to yell or act like you don't know what you're doing. You do get a lot of grateful callers too. I love most all the managers and met some super awesome people that became my closest best friend. I say if you work there stay for awhile things get better. I hope to go back one day. Oh and if ya work 8hrs you get 2 breaks and a lunch!!! how cool is that"
good,"It is a great job to have that includes benefits and extra hours to work at anytime. Only downside is you're starung at a screen all day so you may get some headaches, that is easily remedied because of the breaks system and the management understanding."
good,If you decided to work at Marriott in the sports bar area it is very fast paced. You’re on your feet the whole shift. It can be fun at times but it is stressful.
good,"Always busy, not much time to take a break.  Good work environment, people were team focused.  The food was good, nice clean hotel peple were friendly."
good,I enjoyed working at this hotel for one my manager was very helpful through my schedule and things had to do with family care as far as hours they did vary some people got more hours than others but its a good place to work at.
good,Nice peace work love the people that work there the hard part is when its very busy must fun day they when we all get together in have a meet i like to here people opinions love seeing people happy from the hard work i put into the job.
good,"A typical day at work I comes in speak to everyone and get right to work. My manager loved that about me because I come right in and get to work."
good,"Excellent work environment, best quality. Had great management and coworkers"
good,Great company to work for.Always looking out for the customer.Amazing chance s for advancement.
good,"It was an ok job, just we had one young lady that always try to set the housekeepers up to make it look like they was taking frim the hotel and guest, but if they like I love it. She's still there she's the manager over housekeeping Laura."
good,"I loved my job I watched the company grow and I also watch the company fall my boss was very understanding , but there was no room for me  to grow I worked with a  lot of different people and  because I had been with the company for so long it wasn't hard for me to adapt"
good,The Marriot is a great place with an even better working environment. The chances for employment are high and chances for advancement are even higher. All employees are treated with the upmost care and respect. All facilities are clean and sanitary. Food is provided for full time workers. Ample benefits are available for due employees. And overall it's a great place to work.
good,"learning program consists of three unique components, mixing online learning, classroom style instructor-led training, and ongoing “stretch assignments” for the associate to implement in between classes. Through Ascent, our associates gain invaluable knowledge and experience. Upon completion of the program, they are ready to attend a panel certification and start applying to management positions."
good,"We work as a family, with respect and nice environment  The people you work with are usually very nice. Many learning sessions. Good work life balance."

good,there is room for advancement and growth as long as you know howto deliver whats expected
good,working at Marriott is a wonderful experience to work at. i got a chance to work with great people and that had a lot of experience on what i had to do.

good,"Performs routine duties in cleaning and servicing of guest rooms and baths under supervision of housekeeping supervisor. Room attendant promotes a positive image of the property to guests and must be pleasant, honest, friendly and should also able to address guest requests and problems."
good,"VERY hard work , fast pace. To me it was a challenging experience. The unit I was in was sold to another company and the benefits package was a distant second to the package Marriott offered. I then had a death in the family and had to leave suddenly."
good,"Assisted and managed the day-to-day operation of the housekeeping department, performed all necessary administrative duties and reports, trained and counseled staff duties. Motivated and directed line employees to ensured consistent and productivity in turndown, guest and public area service, provided and maintained the high standards cleanliness service and guest assistance"
good,"No comment at this time.  I worked at several hotels for Marriott.  The initial placement was fun, exciting and very much customer service oriented. There were, at every location, however, management playing favorites with the employees.  That was very uncomfortable and seemed to be a prevalent practice throughout the company."
good,"I was set up for failure by lazy, incompetent colleagues who did not like my professional work ethic. I wasn't too concerned about that because I figured the manager would appreciate my work ethic and attention to detail. I was wrong."
good,Working at the Westin charlotte was a great opportunity because of it being right across from the Convention Center and getting to meet so many great people that travel all around the world
good,Don't get comfortable get experience and move on. Met great people here though as far as guest are concerned. Learn a lot about interacting with different types of people.
good,Marriott is a wonderful company but most hotel are franchise not corporate. SpringHill Suites Denton has a lot of issue within the management staff inconsistencies in training being told my one staff member to do a task one way only to be told by another you did it wrong. If the property as a whole would come together an come up with a solution this establishment would be a better place of employment
good,"Marriott is a great company to work for if you are okay with being complacent."
good,"Good working experience."
good,"Shift change"
good,My coworkers are great just the management. The hardest part of my job is not feeling appreciated. the most enjoyable part is sometimes my paycheck. The GM do not even speak to her employers.
good,It is a good first time job to get you through college but they do not pay well enough to make a living. Not too many opportunities to move up within the company.
good,"- Control, supervisión y seguimiento de los eventos realizados en el hotel desde el primer contacto hasta su finalización."
good,"A wonderful place to work."
good,great place to work when with corporate Marriott. when with franchises they are lower paying and do not have great benefits. many times unorganized.
good,"It was really productive, really good culture, people really nice, managers really helpful and the place is remodeled and beautiful"
good,"I really did enjoy working at Marriott as I learned many different things and"
good,This Marriott was pet friendly with full kitchens so a lot of times the rooms are horrible and takes more time to clean then it would a regular room I do not recommend this hotel
good,food a d beverage manager is racist. He's always late for work and when he do arrives he has an attitude. Good place poor management . Its ok for students
good,Very bad management after the building caught on fire. I was doing some marketing skills I wasn't even supposed to. I did a lot of work that was out of my field
good,This is a nice job for college students great learning environment for hospitality and food service. Promotions and raises are promoted. Employee appreciation nice when consistant.
good,good job but they dont pay well and poor management...lots of turn over. they promised me a position as kitchen manager with a dollar raise and got a new GM and said no promotion and only got a 10 cent raise after being there a year
good,"The Marriott hotel and resort is a good place to work, they have multiple positions and a nice work environment. They also offer you a free meal on the time of your break."
good,Just another day at work. Haven't learned anything new just what I already know. The management could be better. Workplace is good most of the times. The hardest part of the job is when I get a lot of laundry and they want me to do facility too. Pay you only for one job and want you to do another. That is not right! Enjoy work because most of the people I work with are nice.
good,"i cant speak on behalf of all marriotts but the one i worked for didnt have room for more opportunities to grow, typical work day had the short staff overworked and under paid"
good,"-prepare the food for the next day"
good,"I enjoyed working here. I liked the people, both employees, and most guests."
good,buen ambiente pero no cumplen con el pago de nomina ni de seguro
good,"There is nepotism in upper management and what is good for one is not good for the other at this property. My hours consisted of 4-5 hours on average, 4 days a week. I only worked maximum of 24 hours per week."
good,At the Marriott I answered calls and answered questions about hotel facilities and went through prices and perks of hotels used for either business or pleasure.  I enjoy working with the public and I enjoyed the co-workers.
good,Loved working with the long stay guests. Lack of communication from management to hourly help. Newly remodeled. The hardest part of the job was trying to please all of the chiefs at the same time.
good,"Good job, good hours, not enough pay to support family but potential to advance or change departments. Spend most of the day helping housekeepers and taking out dirty linens and trash."
good,"It is a great place to work, just the pay and demand are not equal."
good,"Great company! Difficult to live off of the pay. Schedule was obnoxious if you are in Leadership role. If your a union worker you are protected by the policies in place. High expectations for leaders, but pay does not match expectations. Schedule was very inconsistent."
good,Never want to work for a franchise again. Raises are not compatible to other hotels in the area. poor management. There is really not much more to say.
good,Every location is different and managed by a different company. I've worked for the Marriott at a few different locations and no experience has been the same.
good,"This was a really great job. I  wish that i could go back but the different people have different stories.  If you like to travel and can get time off , lots of available bonuses are available.  Have pretty good employee discounts."
good,"Ambiente Laboral con oportunidades de mejora, aunque Marriott es una gran empresa. Las mejoras a la calidad del ambiente laboral, pueden mejorar para los empleados."
good,"Working there for me wasn’t really all that bad or really all that good it was just a problem because of my living arrangements and school schedules, so I’m trying to find a job closer to me."
good,"a day at work is clocking in, do your job, and go home..its not too much to speak on, its not a hard job, just certain situations makes it hard>  when you like going to work, then you know youre in the right place..but lately its not been good for me."
good,While working at the Marriott for my work experience i was asked to help decorate the main room for the kids to attend for their prom which was really good as it help me understand how much effort people put into everything to make your evening a wonderful night.
good,"•	As TSA, I strived for wonderful over the phone guest interactions while taking in-room dining orders and providing delivery times suitable for my guest and reasonable for servers to meet. "
good,"Great company to work for and learn and grow. Good development opportunity.  "
good,working for the Marriott company was a really great experience and will do this again if I had the opportunity. It was a really busy hotel and had the chance to meet people from all over the states.
good,A typical day at work just cleaning rooms in a timely and professional manner learning how to work at Fast Pace 20 to 30 minutes per room detail oriented. Fun fast pace different cultures even though we really need more the hardest part about being a housekeeper is finishing 16 to 21 checkouts and 8 hour.
good,"Beautiful modern hotel with a good crew and atmosphere, but there is almost zero opportunity for advancement. It is very difficult to make plans when schedule comes out one day in advance."
good,"no set shift timmings, no involvement of HR on how many hours you work/ over time. Week offs may get cancelled if schedule is busy. work is not appreaciated. No increment in salary."
good,I am more skilled and trained to do my job but instead of giving me a promotion they gave it to some guy who doesn't know anything and I have to train to do his job
good,"There was a lot of turmoil with the Old Owners, we never knew if our checks would clear. The Security Team was awesome and Co workers were great!"
good,my days working here was ok only because the new management that took over . before moving to  vage i work at a dallor tree in New York and i was on my way to become a manager and i call the dallor tree i was be transfer and i got deny for the management
good,"The moment you punch in it means run, work fast good and efficiently. The hardest part of my job is not having the security that I will work my full-time since its a hotel there are times when work is low and I only get 20hrs a week at times or less because work is so low. The most enjoyable part of my job is working as a team with the other house keepers that keeps a positive and efficient work place."
good,"Marriott International, Inc. is a leading hospitality company with more than 3,900 properties, 18 brands, and associates at our headquarters, managed and franchised properties around the world. Founded by J. Willard and Alice Marriott and guided by Marriott family leadership for more than 80 years, the company is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, USA, and reported revenues of nearly $13 billion in fiscal year 2013."
good,The Marriott could be the ideal job but I learned that they don't promote with in. The days a very long and very busy
good,A relaxed environment on non busy days allowing you to be flexible with your tasks.
good,"The job was very rewarding, helped me to grow and utilize other skills I didn't know I had, sharpened my cognitive skills as well as dexterity skills, and was helped me to become more focused."
good,The last location I was at was not a good place to work.  There is a serious problem with the management there.  Even if you talk to someone about it nothing ever gets done.  Management likes to treat the employees as property not people.
good,The patrons are what made my day. Working for Marriott hasn't been a nice experience... I thank them for the opportunity but I don't think I'll be considering going back anytime soon
good,Typical day reaching out to my Vip guest and reserving a number of different hotels reservations in different city and state and country. Making sure my guest gets whatever it is to accommodate any personal or family vacations.
good,"The best part is doing for the people. A hotel is big time customer service all around, and to makes someone’s day or experience better is everything. You deal with businessmen and women. I even drove and contributed to a weddings party happiness with our shuttle service"
good,"I enjoyed working at the Marriott to be around different people and the morning shift was always great since it was 7:00am to 3:00pm. At the time, this worked very well with my school schedule since I would take afternoon/ evening classes. I would recommend this job to college students for the decent pay and flexible hours."
good,The front desk is an amazing job if you let it be. I did find it hard to please everyone when it came to upgrades...the resort only has so many suites and connecting suites. Sometimes people feel over privileged and that you just don't want to accommodate them.
good,"I apply for HHSK position in this company and I been treated unfairly and with pure racism by GM."
good,"so day to day is pretty consistent, not to fast nor is it too slow. "
good,The best part about this job is meeting new people from all over the world. It is pretty slow paced and you do not get a lot of guests for dining in but taking room orders were fun and a good way to get tips.
good,"Good:"
good,"when working at the Marriott you are ask to follow brand standards"
good,Good place for great working individuals. The perks were great. Management wasn't so great. A lot of interns work there. Lack of respect between higher ups
good,Really good for starters job. No chance for career advancement and compensation not equal to industry standard while I was there. Great benefits after advancing to platinum concierge but still not enough. Pay for the amount of sales required.
good,"I love working with other people team work make a dream work i love the hours in the checks was good the rooms was nice in clean made beds,vaccum,dust clean bathroom change sheets,wipe walls down in made sure my rooms was good the guesses where nice in pleasant in I made sure the guess enjoy there stay working at the Marriott was an nice pheasant experience"
good,"it was great to work with this property, I had awesome time being there, however the pay was not good, and the management was not that good to work under."
good,"This Hotel was great, not you run of the mill place, the night audit was hard you had to know 14 different systems to be able to run the audit, but that opened me up to computer software's and helped me grow more with my career"
good,"Era un buen ambiente de trabajo "
good,"I put in 2 and half years , made millions in revenue for the company and was still treated replaceable."
good,"This job was extremely fast paced to start with then more work was added to the job.  My original job was general cashier, then payroll was added to my duties.  I enjoyed doing both jobs and I learned a lot of new skills.  I was glad to have a chance to expand my job skills but there was never enough time to get everything done.  The payroll part of my job was dependent upon the department managers getting their reports in on time and they were always to busy to check their reports and get them back to me on time.  It was really a great job and I am glad that I had the opportunity to be involved in this work."
good,"Always Busy"
good,"The hardest part of the job was balancing being a full time student. Being my very first hotel, I received a lot of good feedback from guest and management."
good,"Не удобный график, много ""начальников"". Один говорит одно, другой другое, в итоге не понимаешь, что делать!!!"
good,"Ik heb bij Marriott 3 maanden gewerkt. Als kok gaat je nauwkeurig te werk en probeer je al tijd het werk tien stappen voor te zijn. Elke worden er verse maaltijden (hot and cold) klaargemaakt voor de Executive Lounge. Deze lounge is bestemd voor gasten die je ook wel vip kan noemen, zij betalen wat extra tijdens hun verblijf en mogen dus ten alle tijde gebruik maken van de Executive lounge die 24 u open is. Belangrijk: De lounge moet binnen 2 uur klaar zijn."
good,"if you want to grow and advance, it's not the best place to be. Good luck but I wouldn't recommend it. Great for the short term, Not the long term. if you want a stable job without much growth, go for it."
good,coming to work everyday was like everyday life for me. claning and making sure the room was sutible for the next guest was a pleasure for me. i enjoyed doing my job everyday
good,cleaning rooms paying a great deal of attention to detail and also have knowledge of different perks that the hotel have to offer. In my opinion the management could get more training in how to interact with the staff that is under their supervision. The hardest part of my job is working every weekend and holiday not knowing when I will have a day off
good,"I enjoyed working at Marriott it was like a family at work. Once we went Franchise that went sour. Although the new GM was very hands on I really enjoyed working beside him. He actually turned the hotel around with rumors other hotel management taking over. I did have some concerns when he hired an executive housekeeper, I really did not see the need to have one. Like my gut was saying he was very condescending and very nosey to be older than a lot of us. I feel he was not a team player he was just there. Although I always worked at my own pace and did my job to my ability and helping out in other departments I never complained. I made sure the housekeeping department was maintained when I was there. I got along with everyone and everyone got along with me, I'm not the type of person that likes negative energy or gossip. I just come in and do my job and get to the next day. I wish them the best of luck and know its time to move on."
good,"In the summer months and Christmas working at the hotel is fun busy and enjoyable however in the months just after Christmas the hotel is very quiet and there is a lack of work, which isn't Ideal as you don't have a lot of work just a few shifts a week which becomes tedious and boring. Also being un-contracted means you don't get paid also which isn't good for paying bills etc. Its a good and friendly place to work to make lots of friendships."
good,I really enjoyed this job. I passed inspection in housekeeping. The company at this property had failed for 5 years. The management was not good at all.
good,Checking in-out. Insuring all paper work is in with check ins.
good,When I began I was in the laundry room and enjoyed it because it had a certain comparative edged to it.  By the end I did maintenance which included stripping down the rooms and putting in new accessories.  The other half of this department is the people who clean and refurbished the rooms always became low on supplies.  This made forced me to work harder and faster to up hold supply and demand.  My answer to this problem is to hire only 2 extra people.  One person day shift when needed and for the night shift.  These two can be alternated for night shifts.  This is my answer fixing the supply and demand ratio.  The people I worked with where all hard word workers.  Just like any other job there are some you may not get along with but that’s expected.  I was able to get along with most everyone.  One situation I don’t like is the huge over to management of this department.  It seems like every 2 - 4 weeks there was someone knew.
good,"Productive and innovative"
good,"At this job I was able to take guests mountain bike riding, parasailing, jet skiing, and many many more outdoor activities! I learned to teach classes such as water aerobics, yoga and even got to create an 'abs blaster' class for the hotel guests. It was a fun job where you were able to put your creative mind to work!"
good,"It was an ok atmosphere but they needed benefits,and everyday was a typical work day with no breaks."
good,"A home like atmosphere, great managers like family seniors and the co-workers like brothers and sisters all there to assist in a kind and gentle manner. There is hard times but with associates like this it is just another experience or a learning curve, we all work hard and we play even harder."
good,Decent place to work. Management was some of the worst I've ever seen. Good possibility for advancement if you want it. Benefits were decent and pay was poor given level of responsibility expected.
good,"I was an prep cook, line cook, set-up cook. I prep for the line , salads, follow recipes and temps, set up line for serving. I ran the cash register on some days. And some ran cash register behind the coffee and desert counter."
good,Had the opportunity to see how and who determines the where and what of a Hotel from developmental to operational stages.
good,"More of what the goals I have for my life, but if I had been given the choice to pass on the job, I would have. But for the most part, working there is actually one of the better jobs that I have had."
good,"I would greet my guest, check them in and out, and always make sure to assist them. I would also answer the phone, make reservations, and make sure I had a clean and organized work area."
good,"Enjoyed the benefits and the ability to work from home, but it does have its cons. Shifts aren't great for people with families. Hard to get a day shift. Almost always need to work weekends. It's a great experience for someone out of school needing to gain experience, but it's not enough if you're raising a family. Everyone I met seemed lovely, but I always got the feeling that they hired who they know and weren't forgiving if you left and wanted to come back."
good,"Not easy to transfer between hotels. When try to go international is harder. Good company, good management but need to understand work and life balance."
good,"This job was difficult at best. No work life balance, exhaustion after every job, no energy or brain for anything else. Some days expected to work 7 days a week of hard manual labour with no rest. Benefits are great team spirit, understanding supervisors (some of them) and training is great. You do get acknowledged for all your hard work. Pay is low, increase in pay is not to be expected (after chatting to some colleagues about it who have stayed there for several years) and and pay increase only £1 after a while. There is room for progression. There is room for going into other roles. Expect your body and your brains to be bashed into a million pieces everyday. The design of the hotel rooms and corridors seem and feel more like a prison than a holiday destination, no air ventilations, no fresh air circulating the buildings and your body will suffer from the constant need to use the air con in order to make it feel less stuffy so you can actually breathe comfortably, so working there can seem like feel like you are imprisoned in the walls."
good,I liked my job and the people around me but my managers were indifferent. I had two at the time of employment and one was great. But the other was stuck up and very demeaning
good,"Typical days at work are enjoyable in the sense that the people who work there are a great team to work with."
good,"management could be better"
good,"I clock in and I start working on lunch orders, I learned that management likes to micromanage, and that it isnt so much team work but everyone for themselves and no help is offered it is expected."
good,It's not very likely that you'll get a promotion unless your friends with management. Top managers won't give you the opportunity even if you qualify for another and better position.
good,"Although Marriott has several establishments with decent benefits for its employees. Since this is located in India, my experience involved in getting pushed right in without any sort of introduction to the hotel or a small tour and a basic instruction guideline on the ins and outs of the hotel. I never knew there was a training center until I left. They just threw me right in without an explanation on why or what was I doing there."
good,Marriott offers a great room benefit to their employees and this is the higher paying hotels in the region. However this location does not promote from within.
good,"Corporate headquarters was very involved in making many of the decisions concerning the daily operations that included restaurant/room service, etc.  This created an unstable work environment."
good,Good work place always busy just make sure to be able to lift over 50lbs pay is very low for what you get asked to do and for the amount of guest we hand per shift
good,"Strong job"
good,Am willing to leave here because its easy for me and am using working mire but overall its a great place to work. General Manager is great most of the Manager we get along real good with them the leader show is respect.
good,"The hours are long, but it is very rewarding place to work. The hotel is newly remodeled. The restaurant has some of the best food, along with the new addition of Starbucks coffee outlet."
good,Wide-ranging benefits and tools if employees seek them out.  Management promotes through personal preferences more so than performance or previous experience.
good,The Marriott was a good place to work. Line Staff were professional and courteous to guest. Management was often unfair to employees. Absolutely no consistency in discipline. Employee recognition was often unfairly displayed.
good,"Working at the front desk of a Marriott has provided me with experiences in customer service much different than UDF. I was able to have more one-on-one conversations with customers and engage with them in ways that UDF didn't provide. I believe this would relate into serving with being one-on-one with each table. "
good,"I left this job shortly after the new manager came in so I don't know how she is as a manager and I've heard both sides. Before I left though, the environment was a ton of fun."
good,"The job is fine. It just needs more opportunity for advancement. "
good,"A typical day was checking guests in and out of the Hotel and seeing to there needs as they come up."
good,"Hard coworkers"
good,My work day was ok. It was hard labor and a lot of inter departmental conflicts. Overall we got through it and completed the tasks that were handed to us.
good,The customers were everything. I constantly received tips and gifts. I love the fact that there are plenty regulars who enjoy seeing the same face when they arrive. If not for the low wage and fight to get my bonus I would stay.
good,"unwelcoming and unfriendly to new starters, poorly managed,overall not great, poor pay even n relation to other hotels so hospitality is no excuse. better places to work"
good,"I love working for the Westin Brand, I think we could have done a lot more with mix markets.  Management is not friendly to open up and listen to Sales marketing team what we have and what we can do to bring in the business based on long term clienteles.  it's very competitive markets because where we are located at LAX Airport.  I left because it's a unfriendly place."
good,Over worked not appreciated benifits are great. Management is a joke they only care about seeking a room. There a lot that happens there a lot of good with bad
good,"Great job if you are in school. Co-workers are great.  Wonderful atmosphere. You get discount on hotel."
good,less manned with high pressure work culture with very slow growth plan. Salary structure is also a point of concern. potentially good working place miss leaded operationally.
good,"I only worked there as a work experience placement but while I was there I enjoyed every minute of it, would happily go back the the company for a job"
good,The department use to be much larger when I started but dwindled  to 4.  Management wasn't  that helpful when you went to them.  scheduled staff to cover late parties.  Learned how to place ordered with vendors.  Attended culinary meetings as well as having meeting with my staff to make sure the B.E.O's were understood and executed completely
good,"Not a supportive work environment. they don't care about there workers . management is unsupportive, no room for growth"
good,"Working here is great for a person with no responsibilities or family. Promised advancement is what kept me on and never saw it. Very stressful and often, you would be left as a team of 1 while other coworkers talked and visited."
good,"it's just a job. I can be passed over even though I applied for a new position. The management was not great , co workers we great since they where from different parts of the World.  Hardest part was parking in the lots that was expensive. Got to be there during the Super Bowl in Indiana."
good,"There no work and life balance. The communication is not the best. The management is polite but can be a little rough with some associates,"
good,"A typical day the phones are ringing back to back with guest needing their vehicles, wanting receipts to be emailed, or wanting to order breakfast, this all happens from the time I clock in until around 10am, having to multitask is very challenging, but the experience is very needed if I am planning on making this a career for the long haul. The most enjoyable part of my job is my General Manager, he is by far a charm for this property he really keeps me on my toes, he challenge me when I make a mistake, instead of his fixing it he looks for me to correct it and tell him how and why the mistake was made. He really pushes me to my potential."
good,"scale 1-10 = 8 Had fun working independently for a good hospitality company.  Lots of amazing people, friendly environment."
good,"Large opportunity for movement around the world. Lots of hours for associated management is usually trending at 50 hour+ per week. "
good,Marriott International is a superb company to work with. There are a number of benefits that can make an associate continue to work with Marriott.
good,"great place to work for current students in the human resources fields. staff needs to improve on training skills."
good,"Great place to work, but with tight reigns which is fine. Management teams and co worker teams in management very competitive. I didn't say trustworthy."
good,some times we can be short staffed on days when we are busy. It can be hard to work the front desk. Was not aware when I started that I would be driving the hotel shuttle as well as working the front desk.
good,Not much supervision more as a prep cook. Spend shift making sure line cook works and you do prep for the banquets. most of the day is spent trying to make sure you are set up for the next day not being behind the 8 ball when you come into work
good,"They treat their employees well, just no opportunities to grow. It is based upon a Seniority decision, not experience wise one. Free lunches every now and then, and great employee discounts, if you can take the time off and use them."
good,"Working for the Marriott hotel is a delight. Serving our frequent guests is a pleasure. The only drawback is the management, often condescending, disorganized, and petty."
good,"A typical day at work can vary everyday. Different people come thru everyday. There is always different events, and projects to do. I've learnt how to handle any kind of person who has come my way, whether mad or happy. All my co-workers are wonderful people, and hard workers. The hardest part of my job would probably the hours, sometimes your working all times of the day and the inconsistency is exhausting. What I love most about my job is making the guest happy. Also, my co-workers. There all really the best people to work with."
good,"Corporate culture with the Management Company, not Marriott, proved to be a challenging daily event.  I learned a lot from staff, guests and vendors, very little from Management."
good,"Worked the dinner shift, great servicers and bar tender.  Almost all the guest were regulars so always a friendly face in the crowd."
good,"Strip and clean all rooms assigned for the day by end of shift. provide any requested items to each room. clean all common areas. Exterior ground kept clean and clear of all debris. maintain all maintenance requests assigned. clean, fold and stock all linen."
good,"Remote position from MA, Able to sell mutable market segments for 11 hotels as Regional Sales Manger."
good,Enjoyed the work environment and the challenge that came with the work. Everyday day was different and yet fun.
good,Worked as a Catering Sales Manager.  Good company and great corporate owner.  We got lots of help from corporate (HSI) on any marketing plan or materials.
good,This job was enjoyable people were nice. Management was very helpful. The hospitality business is a field that gives a lot of experience. Meeting new people and learning what they come into town for is always interesting. Hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers who are unhappy with the service the company/hotel provides.
good,working inconsistent hours for little pay took away most of the rewarding aspects of this job after just a year.
good,"This property is beautiful, the staff are like a tight nit family. I have had a chance to cross train with housekeeping and front desk. "
good,i would always recommend hospitality work but this particular location seemed a little too aggravated the management seems to be a drama queen  
good,"Worked kitchen for breakfast/evening and did overnight audit shifts for the front desk.  The management at the time was not proactive for any employees needing to call in - worked 12 hour shifts maybe more.  Although paychecks could be nice, it was a rough transition with another job."
good,"I did not get the opportunity to work there long enough to experience the company, but I believe it's a good company, besides they've been around for a long time and still going."
good,"Great properties, need to be more cohesive direction about brand."
good,Broken promises with internal advancement leads to the low rating.
good,"The Grand Hotel is one of the most stunningly beautiful, full of character, spacious, relaxed, and all-inclusive resorts I have see in the SouthEast. The guests here love it and they are almost always repeat business. The southern hospitality of the 'South' is evident here from the first moment you pull in the gates."
good,Great team environment.
good,Come grab you work order plan the rest of the day do daily stand up meeting with other assoc meet with clients see what there needs are.
good,"Managed and supervised accounting team, very productive enviroment and smooth running systems"
good,The W Hotel is a great place to work if you are content with your position you are hired for. I came on as a Engineer with plans for advancement. No advancement was offered to me in this department.
good,The company was be good. But salary wase getting to cutting salary finally getting₹ 9000/-for employee so please increase the amount. Snout the work wise more then duty hours to work in banquet hall.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to check on upcoming events and ensure all event details were executed proficiently and accurately."
good,I worked the audit shift so hard to tell what it was like during the day but the FD manager always left stupid notes about stuff that had nothing to do with audit and always wanted us to show up at meeting at 2 or 3pm just make sure we didn't get a good day's sleep before being up all night.
good,Great people to work with but terrible management!  They pay minimum wage and expect a few employees to do way to much due to tremendous understaffing in every department! With proper management and fair compensation it would a great place to work!
good,Great company!!! Love meeting new people from all walks of life everyday. You build friendships and customer service skills come naturally when performing task here.
good,"I went in not knowing a thing about maintenance, now I know a handful of new skills that will benefit me in the future, but like a retail job, customer satisfaction is crucial"
good,"High pressure from owners and hirer ups to close business "
good,"their attendance policies need to change and more parking for employees. the chef take them self way to seriously. and expect to be written up a lot, like for going to the bathroom at the wrong time or something dumb like that."
good,"I will say that I think Marriott is a good company and by far one of the best corporations I've ever worked for...the main problems/issues usually tend to be property specific. I will say my position is extremely stressful and I'm grossly under paid for what they expect. I make $15.50 an hour and I coordinate large demanding group room blocks, answer every phone call, organize meetings, do site tours, plan catering, provide/seek out new sales leads, AND do all the accounts receivable (about 5-7 extra hours a week). I like doing those things, but I simply can't do it all and management talks down to me when I ask questions or for assistance. I wouldn't mind so much if I were making 40-50K a year. The pay is NOT worth the frustration. Hopefully, I can move to a more organized property. Also, my training was almost non-existent. I had to fight feeling set up for failure from the beginning. Thank goodness I already had some experience. There was a complete management turnover within my first 2 months and that was not a good sign. Plus, the sales office is extremely demanding when booking business and expect you to drop everything when they have a question or to answer an email . Life/work balance is terrible."
good,"I do 17 or more rooms per day, I learned how to work in a fast pace environment  I enjoy doing it,it  can keep you very busy.the good thing about this company is you can make customers very happy knowing they have a very clean and neat room, so when they are satisfied with there room I am pleased I no I've done my job well."
good,I work in banquets therefore the shifts keep on changing ie no work life balance. there are times you work 50 hrs a week and then there are times where there is nothing for entire week.
good,"When I first began with Marriott, I loved my job in housekeeping. after a few months I quickly was promoted to supervisor and also enjoyed this position. However, after experiencing some harassment issues and company policy breaking from my co-supervisor, I decided it was best for me to switch departments within the company. I then switch to the front desk position for Marriott, and also enjoy this very much. However, the same co-worker started to cause problems in this department for me as well. After reporting it to my direct supervisor, the general manager, and the area manager with no consequences, I decided it was best to leave the company. I would love to work for Marriott again in the future, just not this specific location."
good,Busy place to work with plenty of opportunities for training and self improvement.  Management have an open door policy and are approachable.  Many different roles to suit different people's requirements and availability.
good,I have done all aspects of the hotel. Each property has been different but overall a good company to work for just not much space to advance. I have enjoyed working for Marriott over the years and would love to work my way up just have not been given the opportunity.
good,"Worked here for less than a year. I enjoyed it for a bit, when we weren't understaffed, I was overworked without a raise. The main reason I left. The supervisor never really helped with extra stuff, when she was fully capable of the extra help. Needs to be a team player and help her staff out, not just behind the desk,"
good,"Marriot was okay but the management was very bad. They were unprofessional, and very unethical in their ways. They were not good leaders or good teachers either"
good,"I was hired as a manager and was more than qualified.  I let my immediate manager know I was a single parent with a small child BEFORE I was hired.  On more than one occasion, he told me he wished he had never hired a single parent. I left several months later with a job that fit better with a preschooler and he was fired for a multitude of infractions."
good,Fast paced . Day consisted of cleaning rooms .every room had to be perfect in 30 min. the hardest part of the job was knowing you cant make  mistakes when it comes to dealing with the public. Seeing happy faces is most enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work was trying to keep my co-worker awake and doing his job."
good,A typical day at work would consist of me loading my work cart and starting my day. I feel as if this place does not have the right supervisors running this establishment. It is drama filled and the hardest part of my job was staying focused. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my step mom.
good,"The managment on site is very good, but the hours are terrible and you basically accept that the fact that while you are working everybody else with a normal work life balance is off and enjoying their night."
good,"Workplace can be toxic, hard to advance unless you know someone in the company or you are willing to be the boss's best friend. Management makes you feel unappreciated and aren't loyal to their associates."
good,"Marriott can be a great place to work as long as you're in a position that you enjoy. While I was there, I was unable to advance my career even though I had a Degree."
good,As a maintenance tech the first thing that i would do is get the list of jobs that had to be done for the day and proceeded to the workshop.  After that i would start my day going through the list of jobs and take care of anything  else that came up.
good,the workload is unrealistic so we leave atleast an hour late everyday. on the busiest day i leave at 7pm with my 2 kids waiting. The company isnt as bad as the position.
good,"Management was all over the place, work life balance was difficult when requesting time off. Benifits takes forever to get, always had to cover other shifts."
good,"When I worked at the Four Points Sheraton the hotel was in transition. The hotel had been sold to another ownership group, and there was a lot of turmoil."
good,"Best incentive for working for Marriott International, Inc. is the travel discounts, especially with them merging with Starwood.  Pay could definitely be better, especially when they combine positions into one with no significant pay increase."
good,"Very good to have as a side job, not a career."
good,"I worked at Sheraton Arlington as a Bellman, it was fun I learned so much about customer services. The importance of making a guest day and how a smile can change someone life."
good,Nothing to do at this job but twiddle your thumbs . They say we can check our phones but they don’t want us on them. Literally stand at the desk all day and stare at the wall.
good,"Working at the westin hotel is alright. The workers are nice and friendly, but management slacks most of the time. If you are thinking of moving up at the westin, don't."
good,"I was an on-call bartender so the only benefit was rom discount. I worked only when they needed me, so I wasn't around that much. They treated me well."
good,I worked for a staffing agency that was not right but working here was alright. I loved the kitchen management and most employees had respect but there was a lot that didn't. the only thing negative I would say is not enough pay for the job.
good,Marriott is a great company to work for with amazing employee benefits including discounts. Their computer programing could be more up to date like some others in the industry.
good,"The associates make the experience. While it is hard to fault anyone else, the opportunities for upward mobility, while they seem promising, are very limited."
good,"I really enjoyed working in hospitality, and getting to meet interesting people. The work itself was mostly easy, and my coworkers made working there a blast."
good,Management was 50%/50% in terms of talent. Treatment of consultants good for the most part. The acquisition by Marriott has led to many original Starwood employees accepting packages. Rather Bleak outlook at present by those who remain currently.
good,"Truly a great environment to work and the majority of co-workers are always pleasant. But when it comes to management I've seen more organizational skills from a group of 8 year olds. they will smile to your face and stick you in the back as soon as you turn around. There have been some really good managers there over the years, but they were either abused by upper management and left, or, were smart enough and left before they had a heart attack."
good,"I started and had to have surgery so I was there very long "
good,"el sistema de trabajo no puedo aceptarlo poque necesito trabajar todo el año y esta empresa cierra varios meses de temporada baja, los cuales no cobras"
good,Anyone who has a good understanding of their job requirements and love what they do will do well with this company.  The training is not the best but the positions are easy to figure out and to perform.
good,"After Marriott adquisition the company is not the same. The severance package is not as good as average US company. Sadly, Marriott is offering jobs that pay way less than current associates are making. They have cut vacation days, food and beverage discount has been reduced to 20% from 50%. Hotel discounts used to be very good for high-end hotels, now Marriott is preventing that."
good,Hard to work with a general manager who did not understand what ir takes to make quality product.  thoughts of just getting things done fast.  clean and nice to work for.
good,"typical day at work was sometimes stressful and difficult to deal with.  A lot of  hotel issues like linen and amenities"
good,Me gusto casa magna marriott pero mi ciclo acabo a buscar algo mas
good,"L’ambiente in cui ho avuto la fortuna di lavorare è altamente professionale e professionalizzante, i colleghi e i superiori molto disponibili, e da subito mi hanno spronata ad essere autonoma affidandomi compiti e responsabilità."
good,"Ho svolto presso questa struttura un tirocinio curricolare: l’ambiente è altamente professionale e professionalizzante, i colleghi e i superiori molto disponibili, e da subito mi hanno spronata ad essere autonoma affidandomi compiti e responsabilità."
good,Everyday I interacted with holiday visitors at the beach.  I had monthly tour goals to meet set by my supervisor.  On going training was provided to help achieve monthly goals.  Sometimes the most difficult part of the job was convincing tourist to take the time share tour no matter how matter free gifts I could offer them.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.  I enjoy meeting new people from different walks of life.
good,with exception of director of F&B the management in the restaurant was poor with no clear direction for its serving staff.  The hardest part was the long hours without much rest in between shifts.  I did enjoy the lovely weather as well as meeting some very nice guests on vacation.
good,I dont have much of a review to leave. My manager at the time was very understanding and worked well with my school schedule. I really enjoyed working for courtyard by marriott.
good,"Clean, happy, friendly and exciting environment to be a apart of on a daily and or nightly basis. (Night Audit)"
good,busy throughout the year. banquets is the biggest business in the hotel. good benefits but load of work is extreme for barely any pay
good,AC hotel by Marriott is a new hotel here in New Orleans. The owners were new and management team was also new when they opened. I have learned many things about the hospitality industry. Management were all arrogant.
good,"My day consists of making reservations by phone and in person, assisting guests in maintenance, janitorial, or any other needs. I have furthered and improved my customer service experience in all aspects, gained worth while sales experience, have built helpful and beneficial relationships with guests."
good,"made sure that the rooms that were given in the morning meeting was completed in a timely manner. helped other people when finished with rooms, tried to make sure everyone was able to get out of work quickly."
good,"I am in charge of all daily operations of the hotel. From the patrol of security to the daily itinerary for the house keepers. I meet with clients to book banquet halls or conference room. I give corporate tours as well as create presentations for new ideas implemented in meeting i hold every month the the GM's. My day is always productive and to list all my responsibilities i'll be typing forever. I was hired because i know how to prioritize and execute. I'm trust worthy to the point that no one else in upper management will ever have to shy away from their responsibility to solve a problem, they have me. i keep everyone on their toes and stress free."
good,I was only an inturn at the Marriott but it was a really great experience. I was able to learn a lot there and I enjoyed working for a hotel.
good,"Great environment to start your career! It gets rough when occupancy is low , but overall a great place. A lot of high profile clientele come through the doors on a daily basis."
good,"Very Good"
good,Nice people and good vibes. The staff was helpful and enjoyable. The guest were very nice and they enjoyed the stay. The company does not have to much room for improvement.  It doe snot allow the staff to grow.
good,"This is a good company to work in with their fantastic banefits."
good,"Management is terrible.  co-wokers are fun to fun around. costumers are great. I enjoy them. I had fun while it lasted. It just wasnt cutting it. everybody wanted to be in charge. We have 1 manager, 3 red coats, and that's it."
good,"Marriott Corporate treats is employees with respect. The franchises can be difficult as they  must abide by Marriott Standards as well as the Managing Company standards. "
good,"buen equipo de trabajo , eramos todos jovenes y con pocos prejuicios , un ambiente bastante bueno en lo social , fue dificil en cambio integrar a las personas con mas edad , acostumbrados a los cotilleos , a la competencia y al salvese quien puede , a no trabajar en grupo , pero los jovenes eramos mayoria yprevalecia el buen ambiente"
good,Enjoyed being productive with co-workers. I learned hard work can lead to promotion  and towards management.
good,There has been a lot of turnover on management in recent years. The company is growing very fast so it has a lot of growing pains.
good,its fun but you have to keep up with your work. if you don't then you fall behind and could get in trouble
good,"A typical day would insist of preparations for the arriving guests, arranging any/all guest accommodations, working with other departments to insure perfection, complete all reports that needed to be done, all while answering a multi line phone system. This job really knew how to challenge me and keep me on my toes which I liked. It is very competitive. I would have to solve problems in order to satisfy the guest. The feeling of making someone smile after a long day or fixing a situation for a guest knowing they will now enjoy the rest of their stay was very satisfying. I loved most aspects of this job but if I had to name negative ones they would be; management using negativity to inspire their employees, not every guest can be pleased no matter how hard you try, and poor benefits."
good,Overall I loved the job and the duties of the job. It was typically a steady paced environment. It was fun meeting and interacting with the guests of the hotel.I loved every single one of my co-workers. I learned so much from the experience. But the worst part was having to work by myself a lot and management really didn't like doing their job.
good,i learned flexibility.co workers are good .hardest part of the job is to work continously for 24 hrs
good,"Cleaned room, bathroom, hall ways. restocked linens. Washed and dried laundry"
good,"Starwood in general is a great Company to work for.  I have learned a lot in my time there, but it's time for a change.  The growth potential is very low and highly preferential (i.e. you have to know the right people to move forward.)"
good,"Day to day we work ethic and moral are high. All departments work together to meet end of day goals and keep guest satisfied. The environment is very supportive. The most difficult part of the job is handling unhappy guest when the reason is out of your control, such as, heating issues or something in the lines of mattress not being firm enough. The satisfaction and challenge is in keeping that same guest happy and finding resolution that is satisfying to them."
good,Enjoyed working for the Marriott corp. would have continued but my mother developed colo-rectal cancer and I had to leave to care for her out of state.
good,I enjoyed working here and moved up into management very quickly especially when Marriott took over the hotel.
good,"The staff is great. A typical day at work is ok sometimes. Sometimes u get rude people rooms to clean and you have to have patiientence .My co-works and I got along well. Hards part of my job was dealing with rude people. After I finish a room , I look back and give myself a job well done.."
good,"It depends on the department, this work place be a great place to work, nice people, friendly co-workers, but not so good management teams"
good,"Must do things a certain ""corporate"" way. Long hours but that is expected in hotel industry."
good,"I had the privilege to meet many great people both as guest and "
good,"•	F & B associate."
good,"My experience with Le Meridien was a great learning experience. As I was working as a Flight Coordinator, we were the suppliers of all the inflight requirements for Kingfisher Airlines (food, linen etc.).  At work, I used to coordinate all the operations between Le Meridien and Kingfisher Airlines involving maintaining flight reports (stock, equipments and requirements) with respect to the services provided. Overall it was a good experience."
good,staff was great
good,"Independent contractor for a interim food and beverage placement company. Duties ranged from either a banquet manager to a Food and Beverage Director.Menu meetings, floor supervision and guest realtions in Hotel setting."
good,Good is no two days are the same and you are only limited by your own drive. Great value system and very rewarding work. Hardest part is the work life balance.
good,Enjoyed working for the GM during the years listed on my resume.
good,"A typical day includes being in touch with current clients while always hunting for new business. The Westin Dhaka has taught me how to handle a mix of personalities and people from different backgrounds, further it has created a solid base to build a sales profession, if i ever choose to. The management gives immense opportunity and recognizes hard work, a downfall is that the everyday system can be school like with strict timings and guidelines. The associates working here are generally warm but not always helpful. One of the the most difficult part of the job is to deal with certain supervisors of other departments who are inept and unprofessional however will behave like they know everything. Not to mention that I work on an average 10 hours a day, 6 days a week and have little time for anything else hence a very poor work and life balance. However, the comfort of working in a hotel, a wonderfully understanding and competent boss and the easy access to information or amenities (food, air line tickets, tailors, etc) makes it an above average working environment."
good,at the westin michigan avenue it was challenging when it came to advancement. there was constant time on the floors but very entertaining with constant client change there was always a different person and a different personality which always kept me on my toes.
good,"marriott is a good place to work, if u like to be your own. balance work and life. at time u my be every busy and at time u wont but the work there is good, u won't fine it at any other hotel"
good,"Fun and fast paced atmosphere. Made a few friends, and we worked very well together."
good,1. I m very hard working guy i remember last time when we are busy that time i did packing folding ironing until night 10:00pm.
good,-a typical work day was sometimes slow it was still fun though and i would i would always find something to do.
good,"•un día típico en el trabajo:Es un trabajo bajo presion constante, en donde tuve que reportar a la gerencia general nacional y coorporativa en el extranjero."
good,"It was a good place to work. People are clicky though. I enjoyed my job, but there is no room for advancement unless you can move all over the country"
good,Not really the chance for a social life. I don't have any children so they put others in a priority position for weekends/holidays off
good,"It was a great experience because I was thrown in and I was able to get into the flow of everything right away. The hotel I worked at was running downhill with lots of employees and managers staying for only like a month or two, I was there for a year and I learned to do everything and ended up even running it as a one man show. I even had a lot of 16hour shifts which either ran from 7am till 11pm or from 3pm to 7am, but this helped me realize what I am capable of doing."
good,"It’s a good place to work. It can be very busy when there are events taking place, but overall safe friendly work environment. The benefits are great for employees as well as friends and family."
good,"I am a hart working team player, willing  to learn. Open for for any advice,  working  at the company is a best thing, the managers the are the best open for advice and mentoring."
good,"I love the people I work with at Marriott. You work hard and it's rewarding work. However, the work/life balance is hard to come by depending on what your position is. Burn out is pretty frequent especially in the Event Management world."
good,I was able to advance in the company and work in several departments hence learning the various areas of the hotel industry. I was also able to transfer to different states with my family since the Marriott is worldwide.
good,"Un lugar agradable para trabajar, con mejoras dentro del propio trabajo."
good,"Working for this company through a temp agency was not so much of a good experience. Work hours were given were short and very little pay. Maybe if I would have worked directly through the company, it may have been a better outcome."
good,Its a place to learn in your own page good amount of rooms to deal with and good number of team members to help you out. Need to understand its location and work culture
good,"Marriott International is an amazing company to work for, but it just wasn't for meant for me in the long term. I would certainly recommend this company as a place of employment to anyone. They have great benefits for anyone seeking long term employment with them. However the politics involved at the location I was assigned to, I could have certainly done without."
good,"I enjoyed the alone time I had with this job. It involves a lot of individualism and that was absolutely one of my favorite things about this job. It was sometimes busy, sometimes peaceful which I found to be a good balance."
good,The housekeeping manager was the worst but he is not there anymore they fired him after he fired me. The hotel it self was nice some of the ppl I worked with was wounderful
good,"Different managers, different atmosphere in the work place. "
good,"Very well organized company with good benefits and fair pay, work-life balance not good have to be available evenings weekends holidays even Christmas Day"
good,Get paid weekly; Always have to work one weekend day as part of your schedule; good benefits;everyone has a smile on they face; As long as you can deal with the call volume you will be great and advance quickly
good,The schedules need to be discussed of you have any other engagements like school for example other than that the pay is good and it is a good work environment.
good,"The overall Marriott company and culture is fantastic. The global design team is less aligned with that culture. People are highly competitive, advancement is for a chosen few. Some of the people there for a long time are entrenched and resist change or hearing new perspectives. People are quickly labeled, or catagorized. People are commodities, it leads to high turnover, especially high in specific teams. This needs to be addressed to make that entire team better."
good,"As virtually all Marriott hotels and the accompanying brands are now franchised properties you really have to do your homework about any interviews you may partake in, do your research know as much about the franchisee as possible as this varies dramatically and can make or break your success or overall experience"
good,I learned a lot about what I was capable of.  I was a jack of all trades as the Operations Manager at a select service hotel.  I enjoyed hiring new employees and doing group trainings.
good,"There was the 'good ole boys club' and they were extremely demanding. They kept their budget small, so turnover was high and staffing was not adequate. Pay was very low, employees with long tenure barely made over $10/hour"
good,Many location lots of challenges and great people to work with. Many cities and lots of new friends over the years. Only leaving as I need to settle down in one city and give up my crazy travel and crazy ownership.
good,"Really boring job. Marriott is not a great company to work for. "
good,I am a contractor so I do not receive any benefits or direct compensation. I make my own schedule and work independently. There are a lot of wonderful employees but I only see the ones who come to my office.
good,The location where I work is poorly managed in the area of the culinary. The kitchens are not nearly as clean as they should be for a hotel that's supposed to be at such a high level.
good,"Best perk is the discount on hotel rooms, worst part, it is looked down upon to request off. Work life balance is non existent, hotels are 24/7/364 so plan on working until 1am then back at 6am. No weekends or holidays of."
good,"Great money for someone just out of high school, you will make no money of you are lazy and un motivated. Heavy tip based job. Poor management, intemdent for long term temporary jobs."
good,This job was not exactly a career as there was not much room to move up. As for the position I was in for years I did however make great money and am now looking for a change. This opportunity with the Marriott did allow me to travel at discounted rates with great perks as I took full advantage of that.  I now look forward to trying something new.
good,I was one of thousands of franchise GM's.  The only time I really talked to a Marriott Rep. was when we had IT issues or we were being audited.  I suppose it depends if you are at a Corp owned/managed property or at franchise.  My experience was more with my management company than Marriott.
good,"Busy during season. Management was organized. Systems in place to facilitate work flow. Work days can get long, but the stress level was not that bad."
good,"I love working with the marriot hotel, they managed to be very helpful and assertive with certain tasks and created an efficient and fast passed environment"
good,Cleaning hallways stripping rooms vacuum floors mopping helping housekeeping..cleaning multiple levels of floors cleaning outside responding to calls and get service
good,"Basically a positive environment but no benefits, poor compensation an very few opportunities for growth. Other Marriott hotels offer benefits and much better compensation."
good,"Starwood is a good place to work, but they do not have advancement now that Marriott has taken over. Too much information about employees FMLA has been ""lost"" due to the merge."
good,Marriott at one time was considered a great place to work. Now it is focus on results and shareholder value above all else. I do not think as an employee you have insight into company performance and overall company goals.
good,the discounts you get for working here are amazing meeting new people everyday is amazing. the amount of opportunities you get from meeting new people is amazing i can't tell you how many times i got job offers from a lot of successful business while working here. the management does an ok job they advance people who do ok jobs if the work in morning opposed to people who literally do everything running around all night helping every other department
good,Pretty easy . My favorite part about this job was the guest. We have the best guest ever . Management is ok. The area is pretty cool. Has 3 other hotels located close by
good,The work place culture is very good . I leaned how deal with difficult gusts at hotel . I like team work at the Marriott hotel . The most enjoyable is the team work to finish the given assignment before shift  is over .
good,"Great corporate culture, truly care about the employees. Constantly changing and implementing new ideas and processes, which makes the company the #1 hospitality company in the world."
good,"A lot of team work with the staff, management not so much, staff pulled together to get things done right management pretty much hands off."
good,"Работал беллманом,чаевые платили почти все,брал с гостей по максимуму.Платил откаты за допуск к работе.Зарабатывал на всем,не гнушался ничем,каждый день ходил на работу как в последний день,главное было содрать по максимуму,пока шёл ЧМ.После его окончания все таки выгнали,но я не в убытке."
good,"For the most part working at Marriott was a team effort. all employees step up to help others. I was trusted to work alone on the over night shift as the ""person in charge"". At times this was stressful not having anyone to turn to in the event of an emergency, which happened three times since I have been there although it was also a benefit for me because i was proud of myself to step up and handle the circumstance."
good,this is a great property and it needs more time to truly become an icon in the city.  it has great people and potential which will grow with time. people are dedicated
good,The manager at the time was very unprofessional.  The employees were all nice and helpful.  My crew was breakfast.  We all helped each other get the job done.
good,"I like to have the benefits of being able to get a hotel room for a third of what the rate really is. "
good,"Staying on your feet and moving constantly was the best part. Cleaning up after tables, being a barback, plus my interactions with the customers/guests  have improved immensely. I love a fast paced work environment."
good,Not what it use to be.  In recent years benefits have dwindled.  IT management continually tries to squeeze workers more and more by taking on multiple ambitions projects at a time.  Some bad bosses abound and there's little avenue to work around them.
good,"Had a good time working at the Marriott learned a lot and had a lot of chances of advancement and management experience, always room to grow with this company"
good,"Gives you the ability to interact with all kinds of people, learn computer skills, multi task, problem solve, and keeps you busy all day which is a wonderful way to get through a work day."
good,"buen hotel para aprender, sistema opera, facto, empower"
good,I've worked with STARWOOD before they combined with Marriott. Before then STARWOOD was an ok company to work for.. the atmosphere with all staff was pretty home like. Good company to work for.
good,"Working for Marriott in the beginning was a joy.  Great benefits and a really good scheduling system too, which allowed for a good work/life balance. Once they acquired Starwood, the company culture and policies shifted to the standard corporate cubicle culture.  A lot of benefits and perks disappeared and then scheduling became rigid too. Most of all was the change in management technique; in the beginning it was a fair method with QA reviews and then positive and negative feedback were given with guidance on how to improve, if needed. Now it is solely focused on the negative.  There is no positive feedback offered on QA, just a checkbox to let you know you either met the standard or a paragraph about anything you did wrong.  I was a top performer in both sales and customer service but near the end, when I was in the top 10 agents nationwide, no one even noticed.  It was disappointing.  You can make a paycheck here but you will not be given the incentive to thrive."
good,"I enjoyed it. Nothing really stood out as really good or really bad. I enjoyed meeting the hotel patrons and the staff were always really kind to each other, even if we were in different departments."
good,"If they fixed their management problems and communicated better or had some sort of organization skills it would not have been that bad. It paid good and was easy to do. If the management liked you or if you were popular not with skills just personal, you had advancement opportunity. I hoped that changed."
good,I've worked here for 3 years and I learned a lot. Moving up and into departments was easy and my team was great. Lacking in a few management areas -would recommend to others who are looking for growth.
good,Nice place to work good work environment great coworkers i liked the variety of jobs and tasks that would pop up each day. i just don't think the pay matched the cost of living in the area.
good,"* mostly come in and take care of any fires."
good,"I feel I did not receive adequate training on the hotel software before being asked to work solo.  I asked management for additional training but never got it."
good,"I was in their second class "
good,"As i started my career with this company i cannot knock it completely, but there are many ways they could improve how they handle valued employees. I realized shortly after starting that the bottom line is the only goal in mind for some managers."
good,It's a great company they are like family... We had great time we work hard ...They gave me time off when needed ...Threw me a baby shower ....   ....
good,On ocassions pizza is bought for the housekeeping staff on busy days.Not much advancements upwards.Housekeepers need to be paid more money.Very hardjb
good,What i learned to always try to have a positive attitude no matter the problem is.The hardest part of the job was when the hotel use to be booked up and i had to rush and move at a fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job i met a lot of wonderful people..
good,Each hotel is different and company culture can really effect the middle management of an organization.  There were many different departments that were managed differently but needed to work together.  The fast paced atmosphere is a contributor for a lot of communication failure.  The company name and benefits are still a selling point and I would work for the company again.
good,The hotel is severely understaffed and it is not seen as an issue. No opportunity to advance for certain individuals. The quick pace of the hotel is compelling but it is not an industry I am interested in.
good,This is our new parent company and only a few months under their leadership so  not a lot to tell from my stand point at this moment. The Marriott chain has extensive properties and many places to choose from should the opportunity present itself.
good,"El ambiente laboral nada bueno hace falta un cambio radical de los encargados del area de mantenimiento del hotel; los responsables y cabezas del mantenimineto sabotean las instalaciones del hotel y hechan culpan a los demas para correrlos. "
good,Helping guests was great but if you didn't make your sales goals you would get written up. If you got people that had a lot of questions and took a long time on the call you have to be polite and help that customer but the long call would count against you and you would get written up. They are constantly threatening your job which makes for an extremely hostile work environment!!
good,It’s a very nice place to work and everyone is always ready to work I feel like it was in the beginning was very good but you know that a restaurant have there up and downs
good,Management cares for management - Managers get the credit when the ground level does the work.Otherwise a very good company to work for . this is all i wish to state
good,A typical day at work is set up events. What I have learned that the company was very unorganized. It wasn't really a hard part of the job. You really meet some interesting people.
good,"Since I worked there, 5 FOM's have came in and out of the Sheraton Minneapolis West in Minnetonka. That says bad things about the hotel. The hotel was always low staffed."
good,"I drove a bus to and from the hotel. There were many characters in managment that made it a harder or easier workplace, depending on who you dealt with. No clear path to advance in the hotel business."
good,"Setting up rooms for banquet functions"
good,"Great staff, fun atmosphere, as well as place to work. Pleasant customers and staff. Very relaxed work environment that was never stressful. There was always something new to challenge you."
good,"High paced, high energy.  Meet great people from all walks of life.  if you enjoy conversing with people and receiving gratification for a job well done, the hotel industry is for you."
good,"this is one of the best places i ever worked. aside from the GM who apparently could care less about real life, and the fact that in the hotel world most employees are taught by senior employees. therefore if the new employee says something or gives the wrong direction, it was probably taught to them. instead she writes your department head to immediately issue a write up"
good,"Work Allotment is ok.."
good,It was really memorable time while I work with ritz carlton abudhabi. I have got lots of experience and skills during the time of eighten months.people from different country and service they provide to customer was really nice and inspiring but didnot found any motivation and need to work for long hour up to 17 hours a day and paying just maximum of 2 hours of overtime. They Just suck blood of staff. So I leave that place.
good,"we had a hotel guest who missed his flight because he were drunk and he could  manage to checkout ,he  was blaming at night receptionest to not given the wake up call, "
good,"Working for towneplace suites was very chill, no real complaints other than the womanizing general manager that we had at the time that I worked there. Other than that I had no complaints"
good,"	Taking and delivering food orders"
good,its ok not the best discounts for employees but it helped pay the bills. But lot of work or task given to employees with not the nest pay. Long hours and inconsiderate managers.
good,"I Got a job here directly out of high school. It was an enjoyable place to work, but the management wasn't always up to par."
good,Worked part time with great people. learned daily reports and submitted daily numbers for invoice. Also helped with front desk and making sure our inventory matched.
good,great place to work with many friendly people. provide lunch which is nice. downside is housekeeping department is highly unorganized and management has not done much to rectify this
good,The position is very adaptable and easy to maintain. My main issue was the personal relationships among management. There is a lot of intermingling among co workers no matter the title and in most cases they have the advantage of advancement because of personal relations.
good,This job is for some one with more patients den the normal human being management sucks the rooms are terrible cleaning wise they always cry about money just not a good environment right now
good,"Staff and guests were great to work with "
good,"It was a good company but a bad managers, Mafia's all around and "
good,Good company with pretty good benefits.  Wages don't really match up or the income is not steady for servers and they don't compensate. Beautiful hotel to work at and show off.
good,There will be constant times where you'll be on your toes running from point A to B. Depending on which site you're sent at it can be an easy 8 hr shift or dreadful one.
good,great place to work. its under new management from when I was last there but its an easy job once u get into the swing of things. all employees are more like a family than just coworkers
good,"Great pay and benefits. Good location, not good for parking. Uniforms and pay increase provided after 90 day probation period and every year on your hire date after that. Teamwork is poor and management doesn't care to address the issues"
good,I enjoy people and get to serve them breakfast. I do wish management would be there when I get there but overall good experience working there. Wish I made more.
good,"My happy days at is when my guest are satisfy and a repeat business, I learn about making people fill very happy. I achieve in managing people and myself. My hardest part is that when I didn't up my target and staff working under me didn't meet up the set goals."
good,"Typical day work includes checking people in & out. Dealing with any complaints."
good,"This is a great place to work, fun and busy but id say that sometimes work can overrule your work life because its a 24 hours 7 days a week place."
good,"This is a really great group of people that focus on the guests. Unfortunately, as a franchise Marriott the resources, equipment, and pay are all very limited. The managers are generally good, but advancement opportunities are few. Positions are supposed to be posted, but aren't. The only way you know about them is to watch www.hospitalityonline.com. If you do apply for an opportunity you frequently find out that someone is already preselected for the position before its even posted. Work-life balance isn't really in balance here, its feast or famine depending on business. So some weeks you might work until you feel like you can drop, and other weeks have a hard time paying your bills because of too few hours. Hospitality can be fun, but it is best as a side job unless you are on a management tract. The pay isn't the best, although that is pretty standard in the area for hospitality."
good,"The best part about working at The Richmond Marrriott Short Pump is the work environment.  It is a business hotel and very formal.  The employee gets free lunch and dinner everyday.  However, the employee at the front desk rarely get any breaks."
good,"Management and coworkers are friendly, always works as a team. Not much for room for advancement. Job security was ok. Overall it was a great company to work for but it could improve."
good,"a typical day at work was ok, I started when they were still under construction so it wasn't too busy but once things go up and running business picked up a lot. the co-workers were alright some of them were nice."
good,I enjoyed the guest they where very kind. And I enjoyed the environment. The manager at the job was very respectful and understanding.
good,Cool place to work. Manager was awesome till she moved away she always made the place rock!!! An she was very caring made coming to work well worth it
good,"Great place to work to develop customer service skills. learned a lot of trade skills that will help me in home ownership and in different jobs. Management was great the benefits were ok. The Staff for most parts were great people to work with. Learned to manage my time for projects and immediate hotel issues. great support from management far as any tools or supplies needed to finish projects. did not like the part of the year when my hours were basically cut in half wish it was full time all year round. all in all I learned how to service pool and spa, some light roofing, A/C issues, locks for doors repair, dishwasher repair, painting, plumbing, carpet cleaning, washer and dryer repair,etc... awesome place to work for a limited time I dont see it as a long term position if you have children and a mortgage to pay."
good,I went from a front desk agent to being the Revenue Analyst within a year.  The managers recognize individual strengths and strive to match them to challenging work opportunities.
good,I worked here seasonally and it was ok. Management wasn't that great and we were treated like we were less than important to them.
good,"Come prepared to work hard, smile lots, and do your best. There are some great recognition programs and incentives in place including a really great employee discount if you like to travel and stay in hotels. Some departments have great management in place. It can be a struggle at times to stay upbeat when scores are low due to circumstances you can't control. You will have great coworkers, good leadership, training, and amazing guests that are easy to serve as well as those that are harder to handle. Every day will present a new challenge and be something different. This would be a five star rating if it weren't for being in so much stress and transition during the renovation phase. Things should improve greatly by next year."
good,"With a high number of meeting rooms, and an exceptionally large ballroom, the Westin Seattle has a high volume of banquet business. This makes it a great location to learn the ins and outs of banquet management, and get a larger amount of experience in a shorter time than many smaller properties would offer.  "
good,"Quite easy work, managers were great, only problem were my 9 hour shifts interfering with my first semester of college. Guests never complained and even go out their way to accommodate my help making me feel appreciative of my work position."
good,"Marriott is a great company to work for. And now the biggest hotel chain in the world."
good,"Great place to start in the hotel business, however not a good place if you're looking to be compensated well, or looking for middle management position."
good,"A typical day at work consist of maintaining a strong and safe environment for all customers and employees.  Usually, my work environment is easy going, and carries safe and fun atmosphere.  However, every now and then I am forced to conduct some form of security on an individual.  The reason for such security measures stem from one's intoxication level, and, at times, aggressive personality.  Overall, I enjoy what I do, and I would recommend my job to other people looking to get into security."
good,Usually I would do minor repairs on the hotel to keep the hotel in excellent condition for all. Great staff and management that are knowledgeable and caring.
good,"I love working here, I love assisting guests and learning new things. Going out of my way to assist someone to make them smile is what I love, making just a small difference means the world to me. I have worked for Marriott for almost two years now. I am one of the only associates who have learned almost position there and still want to learn but they have cut hours and do not use me in the areas that I have learned even though they are hiring more people. I feel that I can take that I have learned here and apply them some where else. The hotel itself is a great place to work, management is difficult to communicate with and is frustrating when I want to be there and work and have them use me but they just do not. Do not understand. The new CEO came to visit and even he complimented of how well I was doing by going out of my way to always be busy and get extra things done... However I am not getting anywhere here. it is like being in a one way relationship."
good,"I don't know if this is the same for all Marriott's, but for TPG Marriott's, the money is ok.  I KNOW I can work less and make just as much if not more money, but, as yet, have not found this new place recently (still looking).  Co-workers are very nice for the most part.  I have no idea what the powers that be have in mind when they promote certain individuals.  Management, I believe, feels they can just get any person in the position to do the job without paying respect to those of us who have received incredible accolades from guests and from the institution itself.  For example, in my establishment, I have received Associate of the Month two times in just over a year while another employee was fired once, came back, almost fired again, came back and dips their hands into other people's bank and THIS employee gets five shifts while the rest of us get only four shifts during off season.  Is there something wrong with this equation?  I'd say so!!!  The equation states that whenever I get something different from an established institution, I'm OUTTA Marriott AND the hotel industry FOR GOOD!!!"
good,I like Marriott and how they take an interest in their associates.  I just wish that some management companies would follow suit instead of treating certain jobs as being for second class citizens.
good,I would come to work about 5am from that point until 11am I was making sure that the guest coming into breakfast needs were met. also to make sure we received a great score.
good,la parte mas fácil era llegar hasta donde se tenia que estacionar el coche del huésped lo difícil era cuando un huésped se mostraba molesto con el servicio y hacer que se le bajara lo molesto con cortesías o ofreciéndole una disculpa me gustaba cuando el huésped  nos daba las gracias por el buen servicio que le otorgábamos  la gerencia les prometía cosas o estancias al huesped y no se las otorgaban y nosotros teníamos que dar la cara por la gerencia que no cumplía con sus promesas hacia el cliente
good,"Great team work environment for department co-workers. Limited availability to advance, limited positive reinforcement. Friendly family-like staff and management. A lot of information and knowledge about the company and location is essential to complete daily tasks. Pre-Arrival coordination and booking reservations apply to daily tasks. Time-share information as well as information about the surrounding area, other properties, and directions."
good,A typical day at work was to greet customers/guests take their order serve them and have great people skills make them feel welcome and at home enjoy their stay
good,i have seen very unique and high standard service in this hotel and i learn punctuality and grooming standards and how to handle the guest effectively and most important thing is up selling and standard of sequence of service.
good,Go into work and deal with customer service all throughout the shift. Customer service is huge at the Marriott hotel. Must be able to stand  for long periods of times.
good,"Served as night auditor on the graveyard shift.  Rolled all the day accounting informatino and assured that all of the hotel numbers were acurate, in addition to checking night guest into their rooms and providing invoicing for each guest.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the publlic.  The hardest part of the job was working nights by myself."
good,"I love the Marriott as a company and how professional that it is run. I  have gained an in-depth look into the world of the hotel the business and what all really goes into it. The only thing I can say is like a lot of businesses, there is a lack of communication and teamwork that needs to be addressed within the company in order for the business to be even more successful."
good,I had a very good time working at the Marriott it was a wonderful experience and it was like seeing Atlanta threw a whole new set of eyes do to the many different people I interacted with.
good,"We have had a rather large number of people leave the company, all at once, and opening day was December 29th, 2014. With such a large number of workers leaving at once, training was nearly impossible because new hires were training new hires, and things were not getting done as they should have been, and new hires calling off caused a lot of problems with covering shifts and working 7 days a week every week. The new hires would come up against a situation and immediately state that they wouldn't do the work because it was not their job (when in all actuality it was their responsibility), so things were being neglected."
good,My work at Marriott was easy going. I feel that my immediate supervisor could have been better (fair). My coworkers there were good to work with. The hardest part of my job was sometimes room turnover time. The most enjoyable part of my job was customer satisfaction.
good,"Working with Marriott has been a rewarding experience for me. It has broadened my knowledge in Sales and Customer Services. As challenging as some would say it is, I would say that is what also made me enjoy it. The amount of people I speak with on a day to day basis including my co-workers and guests keeps me excited and always engaged. "
good,I like the people I work with. The management is okay. I think that the hardest part of my job is the constant schedule changes. I like the people that I meet from all over the world.
good,"My experience with The Westin Mumbai was a learning one. It made me learn how to use my special skils of interactions & smart working attitute on the floor of a International standard hotel, also it made me learn how to stay carm in some of the panicing situation. I remember the day when we were coming closer to the LRA audit, one of the important audits of The Westin Mumbai as a result we scored 97% in the audit of year 2013-2014, little higher than the previous year audit of year 2012-2013 in which we scored 96%. The result of the LRA audits shows that the hotel has very good team work. The stress buster of the audit was the party which we enjoyed a lot with all the fellow colleauges."
good,I really enjoyed working for Macon Marriott. If i had to do it over again i would work here most definitely.I loved the people i worked with. From the first time i started working i felt welcomed.
good,Help guests with anything they might need during there stay. Management isn't the best. Co-workers are the best people i have ever worked with.The hardest part of the job would be the outside elements. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with my co-workers.
good,I worked 8 hour days where I learned interpersonal skills through telephone sales. Management was very helpful and my co workers were a valuable asset to have beside me. Hardest part of the job was selling to people who were not interested in particular properties when others were sold out. My favourite part of the job was the commissions.
good,"It's a powerful feeling to feel like you belong. Responsibilities include: Process all guest check-ins by confirming reservations in computer system, verifying guest identity, requesting form of payment, assigning room, and issuing room key in accordance with property policies and procedures. Operate telephone switchboard station. Responding to and resolving guest requests, including wake-up call requests.

Completing end-of-day activities including posting charges to accounts, completing cashier and closing reports, running night audit backup, and roll the date. Printing and folding folios and ensure that they are placed under each guest room door the night before check-out."
good,"My primary duties were to answer the phone calls from our owners and provide world class service.  We try to promote excitement about vacations and provide memorable life experiences  with every caller.  Up-selling our products and services.  The people I worked with were my favorite part of the job.  Professional and knowledgeable employees and great team players,"
good,"Marriott was a very good company to work for however there wasn't much room to advanced at such a small location. I feel management didn't reward their employees enough for all the hard work. The hardest part of the job was covering every shift call off. I've worked almost 24 four days more than twice a week. No matter how stressful the job became, it was well worth it for the guest. I love to make people smile and feel at home whenever they stayed at the hotel."
good,"Manage 305 room hotel and 143 condos with several outlets. Handle a high volume of work requests.  Learned to be very organized, efficient, fast pace, and make quick common sense decisions. Management in my department needs improvement.  Co-workers perform miracles on a daily basis because we are very short staff.  The hardest part of the job is working with individuals who make the job hard when it is not necessary. I enjoy working and meeting people on the job."
good,wonder co workers and great training classes. the housekeeping department were like a family at on e point
good,"day work,full time Monday to Sunday eight hours 9am to 5pm"
good,"It was a great job if you like a business oriented, fast paced day."
good,"Working at the St. Regis was rewarding in many ways, especially during the peak ski season, including the Sundance Film Festival.  The logistics of employee parking, baggage handling and valet parking provide a unique challenge because of the hotel's layout at Deer Valley."
good,"1.Dealing with call offs and adjusting your day"
good,"location was bought out...but the staff was amazing and the job was, we had a ton of regulars and the food was top notch."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at a Marriott was meeting the different people and cultures who stayed there. I'm sure my coworkers would agree that we, as a team, learned a great deal about properly engaging the guests. The hardest part of the job was the physical aspect of it, including running up and down stairs, constant up and down movements, and no breaks. W"
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was all the different kinds of people you meet. The hardest part of the job was not having a set schedule.
good,"This job has given me handsome experience and skill in customer handling and delivering of orders on a faster rate to reach the standards.  learned people skill to manage the crew in assigning works in the right manner, and also position them as per the capabilities and training them by understanding the weak points and training them on it."
good,"I have been working at this hotel for about 6 months and they still have not started my benefits. They recently changed management companies, so I understand that things are a bit mixed up but I don't think I should go without coverage because of it. The management is so-so. The general manager is a very good listener but doesn't act on important issues in a timely manner and the assistant general manager has gotten away with verbal harassment and sleeping on the job on his watch. Also, the pay is very low and hard to live on."
good,"Typical day of work is more guest ,less staff. I learned multitasking.The management is good.My co-workers are friendly and curteous.The hardest part of the job is unbalance ratio of guest and employee during pick hours.The enjoyable part of the job is hitting average target revenue."
good,"Everyone worked together as a team. Got to know the guests on a personal level their likes and dislikes regaurding their suites, due to long term stay mainly from relocating."
good,"I have worked at two Marriott locations. A Fairfield Inn & Suites and a Courtyard in downtown and both are extremely different. The Fairfield was more inviting and welcoming when I was training and what not and the Courtyard staff kind of made me always feel left out, until someone else was hired. Management was good at both locations, but sometimes at the Courtyard it was kind of bi-polar. This or that wasn't a big deal but this or that was a huge deal even though the situations were very, very similar."
good,"Live & Breath: flirty, insider, escape"
good,"Coworkers were like a bunch of high schoolers. They had cliques which included managers.  I learned alot from this job, because we were always understaffed and employees were under trained. The people who learned quickly had to hold the rest of the department up."
good,You get an employee rate that helps when you are traveling. Depending on the property that you work at you can easily take time off around the holidays.  The hotel industry is fun and always something different everyday.
good,"Fun environment, good people to work for and with. Hard to get weekends off. Work is fun and day goes really fast. I love working with the little kids. They are fun and full of energy and always entertained me. Sometimes hard to enforce the rules to people because they don't always want to listen. Overall, OK place to work."
good,"overall it is a basic call center life, the management team is highly professional, and will do everything in their power to help you reach goals and advancements. i would definitely recommend them as an employer"
good,"1.My first day in marriott when i joined everthing was new so i was totally confused on that day."
good,"My schedule is normally a 8 hour shift - 7am:3pm or 3pm:11pm"
good,"I loved working here. It was alot of hard work. Nice co-workers .  You start at 9 am and work until you are done.  Hardest part of job waiting on linen to put in rooms , had a shortage when I was there.   I would love to work there again.I was there for ten years  .   Pay starts at minuim wages."
good,"I manage about 20 people each day by preparing our game plan to be successful. I get everyone organized and assigned specific tasks to keep the operations running flawless. My co-worker around the hotel depend on my daily to make decisions and give advice about decisions within the hotel industry. The hardest part of my job is not being able to give people what they want. In some instances we cannot give guests what they want because there is not justifiable reason to. The hotel is in the business making money, and trying to provide the best service."
good,"A typical day at work is ongoing non-stop work. Intellectual Property for Marriott is always busy."
good,i was the av manager at the Marriott. my was to meet with all of my contact and make sure that everything is good make sure that all the av that is going for the day is set
good,"The client is always changing so you get to meet new people everyday, however there are some that come year after year and its great when they ask for me personally. Management lacks communication skill. They hire a lot of ""on call"" status which causes a lot of turn over."
good,Great meeting new people. Supervisors are very helpful and understanding.
good,"I just did a review for some reason it did it twice!Prepared food for salad bar...Set up tear down of salad bar soup bar,cleaned drink station  cleaned tables.Customer service to college kids.Enjoyed my job."
good,"Its a great hotel to work but needs to build up as the staff and management are having low co-ordination."
good,"I enjoy workig for this company, I am lookig for a better paying job with benefits."
good,"This job allowed me to manage my time, oversee myself, run the logistics for a broker firm for two states, keep track and execute sales, invoices, purchase orders, communications, shipping and receiving, storage of dry and frozen goods, inventory, filing, A/R, A/P, balancing of finances, developing new sales sheets for new products, and continuous moral of sales staff."
good,"The staff are good, but the administration is not good and bad salaries"
good,"To start the working day, room attendants need the room sheets to clean and the key to open them. Then, they have to organize the carts and get necessary linen. Because the number of room for cleaning is different every day, it is important organize the time. To have a good employees develop, I learned that people need to be listened and treated with dignity every day which is responsibility of superior positions. My co-workers were amazing people. Each of them with a interesting life story and exciting experiences. Because the job demand physical effort to accomplish the daily goals, people need to be in fine shape. I think that when the team job has a good performance, the goals were reached, and the employees feel labor stability, it is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,looking for advancement that is with a company closer to home.
good,"Marriott is a very well established company. I worked in a licensed Starbucks store so i didn't have the advantage of taking part in all the  things offered, but it was a pleasant environment."
good,Great benefits and perks but long hours left to manage hotel on your own.
good,"A typical work day would be coming in and Taking care of guest related issues and working on work orders of work that needs to be done in a timely manner."
good,cleaning about 25 rooms a day and providing great customer service.
good,"Front Desk Agent, At your Service phone agent."
good,Fast paced work environment with long hours. I've learn how to use my managers and co-workers to help for the greater good. The hardest part of my job is dealing with peoples attitudes on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part about my job is the satisfaction that I've made someones day.
good,I enjoyed the opening process and the work involved in getting the Hotel opened.
good,"temprano"
good,long but nice my co worker are team players sum days where slow but nice the guest where happy and nice.
good,I loved working at the front of the hotel. I was the first face that the guest would see and it was my task to make sure their stay was amazing. This job taught me everything about business relations and customer service.
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff workers at the facility. I have grown form a front desk agent to my current position. I met some very nice people from different businesses. The Hardest part of my job is not knowing what the day will consist of. what I most enjoy is to see a guest leave my property with a smile on their face promising to return. I feel as if I have outgrown my property for being here for four years I need more of a challenge to accommodate my skills
good,"I enjoy organizing events, managing a team, making schedules, I learn something new everyday. The hardest part about my job is starting at 4 am but once I am there I am fine. I stay so busy during the working hours a 12 hr shift flys by. "
good,"Good name recognition, but little input overall from Starwood.  Its a good starting point, but expect to work for an independent operation and held to their standards.  I would imagine a fair amount of variation in management and standards because of this."
good,"Take calls, reservations and checked in guests.  Go above and beyond for our guests."
good,"If you are just starting out this is a good place to work."
good,"Job itself is repetative as is any job, the guests that pass through are the real treat. A typical day I meet around 10 new people from all around the world. I get information about their lives and occupations that inspire me to expand my life experiences. Co- workers I do not get to be involved with very much, mostly a 5 minute update and that is about it. I update all paperwork for the coming day and ensure smooth transitions for billing and recieving payments."
good,"Most work days are spent checking-in guest and dealing with and guest issues. Handling reservations, refunding or collecting payment, and helping guest feel more at home. If there is any problems that is to much for one to handle, mangement is always there to help."
good,"i would stock my cart every morning or evening, i would go and take all the dirty bedding and towels out of the rooms and then thoroughly clean them to perfection."
good,Very fast paced work
good,The most challenging part of my job is managing operations and balancing the work load between 15 employee's on 3 shifts.
good,"This company is ok to work for. There was no room at my hotel to advance. Management also has favorites, so it makes it hard to like coming to work and lowers the work moral."
good,"Hospitality with a smile. Make reservations, data entry, and inform guests of local sightseeing. Most members of management were very diplomatic and intelligent."
good,Working one or two banquets a month was still hard. Each time it was done it was a shift of 14 hours or more at a time.
good,check hotel areas for cleanliness see what needs to be done and what doesnt. i learned how a hotel operates. management was nice but not fully on top of things. co-workers were friendly and easy to work with. the hardest part of the job would be doing all of the laundry for the hotel over night. i would say the most enjoyable part of the job would be doing the shuttles and meeting so many different people.
good,Great company some of the management needs more training in customer service.
good,"Engaging with guests though out the entire day from pilots, celebrities and flight attendants. I learned how to work the basic system in all Marriott's and how to interact with all types of guests. The Management team was great, very nice and helpful for any issue. Always able to lend a hand an provide quality service. My co - workers were great as well, always keeping the place well lit, clean and very welcoming for guests. Nothing was hard about this job, I excelled at everything I did here, it was great. I enjoyed being able to drive the shuttle to pick up guests and have a personal conversation with them on the way back."
good,It was ok to work for but the advancement isn't really there. They took great care of the customers but not so much with employees.
good,"I started at the Westin as a Front Desk Agent and learned a great deal. The enviroment was friendly enough and the management was not too bad. Occasionally you have to deal with rude people, but that comes with any job that you do. After about 9 months I was promoted from Front Desk to Convention Services. It was a lot more responsibility which I was very welcomed to. The more responsibility you have the more you learn!I worked a lot with Customer service, Delphi, LightSpeed, Microsoft office and data entry and filing. The best part of my job is meeting all sorts of different people! It's amazing all the different ethnicities and cultures you come across in this industry. The worst part of my job is honestly the pay. I feel as though we could be getting paid just a tad bit more than what we are. And checking around with our competitive hotels, a lot of them actually do pay a great deal more. I enjoy working with my co-workers and we have a solid team. I think the Westin is a great start off place. Somewhere that will teach you and help you grow, but personally it is not a job that I would choose as a career."
good,"When I started working at Starwood, the leadership was excellent. The CEO at that time was very passionate with family values, and making the company a place where employees would want to work. I experienced three different leaderships while at Starwood and the one that impacted me the most, came from the very first leadership team. In any event, Starwood is a good company. It's a company that continues to grow and looks for the best talent to employ and retain. Most of the people are very pleasant to work with and helpful. If you are looking to work for a company that has opportunities to help you grow, this is an excellent place to work at. However, you have to stay on top of your career growth to ensure your immediate manager / supervisor is consistent with your development so that you can relishes from the opportunities available there. All and all, this company is a good place to develop your skills and grow, but you have to take initiatives to make it happen for yourself."
good,Marriott is a great place to work and does accommodate to their employees and the guests the best the can ..i was very happy working with this company
good,"En el CEC de Marriott se vive un buen ambiente laboral, hay espacios de descanso, lectura, juegos, comedores y terraza para fumadores tipo lounge. Son buenos los salarios y se mantiene siempre la cordialidad."

good,Es una empresa increíble lastima que haya tanta argolla y que no se cumpla lo.que se dice al inicio de contrato ....en fin es una maravillosa experiencia está ahí!!
good,I consider myself to have been a great assets to the company.  Recieved employment of the month my 1st quarter there.  Guest wrote great reviews about me.  One of the biggest tips I received from a guest was $100.
good,"Very well 5 star hotel , but when it's comes the management it's liltle toxic when it comes to work of regular and casuals employee . Casuals is the one who working hard while other not."
good,I loved working for the company  my immediate supervisor was good most employees were very nice  Big turn over often at hotel constantly.  The general manager was very nice.
good,"Fun and very professional workplace"
good,"Kind workers,,, kind bosses,,, great hours,,, understandable bosses,,, clean environment.... Good  pay.... Exciting  place to work.... over all good place to work"
good,"Everyone has a bad day, That's where I come in, I can turn a day upside down for someone by giving them an easy and fun check-in experience as long with a wonderful stay at a beautiful place. Every guest stay is important and guest's loyalty is important."
good,"Flexible work schedule.  Good employee discounts on hotel stays.  Training was good. Loved working at home"
good,"I learned how to deal with different people from all walks of life, management was really team work oriented and we even got together after work weekly for our managers meetings."
good,It is a pleasure working for Marriott the staff and guests are amazing. Because my name got mentioned a lot I got star of the month which was a bit of a shock because I’m only doing my job.
good,"It’s good but way to long to do this. My company is a good company to work for. it’s just no longer the job for me so, I need to find something else I would like to do."
good,I had learned that job is not small things. We should not dominate  that what is our job. The main thing is we should be always happy  and smile on face.
good,"Its a a great place to work for , the leadership is great but and helpful. The appreciate there employee from time to time and it really depends on the team you work for"
good,On travail pour un agent  je ne rien à  reprocher  aux Marriott  International
good,The company has always allowed for the employees to access the latest in technology and gives support on the new advances. The company also gives a great training program.
good,I work on a zero hour contract so I am unable to give a fair review of benefits etc. but I know that I am happy here and the work is good I would recommend this to anyone looking.
good,It’s not bad  it’s just a lot of room more floors but the job is really easy you just got still focus and get your job done with out no problem you will be oksy
good,99% of hotel guests were provided by Manitoba Medical. Different workplace culture however gained hospitality experience. Hardest part of the job was security concerns.
good,Très bonne expérience avec une équipe très à l'écoute qui sait mettre à l'aise son personnel sans trop de pression .
good,A typical night at the marriot consists of setting up the bar and dealing ith hotel guests. As a bartender I was often the sole employee responsible for interacting anf taking care of the guests late at night which could get stressful depending on how busy we are.
good,Challenging but rewarding. I helped with the induction and training of new finance staff as well as reviewing policies and procedures and amending them as required.
good,"Fast pace and lovely perks. Detail was very important, but little room for growth. Great environment, always making sure the agent were never getting bored"
good,Great place to work. Very friendly and professional environment. The benefits are great. The management and staff are excellent as well. Everyone there is extremely helpful and kind.
good,I would say this job would be a great starter job. Not something to make a career of. There are alot of positions and a high turn over rate. Lunch was cheap and available to everyone except those who work overnight.
good,It was wonderful to work with a different group of people every day and doing different things around my work place. It was a great start to go into a new field of work. This was my first cleaning job and now I am working at Merry Maids cleaning people’s houses which I got to learn since I had experience. This Marriott helped me get my foot in the door.
good,Application which I was working on this project was product based applilcation. It is fun and challenging for us to test the application for Client Marriott International. It is great place to work here.
good,"I Enjoy the moments, customers are like family. Easy advancement if Intrested. The hardest part is no extra hand with deep cleaning the store, hard on the few staff members we have."
good,"I feel working at the Marriott was a great experience for me. I got a chance to experience and learn a lot along my journey. A lot of the work was hands on. But simple, so it was no problem getting the job done"
good,"Marriott hotel is mostly guest oriented,everything for guest satisfaction.its a great place to learn dealing with all the international guest all over the world.i have been working in Marriott for more than one year and i have learned so many things how to make a guest  satisfied and make him intent to recommend our hotel.i am so privileged working with Marriott hotel group.Thanks for selecting me."
good,It was very friendly everyone there was a  amazing I had to leave because of school it was a program but I love it there I had to sweep vacuum dust the main lobby and each floor
good,"Staging rooms for conferences and events"
good,The workplace had a fun environment with learning new things. Management was super cooperative. Staff training and collaboration was significantly high.
good,Kerer trabajaren una empresa sin precio consentrarme en lo  k ago buen sueldo por turno de noche bonos  horas estras día libre por mi cumpliaños y propinas  pero si arto travajo mucama y auxiliar de aseo profundo
good,"Constant learning career, must work quick and learn new things quick. Must take constructive criticism. Built long lasting relationships with coworkers."
good,It isn't the best place to work if you are naturally slow. The training process was difficult to keep up with and there is A LOT of work place drama. Wouldn't recommend trying to make a career out of it.
good,Good benefits. Great open door policy. Flexible schedules. Easy  transferring between departments within the hotel. I would recommend this company as an employer.
good,It’s a great place to work you can learn a lot if you willing to. And very good people who are willing to teach you great benefits and all that take care of you
good,I can not say enough great things about Marriott. The opportunities are endless and you are provided with the tools to be as successful as you want to be.
good,"Great company to work for. Pretty great benefits. Not enough pay tho. Either way, I'd still probably work there again. You kind of got stuck if you worked in my Dept. They would never hire anyone else in case you wanted to move up or transfer departments."
good,"I made a lot of friends and I was always happy to work there it was my second house, the squelcheduled was great and I always get the days off when I requested it."
good,"Mostly you take hotel reservations, but in my time with Marriott I started as Worldwide reservation specialist then moved to the Platinum Desk and ended on the Customer Care Desk"
good,"Worked many hours never had time for life situations. God forbid you take a weekend off, you’ll work 14 days before another day off. You’ll learn a lot but at what cost."
good,"Great place to work with great people. Learned a lot of accounting information. Free meals. PTO, Vacation, Sick, all after one year of employment. Cons- Not very much advancement."
good,It was a ok job. I didn't mind doing the work. I just disliked when things got piled up and it fell on other workers and we couldn't complete it because it was to over bearing for us.
good,"Great place to work, but you must know how to take care of guests and provide excellent customer service! You are at the front of house at the desk and must be able to manage all kinds of questions and concerns from guests."
good,I have worked for Marriott about 10 years in all and believe my skills put me more in a managers position at this time I'm my career. But is not notice I am now trying to pursue that.
good,Hospitality work is always hard work for decent pay. If Hospitality work is something you are in for this is a great place to work. There is a tight knit family atmosphere and the work is honest. Advancement is available to those who want it
good,It was a great job I really enjoyed it wish I could return but I had to relocate I made sure all my work was filled up done and also clean and fresh!!
good,"great company with good benefits. flexible hours, however it's a 24 hour establishment and is open on holidays. great parking for employees. uniforms are provided."
good,The HR department when I was there had several fun incentives. We would play games at meetings and would win nice prizes.  Management has favorites and allow some things with certain employees but reprimand others.
good,"Wonderful experience, great growth opportunities, excellent team of people to work with.  However the company tries to guarantee loyalty by keeping employees in same positions for extended periods to gain experience with in the company as Marriott rarely recognizes experience gained outside of Marriott. Promotion from within is indeed possible, however only after 3-5 years of employment (proven loyalty)."
good,I was working for room service so just did my work and leave i did not get any benefit work for them short time but i can tell you they are very clean a
good,I always enjoyed going to work at this property!! had a great management team and desk staff that I worked closely with daily and never had to question what I was worth to the property
good,Answered incoming calls using the reservation software.  Provided excellent customer service while selling various room types at suggested locations. Timed call while being evaluated on a monthly basis by the supervisor.
good,It is a pretty chill job and the guest are so interesting and diverse.The workplace is not that diverse and the hardest part is the management that has been there a long time they are stuck in their own management ways.
good,I worked at a slow paced Marriott where you stand for the majority of the eight hours but could always go back and take breaks as long as someone was up front and didn't have to clock out for lunch. They also allowed you to get leftover breakfast at 11 every morning if you were working. The main thing to worry about is the training and learning the computer systems properly.
good,"It was a great place to work when it came to the people. However, the management was pretty closed minded when it came to the food operations side. I left because they were not giving us the tools to do our job efficiently."
good,"I feel that I am fully invested in where I work, but the company is not invested in me. I feel I am not fully compensated for the multiple jobs I perform for the company. I am reliable and eager to learn new task at hand. Being organized is an important part of the job. I want to an opportunity where I can succeed fully to my potential and to learn a long the way."
good,"mauvaise ambiance de travail au sein de mon service . et mauvais management, je ne me sentai pas à l'aise en allant au travail"
good,Marriott training program was very detailed trainer was very patient with you. Knowledge of properties is very important. Also being able to work with guest and understand there needs is great.
good,Management when I was there was great. Always upbeat and happy people. They stuck with me through 2 surgeries while I was employed there. My job was never in jeopardy. They we're very caring and accommodating
good,The property is mismanaged and unorganized.  The General Manager and Executive Chef are disrespectful and create a hostile work environment.  The management company doesn't seem to care to get involved.
good,"I worked at a full service Marriott hotel but it was a franchise location, not corporate. I enjoyed the full service environment and being able to accommodate most of the requests/needs of the customers."
good,"Productive and active workplace"
good,"I loved working at Marriott Reservations. Very relaxed and fun. I enjoyed speaking to different people from everywhere...going everywhere.  "
good,"they're a nice company but its not necessarily the best.i work at an extremely small hotel where they don't really care, but that could just be my management. i would recommend for someone who wants a smaller pay for a stressful job"
good,"This job requires more sales than I expected.  You receive a bonus for the time share and credit card referrals, but you are expected to provide them to callers."
good,A stressful but fast-paced job.  Plenty of opportunity if you seek it.  An ultimate 'take out what you put into it' type of work.  An enjoyable opportunity.
good,Marriot has its ups and downs like many companies. I was not with them long enough to accurately provide feedback. I can say if you want it go for it and the rest will fall into place.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the staff. i really love my team and i'm so proud to have been apart of such an amazing group of people. "
good,"The people that work there (supervisors and co-workers) are all awesome. Hours are somewhat flexible which is helpful, and all training is provided. They don't push you to do things before you are ready, so you can really be comfortable."
good,"The Managers where pretty upfront and new about stuff. Nothing was really to stressed there. Wasn't just a night auditor, was everything to cook, to laundry, to room cleaner. It was okay till they hired another night auditor."
good,"Work was good, most of the employees are good to work with"
good,"Learned plenty about customer service, scheduling, dispatch. Worked with accounts. Great environment. A lot of team work. Can be very fast pace. Worked with different clients."
good,"Very great company to work for. Energetic team, and you are treated like family. The work experience at the job, is great for anyone that wants to step up in life"
good,Working at the Marriott you gain a lot of knowledge and learn the ropes of preforming at guest expectations. Great management team who work with your schedule.
good,"Had to leave due to two disabilities making me less capable to do this specific work. "
good,"I've experienced 3 different managers in my time at this company one absolutely crazy, another passionate; another apathetic. My enjoyment of this company came through the passionate leader. I worked myself hard and knew the managers who appreciated me and the ones who could care less."
good,"el trabajo es buena, todos se adaptan al trabajo, solo falta mas enfoque al empleado, una frase dice, para que los clientes sean tratados bien primero debemos de tratar al equipo de trabajo como se debe."
good,"The location that i worked in was under renovation, it was a franchise property and management had no idea what they were doing. there was constant turn over of employees and management."
good,It can be taxing because of the amount of work and effort that is required.  If you are capable then it would be a fine job but not without long hours and heavy work hours for select periods of time. A knowledgeable and professional individual would find it slightly mundane and boring at time but it can nevertheless become exciting if you are willing to do more then what is just routinely expected of you.
good,It is a fun place to work.  Employees are very cooperative.   The benefits need some improvements. The pay is really for my experiences.  Overall its okay.
good,"As far as hotels go, Marriott is probably the best brand to work for. They have properties all over and are continually expanding and adding more hotels. The employee rate is usually a fraction of the regular room rate, even at some of their signature hotels. Also, a good place to advance your career."
good,"The problem with this place is that is next to impossible to get rid of poor preforming employees, and these poor performers knew it. The upside to that was I you did perform well, you stuck out and got noticed.Good benefits, not so good pay."
good,"Pittsburgh Airport Marriott, Coraopolis, PA • 1995 – 1999 • Bartender/Server/Hostess"
good,"It wasn't a horrible job some Co workers were awesome and most guests were great people, but the management excluding a few were terrible to deal with and the pay was not enough for the amount they demand from you"
good,"I was with the company for 3 years, I truly enjoyed it for the most part. As for growth I found it to be unfair sometimes. It always seemed if you rubbed elbows with the right people in the corporate office you moved up. Which I found very uncomfortable and unfair. Just a simple front desk employee but corporate had me training GM's and AGM's. When confronted about moving forward the area manager would always put aside my request. Even after putting in my time into the company and still training managers and assistants for them with no pay increase at all. I stayed devoted to the company until management failed me after many months of requesting to fix my hours. They threw me under the bus to corporate to save there own selves. Definitely a sad experience for me. I loved my job"
good,"Great company to work for. Most hotels are franchised owned, no two are the same. Look at the hospitality companies first before applying. This is a 24/7 business, you'll work be required to work all holidays"
good,good opportunities through corporate locations. franchise locations may vary from the mission and operate more independently at times. Work culture would improve with more involvement and consistancy from  corporate headquarters
good,The hotels are all over the place so options to travel are great. They are usually always up to expectations for cleanliness. The managers are nice at a lot of locations. The hotel tries to work with your availability.
good,I had a great time working with people from different sections.I learned a lot for international welcoming and improved my skills on the front desk.I was happy to work in this hotel even for a short time.
good,Marriott is a great company to work for. There a lot of opportunities to learn and grow in your career. You get to work with every single department which helps you learn even more about the hotel as a whole.
good,It was a good place to work at if you want time to go by far housekeeping is a best job always busy I work overtime every Friday it was a good place to work co works we’re friendly and had good training at that time
good,"A typical day at work varies depending on what kind of function you're working. Marriott offers benefits with full time employment, as well as great hotel discounts."
good,Based off what you put into it you can achieve a rewarding career at marriott with rapid advancement opportunities if you are willing to relocate and learn new things
good,"Unfortunately way too structured and not enough to learn and develop at if you can only choose one branch of it. Takes way too long to get a promotion and grow in your career learning new something every day and developing yourself. Happy place for people who love stable jobs and more concentrate on staying home with family and only coming to work for 8 hours to do work because you get paid, not enough for motivated leaders who are ready to stay longer, do more, grow and develop."
good,"This was an overall great place to work. The management staff was great, the general manager was great, and all of the other staff was wonderful. Those factors made me enjoy my job even the more."
good,Customers were great. Most of the employees were good to work with. Always stayed busy. They had a good employee discount. Always took care of their employees.
good,"Great company, It was just an internship so I couldn't get a great panorama of the company"
good,"My intention was to work there temporarily while I recovered from chemo treatments.  I enjoyed learning the new job, the people were nice and the management wanted for us to succeed in whatever position we choose to be in - reservations, customer care, elite services, management, etc. I ended up staying there for 4 years.  They have great benefits at Marriott but it was the pay that finally made to look for another job.  Great job for retirees, people nearing retirement, physically handicapped, Vets, and those just out of high school."
good,"Love interaction with people."
good,A typical day at work would be arriving and going to your station to stand for 8 hours and fulfill your job plus you are given a checklist. The items that you are given are the same every day and very doable. I have learned a wide variety of management items from the job. The culture at my specific location was at times loud a hectic but as the daytime employees left the hotel became a quite enjoyable place.
good,Marriott is doing pretty well in employee recognition. The management always encourages and empowers the employees to engage with guests to provide good customer service.
good,"A good place to work and friendly environment. Poor Management, decision making and lack of communication on managing staff to co-department managers."
good,"I enjoyed working for Marriott. The pay was alright, could have been a bit more for working overnights. However, I was only part time and it was my first job like that so it was fair."
good,Good company to work for and i would recommended anyone who is looking for work. This company got great opportunity to advance. I do not know what else to say. I have said all that i could.
good,But overall I like the job I’d recommend working nights because the days don’t get much business. And if you choose to work banquets you only get your hourly pay you don’t get tipped out for each banquet.
good,"On a typical work day, I would take home great tips and it was fun being able to learn about and drive different types of vehicles. I learned how to back into parking spaces and how to drive bigger vehicles, such as vans and SUVs. I almost learned how to drive stick, but i was too afraid. Management was okay for the most part, but when it came to advancement, I was only able to be a shift supervisor. They would choose other people to do higher positions, and i felt like i was being discriminated against. The hardest part of the job was working in the cold. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet famous people."
good,"Very good company to work"
good,Marriott International is well known in the hospitality industry with hotels and resorts all around the world. Like other hotel chains Marriott operate 24/7/365.
good,"My experience is limited only to working in the Waltham Abbey Marriott branch. "
good,"Work, work, play, work. It was a franchise that had some rules that were different than the main company. It was a good place to work, but the only challenge was the new managers every few months."
good,"Marriott is a fun company to work for, they enjoy targets and results and promote self development. Marriott is the perfet match for someone who would like to progress wihtin the Hospitaly Industry."
good,Staff are hard working and serious about what they do. A place like this makes one realize the importance of detail and building a convivial atmosphere even among the staff.
good,"Great place to work, fast paced "
good,"Mariott is a great company. The benefits are great, there are people who are willing to help you move up or around the company. HOWEVER, especially if you're looking to go into management. You must have a love for hospitality! If you don't it will be extremely hard to last. The hours are very long, at least 10 a day. The constant change in policy will be a headache all on top of managing an operation.  Be sure, that this is what you to do. If it is you'll love it and never leave the company.!"
good,"I loved working for Marriott. I worked front desk at a Springhill suite and a Courtyard. The job itself is very enjoyable and easy to learn. The only problem I came across was management. IF you have a good manager by your side. The job will be very pleasant, if not you are not going to have a very stressless work environment."
good,When we first came in it was joyful and fun. The mornings are a bit hectic but the afternoons make up for it. What I like the most is that good work ethics are recognized and appreciated and lead to higher success and responsibilities.
good,"The Marriott International, Inc. was very stressful because of the work load that we had to do meaning washing , drying, pressing, folding the linen and tablecloths. Having to work with people that didn't know how to speak English well and there was a lot of failure to communicate different job tasks."
good,During my time at the Courtyard Marriott I learned a lot about stepping into a higher position. I got to work among a great team in the hospitality business.
good,very demanding challenging keep you busy all day made the day go bye fast felt like you were accomplishing what needed to be done everyday on the job .Did learned how to take pool reading . my boss was a very nice guy helped when needed if needed.Very friendly i enjoyed my job .
good,"worked here for over 20 years in Detroit, MI. The staff is very friendly and very flexible with hours. As a resource that has been there for over 20 years they treated everyone faily."
good,I like the job. It's really easy and simple. All you have to do is check people in and deal with the occasional complaint. Paperwork is not too daunting. The management could be better as they are a bit disorganized and don't know much about anything besides scheduling and refer most questions to HR. The discount is great and perhaps the best thing about being there. It would be awesome if the pay was a bit more substantial.
good,"Asociados con la camiseta muy bien puesta, siempre se preocupan por que crezcan en la empresa y se les reconoce."
good,Marriott is the largest Hospitality company.  They have good strong foundation on running the business.  Good strong culture.  Very clear on policy.  Strict
good,Houseman on grounds organize warehouse new merchandise to separate loading unload takeing orders get dirty linnen to laundry then take clean linnen to the house keepers or if the people as visiting there take what they need plus meeting different people it's a nice place there Marriott
good,"My coworkers, direct managers, and workplace were wonderful, but things at the corporate level were notoriously awful. It was hard to get raises, have job growth, or solve basic business problems because corporate was not interested in the little people. I had years of experience and months of seniority at my job, but would often have positions directly above me be filled by young people directly out of college who had no experience. I loved my job, but I left because I had medical bills, and the job was not financially sustainable."
good,meets the needs of all culture and people some times slow in the restaurant some times busy  just never know just do your job get work time get along with everyone and its ok job
good,"neel kamal restaurant is far away from this restaurant , so other things are some but new thing is I learn about how can I adapt my self in another or new places"
good,"depends on functions going on  prepare food for restaurant and get ready for any banquets, buffets etc  cook and prepare foods for that day affairs and begin prep for following day"
good,I loved my job but at times it became too much. Management took advantage of people who worked hard but did nothing about people who did not work hard.
good,My only complaints about this job was the fact that the department I advanced to was end dated. Also I got increasingly more annoyed with the type of employees they begun to hire after contracting Randstad to staff the call center.
good,"A normal day of work consists organizing my agenda with the respective clients. I learned to be  very determined in achieving my goals and achievements through management persistence and  put this in practice . "
good,Marriott it was good company since I started working there the manager where good even employee it is good company I can recommend to everyone who want to work there
good,This employment was secured during my high school and college years. it was a great learning experience and Mgmt was always willing to give me the training and education I needed to grow. I would have stayed with them longer but I decided to move to FL after my college education was completed.
good,"high quality expectations and experiences."
good,"Great place to meet and talk to people from all walks of life, fun atmosphere, great training, hours were long but was able to use my people skills to help many people .."
good,most notable memory is the housekeeping manager telling me i wouldn't be able to make it working in a hotel downtown (I've been downtown now for 2 years). front office managers were very knowledgeable. not much room to advance at this property as it's very small. lowest average pay of all hotels in the sesame place area. (9.25 starting).
good,Great just misunderstanding with hours and can get very stressful with the customers demands  Time doesnt ade up to the quality of a worker. Compassion for workers insanity is over looked
good,"Your typical fast paced clean clean Marriott hotel rooms to their high standard, empty trash cans, clean sinks, tubs, and toilets kind of job. 30-40 hours a week job."
good,"The day-to-day can be stressful with guests, but good management means it's never that bad. However bad management makes it terrible. There was sadly a lot of bad management in my time here. This location and position on site seems to be forever understaffed, and so the employees there are forever overworked and trapped doing exactly what they are doing because they can't afford to move someone up if that means losing them from their current role. "
good,"i worked with sheraton actually it was great "
good,If you like hospitality this company is for you. The say employees are as important to them as the costumers. This is true for the company but every location is different and not every GM is great. Pay is decent benefits are usually good.
good,"the managers were inappropriate towards female workers, the employee elevators were always broken so the entire building was using one elevator, was very fun and interesting working in an environment where you got to meet such nice and interesting people."
good,"Shows a great compassion towards staff, it is kind of a fun environment even though there is some times where we tend to feel very stressed during the peak time.Staffs are very understandable"
good,Geared toward previous full time employment. Welcomed back. I worked with the company full time from 1985 - 1990. I began working full time at my present.  I returned part time from I think 1992 to possibly 2016.  The hours for part time increased and I could no longer fullfil the hours required along with my full time job 40 plus hours as well. Over all I enjoy working for Marriott.
good,"typical day at the marrott was fast pace,Ilearn how to clean a room . management was some what   helpful not always. "
good,"Marriott was a great place to work. The training is adequate but the job can be  little intimidating at first. Everyone is willing to help everyone else, a very team oriented organization."
good,"Coming from the Westin Family, the hotels I worked with truly felt like family.  We cared for many, many travelers of all sorts. When aquired by Starwood, many services were cut to improve the bottom line.  Tough to maintain a customer service business when customer services is minimalized."
good,Wonderful Property with great benefits. Beautiful place to work with nice people. They have a complimentary cafeteria for all employees to enjoy their lunch at.
good,"unorganized, management was not qualified to lead the team. continual profanity used on the job and in meetings. partnering with Marriott tea and my recruiters, I learned alot."
good,"Great place to work, very competitive but you have the ability to move up. Union environment but as long as you are following the agreement, you will not have any issues."
good,"This was my first hospitality job, and I enjoyed working here. I applied for a server position in the restaurant, but was hired as a Human Resource Assistant. Then, after a few months, I became the only Human Resource person, which was a bit terrifying. I left basically because I was paid too little for far too many responsibilities for an untrained, under-qualified person. I had no idea what I was doing, and was left to figure it out on my own, which could go really wrong when it comes to HR."
good,you get the good and bad with this as you would with any other organization....work hard and be respectful and you can grow quickly.  Choose not to represent the brand properly and youll be looking for work elsewhere.
good,"Marriott is a great place to work, you just have to remember that there is Marriott INTERNATIONAL and Marriott FRANCHISES! international is great, offers great benefits,  fast paced work environment, definitely challenges you in a lot of good ways buuuttt... franchises are pretty much the devil! i have a very strong opinion because i have worked very closely with both and always go corporate if you can!  You definitely have to be ready for anything the moment that you walk through the doors but as long as you keep a positive attitude you'll have a good time and the pay is so so compared to cost of living in my area. I will say though that they are always willing to do just about what ever it takes to keep the best employees so work hard and do your best for 6 months and then have a sit down with the manager of your department!"
good,"Better staff more pay  when staff is low call temp service would be helpful.I have some good days some bad days cleaning 44 or 34 rooms is a lot over better rate of pay.stock closets with linen considering  we go outside in the cold and rain ,snow from building  to building."
good,"The company provided decent housing for us, free food and transportation. Although they did not hire the best of staff and exploits the lower level staff most especially the Housekeepers by under-staffing and not recognizing good work."
good,"Direct leader in my department respected our work/life balance. "
good,"However quite difficult to progress within the company for a higher positions at time. You tend to get that feeling that guests get too much and make use of that according to the company standards, which might be irritating for the employees."
good,"Productive , good working environment . Good Organizational culture"
good,"Hard working ,responsible energetic team work team player always be on time fork work .looking for great company to grow up better location and better benefits"
good,This is where I learned all of my multi-tasking skills. As an outlet director I was in charge of 4 different outlets. I had to use my time and skills all day at all outlets. Being able to change gears for the staff and guests is a very valuable skill I learned while in this position.
good,Working at the hotel was fun. It was a great environment and coworkers were fun to work with but upper management was harder to deal with. Upward mobility was limited. Perks of working in a Marriott hotel are the discounts on hotel nights around the world.
good,"A typical work day consisted of building repairs, keeping common areas clean and tending guests needs and requests."
good,I learned a lot from this.  I use a lot of these skills still today even though I no longer work.  I only left as I became a mom.  Otherwise I would have loved to have stayed there.
good,Very outgoing and social jobs with lots of friendly interaction and consistent ongoing tasks. Good opportunity to meet all types of people and develop social skills
good,They really needed to hire more staff. Management put too much work on us sometimes. They would interview people and not hire many. Other companies weren't team players. They would get us to come help other positions but wouldn't help us which isn't fair at all.
good,The hotel was average. The event was for a worthy cause to assist the veterans. I enjoyed capturing photos of the veterans and participating in the event.
good,The work environment was fast past and always changing daily. Management gave me every opportunity to succeed at my position and help me with any problems.
good,"Working in the restaurant as a food runner was great.  The night shifts were fun and profitable, of course it depends on your co-workers; working and average of 6 hours a night, making at least $100.00 on average (weekends you would leave with more).  Management attitude and skill set vary, some were hands-on and some were pencil pushers.   I recommend this job for anyone that is in college and needs to pay their way through school."
good,"Atypical day at work at the Ritz Carlton was chaotic, but yet refreshing. You meet new people while serving gusts from all around the world. I learned how to engage with people from different backgrounds. Also learned how to run a restaurant on some of the busiest days ever. My supervisor was AMAZING. He groomed me into the young lady i am today. The hardest part of the job is being able to juggle the busy moments with a smile. I love the atmosphere, the family vibes from the establishment."
good,"I learned a lot for this job.  Typical day is working with the restaurant, lobby bar, and room service.  Constantly on your feet making sure everything went smoothly."
good,The job was good. I got to meet allot of people that worked with all types of different businesses. It was early morning hoursso I was able to work a second job and was off on the weekendsand that was perfect because I have three kids.
good,"Loved the job, and the people. It was a fun environment to work in, although not knowing what time you would finish was hard. The best part about the job was it was close to home."
good,"This was an excellent workplace for gaining skills with speaking to people, and gaining experience with an overall work ethic, as his was my first employment."
good,"I have worked overnight, it was easy not a lot to do but you don't make good money unless you are valet parking. Bellman, you don't make a lot of money because you work for an outside company, town park. pay is $9.50"
good,Being a Chief Concierge was a great experience.  I learned about the hospitality business. I liked taking care of the guests. It was fun meeting people from all over the country and world. Working major holidays was the hardest part of the job.
good,"Typical day consisted of answering phones and assisting guests. Many guests return every week, which makes building professional and personable relationships easy. Loved my manager."
good,"Everyday is a new day. There's never a dull moment working in one of the most fast paced, versatile, multicultural, learning facilities under a great management. If you are a passionate and hard working individual who puts your heart in what you love to do, every company you land in becomes your home, your family."
good,"Marriott Marquis has taught me patience and helped me gain the necessary skills needed to become a positive asset in the workplace.  "
good,It's ok but not the best. I don't think I would like to stay at this place. The moral has good down a bit. Contracts changing every year is not a GOOD LOOK.
good,"it was fun because of staff but of course, it is a big hotel with high standards it was hard work but it was worth it and I would recommend it to a friend"
good,"clean cut button up clock in. Start by checking logs pools boiler room fire sprinkler inspections. Elevator checks, FAU, and plumbing repairs while assisting with guest issues. Management was poor, not following up with projects. Hardest part of my job was getting the wi-fi to connect for guests. Finishing an ongoing project was the most enjoyable."
good,"Daily task and challenges intrigues the work even more, with helpful colleagues and good workplace culture that is fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of the work is to be able to meet different people on a daily basis and create good memories with the guests."
good,"Rewarding opportunity for individuals who excel in change management, leadership  and operations. Must be willing to work long hours when necessary to achieve desired outcome. On call 24/7 and willing to work weekends and holidays when the operation demands."
good,"I get to work at 6;45am and start with my daily checklist. by 7 I am running a shuttle and taking guests to the work place. When I get back to the hotel my day consists of daily check list, Communicating with different departments, communicating with guests, placing orders at our Rivue restaurant and providing excellent customer service"
good,"Did not enjoy the corporate climate. "
good,The job is great it is fast paced and there is never a dull moment but it is very stressful and demanding. You're required to stand your whole shift which puts a ton of strain on your body.
good,"You spend 40-50 hrs a week cooking and prepping 5 to 6 days a week for anywhere to 8-12 hrs a day."
good,"Polish all mirrors"
good,It was fun to work there as a bar bask in my younger days but as you grow into adulthood need more hrs or better pay to provide for you or your family
good,"cadre de travail très agréable, beaucoup de polyvalence demandé"
good,"Responsabile for looking after guests and attending to their needs during their visit. Welcoming them to the restaurant, escorting them to their table and also informing them of any special offers or meals."
good,"During my tenure, management in my department were not that great however, I enjoyed what I did for my customers, I really am a customer related individual and this is a great place to advance your skills and make magic."
good,Marriott is a large recognizable name.  Guest expect a lot when the arrive and Marriot delivers.  You must always be up to date with local attractions and events.  Hardest part of this job is keeping up with local events as they are constantly changing on a daily basis.
good,"Hotel is situated in the heart of the city. Convenient location and everything is quite easily accessible like the malls, restaurants and the grocery shops. Staff accommodation is 08 minutes walking distance from the hotel. Working hours at the reception are 09 hours exact out of which 01 hour is for a break."
good,Everyone knows each other and helps out when they can. You even know some of the guests to recognize their needs immediately. The managers are excellent at fulfilling your needs.
good,"I left because they changed management and I didnt agree with the changes of the new management group. "
good,"a typical day at work is making sure the bar is  properly clean and sanitized as well as making sure we have everything we need to get the shift started. What you learned working as bartender manager and bar server is always a surprise to look forward to help me to learn more each day someday can be better them other days and some can become overwhelming help me remain focus and stay clam and collected and be professional at same time As a manager "
good,I worked for the Ritz Carlton in the spa department. There are peaks and lows to how busy the spa is during the year which effects hours/pay. Slower period resulted in pay cuts due to low occupancy. Also less hours without room to work lateral service (working in other departments to make up for hours lost due to low occupancy). Love the company culture though! :)
good,"Great place to start working for newly graduates of high school. Great atmosphere as far as location. Sitting across from the ocean, its a beautiful location for vacation, weddings and so much  more."
good,"Set up small to large ballrooms for parties, weddings, business meetings etc. I gained people skills and learned how to work as a team. Setting up last minute parties is very hectic but teaches you how to get work completed quickly and correctly."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the Banquet Captain Chris. Typical day was good.  Not learning much but stay busy. Also, the hotel staff in general was great.  I also work with the housemen setting tables and placing pens and paper on table.  Set up chairs in the ballroom.  At times I would also be a bartender, set up bars with beer wine and liquor, cups and lemons and limes, etc."
good,"better then when the starwood collective owned the  hotel I had worked at. Positive attitude for workers, carred for them and worried of their day to day work. Nice management, terrible pay"
good,I loved working for the Marriott. The management at my property thous was terrible very selfish and inconsiderate. Definitely did not treat all employees equally. When I put my two weeks in my manager did not even bother to say goodbye or thank you to me. I did feel very unappreciated. I would recommend working for Marriott they have great benefits and the coworkers were amazing. I think the management needs to care about the employees more interested of only focusing on their own success.
good,"Wonderful structure. Experienced leaders and professioal personnel.  Growth opportunity.  Flexible, and provided me with the motivation to be an extremely productive, valuable employee."
good,"Its a very fun.place to work at, even after the long working hours. The long working hours are applicable to majorly to tge kitchen and service departments. Otherwise its a fun work place, very productive career wise."
good,"Conduct successful cash audits in the morning and at the end of each shift.Trains new team members with positive reinforcement and respectful, encouraging coaching while accurately taking to go and special orders."
good,"Day at work was as a first busy time but if stuff is well trained and people know what to do it is not so difficult to handle."
good,"Was nice you work there some days it was relaxed or it could be very busy all depends on the events that are there in the day, its nice place to meet new people and network."
good,"I was a hostess here. I wanted to move up to the front desk. The management did not want me to move on. I feel the only thing the management cared about was going out with each other and partying. Grant, this was 7 years ago. I'm sure they have replaced the managers by now."
good,Definitely not for the faint of hearts. Fast paced but efficient and fulfilling. 10 hour work days fly by quickly as there's always something to do. For the go-getter!
good,"This property has over 1,000 rooms. On any given day our average check-ins were around 750 and checkouts around the same."
good,"beneficios para los empleados, trato con el empleado"
good,My overall experience at the hotel is a positive experience. Sometimes it can be demanding and difficult at times. But it helps you create a since of will and know how to deal with difficult people during a difficult time.it definetly teaches you patients and the know how to deal with unexpected situations..
good,"I learned how to be patient, I learned customer service I make a lot friends, I learned to be a good team leader good plase to work .The hardest part the managers the change a lot"
good,I would draw the custom kitchen designs fro the salesman for the customers. I enjoyed helping the customers when they can in for help. I answered telephones in the kitchen department and did some office work too.
good,"it was alright.Very hot environment, liked the hours of the day we worked. people were nice to work with. The free breakfast was great had a lot of variety of food to choose from"
good,"long hours, only one day a week off. No matter how much you give management wants more. There is defiantly not a team atmosphere."
good,"there is no work life balance, at least not at all when you are in an executive position. working Hr can go up to 18hrs,"
good,"The company is reliable work wise as I have been working here for the past twenty years. However, it could be better in respecting seniority amongst its employees."
good,"Good benefits for the job sector.  Pay could have been better. Worked with some excellent managers. Hours were long, holidays were always work days, including Christmas."
good,"My experience being a server there was very stressful and uneasy at times, sucks if you're extremely not use to large and I mean LARGE crowds like that. I wanted to challenge myself, so I went for it. The pay was here and there, some days you'll make something in the triple digits and other days in the double digits depending on what section you're assigned in. The point system there is unreasonable and it eventually became too much for me."
good,"Personalmente ho avuto un'esperienza molto positiva al W Hotel di Barcelona, l'ambiente di lavoro era ottimo, le persone con cui ho lavoro erano tutto molto socievoli e il team work è stato molto costruttivo."
good,Job required plenty of patience and multitasking. It was also a plus to know your surroundings within the city so that I may be able to assist guests or direct guests to their preffered areas. Knowing how to provide great customer service is also a must. Being organized and prioritizing guest and department requests was very important as well.
good,Protection One was in the process of changing over to ADT at the time of my employment. They were in a state of flux therefore it is difficult to provide a fair review.
good,"Stressfull a lot of time because this is a busy hotel but you can learn a lot from here. Starwood takes care their employees very good, you will receive a lot of training course, complimentary meals and discount when booking other hotel under the company."
good,"Working here taught me so much, how to handle myself in the craziest of situations. Work culture is something I genuinely feign for; I personally love working so nothing was wrong there. The hardest part of the job sometimes was handling the managers. I made some of my closest friends there. A typical day at work was getting excited to see the team I was working with that day. The encouragement my team and friends brought me. I worked really hard for that company so never  anything went wrong. I hardly ever had any problems. Human resources was my favorite part, she was one of my biggest support systems and having that in my life as a college student encouraged bigger things for me.  "
good,"from checking in guest to joke around, its like working with family."

good,A place to gain and grow skills in accounting. Opportunity to grow knowledge especially in full set of account is open for all Finance staffs. Also to relationships among other associates is the best part and work as a team.

good,Always busy and we merged with Marriott. All systems are changing. I learnt a lot through the transition of changing management company and new policy.
good,"GREAT PLACE TO WORK answer telephone calls from guests seeking to make or cancel hotel reservations. They greet arriving guests, assign rooms, issue keys, and collect guest payment and billing information. ... Upon checkout, agents calculate the guest's final bill and collect payments."

good,Great place to work. Loved the environment and the clients who came in were very nice and professional. I bartended and served but was hired in just to bartend. My only complaint is that on occasion I did have to serve too.
good,"I helped my customers pick out pictures to go into snow globes , picture frames , key chains etc. I was a greeter. I took pictures of families, couples, and singles before they went into ICE."
good,Working with supervisor everyday to check on my work. Make a bed in every room. Vacuum the floors. Replace coffee and coffee things. Replace dirty cups. Clean the bathroom. Throw garbage and replace bags.
good,"never knew what to expect, daily duties were changing all the time without notice.  Management needs to acknowledge when employees are recognized and not only just critique their work"
good,I learned to smile to co-workers and guests. I taught Yoga classes to guests. It was done outdoors with the sky as the roof and the chirping birds as a background music. Once we did Yoga by the campfire. Those are my good memories teaching Yoga at Marriott.
good,"Marriott International offre une dimension Internationale grace à ses 30 marques d'hotels à travers le monde entier."
good,"Enjoyed my job, got a promotion in 3 months as supervisor, in room service department.  I learned alot working there, but my one concern was that when you become part of management, not just a employee.  Marriott becomes a advisor on your personal life. which includes who you can associate with, monitoring your every move, even during your off hours. which became a problem, I had no idea of this, which was difficult for me.  As it turned out I moved to southern california, GREAT EXPERIENCE for the time I had with that company."
good,"Buen lugar para aprender nuevos conocimientos."
good,Great place to work with room for advancement. Nice to work with different departments to see everything come together. Nice hotel benefits for personal travel.

good,Good overall environment. Team is flexible and cares about employees. Everyone is very friendly and always speaks to you. All places have their pros and cons however this location has a lot of pros. Things constantly change in the hotel industry so the same people here today may be gone tomorrow.
good,"Busy work place environment. Hard but enjoyable work with lovely staff."
good,"Für Lehrlinge ein wirklich sehr guter Platz, da man sehr früh gefordert wird und auch wirklich mit Verantwortung in Verbindung gebracht wird. "
good,"The environment for Marriott was excellent. the staff helpful and courteous. Unfortunately Trump management was not,they did not have knowledge of the processes or procedures of the property but instead of keeping the knowledgeable employees they re hired new ones without experience which made the working environment impossible."
good,"Working at the Buffalo Marriott Harborcenter was both exhilarating and exhausting. The adrenaline rush of being at the forefront of the city was offset with the cons that are prevalent throughout the hotel and hospitality industry. The Harborcenter was also unique due to the fact they combined the valet and bellstand position. This led to our staff being shorthanded for large events. Yet we would be overstaffed on slow days if we added anymore employees. Like most hotels, the Harborcenter never closed leading to guaranteed work on weekends and at least a decent portion of nationally recognized holidays. While these situations could lead to frustrating scenarios, the Harborcenter is unique among hotels in the Western New York area due to its proximity to the Keybank Center. As an employee of the hotel you will work with the majority of visiting NHL teams as well as most performers."
good,"a good hotel to understand the star woods employee policy"
good,"It really depends on the department your working st , room service needed a lot of work . There was a lot of things that didn't make sense , and there was barely any employees . You could end up doing room service for the whole hotel by yourself from 5:30 am to 4 pm , not just including rooms , also spa pool and the nail or hair salon located at the spa. The Marriott can be a great job for people looking to advance in the career . Be there long enough and work hard enough and it's easy to become a supervisor and then manager . There is a lot of things offered at the Marriott , lot of advancement and educational opportunities . Always follow the rules at the Marriott . They are extremely strict on late policy as well , it might be hard to get holidays off , and the pay isn't to good in room service ."

good,"I was behind the scenes and would help guests prior to their arrival.  I would start my day by checking my voicemail, respond to guests via phone.  I would then check my emails and respond to guests via email and send them their itinerary for activities.  I worked 4 ten hour shifts, this was the best part of the scheduling was having 3 days off in a row."
good,"Siempre era agradable ir cada día a trabajar, se aprendía continuamente además que el ambiente laboral era cálido."

It was one of the most fun jobs I've had.  i got to work with some really fascinating collections and despite my low position on the totem pole, I had desk with a view of the mountains. The work environment felt a little weird and alienating sometimes, but probably because the department was in transition."
good,"Généralement après avoir consulté mes messages et traité les demandes les plus urgentes, je fais de la prospection, je prépare des réunions avec des nouveaux clients pour présenter les Hôtels Starwood à Bruxelles et dans le monde entier.

good,"Working at the AC hotel I gained a lot of experience, the management part really needs a lot of work. It was a new hotel which of course they new it was my first time working at a hotel and mainly the girl's also that I worked with. As a new business and new Hotel, i would expect a manager to help me when I needed help, Instead of doing so many mistakes to learn on my own. Eventually I got the hang of it and learned on my own. First night I worked the over night shift, No management just me and security, I had a few complications so I would always have to call my manager which she didn't even know so i had to call the main instructor who trained us before the hotel open and she directed me into everything which I was very thankful for her. "
good,beautiful place to work and worked personally with some good people in my department. a very good company to work for and good environment.
good,typical day varies.  I learned a lot of communication skills by interacting with staff and guest of different cultural backgrounds.  My co-workers were great team players and very appreciative of my efforts. Management is slightly disengaged from the associates at times but all in all the job experience at such a property will help you better your professional hospitality career and knowledge.
good,"Typical day was eventful"
good,"I got lucky with this internship working with such wonderful people!"
good,Upon clocking in you are busy right up to lunch time. Then just after lunch your work load builds as you eat lunch. Co-workers will cover for you on occasion.
good,"Perfect work/life balance, nice company to work for awesome benefits. "
good,The Westin Bonaventure is magnificent hotel to work for. The management provided easy communication. My typical day at work begins wearing a provided uniform and prepare the dishes for the guests in room service. My co-workers were team players and friendly. The hardest part of the job was transportation to work. The most enjoyable part meeting celebrities and tips.
good,"There are no typical days, each one is unique and different as each of our guests are unique and different.  Our goal is to provide superior customer service for an end result of satisfied, dedicated guests that will return time and time again."

good,"first time working for a hotel, but i highly enjoy it! i love the different people you get to meet everyday. its even gotten me over my social anxiety, the slow pace of the job gives me time to get school work done or just extra duties but the pay is nothing to go on about."
good,"Job requires an extremely flexible schedule, some nights you'll work from 2 to midnight, others 6 to 2. Most A/V jobs require this sort of thing so not very unusual. "
good,"A front desk associate works directly with customers-- making reservations and ensuring every customer has a great experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that a customer had a ""wow"" experience. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unscrupulous customers. The manager sets the tone of the organization and had created a good one despite inheriting a dysfunctional culture."
good,"The Paid time off for Marriott is amazing, the way you can use some vacation time to bump up your check when you need to was great. Also plenty of position to move up."
good,"At this location, there needed to be more leaders in management. Not only to manage, but to be the change this particular hotel needed to see. I enjoyed being one of those managers and working hand in hand with others who were as dedicated to seeing improvements as I was."
good,"I loved to work there and would go back at anytime, great people. Everyone should at least apply. Thank you. Read details before applying so"

good,"Manage the daily activities of the Housekeeping department to include appropriate cleaning of all offices, concourses, seating areas, washrooms, restaurants, concessionstands, suites, and all public spaces"
good,"The company as a whole is a great company to work for.  If you end up at a property where the management is strictly for themselves and not for the company, you could end up with a job you hate going to. My years of experience on the job has given me skills to use on other jobs. I never turned down any opportunities to grow in the company, but was always looked over for moving into different positions in the company."
good,"A typical work day I would provide massages for guests. I learned how to deal with all kinds of different characters and personalities. Management was awesome, and so was the co-workers. The hardest part was when I didn't have a massage, I wasn't earning anything. Seeing the satisfied look and appreciation in the guests I helped."
good,"Un dia tipico de trabajo , aisitir a tu hora para complementar una jornada de 8 horas , organizando tu area de trabajo y las labores que tienes que realizar durante el dia , aprendiendo dia a dia."
good,Work environment is good but working hours are really hectic with at least 12 hours of work on daily basis. One of the supervisor there doesn't much care about its staff and screams a lot which caused a bit trouble for me. All other employees are really welcoming.
good,"It's a good place to gain lots of hospitality and customer service experience, There is always opportunity to grow with in the company. Not necessary a place to be at forever. In the process of merging with Marriot, so things will definitely change."

good,Enjoyed working for Marriott.  Had some great managers and some that were not quite as good and very difficult to work with.

good,I love this job the people were great and the environment was always happy and pleasant. it was alot of hard work for very little and i had to drive very far from my house to get there.
good,I ran the floor shift of F&B. My staff was willing to learn and the hardest part was the renovation. Getting to know our regulars was great.
good,Environement de travail agreable mais pas beaucoup d'opportunites de developpement sur le management.
good,"informative, great place to learn. Learned payroll, scheduling, and star time. Helped to implement a new point of sales system during our high volume season"
good,"A typical day at work involves logging into a computer and taking around 50 calls a day and making reservations. I find that I learned many ways to help keep customer/guest information private that I hadn't considered. This job also helped me to ensure confidentiality, how to avoid offending people (without realizing) and new ways to explain things to people. "

good,"Achieved successfully with the team Dedeman hotel opening ,"
good,Typical day at work would be the managers rushing everybody to get off the clock. They didn't want us to do anything but clean the rooms. We were not able to listen to music or any extra things.
good,"Periodic events for staff apreciation. All shifts get 1 free lunch a day. Easy to change title or jobs incase of burn out. Dallas has 1846 guest rooms, such a large hotel always busy. Lots of sleepless nights aren't remembered when its time to make good on vacation days. Almost impossible to get 1 day off a week."
good,"For the most part it is a positive environment to work at.  However, at my location, turnover has been high and new leadership has been inconsistent."

good,"My typical day was to take phone calls modify,cancel and book hotel reservations. I learned to use active listening skills to resolve escalated calls and take care of my customers needs. I had an awesome relationship with my management team. The hardest part of the job was just being on the phone for so long. The most enjoyable part was hearing my customers feedback on my calls."
good,"A Empresa Marriott e' focada nos seus empregados com uma política 'open doors', ou seja, fácil e total disponibilidade de acessar supervisores e gerentes."

good,"In house booking guests to go on timeshare presentations, co workers were mostly good, certain management was good. There a poor level of communication on the management team that started leading to high turn over."
good,Mu opinions are confidential and I refuse to discuss anything further about previous companies I have worked for. I will discuss any questions with possible employers only if asked.

good,I started as the part time front desk associate and have worked my way up to my current position. I enjoy my job. I enjoy the people I am blessed to meet each day. The guests are very important and I make sure they are happy with their stay.
good,A typical day at work at Marriott International I was standing up for my whole shift no break on afternoon shifts checking in guests with all types of different personalities. I learned to always  be on time and take your job seriously. When I trained others to me it wasnt hard at all and I feel it was because the way I taught my co workers were more slower than other trainers. My co workers were very helpful and it was a very family oriented environment.The hardest part of my job was learning the PMS computer system and dealing with very rude guest. The most enjoyable part of my job was the experience of being apart of a corporate company and seeing the growth and happiness of others.
good,A day at the Westin is exciting.  You never know what kind of guest you will be having to deal with.  When I come in to work I have to check reservations in order to know what the occupancy will be.  I also have to check with my colleagues to see if there is anything that I need to be aware of before I release them at work.  The hardest part of my job is knowing how the guest are feeling of energy.  My job is to make them comfortable in my hotel so that they can have a good time and come back.  I really enjoy the people I work with we always have a good time and get the job done by the end of the night before we check ourt.

good,"its the biggest hotel in Dubai in terms of number of rooms (1 608 rooms) hence, very busy reception.you deal with people from start of your shift till the end, each one of them with different needs of their own."
good,This company has excellent benefits. Upper management leaves alot to be desired. Young manages fresh out of college with no management experience
good,My experience working there was exciting. I learn a lot from my co-worker and manager they supported  my personal growth  and taught me many life lesson. We specialize in hospitality and would have to meet the standard of guest satisfaction and beyond that.I took my job very seriously but i enjoy the most is meeting new people every single day and learning from them. I meet my standard everyday no matter the project or challenges were.

good,"Marriott has very high standards and that is very refreshing in today's standards. In the short amount of time working under the Marriott brand, I highly value their environment and culture."
good,Working for Marriott Vacations worldwide has been an Honor. Immediate supervisors and upper management is above Par. they do lack professionalism sometimes but overall hard and dedicated employees. Because its a corporate business their rules and policies are in black and white. There is no gray areas which leaves associates out of luck when there is an accident and a mistake is made.
good,"very high standards of customer service, very professional, great culture lots of benefits globally. good management and hr team. nice location lots of very high profile events such as indy 500"

good,"I spent over three years in the same position as the NYC is market is saturated with lots of talent. It is pretty much about who you know...doesn't matter how hard you work or how much you sacrifice. Associates are free to mistreat and disrespect management.  "
good,"Gorgeous facility with state of the art amenities. Fun pamper-minded clientele. The management team was overworked, very long hours. Because of the high goals given to them they were always under stress. Depending on their personal constitution they might be pleasant and reasonable but others were moody and took their stress out on the employees. Company policy made it very difficult to release someone from their job so you had to work with supervisors from time to time that would have been re-purposed in another company."
good,"The Marriott Brand is second to none when dealing with customer service. As long as you give 110% in making sure the guest is happy and satisfied, the rest is easy and fixable."
good,Seem to care about the employees.  Leadership was good and there was a work life balance.  I would recommend it as a good place to work.

Management kept me busy by stocking the gift shop, going to guests rooms to prepare their room for their stay before they arrive by specific things they want in their room and if they are VIP guests, handing out printouts to housekeeping showing which rooms are clean, dirty, vacant or not vacant. I would also call maintenance to guests rooms if a guest calls telling me about an issue in their room. Setting up blocks of rooms for parties. I also was given checks from management from major companies that were clients of ours that needed to be inputed into the accounts receivables program. The hardest part of the job is prioritizing your work. Management was readily available if the front desk got too busy."

The Marriott emphasized teamwork and the idea of being an orchestra - this idea was proven under extremely busy days, as people from different departments aided others. I learned the importance of time management and of the satisfaction of guests. I had strong relationships with my co-workers; everyone helped each other in various ways.

good,"County Hall Marriott for example, we were responsible for around 150 permanent staff and around 60 freelance contractors. This involved providing support and coaching to around 21 managers on a range of people policies - from employee relation cases to performance management issues on a daily basis. As part of a small but highly effective HR team, I worked closely with senior management to implement the agreed HR strategy through various projects and initiatives. Part of my job was to support resourcing and recruitment of new talent, and make sure managers have the tools to get the most out of their teams. Due to the nature of our business, a large proportion of staff were from outside the UK and spoke several languages, so good communication and rapport skills were vital."

good,The environment was pleasant and excellent management. Excellent staff.
good,"From my experience I learned that we have to do things we don't necessarily want to do in order to succeed. Very rarely have I ever had a day off that I actually requested (and have not had a weekend off during my time here), which is definitely the hardest part of the job. The management however, is wonderful. Very well run. The people that I get to work with are absolutely the best part of my job."
good,I learned how to prepare and present food to a good standard of the Chefs' instructions. It was all enjoyable as it was a fun experience learning the basic things that are needed to work in a kitchen.
good,"The team at The Westin Richmond is very dedicated to the guest. This dedication includes ensuring time and attention to all guests that interact with all departments. The environment is comforting, although it is very fast. It takes hard work and dedication to guests, however, the work/life balance is sometimes trying on individuals, which can lower morale and energy of individuals, which is crucial to provide the proper level of service to guests. Employees must feel just as important and valued as each guest."
good,I Worked at the DFW Marriott for over two years. It was a good experience but am currently looking for a summer internship with a company I can continue my long term career with.
good,"I only worked a seasonal job at the pool area. The sights were amazing, very pretty hotel on top of a hill. the pool was pretty big with a kiddie slide, and also an adult section.

But I learned to cope, how to handle angry callers, manage my time, solve problems and get customer accounts in order. some days were great some not so great."
good,"A  typical day with my co-workers was very chalenging, due to the fact no one spoke english, I learned I need to take up a second language. Management was okay, the hardest part of the day was getting past the communication, and the most enjoyable part of the day was completing my job on time."
good,"Un día típico en el restaurante del hotel consistía en conocer la proyección del día (cuantas personas recibiremos en el comedor aproximadamente) y hacer preparaciones en base a eso. Mi turno era responsable del cierre por lo que todo debía verse impecable para comenzar el trabajo al día siguiente, tuvimos fines de semana en los que cubrimos 10 000 cubiertos por turno como días en los que no hicimos ni 10 personas, las estadísticas eran variables pero la mayoría de las veces teníamos turnos muy ocupados y exigentes. Este tipo de trabajo me permitió aprender mejor a organizarme en una cocina y a trabajar inteligentemente de tal manera que los productos finales salieran siempre frescos, bien presentados y a tiempo."
good,"I would work 8 hours a day, clean about 18 rooms. my co workers were very nice and friendly people. all of them had a interest in cleaning. i would say that the hardest part of the job was pushing the supply-cart. over all, the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing happy a satisfied guests/customers."

good,Going to work is like opening a box of chocolates. You'll never know what is going to happen for the rest of your shift until it ends. The hotels'  motto is Whatever/ Whenever. Making all guest request possible for anything as long as it is legal. Being a team player plays a big part in our department. Our managers are very hands on as well. The hardest part of my job is when there are last minute change of plans among our guests. The most enjoyable is when you see them happy and satisfied.

good,The Marriott is a great place of employment for those seeking management positions in the service industry because it allows for employees to gather lots of responsibility in setting up and running the restaurant.  The environment nurtures employees who take initiative and learn fast.
good,"Through the Marriott, I have learned great methods in working with people professionally and how to handle a wide range of situations. A typical day would see me overseeing current activities going on in the hotel, organizing the guest ledger, including their residency at the hotel and their finances as far as billing. Also I would be keeping track of duties performed by other employees, making sure guest needs are met with high quality handling in a timely manner. I would also report any problems and oversee the assignment and completion of such problems to assure good customer service and problem solving skills. Working in a team is highly beneficial, especially in learning your team members strengths and weaknesses, working with them to develop theirs and your own. I enjoy my time at the Marriott and working with my coworkers and the guests we offer our services to."

This was my favourite hotel job as the hotel was right on the water and we had a bar out on the dock and people could tie up for the night, for a fee.  Met lots of famous people there.  Fabulous huge weddings and banquets..vwery wealthy area..Again, management and co-workers changed often, but I am still in touch with some of them also, which means a great deal.

good,"Great place to work pays great,people are great management like it’s management you can’t expect much but they are trying and that’s enough like you’re gonna have good days and bad but overall best place I ever worked"
good,"Ability to meet some great guests from all over the country. Clean, pleasant environment with a great GM and supervisory staff. The owners are also very friendly and personable."
good,"Nice place. Good people. I liked everyone I worked with. They were not very flexible with hours, they try to act like it but not really. They turnover rate is high"
good,"Pros:"
good,Mostly a fun place to work. I enjoy my co-workers. Management has just changed so there is a growing into the newness of the new management team. Is more fractured as a team then in past.
good,This is an amazing job to work at. I love dealing with people and being very sociable . I would always recommend this job to anybody who would like to work here.
good,Great place but some of the co workers and supervisors very unprofessional And Favoritism beside that I love that place working there just being in the scenario is a different experience
good,"I have been working the the Westin for over 6 years.  Before that I have two years at the Down Town Sheraton so that is a total of 8 years.  I recently found out that a new hire is hired at 13.50 and that is just as an agent.  Dispatch has more responsibilities,I have been 6 years and I work the overnight shift which should have differential pay.  But I only make 57 cents more than that person."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of reservation confirmations or quotes on room rates, closely working with the housekeeping dept to check guests in early. I learned how to better use my customer service skills and maintain a professional environment. The hardest part was seeing regular guests upset and  most enjoyable part was giving a family an upgraded room if it wasn't available at time of booking. I very much enjoyed the hotel industry."
good,"Busy, fast paced place, huge loyalty program - really challenging. "
good,"Employees are not having any five star or some times even less than that. Always work under pressure from the management without any particular reason. So, it's very much difficult to work in this odd situation."
good,"Worked at Marriott International - Headquarters office in Bethesda, MD for over 5 years.  Digital QA Department.  First few years were very pleasant, worked on an Agile Scrum Team with great co-workers!  Environment and culture of the office were very good.  Balanced personal and work life really well.  The following 2-3 years were busy - full of Release support during weekends, weeknights and a lot of OT with no extra compensation or acknowledgement.  Management and Leadership changed with work schedule dramatically different.  Really enjoyed my time for the most part.  Just wish things stayed the course when the Agile Web Software Development were created.  Made being at the office much more fun, with hard work, encouragement and dedication.  The balance of personal, professional and team bonding were much more personable and visible to everyone.  But from 2017-2019, the Digital Web Department changed to a more strict leadership, tougher work schedule and stressful office environment.  The company in general is a great place to work for.  However, certain IT departments make it hard to advance in your career and make you work much more than the weekly limit without extra compensation.  4 star rating for the company, but 2-3 rating for their IT management."
good,"Good spot to work.  I still recommend it to anyone and everyone looking for a solid gig.  Very unpredictable, though.  An all or nothing type of job.  Shift change could be at 3:00pm, yet you get a 40 top at 2:45.  So be it.  Food and Beverage is top notch so, once again, I recommend it to locals as well."
good,"I worked at a Reservation Call Centre. The hardest part of the job was trying to explain to impaired guests that yes, they were calling The Marriott, call centre... O was unable to greet them at the front door to let them in."
good,"I was only with the company for lest than 1 year. Due to management changes, they had to remove the position of Manager on Duty but thankfully let me stay working the front desk. I did not see the opportunity to grow there and everything felt stagnant. I believe Marrott is a fantastic company but it just was not the right fit for me."
good,While I am working for this company i get to know some of the other nationality their culture. I became friends to learn their languages. and also get to know the other department in the hotel. joined extra activities like in sports.
good,"A great opportunity for those in the hospitality industry, or wanting to get into it.  The ability to transfer to another country after 1 year in a Management role."
good,The Marriott I worked for was going through a difficult time with the Management company for that property.  Since I have left employment there the management company has changed.
good,It was wonderful to work with a different group of people every day and doing different things around my work place.  It was a great start to go into a new field of work.  This was my first cleaning job and now I am working at Merry Maids cleaning people’s houses which I got to learn since I had experience.  This Marriott helped me get my foot in the door.
good,The most enjoyable part of the Marriott is the relationships I created while working. They were very easy to work with when I decided I wanted to return to school.
good,"This is the kind of job that requires an eye for detail, you need to be able to see and dispose of any and all hair in the bathrooms (including the shower drain) must be able to; strip and remake 1-2 beds (be sure not to use and sheets with stains), empty and replace both in-room trash bags, restock in-room coffee bar, disinfect and dust all hard surfaces, thoroughly check for left behind items (to be cataloged in case the guest wants it shipped to their home)  replace laundry bags, replace all bathroom towels and toiletries, clean glass (no streaks allowed), disinfect; bathroom counter, shower, toilet, etc. In under 26 minutes. But there is a perk to this job, you get to go home when you're done (after checking with management to see if anyone needs help)"
good,I thoroughly enjoy working at the Marriott I notice there is room for growth. If you are crossed training you can fill shifts in other roles within the hotel. In my time there I have seen people excell and develop themselves to promoted positions. I love interacting with guest's from all parts of the world. Great networking environment and perfect if you love the hospitality industry.  I definitely recommend
good,Working at Marriott was one of my favorite jobs although after training they just kind of throw you in without proper practice. The systems are constantly down and lots of people weren't getting paid due to errors in the log in system.
good,"Love the job, hate the  commute, Rt 1 is the  worst and the beltway is not much better. It does help to know what you are going to be doing before the interview, read the job description well before the interview."
good,It was a very nice place to work guest are usually friendly the environment was pleasant to work in..i would recommend working for the hotel it was a good work experience.
good,"Enjoyed the position but new GM had no experience (came from sales) and was scared to make decisions ,fun place to work with great rates for you and your family"
good,"Easy job, not many hours. Management worked with my schedule and gave me my requested days off. Holidays and birthdays management and coworkers pitched in for lunch."
good,"great employees, fun environment, fantastic clientele, productive workplace, supportive management, business casual setting. I would have to say the hardest part about the job is finding yourself within the industry. The best part about the job is that you are confident in yourself."
good,"Marriott has strong name in sector. You can easily access all the equipment and arguments to do your job."
good,I spent the day catering to the guests and their needs. Advising guests of activities in the city and even outside the city. I was in charge of helping guests with their luggage and parking their automobiles.
good,"Management fluctuates depending on the property. Marriott Irvine Spectrum is a horrible location. Your schedule and availability is not followed, your direct management team doesn’t care about their employees and upper management is focused on  keeping their managers happy instead of the employees. The Hive and Honey management team is worst of all, they genuinely do not care about their employees well being only their sales and will force a server to take on 100 drunk guests themselves on a Friday night."
good,Good place to work had its ups and downs but great customer service housekeepers work as a team and also houseman worked together easy way to dont only problem not enough hours and little pay.work
good,"It was a great relaxing place to work, although certain managers made it unnecessarily stressful at times. My coworkers were great, everyone was generally nice. Managers were extremely uptight for most of the time no reason."
good,It was great before surgery. After I had surgery there was no communication between the Gm my manager and myself.i had to continue calling until I had to call the regional office.
good,"I will say this, this company in it self is amazing and I would recommend anyone to work there.......just not in the housekeeping department."
good,Coworkers were great to work with.banquet supervisor a great person and the banquet group is a very collaborative and welcoming group. Pay was very close to minimum wage i believe it was only about 30 more cents than the minimum.
good,"Marriott is a great company to work for . "
good,"Working with the department I was in was fun and exiting. The thing is managers in other departments treat you as if they are entitled to more, but always have to know that managers in your department will have your back."
good,Very fast pace and fun.  Great people to work with.  My manager was great!  Lots of training and there is room for advancement.  Do your job and you'll be fine.
good,The system that implementing at Marriott is perfect for developing associate carrier was good Marriott gives to the associate a lot of training its good but when you got promotion the company offer too minimum amount of salary which is not fair
good,"Decent place to work,  enjoyed the people i worked with.  extremely poor management.  management did not show that they care for the employees, would let guests treat employees badly"
good,Was a great place to work was able to learn more management skills and enjoy engaging with the guest had a great housekeeping staff and a great management team
good,"Over all I liked working there, it was fast-paced always moving and on your feet. I really enjoyed housekeeping and seeing people from across the world."
good,Ottawa Marriott is a really great place to work. You see a lot of lifers and everyone else seem to be younger students (at least at the front desk). High turnover rates because of this.
good,Cet emplois est très stressant… Direction peu compréhensive.
good,"Great place to learn everything you know about customer service, Had the pleasure of Starting with Starwood before it became Marriott and very grateful for everything I was thought. Hard work does pay off :)"
good,Opportunities to learn other responsibilities were always available. There were excellent resources and help was always accessible within the property
good,"*8am or earlier based on conventions and u[out around 9pm"
good,Great team. Lack of education opportunities and no place for growth. Takes a long time to fix anything or work on problems. Great room discounts and providing with parking.
good,"Ones working experience here depends on the leadership of the organization.  I have worked under the radar with a lot of autonomy for years.  There are a lot of opportunities to improve your skills with a lot of training available however there are not many opportunities at the manager level and above.  They do not regularly promote/upgrade positions, one would need to seek promotion outside of ones group/team.  Like any other company your career prospects are tied to being on the right people's agenda.  Working harder does not necessarily mean you will be recognized or rewarded.  Leadership often turns a blind eye when informed of employees being railroaded, there are many instances of blatant unethical scenarios.  The company can be fun to work for as the industry is very interesting, never a dull moment.  There is a stark contrast between hotel culture and corporate culture, where the hotel environment is merit based and corporate culture is based more around who looks like you, and who your sleeping with.  Although this is a hospitality company they are not hospitable to one another. The company and many of its people are culturally insensitive even when they try to be culturally sensitive.  Depending on your organization your work life balance could be really awesome or really terrible."
good,"answer phones, take reservations, set guest. show guest around answer any questions. set tables. polish silverware, plates and glass."
good,"Good company to work for. It is an international organization with a vast network - recognized for a consistently high level of service.  "
good,"When working through Marriott i learned time management. Considering the work load that is given and the amount of things that needed to be accomplished in each room to meet sensitization standards, you really learn to you and manage your time wisely. I also acquired exceptional organization and cleaning skills."
good,"I was a housekeeper at a Marriott Hotel in Sacramento,California and  basic routine was to have regular meetings before the shift and notify us of anything we should be be on the lookout for. If we ever had special guest coming, look out for anything and to remind us that our own safety was to be first and foremost. The Hardest part of the job would be to meet Quota.Usually every house keeper is assigned 12-15 rooms for the day, depending on how bad or good a room is you can usually stay longer then your regular shift. "
good,In the time I worked at this property I expect to give an exceptional service to the guest but this Marriott banquet servers just do the service not always taking care of the guest.
good,"A typical day working at the Marriott included me greeting guests, registering them, and assigning them to rooms. I learned new tasks on a daily basis which was challenging but it was interesting because I love to learn new things. Management were sometimes difficult however, I went to work everyday with a positive attitude and mindset. The work environment was professional, supportive, innovative, comfortable and fast paced. The hardest part about this job was not having enough staff coverage. The most enjoyable part about this job was being able to meet new people and satisfy the guest."
good,"Okay place to work. Customers were sometimes difficult. But you did receive an hourly pay and got to keep the tips.No uniforms, but had to wear a certain color top and pants."
good,"Hotel"
good,An interesting company to work for on any given day. Being able to multitask is definitely a requirement to succeed in a fast moving and somewhat hectic environment.
good,"Very demanding work schedule for event employees. Excellent H&R director and event staff manager. Very strict about hours, policies, and appearance. Not enough support help provided to do job efficiently."
good,Required to much to fast.. Had to have so many rooms done before you could leave. Being a new employee it was very stressful.  Very nice place and very big/.
good,Work environment allows all associates the opportunity to apply their skill and attributes toward outstanding business strategy and service delivery.  Strategic organization and direct to customer/team member impact are the more enjoyable parts of the job.  The most challenging parts of the job are balancing the aggressive service and revenue goals with the needs and realities of product resources and stakeholder/market expectations.
good,"I arrived at the Renaissance Shanghai Caohejing Hotel on July 15, 2014. I started working in the Korean kitchen and did a lot of cutting and sorting. Later, because of my excellent performance, I was assigned to work in the dessert kitchen, where I learned how to make bread and simple desserts, and I also did a lot of work on cutting fruits and line cooks. The Renaissance Hotel is a brand of the Marriott Hotel Group. Their corporate culture is very professional and the management level is very high. I was shocked when I first joined the company. The job of cooking is something I like very much, but the working hours of the Renaissance Hotel are very unstable. I often need to work overtime for 3-4 hours and there is no overtime pay. But the employee benefits of the Renaissance Hotel are really great."
good,"Hours were long ypu had to work10 fours per day."
good,"The more you give, the more they are expected on you to complete the job well-done . Focus on what the standard is for the policy after while give them what the best in you to complete the job"
good,I like working for Marriott but it is a bit overwhelming without much help. I would love to continue here but the pay does not equal the amount of work I as an individual does.
good,"The co-workers are usually the best things about this job but lots of labor and switching around your roles to help other departments with what they need. Always moving on your feet which isn't a bad thing but if there is nothing to do or prep then it can get pretty boring pretty fast, even if most of the departments are slow themselves."
good,nothing bad to say about Marriott it's been a pleasure being hired work environment it's good there the only thing is that it's a little too far from where I live
good,I enjoyed my time there and the staff was fairly easy to get along with. I very much enjoyed my job but sales and marketing can be overbearing. Honestly the guests were the most difficult part to deal with. Very rude most days.
good,Good technology and collaboration.  Fair compensation and reasonable benefits.  Working conditions and paid time off were good.  Management was reasonable.
good,"fun and exciting meeting and providing hospitality and service. learned how to provide information concerning the city, restaurants, directions to different locations and to make the guest feel comfortable For the most part management was great and the work place culture was always personable The hardest part I guess was not being able to please everyone The most enjoyable part was bring comfort and pleasure to the guest.."
good,Great company with great benefits. Great at making associates feel like they matter. Great at giving everyone a chance but this also means people not fit for management will be in management positions driving an entire team away.
good,"As a fresher you will be paid very less!!"
good,"I have worked in Marriott for more than 4 years. Starting as an intern to a regular employee. I have enjoyed perks with friends and hotel discounts travelling any where you want to go.  I am blessed to have a manager that is team player and very understanding.  I can say she has all the qualities and skills of a great leader. It is a team environment workplace however, it is very important to work individually and not rely all times to your co worker. This is the job that you have to grow individual productive competent professional. There are times to make your own decision to solve the problem if the situation can be simply handled."
good,"There are busy times, and slow times. Management wise i have learned how to deal with the associates i work with and have learned how to do a schedule, write ups etc."
good,Is a good place for work.. good conditions for be opportunities the best life and family.  All is possible because the work it's simply when work with the heart
good,"Every day is different, learn to adapt. Very fun place to work if you let it be. raises depend on the franchiser you work for . over all a good place to work and learn from"
good,This is the perfect job for those who don't necessarily strive to move up in their careers and are easily satisfied with simple jobs that don't require any special skills.
good,I loved working there as a breakfast attendant.  I wasn't able to keep up with my bills with the salary though.  And some guests would treat employees as if they were beneath them.
good,"Great place to work until this past year, company culture changed, no longer in line with my personal beliefs."
good,Working in the hospitality industry for Marriott was a great experience. Over all employee morale was good. Management was engaging and shared knowledge and company information with all employees and brought us all together and a team.
good,"at every single job you will work for the rest of your life you will deal with miserable people you will deal with gossipers you will deal with stirrers, its the same here as it is everywhere"
good,"I enjoyed working at Marriott reservations in 2015. I appreciated everything they did for me. It was nice speaking to people over the phone... however, if you advance chances are your early shift will change.  Anyway, I decided to look for something else."
good,"Well trained for a business operation, most of the time the operation is tight and busy, as we have a lot of groups and accomplished guest staying with us."
good,It was a good place to work. I left due to less hours and low pay rate and plus I started school. I would love to work again if they do hiring again in one of their local locations.
good,"work environment well provided, enjoy working for that company, senior management have a room to do better, overall Marriott International organization have a great culture and have everything on place to operate"
good,"I worked in the office and I learned a lot about clerical work."
good,"Working for Courtyard by Marriott was a very fun experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It provided much diversity throughout daily jobs and the guests that I would meet on a daily basis."
good,I was offered a Career Path which allowed me to advance to Assist Specialty Team in 18 months. I was also allowed to work from home which was what I had been seeking from the beginning.
good,People you work with are awesome for the most part. The pay is not great though.  There are many other positions like this one that pay more. The hotel discounts is great too.
good,I started at Fairfield Inn as a Laundry person and worked 40 hours a week.  Then I moved up to being Laundry Person/Part-time Hostess.  Then I moved up to full time Hostess; then moved up to being Part-time Night Auditor and full time Hostess.  I enjoyed all of my jobs and was glad for the experience and meeting the public.
good,"I enjoyed the social interaction with people. I loved having the opportunity to solve issues ( Not Problems).  The culture of the workplace was focused on the guests, The management empowered the employees to make the right decisions for our guests to make sure they had a problem free stay. I was responsible as the Night Manager on Duty for the welfare of the hotel the guests and its employees."
good,"Marriott international is a great place to work.  There are a multitude of avenues and paths that can be taken to further advance your career, depending on where you want to go.  The hours can be long, and like any job, there can be stress. But i would recommend this to anyone."
good,"Marriott hotels are often franchised.  Each hotel can be managed by different owners or management companies.  I was lucky to work under Pyramid Hotel Group at Marriott Mobile."
good,"The job itself is ok.  Inconsistent training, and revolving door atmosphere.  Its hard to get to know co workers as they are always coming and going.  Alot of promotions are based on friendships and not always knowledge or experience.  Good benefits overall, but poor working conditions sometimes."
good,"I really loved my job here. The reason I was let go is because of Marriott Business Services, which is a centralized accounting service. This service made all of the credit management positions to be laid off and jobs illiminated."
good,"This place has a ton of potential.  The systems aren't quite all in place yet, but once management figures out their systems, this place will excel.  Somewhat stressful job because you're not sure what you will see on an every day basis, as far as guests go.  More bullet proof systems would help to correct this."
good,"Not much else i can say, the title says it all. Lots of perks, free meals everyday. Management is always working to find new ways to keep the people engaged and happy."
good,"Lots of customer service learning opportunities. Good company ethic and interest in individual employees. The hardest part of the job is handling difficult service complaints, but the positive reviews deservedly counter that."
good,"The Sheraton Birmingham is a tough place to work, but will teach you more than you will need in the Food and Beverage hospitality career. There aren't very many places like it in Alabama."
good,The Courtyard Marriott Waterfront was a very nice hotel although the building was twenty years old.  There had been multiple renovations over the years but remodeling and repairs were constantly needed to maintain Marriott standards.
good,"I liked the job overall. Everyone was respectful, kind,and hard working. The problem was that when i would come home my back would be very sore and my health was being effectied."
good,While I do enjoy meeting and speaking with people.   I preferred the overnight shift because there was less traffic and distractions and able to get more work done.
good,"Hardest part of my job is working overnight, typical because of the slow pace, extremely quiet environment."
good,Was great to work there until management showed favoritism. Management needs to be looked into. People who have been there awhile getting written up but those who have been hired and there after probation period not getting written up for the same reason the others were. To me that doesn't set a good example.
good,"Le Meridien de Nice est un Établissement un peu à part Ça ne fait qu'un an qu'il a été racheté par Marriott mon avis concerne plus cet établissement précis que le groupe internationale "
good,"Responsibility for the total guest experience, consistently moving between all shifts but pay not in line with responsibilities.  If you want a chance to advance though, they will promote."
good,it was very informative through out the year.there was all ways positive ways to enhance company policy was in affect and up held to a high standards there were lots of opportunity for growth
good,"I worked at this location when it was called Starwood hotels. Working with what is now called Marriott International was very delightful.You were able to provide the customer exactly what they asked for with all the tools you need in front of you. Marriott also took the time to train the employees with the knowledge they would need to succeed and make every job easier. Management was welled staff and trained. I felt there could of been a better avenue for advancement opportunities and that maybe the way it was done has been changed may have seem unfairly in some cases. The workplace culture was very comfortable and relax, but also competitive to keep everyone on the toes. The hardest part of the job I would say is when you are unable to help the customer due to emergency situations like weather issues and known disasters, especially when these are the times you wish you could help a customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to provide a customer with a wonderful stay. Although you were at work it sometimes did nor tht feel like work especially when you can escape with seeing beautiful images all over the world."
good,Fair with tips to servers and catering. Willing to relocate you inside company to make sure you got enough hours. More understanding of personal circumstances
good,It was fun while it lasted. The staff and guest where amazing. They served free breakfast and dinner which the guest loved. Their was also a pool and bbq area for guest entertainment and basketball court for as well.
good,"Located on the Tiburon Golf Course, the hotel provides an ideal location for golfers yet also offers a comfortable setting for individuals and families. Home to LPGA and Shark Shootout tournaments that garner national coverage."
good,"This job is good for those who don’t mind working at night. It was challenging for me because it was at night time. Would clean pool and recreation area of the hotel, walls and dealing, bars and bathrooms so it’s hard work for someone small like me. But over all it was a good work place."
good,Variety of Cultures. Always learning and everything changes each day. Enjoyable work environment.  Free lunch Provided depending on the property. Respectable work place.
good,Provided great training and support from management.  Received great rewards from the team and residents.  Helped to make sure that all guests felt welcome and comfortable.
good,Enthusiastic working atmosphere as meeting new types of guest everyday.Need to learn more aspects in terms of work and need myself a growth in terms of salary.
good,"It was hard to get promotion, managers are incorporated but what was great about it you gonna be always working 40 hours a week no matter what, Looking for a better opportunity now....."
good,Being that the hotel is a franchise it’s ran poorly In my opinion but The Marriott corporation is a wonderful place to work and grow I wouldn’t mind working for them again in the future.
good,"It's a relatively laid back place to work, but it does get stressful.  There are very slow times and very busy times.  Good place to start your hospitality career."
good,"Marriott is an established company with a clear vision and great values.  However, the merger between Starwood and Marriott greatly impacted the work environment and made it difficult to work with highly stressed and confused managers."
good,Good management and very understanding. They try to help you excel in your goals or career but limited growth within certain properties depending on where it may be.
good,"I learned that housekeeping it not only  about making the bed but creating an experience for the guest,what was hard is the effort we put in action to be best brand that there can be."
good,"Definitely worth the time and effort to progress with this company. Working at the Marriott was great, the company stayed true to their word and I handled my security guard work as instructed to do."
good,"This was my first job in the Hospitality field. It was overwhelming at first, but the training material available is  great. Older Company but they know what they are doing."
good,I was hired as a non-union worker as a guest service assistant. I mainly drove a shuttle van for the guests to get to and from work and also to local restaurants and venues.
good,the sales office is a great place to work. you meet new and interesting people and learn a lot from your peers. not a lot of room for growth however still a great company
good,Westin is my favorite hotel brand. i had an amazing crew that were able to help me. I had a great leader that took the time to come meet with me and clarify my goals. Managers were always available for the staff. The culture at the Westin was amazing. The hardest thing at the Westin was keeping the bellman busy when we were slow. My favorite thing at this hotel was how all associates and manager were  trying to help us .
good,everthing was good and fine and enjoyable moment with all the department in hotel. the hardest part only the salary was less.The accomadotaion was provided and the food and the management was very politely with the staff.
good,Work wasn't hard but i felt a lack a passion for some people and management could have been better but i learned many skills and my co-workers made it a joy to be around
good,"The Marriott has a reputation for being a great place to work but my experience with them has not been so good. I am hoping that something changes. I have been working at the Marriott for two years and have been passed over for promotion 7 times. Their Motto is put people first, but I do not think that they consider employees people because they keep implementing policy that disregard the needs of its employees."
good,"Great people, beautiful places, great environment to be in. Not relly good  perks and benefits, it’s almost as if you are a work very hard long time also no one care not relly bad not relly goods"
good,5am shift. 6 days a week. Started as an food runner got promoted to room service server and banquet server. First experience in the hotel business. I learned presentation is a big fact in the restaurant business. I gained and conserved the knowledge of being a great employee.
good,This is a great way to start a career in Management. It may take a little time to move up in the company but it's worth the wait. I love the discounts that we get at all Marriott brands... not only for myself but for family and friends as well.
good,"Started here when I moved from another state and it was amazing to see the team and the environment working in an hotel. its very fast paced in the kitchen and you get to see bit and pieces from behind the scenes to the front of house. You meet great coworkers and fun guests and even though management isn't the best they do offer so many options for benefits, job security, advancements and boost worker morale any chance they get."
good,I have been working at Marriott International full-time (More than 3 years)
good,"Modern hotel, clean, suburban, high business traveler volume, quiet and relaxed. Great for a part time gig if you need extra cash. Management isn't the greatest or the worst."
good,"The place pays fairly well however the tasks are not divided fairly among employees, there are favorites and there are scapegoats. God forbid you speak up about it. Your concerns will be shut down, no sympathy no understanding. You might end up carrying all the tables, chairs and settings while the favorites are sitting folding napkins"
good,"My typical day at Marriott included reconciling daily deposits, cash and cash drawers. I also checked guests in and out of the hotel. Processed cash and credit card transactions as well as made reservations. As a night auditor I ran daily revenue reports and sent them to corporate.  I also trained new employees both on front desk duties and auditors."
good,a lot of cut throat acts with employees. management is good but the servers run the place. some nice staff but a lot of people try to make each other look bad
good,"The staff at the Marriott are nice people to be around and work with,"
good,The best part of the job was the career advancement. The worse part of the job was the long hours. Working at least 10 hours a day can take a lot of a person. I loved the work culture of hotel.
good,"make housekeeper boards for the day"
good,I loved my time at the westin but the HR Department was not there to support anyone under management status. It was always the manager word and no one others. The hourly employees that you work with may just be second to none what so ever.
good,"It is fun working even under preassure, if you've got benefits as expected, and it doesn't matter how tons of workload you'll do as long as  Everyone smiles.."
good,Es un lugar confortable i con muchos beneficios i estabilidad
good,"enjoy the  staff gusts and a great brand to be with. there are opportunity's with the Starwood brand for growth and movement, great learning experience."
good,whilst working at starwood hotels & resorts I gained valuable customer service skills which helped me in work and as well in my life. I have met some great people from all over the world
good,Ne me plait pas trop par sa taille et manque de personnel.
good,En tant que chef  de partie beaucoup de responsabilités et de choses à gérer mais la cohésion d'équipe facilite le travail
good,The work day was easy but it's hard because they give us too many rooms to handle in o e day. With less rooms we could focus on each one more. Overall pretty good
good,Great place to start. great job for someone getting into the hospitality field.  they will learn a lot and fast.  This is a very fast pace environment.
good,"Westin is a big hospitality Industry, the Westin Kitchen full of people from all over the world. it's been fun working at Westin, I made a lot of friends there. from day 1 they trusted me in making some recipe at Westin Kitchen. pastry chef de party let us learn by experience, she is a cool Lady who runs Westin pastry kitchen for 10 years. the hardest part of the job is just the quantity we produce is in a huge amount. it was difficult in the beginning but as time goes, it becomes easier."
good,Operations are smooth running here and sometimes it gets too busy but its good and I really learn a lot while working here and have been given better growth and opportunities to learn and grow by the managements. The staffs are management is very helpful here to the staffs.
good,Sodexho/Marriott was a very good company to work for. This was a contract situation that lasted for 11 years but unfortunately the contract was allowed to expire and was taken on by a different company.
good,Management is very hands on at the Westin of Charlotte. If things need to be done they management takes care of them immediately. A regular day at work consist of meeting many new people and dealing with people from all walks of life. I can't really think of any part of the job being very difficult. What one person has a problem with you can always count on a co-worker or manager to help you figure out. Everyone does a great job when it comes to team work.
good,"I greatly enjoyed working at SpringHill Suites before the recent changes to managerial staff. Before recently, the overall work atmosphere was welcoming, respectful, and enthusiastic. In my opinion, the whole team at SpringHill was genuine and hardworking in the endeavors to make the hotel a great place to work, as well as a great place for guests to visit. I definitely got the sense that this was a place where everyone worked as part of a team, and were recognized as prioritized members of that team. All employees and managers were shown appreciation through events that celebrated accomplishments such as Employee of the Month, birthdays, and were also included in monthly Employee Lunches where everyone spent quality time together enjoying a meal as a SpringHill Suites family."
good,"There are good and bad factors for this job. While they have paid training with guaranteed full time hours and the opportunity for overtime, there is also much less opportunity for advancement than they make it seem.  There is flexibility in scheduling as well which is nice, with the possibility for day or evening shifts, and the chance to take unpaid time off without using sick or vacation days. The job itself is fairly monotonous, and dealing with customers all day can be a little exhausting, especially if you get a lot of angry guests in a day."
good,Great place to work and great support from management. I loved being able to give the guest consistent customer service and tending to their needs. During the tourist season the hotel was buzzing and meeting so many different people was the absolute best.
good,"I have worked with the W Austin for almost 7 years. I love it! Great benefits, young vibrant company. They encourage independent style and creativity. They are earth conscience. They have a great recycling and composting program. I love that the hotel is so involved with equal right, music and style."
good,"Company with inconsistent hours, however when the hours are high, the perfect job. Always an understanding manager who makes it easier to integrate into the team."
good,I was the Payroll Administrator for seven years.  I also had to back up the Human Resource manager when she was off.  I worked many holidays to get the payroll submitted in a timely fashion.  As I saw the food service for the airlines slipping away I pursued other opportunities.
good,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*+********* great comoany to work for, nothing bad, free meals, and benefits and good pay ..."
good,"the first day to my at lemeridien 16/12/2009"
good,I have done my job for years so I know what I'm doing. Our recent new front desk manager is not trained to.do his job. He is not good at it so it makes my job stressful.
good,"breakfast buffet. baked goods. fresh fruit displays."
good,Es un placer trabajar con personas tan profesionales.
good,"Great environment, paid time off, sick time, 401k -- you get to meet a lot of new people which is fun. Management at this specific location has changed, however the position inherits an independent vibe, which is cool."
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting and checking in guests due to arrive that day, as well as answer all questions from current guests. I communicate with many departments to ensure the check in and check out process go smoothly. I have learned a lot about how to handle difficult situations and how to keep a cool head during the moment. The management is very present and hands-on and truly care about the advancement of their employees. The hardest part about the job would definitely be the hard-to-handle guests but at least it gets easier over time. The most enjoyable part is seeing the look on a guest's face when they are ecstatic about their something you helped them with. Something that doesn't cost me anything could mean the world to someone else."
good,"Management is very accepting of schedules here, but there is also no room for advancement.  It is a small property and jobs typically involve doing things that are not primary job responsibilities.  Pay is on the low side.  I see many employees most concerned with pay, but the culture and ability to make your mark on your position is a plus."
good,i would take 200 calls per day assisting guests making hotel reservations and helping guests make the right deceision for there ideal stay based on really listening to there needs . it was a great place to work at . however a high turnover rate.. there is room to grow within the company'
good,"Hôtel d'aéroport, permettant de découvrir une clientèle business, de l'aérien mais aussi de loisir."
good,"Its a great place to to kick start your customer service skills. Plenty of advancement opportunities, as well as tuition reimbursement opportunities. Benefits are cool too."
good,"I was expecting more reliable hours when I was hired as full-time, however I am having to search for another job due to the lack of hours. My direct manager is very grumpy and not easy to work for. However, all other managers are a pleasure to work with."
good,This place was fun to work at! At first it was difficult with the different cultures.  Housekeepers are difficult but they always come around. Love their culture.
good,"A typical day at work would include dealing with a variety of clients such as members, local clients, those staying in the hotel for business or leisure. Co - operating with other departments. I learnt to enhance my skills as a beauty therapist, gaining a lot of regular clients. My personal experience of management was that they left you to get on with your work but I felt comfortable to approach them when needed. Marriott has a strong policy of being welcoming to customers. You get benefits such as discounts on treatments, products and room stays. The hardest part of the job was only being paid minimum wage for a job I had to go to college for and there wasn't a way to progress. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team I worked with in my department."
good,"The guests and most of the employees are great!!!  It is not an easy decision that I made to leave.  However, current circumstances being what they are make the move necessary"
good,I've been with Marriott for 3 years now and I've learned how to work in a diverse environment. The vast majority of the guests at the hotel are either patients or family of patients going to the main hospitals in the near by medical campus. I love working with patients and working for this property has been encouraging to me as I pursued my dreams of becoming a nurse.
good,"I learn so many things, this is my second pre opening hotel and everyday is a learning process, I have a supportive colleague, it's easy to get along with the team."
good,To be a part & get experience more to the field of hotel management through the hotel that offers me an excellent opportunity to trigger out my talents and hence providing a great way for mutual proliferation
good,"It was a nice experience being able to be social to new people in a nice environment everyday, and being able to have a wide variety of chores and task to do not being stagnant."
good,Working for this company can be challenging But fun. I love working with people and greeting guests. Working as a team pays off. I work in laundry so things can be a mess. Especially on busy nights. It's all about having a routine and rythem going. Team work plays a big part.
good,"le travail se passe bien, il y'a une bonne équipe . Dommage que l'hôtel ne propose pas davantage de cdi.."
good,the team wasn't fun to work with and that didn't make the kids want to come back. They don't allow you to shy away from specific formants even though not all the kids learn in the same way.
good,When you work for Marriott corp you are taught that the client'S satisfaction is is the primary mission of every employee.
good,"As a lifeguard associate, I am not very involved in the hotel's benefits for employees and events. However, as a student, working at the Westin is a great a part-time job."
good,"Its a place with a lot of opportunities for advancement, fun warming, welcoming feel. Hour are inconsistent don't get much of a personal life but at least its a job"
good,"Aprendí bastante acerca de mantenimiento a equipos, no había mucha explicación acerca del trabajo a elaborar, tenias que aprender solo, trabajo bajo presión debido a que atiendes a todos lo departamentos del Hotel, los mas difícil satisfacer al cliente tanto interno como externo, me gusto mucho el aprendizaje que me dejo y el trato con los huéspedes."
good,"Learned cash handling skills and being organized. Working 3rd shift it is not for everyone since it is very difficult to switch shifts and difficult to carry out daily tasks outside of work with conflicting sleep schedules. The general managers from both properties I worked for were friendly and understanding. This is a one man job however since you are often the only employee left in the building at such late hours so you must be independent and solve problems on your own. It is usually slow paced since most guests arrive before your shift even starts. However things get chaotic when flights get cancelled as you often find yourself either sold out or overbooked. While it is not located in a shady part of town, that doesn't stop shady characters from going there and as a result weekends can be chaotic with all the parties and complaints from other guests."
good,"Pros: "
good,not a bad place to work flexible schedule good for a family person the pay could be better and you will have to work weekends
good,"Lots of training opportunities, SMEs (subject matter experts) Coaching and Mentoring. Great guests who love the revitalization of the waterfront. The challenges will be rectified through a full renovation. Difficult to access the hotel for accessible individuals as the hotel is not fully accessible. New Chefs table wonderful but not accessible."
good,I did laundry here i bartended and cooked also i liked working with people and interacting with the people from different states n countries over all it was a good experience
good,Massive upscale F&B operation.Great work place if you enjoy long hours working in fast passing involvement.Management was excellent and co-workers were great.
good,Plz give smart salary your employes  give the employee medical bonus privileged club department pay smart commission per sale
good,Balanced a multitude of tasks on any given day as I ran 3 outlets on a shift. Handled stress under pressure and is extremely reliable.
good,"Pay is about minimum wage, but is made a little more appealing in tips, which are pooled and distributed throughout the Valet department weekly. Not exactly a job to stick with for the rest of your life, but it works well as a temporary job until you can find better employment. Not unionized, unlike the other Marriott Hotels in the city, which can either be a pro or con depending on how you look at it."
good,"The hours were fixed, but reasonable. The amount of effort you put in is directly reflected by your paycheck. I would not recommend this job for anyone with out a pleasant disposition, some guests are hard to please, but some are just wonderful."
good,"The hotel industry is a great place.  Cross training in other departments is available and plenty of overtime is available.  If you are someone who likes every day to be different, then the hotel industry will give you that."
good,"I started off as a reservationist and really enjoyed talking to people on  the telephone and communicating by email.  i was voted Employee of the Month twice in my 5 years there and I won the Sales prize for the most Suites sold 3 times.  The reward was always a free dinner for two."
good,I really enjoyed working at Starwood although it just wasnt the job made for me. They had a hard time with working around my schedule and couldn't accommodate around my personal and school schedule.
good,"Working at the Courtyard Marriott has taught me a lot of interpersonal skills and how to work with customers. "
good,"A typical day at work is good, refreshing, pleasant people. Since being employed at this Courtyard I've learned a lot more of being more responsible. the management staff is pleasant and kind. the co-workers are easy to get along with but you have your good/bad days overall good.the hair in bathrooms so disgusting.being able to sometimes appreciate your co-workers."
good,A typical day at work would be checking in guests in rooms. Everyday I learn something different. Every manager do their job and make sure each employer do their job as well. My co-workers are very nice people and we work as a team. The hardest part about my job is trying to make sure every guest is happy and nothing goes wrong. The most enjoyable thing about my job is meeting new people and being able to talk to new people about anything.
good,"lernt jeden Tag neue sachen. interpersonal skills development, Communication skills,"
good,I have worked for Marriott in Noblesville for 1 year now. Its been a decent gig and compared to most entry level jobs it's got very nice pay. I work front desk and night audit. Audit is very nice because its about 5 hours of netflix and 3 hours of actual work. Now having said that it has all but obliterated my free time. I work extra shifts a lot and we are so understaffed that when someone quits the rest of us really take a hit. The management tries their best and are very cool but it just takes a toll after a while. You also can't expect a raise or any benefits until you've worked at the same location for at least a year.
good,"Check and inspect room"
good,"The greatest thing about Starwood is definitely the loyalty it offers to its guests. SPG program is simply the best membership program among all the multinational hotel corporations."
good,Muchas expectativas por ser proyecto nuevo bajo una gran operadora hotelera
good,Pay isn't substantial enough for what is required. Was fun overall but felt over qualified for position and under paid. I would definitely work for this company again for a better pay rate.
good,"I already put this down above  The co-workers were very nice to work with .. They were also very helpful in working with me.  The hardest part of this job is not enough hours"
good,"This job keeps you busy. The guest service industry is great. Interacting with people, guests and associates never gets boring. That is the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with personality conflicts."
good,"I loved the managers and the complete environment of the Marriot, great benefits .there were no hard parts of the job I learned to work better with co workers here."
good,"I really think my current employer has helped me sharpen the house keeping skills. this is due to the required targets that are set on daily basis. I have gained more time management skills."
good,My co-workers are like family we have fun together we laugh and cry and may have arguments but we are family and try to work together as family. I learned alot of new etiquette skills working in banquets. Management was good they try to do what they could to help out. The hardest was trying to adjust to new people and new ways of thinking. The enjoyable part was meeting new people and communicating with them and working the events.
good,"Great culture, great company.  I am a little annoyed that you are forcing me to write more about my company.  I said it has a great culture and a great company with great work/life balance."
good,"I always looked forward to going into work in the mornings.  My co-workers were my family and the guests were my friends.  My day was mostly always the same, in terms of my responsibilities.  However, the job was exciting because you just never know what will happen in a day in the hospitality industry. "
good,"Typical day is: checking in guests, checking out guests, handling guest problems, training new associates, training supervisors at times, and working with your team to get the day done. Management is okay, and, as in most companies, have their good days and bad days. Co-workers are awesome and almost always have your back. We work well as a team and get the hotel great scores and our owners lots of money. Hardest part of the job is having to work at hours that your friends might not, for example, working overnight or getting off super early when your friends are at work. Be expected to work almost every weekend unless you are upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with people from all over the world and getting to know them and their cultures."
good,"We maintain 3 large facilities with limited supplies and team members, and 2 of the facilities are 40 years old or older. I have learned a lot from hands on experience and working with other vendors and technicians."
good,"Being in the Marriott brand and family, professionalism and culture of the company is very important. One of the key aspects of being a world class customer service company."
good,"Great benefits with employee discounts towards hotel and traveling expenses. "
good,"Working at the Fairfield Inn & Suites was extremely easy for the most part. There were always some days that were especially tasking, but for the most part it was a very laid back work environment. I learned a lot about talking to people, and also hospitality. I had one co-worker who was incredible with the guests, I would say I learned most of what I know about people now from him. I worked there for almost two years and gained a lot of knowledge."
good,The site manager position was a good job. However the work life balance was almost non existent. being scheduled by regional managers to work 16 hours a day six days a week. and oft a few hours on the 7th day didn't leave much room for balance.
good,Very simple and easy going if you know what you are doing and most of the staff is very friendly and polite. I personally maintain the building so it always looks at its best.
good,"At the Westin Waterfront you have the opportunity to work in an 800 room downtown Boston Convention hotel. If you can be a concierge here there is nothing you can't do."
good,"Good to work at"
good,"i make reservations , take phone calls , answer calls, direct calls.."
good,"There are no Typical days, and this was one of the reasons I enjoyed working here. Everyday presented new challenges. I also really enjoyed meeting people from all over the world."
good,"Good company to work for, great hotel products. Moving on looking for new opportunities in New York, but if I could I would stay with Starwood, great company!"
good,"Good place to work.  needs training on dealing with individuals lifes."
good,Beautiful property just need the funds and the right management team to assure it is truly a Diamond in the dessert type of property.
good,Good environment to learn Quality Control and Customer Service. Good growth potential for young professionals. Poor balance of work  and family hours
good,The company takes pride in servicing the guests/clients of the hotel. You learn allot about customer service and how to professionally care for your customer and brand.
good,"I enjoyed working with Starwood Hotels specially regarding the hotel Brands and lifestyle culture and differentiations among all brands as well unique caracteristics, services and personality. "
good,Marriott is a corporation that franchises it's properties. Corporate customer care was constantly in touch and responsive to customer needs. The best part was being able to build an interesting relationship with other employees. The work itself demanding that we learn from each other through personal instruction and individual example.
good,Le Royal Meridien was a Great experience to me. Staff are very Hospitable a fun to work with .. Supportive Management and offer a High level of customer service .. Very Professional in dealing guest . Service Oriented.
good,"Marriott Maida Vale Front office is a lively and productive work place with a wide variety of staff from different cultures and backgrounds, "
good,Starwood is a great company and working in the Bay are is particularly exciting. Our hotel exec team as well as all the regional executives are very dynamic leaders.
good,"i work with the best team players in t he world, we always work and have fun while at it and at the end very productive "
good,"I overall liked this job very much. It was a fast paced environment, I learned to multi task and enhance my customer service skills on a day to day basis. Hardest part of the job was the weather, working in temperatures of up to 115 degree was tough but we had access to plenty of shade and water. Co-workers were around same age so it was fun and communication was never an issue. Most enjoyable part was interacting with the guests and always staying busy. The downfall was the opportunity to move up was hard, with the minimal supervision there was really no one to see the hard work put into the job and thus when trying to move up it was difficult. Management for the most part was available when needed. overall the company knows to take care of their employees and keep them happy."
good,My co-workers are like family here and I enjoy working with them. Marriott associate greet all associates and treat them as a valueable person at all times.
good,"I loved working here, I enjoyed to personal connections I made with the guests that I assisted on a daily basis. The professionalism was great and I enjoyed being able to make every guest feel as if they were at home."
good,"longs hours, have had a lot of training- good experience"
good,"All about enhancing the guests' experience in any way possible.  This is a great company to sharpen your service skills.  Many corporate departments have to be involved with decisions at an operational level however, expected from a large company.  The most enjoyable part of working with this company is the great relationships you build and the vast knowledge gained from others."
good,"The Westin Poinsett of Greenville, SC was built as a family business. There was no growth of opportunity within the Westin."
good,marriott expects no less than the best from their workers. An influx of can sometimes be overwhelming but besides that it is a fun and professional place to work. great place to work with customers hands on.
good,"I helped open this hotel and loved it. The only challenge was not having enough staff from time to time."
good,Working with the Residence Inn was a great experince I got to meet alot of guests that are traveling around the world. Many guests with many stories. Working with coworkers and being very close to them and meeting thier families and feeling like they are also your family is a great feeling. Sometimes you have to make a dission on yoyr own and hope that its the right one that your making.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the guests."

good,Marriot is a great place to work for. My day would include doing hourly rounds of the building inside and out. The management tem is always there to answer questions if any arose.
good,What love the most was meeting different people. I learn a lot things working for this company. It was a great company to work for.
good,"You will begin by 3 week in class schedule which you will be paid for unless you are absent. You must pass the final exam in order to graduate to a sales associate"

good,bad  management fair wages equal oppurtunities but the experience gained was positive for future hotel employment and peachtree hotel services needs to get right
good,I was on a casual hours contract but they still gave me loads of sifts throughout the month. I was able to be flexible around my college work and my university auditions. Co workers really friendly and really made the job worth it for me.
good,"This was my first job after graduating into college and although it was hard for me and it was very tiring because you've got to set up the whole big Banquet areas and finish the whole service, it was still fulfilling at the end of the day that you've got to see and experience working on a big company such as Marriott."

good,Currently under going a major renovation...Great environment and staff are reliable and fun to be around. Things are looking upwards..
good,I enjoyed my job at Marriott St Louis West and love doing what I did. Wish I actually worked for Marriott International Inc vs TPG Industries a franchisee. Management sucked and did not want to promote again even though I demonstrated the skills and attitude needed for the job.
good,It was a nice place to work at. I loved my supervisor and co-workers. I was able to meet new people from all over the world. It was a cool place to work at.
good,"Overall this was a good place to work"
good,"benefits package, normal hours of work.  paid vacation, management has an open door policy.  Would assist you with your education."
good,the work shifts would be good and always active included with team breaks and meetings to ensure that targets are meet as a team. you would learn how to treat guests and how they should be approached  and spoken to.
good,working with Marriott has been memorable and fasinating. The company culture is great and provides employee's with a supportive  environment. My concerns is the company  in the last few years have been eliminating  strong departments in they establishment which makes me think where are there headed in the future. Over all the company is a great!
good,"There are so many opportunities to meet interesting people from all over the world, from all different walks of life."
good,"When I started at the Residence Inn it was because of my mother and it was a nice atmosphere, the coworkers are alright and I've kept in touch with a few. Management could be better, would've been nice to have more hours and if they would've worked with me on it."
good,Typical work day involved very heavy phone communication with Clients and well as departments within the hotel.  Worked closely with clients to ensure meetings and events went smoothly and according to plan.  Communication needed between all departments in order to provide exactly what the client is looking for.  Very busy work environment with everyday different!

good,"The Marriott is a great company to work for. In time, one can move up."
good,Great place to grow and advance in the Hospitality Industry
good,"It was very hard at Marriott.  My two managers were very young and had minimal experience.  I had over 7 years of experience in the industry and they were both straight out of college.  They both resigned or transfered in my first six months.  I was the next in charge and had to fill two mangers positions which left me living in the hotel because i would open the restaurants at 4 am and close at 2 am.  I lived at that hotel, i learned that you need reliable people around you.  The best part of the job was the staff!  They were amazing and helped out whenever they could and that made me proud!  It was very difficult to manage 5 outlets by yourself for sometimes 20 hours at a time (coffee shop, sports bar, sushi bar, martini bar, and room service) for clientele with very high expectations."
good,"Decent place to work at. Great coworkers and at times great guests. Daily routine consists of heavy breakfast rush and a lot of heavy duty cleaning. Management is very demanding to keep up appearances and neglect to realize the amount of guest traffic. Management is very indecisive, not cohesive and although they claim to want to ""work together to solve issues,"" not much is done about it and must be resolved on your own."
good,"Le Meridien ,Bangalore India is a turning point to my carrier not only am become a senior house keeping supervisor with that a good trainer for the new joines and co-workers,Started as a hotel operation trainee ,my work and good attitude towards guest and management leads me to higher level as senior supervisor .Hardest part of the job is some times its difficult to manage the insufficient guest supplies for example (linen&other room supplies) , enjoyable part is to make my guest happy without any complaints and make sure that they are satisfied with our service so that for their next visit they choose here."
good,"Marriott Corporation is an excellent employer.  Many opportunities for advancement through formal training on an internal educational portal.  Benefits & salary comparable to other industry positions."
good,A typical work day at Starwood would include heavy call volumes from customer's all over the world booking hotel reservations. I learned how to overcome the customer's objections when booking their hotel rooms. I think the hardest part of the job was not being able to please everyone all of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was me having the satisfaction in knowing that I was able to help people plan their vactions.
good,"My duties included repairs and maintenance for all HVAC equipment, pool and spa equipment, kitchen fryers, coolers, skillets, and dishwasher, and hot water boilers. Also perform all types of electrical, plumbing, pump and motor repairs and installations as well as any type of room repairs.  I perform all preventive maintenance with great care and enthusiasm and my work attendance and my attention to detail is impeccable."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"I did a lot of managements paperwork and reports every day at work. Couldn't accept the Operations Manager positions/Front Desk Manager position due to maternity/family leave. Always a busy day, worked 40 hours a week and always looked forward to work thanks to a good work environment and good people. Loved my coworkers. Loved meeting new people everyday from different states and countries."

good,"45 hour work weeks, occasional nights and weekends, management team all worked well.  I loved my staff.  The hardest part was a quick response to timely issues.  I learned that the grass isn't always greener on the other side, and I missed it."
good,Run 27 hotel around the state of florida. With all related with maintenance services have two well train tech and 27 chief engineer the I supervises and give direction .
good,Great place to be. I enjoy meeting new people everyday. Guests are felt very important when we show interest of their visit.
good,"This was a high volume job during the age of lounge entertainment."
good,Love the great people you work for. They believe in you making decisions for the guest and associates.
good,"I loved working at Marriott!  A typical day began with the other Admin Assistants, talking about our day and what we had coming our way. I started out as a Temp, through Courtney Services, but they ended up keeping me on permanently. I learned so much through working there. when it came time to proposals, the marketing skills kicked in big time.  I was not without fault though and made several mistakes, that I did correct.  The hardest part of my job was being a new mom a couple years later and not seeing my daughter grow and change. I loved all the people, with a few exceptions of the higher up positions.  When they let me go, it was very unprofessional and the RVP made me wait all day long to find out.  My boss kept contacting him to make him tell me ASAP, but that never happened.  The one girl offered to give up her job that just recently started working there, so I could have my job, as my husband did not have employment at the time and we had a new baby.  They would not let her do this, as she had one extra month of seniority over me through the company."
good,"The summary pretty much says it all. The management company is small with only 3 hotels in their portfolio. Strangely they have a ""corporate"" HR person who, in my opinion, is unnecessary. That's not to say she doesn't try to help, but I believe that due to the company's size there is not enough work to keep her busy. The guests are primarily LTS and are contractors so keeping the floors clean is a challenge, but other than that the property is in good shape."
good,"Great company. They are willing to help you grow, they encourage it. With their many properties you find different managing styles which is a good thing as long as you find great leaders. My last property was fun, great co-workers but there was no growing, no opportunity to move forward. Management did not take the time to know the employees which made it difficult. They don't acknowledge you except when something is wrong and of course since they have no idea who you are you have to defend yourself, prove why or why not. "
good,"Marriott is a great company to work for. They believe in career advancement to the fullest, allowing you to be in a department for a short while, before offering promotions. They're growing world wide, expanding out to different countries and being apart of the experience is awesome! Marriott also offers amazing benefits! (Vision, dental, 401K, etc.)"
good,"I enjoy my job because meeting new people and learning about different places is enjoyable.  I work with an awesome team.  Everyone know what needs to get done while working at the Front Desk at the Greensboro Marriott.  The hardest part is sufficient work to last for 8 hours.  Upper Management does not understand that even though we do the same job every day, we should still be compensated for meeting goals the company mandates.  That you need to stay focus because you never know what is going to happen on a given day."
good,Working hard to clean rooms and the hotel. I learned how to pay attention to even the minor most details. We are like a family at work we know how to have fun and still get the work done. The hardest part of the job is not to get overly mad when people trash a room and don't leave a tip.
good,"I was a F&B server in the Bistro (I had previous restaraunt experience) and had chance to learn the Front Desk job duties. I wanted to work the Front Desk a little more but I guess they couldn't find someone to cover the restaraunt for me.  Management tried their best I guess, but I can say they lacked respect from their employees. Most of my co-workers were awesome and easy to work with, others not so much. Hardest & most enjoyable part would all fall into dealing with hotel guests. Some guests were very needy and never happy, other were easy going."
good,"I would recommend the job and the Establishment. The company is of a clean and precise fashion, in which the guidelines and regulations follow suit. The environment is centered on friendly and classy."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of a very busy environment. The bar and the rest of the restaurant was mostly busy 95% of the time. I learned how to craft alcoholic beverages and mix them to perfection. I also learned how to multi- task seeing that I would need to get more than one thing done at a time. I also learned how to work at a very fast pace if necessary. Management was not that well but the associates always worked through, and eventually mastered how to utilize team work. I got along with all of my co-workers and really enjoyed their company while on the job. The hardest part of the job was working long hours, sometimes without any breaks. The most enjoyable part of my job was pleasing my guests and ensuring that they had a satisfied dining experience while I was on the clock."
good,I have met some incredibly awesome people throughout my tenure at the Marriott.
good,"I love my job, but management picks favorites and they treat you like a slave. The most enjoyable part of my job is being creative and being good at what i do.The hardest part of my job is the long hours and trying not to eat everything."
good,"It let me know what is team work in Westin hotel.Although it is a hard and difficult work but I have a lot of experience for customer service, how is company to operate and I think  to be in contact with the co- worker is the most important thing."
good,i got chance to direct connect with customer. it was so fun and creation working with starwood company.
good,A typical day on the job as a houseman requires maintaing all the public facilities in a timely manner ensuring the houseman has additional time for guest requests and immediate requests from supervisors. Additional duties include maintaining the housekeeper carts making sure they don't get low on supplies and discarding of trash and used linens.
good,"A company where you have the opportunity to learn a lot , in any area that you are in ."
good,"•	Customer Service: assisted customers/residents with needs by satisfying requests in a timely manner, ensuring a great and comfortable stay"
good,"Setting up rooms via diagram, lifting, moving heavy equipment. Setting up a bar from the mobile bar to fruits and alcohol. I worked in different departments of the company to gain as much knowledge as i can. I worked room service, house keeping, and every position in banquets. I was trusted to even manage my own events at busy times. I love working with my Banquet family, i appreciate having trust worthy coworkers. "
good,I was valet so it was pretty fun and laid back when no events were going on. Management is great!
good,"Es un buen trabajo con bastantes beneficios pero uno tiene que tener una buena disposición para trabajar bajo stress. Hay un aire de compañerismo con las demás áreas de trabajo."
good,over all I enjoyed working for Marriott their was just no room for advancement.
good,"Muitos aprendizados, pessoas muito dedicadas, sempre dispostas e explicar, mostrar como fazer, o melhor jeito aprendi muito e gostei muito apesar de ser pouco tempo ."
good,"I work from home which i really enjoyed that i was saving alot of gas but i never minded driving to austin i love the area. The difficult part working from home was that you get really comfortable, I like to talk so it would get boring so it was hard to manage staying up and focused. I learned how to cross sell to other properties to make a sale which was cool because we recieved incentives for that. I had to leave, the shift bids was the down fall after 3 months you had to change your shift which that would be hard because I always keep two jobs so that did not work out like i thougt it would but im happy i received my experience with working in the hotel enviroment."
good,Housekeeping department is the core of the hotel. It is a decent job. If you are willing to work.
good,"Great company with lots of opportunity for advancement.  Three weeks of paid training.  Good support from management and fellow team members.  Potential to make additional money based reservations made, AMEX referrals, SPG enrollments and perfect attendance."
good,Marriott is a pretty good company to work for. A place where good people work who are hardworking and dedicated to the job. The most enjoyable part of working for Marriott is the interaction with the people you meet.
good,"Marriott was wonderful. I was thrilled to have been hired with such a well-known company internationally and have learned much about hotel sales."
good,"Bill Marriott says:"
good,"A typical day at work would be to check in and check out customers. And in house keeping to ensure the rooms were prepared for the next guest. What I learned about working at a hotel is that it can be very demanding and you have to be very detail orientated when it comes to customers. Always have respect for your management due to hotels are always giving you raises and its just good manners. Don't gossip about your co-workers but try to have a friendly atmosphere cause you have to work and see those people everyday. The hardest part of the job is probably when you make a mistake to be honest. If you on accident give someone a wrong room they are not happy. Again ""attention to detail""!!! The most enjoyable part of the job was the extended stay customers that would greet you by name when you come and you could actually call yourself a friend to them."
good,"A typical day in my role is to make sure nothing has gone drastically wrong before I got to work, then get on top of any H&S issues and FLS issues. Order stock for tema to do their job. Prioritise work for department and plan the FFE refurb."
good,"Marriott International's core values foster a work environment unlike any other I have ever worked in. The staff is diverse, eclectic and super fun. Executive and senior-level managers act as mentors to their younger counterparts. Most movement happens within the company as one always knows someone fit for the job at hand--whether it be an executive relative or associate working their way up the corporate ladder. Jobs in the hospitality industry are tough and leaders are required to work at a minimum 10-12 hrs days. Labor intensive activities are part of the job at all levels."
good,"Worked there for several of years and only had issues with upper management, but they are all gone and hotel is being taken over by a new company. I hope these new changes that are about to take place will be for the better of the employees who are choosing to stay and for the new arrivals."
good,"Person in Charge of the Overland Park Courtyard during the night shift."
good,"Making sure all guest room especially in my area is in order, neat and clean."
good,"Everyday I learn new things from my work place: "
good,"Clock in at the time clock with I.D. next to the Security Office."
good,The Marriott Hotel was a fun and enjoyable experience were i developed a lot of skills that would be beneficial for any workplace. My typical day was cleaning the gym and serving the customers on the till.
good,"A good place to work during the summer. Good pay & benefits, hours slow down in winter time."
good,"Very busy days with many deadlines for payroll and HR"
good,There was not much business as this place is not developed much so ppl does not have much work so they are playing good politics from the top level
good,"Independent working environment with very friendly, welcoming individuals."
good,"Unless you have worked at a hotel before, it is very difficult to advance in the company.  Managers are hardly ever there to manage their team and only listen to ""hear say""."
good,"Learned a lot about hotel management back of the house"
good,"between union power and corporate very little was ever accomplished as far as improving business or work conditions."
good,mainly focusing on guest satisfaction but very difficuilt to maintain a work and life balance.
good,We set tables and chair for all hotel events I learned how to adapt to the different customers and provide quality customer service.
good,Daily maintenace and fixing anything that broke.  Good learning experience.  Co-workers were very pleasant to work with.  Very good working conditions.
good,Fun to work at nigh as you learn a lot but it depends on the people working with you
good,Very nice place to work because they have everything right there at headquarters.  The problem with that is they make it so easy to swipe your employee card for food and discounted items in the gift shop.  They also have many vendors visiting selling their goods and you end up spending your entire paycheck.  They pay you well but then you give it all right back.
good,"I was harassed by a coworker and instead of taking action against that employee, I was demoted and then ""let go"". I had complained to HR many times and they did nothing."
good,"Fast paced environment with little room for error.  Management not afraid to empower employees and supervisors however resources are few due to company's (Columbia Sussex) ""lean"" approach to operations."
good,I want to work there I have experience with housekeeping for 2years.
good,"I enjoyed working the Westin Hotel."
good,"Good place to start in hotel experience. once you work for a Marriott you can practically get a job at any Marriott after working for one. "
good,"Hospitality industry does not sleep, odd hours, loved helping people having best vacation and work related stays"
good,I enjoyed working at Marriott for the weekends. This was a good experience and liked how I grew in knowledge different from teaching.
good,"We setup for events that have booked by our sales team, make sure that we have everything setup for the clients that they have requested. I have learned how to give great customer service and how to help brand the company. Management team is always there for employee's if we need help or when we have to solve any problems. Co-workers are hardworking individuals who does great work at whatever position they hold, including myself. The hardest part of the job would be working 16-17 hour days, and not knowing when you have to come in for work. The most enjoyable part is meeting and dealing with the clients and working with great co-workers."
good,"my working time lunch & dinner 6 day, 1 day off ( but sometime nothing because of training) i been work 6 years, Actually  I learned a lot of things from them , how to deal with the guest, standard of the company, knowledge product ,customer service ,over all hygiene  ,motivate ,anticipate and etc. i learned  the work of hotel hospitality. what i can say for  management  for me i don't want to say any thing one word only i learned from them. my co- working its like family brother & sister we are fine & enjoying our work to make easily ( but with standard rule for time of work) the hardest part your doing your best that you can but no benefits . the enjoyable part is with my co-worker and my job."
good,"This Hotel had to many manager from the General Manger on down."
good,"At W Hollywood, your work is your life. That said, it is a really fulfilling environment.  Day to day is very different.  "
good,"you walk into a great and energetic workplace,to where you learn how to perform leadership,teamwork along with great decision making skills.Also being in the hospitality business you learn how to perform more patience and dedication,to satify the guess needs along with leading and motivating your co-workers, and which will allow the company to have great success.the hardest part of the job is when we have a game plan set up and having to alter it for guess satisfaction.The most enjoyable part is satisfying the guess and reaching our goals for the company."
good,"Marriott International as a company has good benefits with flexable work schedules depending on the department. My work starting time was not something that was set in stone because of how traffic is in this area. Once arriving at work,  I really enjoyed working with everyone in the 8 offices around the United States. What would often create challenges is the fact the management lack the communication and leadership skills to create a good work enviroment. This would make the job hard than it had to be. "
good,"Typical day began at 8AM or earlier, review messages and e-mails; often 40 or more in a n evening. Prioritize call backs, visit clients in house prior to meeting / events. Spend next 9-10 hours on phone and e-mails concluding business or getting out proposals and contracts. Had as many as 5 contracts per day and 12 -18 proposals. Review rates with revenue manager/ GM before sending out any proposals that were below expected group rates. Check on billing, deposits, any outstanding balances or final billings."
good,"The staff is very helpful and friendly, however often times shifts went until past midnight.  As it is a call centre setting, you are required to be doing mundane and repetitive tasks for the duration of your shift. If you prefer face to face contact with customers and a job in which you are continually learning, this is not the place.  However, if you prefer a very easy, repetitive job, this is a good place. "
good,"Great place to work but not enough hrs."
good,I entered this company as an entry level employee where I learned most of my my office and clerical skills.  The hardest part of the job was keeping all financial records and books balanced.  Of course the most enjoyable part of the job as getting along well with my co-workers.
good,Great place to start a career in the call center department. the hardest part about the job is being patience with the training. The most enjoyable part is to be part of the guest experince with their hotel stay.
good,"The westin is a great company, but it all depends on the work environment created."
good,"Taking stock and inventory, what comes in and what goes out. This is also an interactive environment with an individual skill working alone without any supervision as the case may be. You are expected to manage work schedule making sure everything are put in place and you are able to complete your assignment and help others to accomplished theirs. Its fun working in this kind of environment because you are able to move from place to place. The work here can be risky and demanding. "
good,"its a ok job but bad hours there is no day hours and you have to work weekends, the pay is not bad for the job they do get good discounts"
good,"aquire new responsibilities, take initiative on my own and build my trade skills stronger"
good,"*Heavy communication, coordinating, upselling, and operations."
good,"I would suggest MBS to anyone. It was a good place to work. The typical day would vary depending on what job it is. Customer Service is a good way to get your foot in the door, but you should be on the lookout for other good opportunities within the company when they come along."
good,As Director of Sales I was responsible for the overall monetary success of the hotel.
good,"Open and close bar area, maintaining cleanliness and full stock of bar equipment and liquors. Provided quick, efficient and friendly service to customers. Boosted customer base and established repeat clientele. Expanded offerings were well received by customers. Rewarded for delivering exceptional service and sales performance"
good,Normal day at work involes loading cart and cleaning rooms on the list provided.
good,"was hard to advance, pay was below par, very good benefits, and hours were great."
good,"en dicha empresa se rolan tres turnos matutino, vespertino y nocturno al yegar al hotel se checa al personal en turno su asistencia se cordinan las trasportaciones ya que estas comiensan desde la 6 am. se asiste alas distintas areas con apertura de puertas en accesos controlados se checa en general la funcion correcta de las intalaciones, reportando las distintas fallas a las areas correspondientes se realisa bitacora electronica la cual es enviada por correo al gerente general . se cordinan las comidas en tre mi equipo de trabajo, la parte mas difisil cuando falla el sistema electronico de alguna chapa de habitaciones ya que hay que desarmarla y esto yeva mucho tiempo y el huesped espera lo mismo con cajas de seguridad ya que por olvido de clave se tiene que resetiar y lo que mas me gusta es conoser a jente extranjera las cuales comentan sus anecdotas durante su estadia esto me llevo a mejorar mi ingles y que cada dia es diferente. todo lo dicho lo aprrendi en este hotel ya que no avia laborado en el ramo hotelero"
good,Great place to work for a college student but difficult to transition into a long term career. Advancement opportunities are few and far between but the company itself has great values and a commitment to their employees. Hotel discount benefits. Great work/life balance IF you arrange time off well in advance.
good,workl is typically easy going but sometimes get busy. nice employees and great hotel discounts with Marriott
good,"During a typical day, I deal with guests (customers) all day long. Most of them are wonderful, but there are the few that are challenging. I feel that they are the ones that make me work the hardest, but the reward is the best. I have learned numerous things about customer service as well as myself, but inconsistency in my hours is causing me to look elsewhere for a new career. I do not have the financial stability that I need right now, but I love my job and the people that I work with."
good,Everyday is a new adventure. I look at everyday as a day to learn something new but also teach something new and working for the Marriott has helped with that. I have worked with some of the best managment. Managers that get down and dirty with the staff. My co-workers are like family. My hardest part of my job is we are open 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. The part of my job i have enjoyed the most are the amazing people i work with everyday.
good,"I've been with the company for about 13 years and the compensation and benefits are excellent. The company has very good job security (thus the 13 years of employment), however, the management is not exactly up to par when comes to motivating and leading by example with other associates. Management needs to focus more on their co-workers/employees and how their job performance is progressing from the day they are hired. In other words, follow up with their employees and make sure they understand what exactly is expected of them, i.e. sit down meetings employee evaluations."
good,Great hotel
good,A typical work day for me is driving people to and from the airport! The best thing I learned from job was learning the south side & the airport in and out. I liked working with management and my co-workers!
good,a typical day at work making sure any guest with problems in there rooms is fixed and taken care of. I learned teamwork and leadership while working at the courtyard. the hardest part of the job had to be the PTAC systems.
good,a typyical day is the joy of exceeding not just one discoverer but making vaulable exceptions to meet and wow our guest. The management may not recieve the momentious amount of compliments we receive on a daily basis therfore the department appreciation is some what low. The co-workers take every demand or request into sincere consideration as if it were there own request.
good,• Setting up banquet and meeting spaces
good,"Upon arriving at the office, I review any new/revised information that may have been posted the night before, confirm any changes or updates to the current computer system and programs. Myself and co-workers are responsible for maintaining knowledge of over 2000 hotels worldwide and relaying informating to clients calling to make hotel reservations,book conferences, change dates, locations, etc. I work together with a team of 30-36 people meeting sales goals on a monthly basis as well as personal goals set daily regarding calls per hour, revenue, conversion and sales per hour."
good,"Great benefits and job security. Due to the nature of hotel industry, odd working hours calls for work/life imbalance."
good,"A typical day at work starts with planning and pre-arrival preparation to make sure everything goes smooth. I print important reports and go over them do ensure a successful day. I manage a shuttle log for transportation to local businesses for our guests, take room service orders,and do inventory. Also, I am very dedicated to the arrival of the guest at check in, as well as over the phone. We provide concierge at the front desk since we don't have a separate department for that. I communicate with other departments to pass on information regarding the guest and any other necessary instruction. I have learned to take control of a situation, be a very good listener, organized, as well as many other things. The hardest part of the job is getting everyone who works at the hotel on the same page eo ensure the hapiness of the guest. The most enjoyable part of the jos is working with people and learning how to react to any given situation."
good,Great company with established process and training resources to complete your job.
good,A typical day in the hotel I arrive at 6:45 a.m. for a 7 a.m. 3 p.m. shift. Review what happened in the previous shift and look for immediate needs of the guest so they can have the best time ever. Best part of the job was the team work and making sure everything was running like it should be in the hotel. A Front Desk Agent is the face of the hotel and first impression of the customer so I always make sure they were feeling like home.
good,"I want to feel the real international experience , I Learned alot but dats not enough . Co workers were nice ,hardest part was shortage of staff n i enjoyed talkin to guests and the getogether we used to have in our hotel."
good,Working at the courtyard was a great experience. I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. Management was always around to listen and offer advice. My coworkers were a great group of people who I enjoyed to be around. The job consisted of room calls and cleaning of the hotel. Interacting with guests and helping them to their satisfaction always put a smile on my face.
good,Night Auditor and Front Desk Clerk. Helped guests enjoy their experience at the hotel
good,"This was my first experience in housekeeping, and would prefer not to do it again. But during my experience i can really say that the staff is great and the hotel stays very clean. The hardest part was cleaning within a timeframe, but the best part was my co-workers and the fun we had."
good,"very busy, great opportunity to meet people from around the country. Near a military base"
good,A typical day at work with Residence Inn is overall good.
good,Guest services representative was fun.
good,"Marriott as a whole is a great company, however many of the properties are franchised. the company I worked for was a franchised property which was difficult for the management group/owner to ""live up"" to the Marriott standards. Marriott has obtainable goals for all there properties, however I would recommend anyone seeking a job to work for Marriott Corp, that will allow for better pay and benefits. Choosing to work for a franchised property you're choosing to work for a Marriott brand, but work that that management group which can result in no benefits. There is no employee requirement in pay and benefits in franchised properties, just the proper training is required."
good,"Good starter for entry into customer service industry, experience and option to advance is there."
good,"Some days could be slow while other were very busy, because of this i've learned how to expect nothing a prepare for anything. I work in the only resturant in the hotel that was connected to to a convention center that held events for thousand of people at a time, that all got hungry at the same time."
good,"It's a convention hotel so I have learned how to work in a fast-paced hotel setting using my customer service skills to assist all of our business guests in a fast, efficient and friendly manner. I work with a very diverse group of individuals and have learned a lot from every single one of them. It's a great atmosphere to practice my Spanish with guests and with my fellow coworkers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with guests that have high expectation but the most enjoyable part of my job is getting positive feedback from guests when I go above and beyond for their needs."
good,"A typical night would start with me locking the doors to secure the hotel so my guests could sleep safely and then after clocking in, I would see if there was any information that needed to be passed on and I would begin collecting the paperwork from the day, sorting it in the proper piles to be placed in its proper files at the end of Audit. I mainly was my own boss, making quick decisions in the middle of the night if needed and that for me was the hardest part because you have to make a split decision sometimes and hope that it was in the best interest of the guest first then the hotel. I loved the Mgmt staff because I knew that no matter what decision I made, that as long as I kept my guests safe & happy, the mgmt was behind me 100% and I had more confidence in myself. The best part of my job was knowing that everything I did at night was appreciated by not only Mgmt but the rest of the staff. To be randomly told Thank you for helping with laundry or leaving notes about inquiries from guests, I knew that I was valued as an employee and a person."
good,Great environment to work in
good,Server
good,"I would go in after class, and just attach myself to one of the 5 chefs that were there. he/she would tell me where to go and what to do for that day and the next day. I would go from making a fruit and cheese platter for 500 + people, to cooking sirloin steak for 40 people. It was very hard to keep up with the management because noone knew what they were doing, or what parties were going where. My co-workers were very high-strung and were never stress free."
good,"The pay is good, better than a lot of places. Amazing benefits. Lots of positions and opening with easy transfers. The directors are great as are the Chefs, and the GM. Although, a lot of the Managers are lazy and don't know what they are doing."
good,Good Work Place Nice Co-Workers Enjoyed my time There
good,This was my first job and i was very young. It was a great place to work and you got to interact with alot of different people.
good,No one day is the same! There is always something wonderfully new to be discovered each day
good,"Great company to work for. Great values, great benefits, however salary for sales and marketing has dropped significantly since the economic downturn."
good,worked there for 17 years and is now closing monson state developmental center
good,"Whan I started my employment it was a Starwood Company then purchased by Marriott. The transition a fairly smooth. Good job security but advancement was was difficult. "
good,"The girls that I worked with were awesome, the customers that stayed in the Hotel were easy to please. The General Manager was not a people person, but the Asst. General Manager made up for her, she and still is awesome...Worked in Marriott in Foxboro MA."
good,"Overall it's a good job. Co-workers are fun and light hearted. The environment is also very friendly. The only downside I would say, (so make sure to take note of this if you apply to work at Marriott), is that you work weekends and holidays."
good,Good benefits and Management. I worked for some great managers at Marriott.  It was truly a pleasure working for managers that truly cared about how you were doing.
good,"Great Company overall and learning experience of how an organization should be in America. However, to advance you must relocate to Maryland."
good,No one will teach you to humble yourself by the values you give to a job.things can be bad but you can overcome it by being responsible and willing to learn.opportunity in Marriott can become a value if you are what Marriott gives as an idea.
good,Excellent over all staff. And standard friendly people around. Good environment. Lots of opportunities to explore.within company . Exellent benefits over all. Good  skill development
good,Nice place to start career and everyone is willing to help you. The benefits are okay. All staff are okay. Just lack of activities among the staff. Nice salary
good,if you are in with the group then you are ok.  they do not pay well.  managers micromanage staff too much.  inconsistent management most of the time.  hard to respect them
good,I enjoyed working at Marriott. Benefits 👍👍 two thumbs up. No Promotion for those loyal and hardworking associates (sad). You have to apply for the position and most of the new hires are the one who were given the chance.
good,My time with Marriott was informative and productive. You will learn on your own with less supervision. Ia have been exposed to different areas in food production and they have taught me to prepare food nice and SEXY
good,"I enjoy working with my fellow colleagues, they make the difference every day and for that I'm grateful. I do appreciate all the challenges, mistakes and various scenarios I had dealt with. That has help me to be stronger and be a better person."
good,"Marriott International is fast paced, and can be stressful. Depending on your coping skills. In recent times there has been a dramatic change in management and things have become much better for progression."
good,"The spa was very flexible with my schedule. They treated you like an adult, but with booking order between provieders there could have been improvements."
good,A typical day at work was fast paced and ended with a sense of accomplishment. I learned to pay attention to detail and to do my job in a timely manor. Mostly management was friendly and helpful though where I worked they had employees they liked and ones they didn’t and it didn’t seem to be based on work quality. There were a lot of family members hired and it was cliquish.
good,The workers were great/ GM was interesting/ my manager was a decent man . There was no room for me to evolve and grow so I had to make a decision for my family to carry on
good,I worked for this company for many years andnit was one of the best hotels I ever worked for . I would definitely recommend this company to anyone else
good,"Great Company  for people who love to work in  challenging  environment. "
good,As it relates to learning new techniques; there isn't much teaching this is left up to the employee (this is with regards to the kitchens that is) . however there are multiple opportunities with regard to learning about the culture of the hotel (not much focus placed on departmental training however). It is a high paced environment and with that comes stress. As it relates to pay the kitchen staff is paid lower in comparison to competing hotels at a similar level. The benefits are great.
good,Need to pay more money employees work hard and I need to be paid right other than that they have great benefits advancement is okay other than that everything's okay
good,Everything feels great except the salary so they must sort it out and team is very good but management doesn't recognize the non managerial staff especially food and beverage
good,"No other company offers benefits as good as the Marriott. Unfortunately at the Courtyard (Augusta) location, we were constantly short staffed and was offered no help by management"
good,"working here has been amazing though new to the job, i was guided well and supported to learn the job well. friendly people,polite and very helpful. The company took care of the travel incase of a late night shift. flexible with your availability"
good,"I enjoy my time at Marriott at Sable Oaks. They are friendly, flexible, and overall organized. I liked their style and I still work there from time to time because I enjoy the people."
good,"Excellent opportunity cut short due to major change in senior IT managment being let do and the consultants working under them being let go shortly there after."
good,"I worked for more than 1 place. The management is the most important. It's can be fun and great place to work but if the MNG is not care about employees, it's can be very difficult to work for them. After all, it's great place to be and to gain new experience."
good,"A typical day at work consist of managing and delegating and assisting our guest in way possible. Managing 13 other individuals and making sure that they're going about our daily task. Parking guest cars, assisting the guest with their luggage and making the guest feel welcome and making a  personal connection with the guest. Making the guest feels like their a home away from makes my job worth while. It's for fulling to have been courtesy and professional to the guest  and they're wowed by the level of professionalism and respect shown to them during their stay."
good,"Typically Mon-Fri..  50 Hours per week. Can be longer."
good,It was a great experience working for Marriott. I learned a lot from Marriott and it helped me out in other areas in my life and other jobs I've had since.
good,Ambiente laboral variado radicado en las actitudes de pocas personal que laboran en dicho hotel  asi sucesivamente con la oportunidad  de crecimiento.
good,"You definitely make money here as a server/bartender, but you have to work pretty long hours. "
good,The upper management needs work. The pay and the amount of work you get is not fair. The hardest part of the job is relying on scores constantly that are slighted.
good,The overall experience working at this hotel was a mixed bag.This review doesn't amount to much. Nothing but a first job that I stayed way too long in.
good,"The marriott culture is really a very team oriented company. The brand standards are implemented daily involving what we wear, our attention to detail, and our over-all hospitality to our guest."
good,"It really depends on the hotel. I have worked for a couple Marriott hotels where the management was stellar, and worked at others with some of the worst managers that  I have ever heard of. They pay pretty well and the benefits are good. Career advancement is up to you. There are almost 7000 hotels worldwide, so if you want to move and grow, the options are there"
good,Not perfect but overall is a great place to gain experience and to advance if you are willing to relocate and learn new skills. Flexible work schedules but depending on the position you may be on call when away from property.
good,I think that it's a good place to be. If I had to help someone with a job I would tell them to take it and make the best of it because it's not to be permanently.
good,I enjoy my job at Marriott. I enjoy meeting and addressing each guest thoroughly. I feel respected and appreciated. I find it to be one of the best jobs I've had and don't plan on leaving anytime soon.
good,Mi trabajo era atender las llamadas de nuestros huespedes asi como de los companeros de trabajo. Realizar mantenimiento preventive y correctivo de todo del equipo en el hotel
good,"The Marriott Brand is a steady fast paced work environment. I have learned and still learn on a daily basis with the company. Management and employees do have a high turnover at the property I am located due to staff moving to new locations, schooling,  as well as job opportunities within the company and outside. "
good,It’s an ok job for just temporary use to me. It’s not a job I would want to have a career in for me to want to be here long. Some of the employees have attitudes which is never a good thing. The food is good at lunch. The general manager is very passionate and professionally cool. He actually cares about the employees and loves to see you strive and be great.
good,I love working in Marriot International and I learn new thing everyday and face new challenge everyday. Working environment are enjoy and fun. What I learn in Marriot International is always give best service toward customer.
good,Job and people are amazing. Pay is good for amount of work. A lot of customers are opinionated about what they want and how things are being run and can get really mad with change.
good,"I loved my job. It was hard, very busy, and always something to do. My work family is what really made this job wonderful. I was a one person accounting department, so I was in everything and learned as much as I could process in my time with the company."
good,Working for the Marriott was a great leaning experience and I love the hospitality atmosphere.Going above and beyond for our guest is something I take pride in. Like I said at the location I was at management was not the best is was very much a buddy buddy system and they let their personal life effect their jobs as professionals.
good,"Cool place to work, must love helping others. Hours can be long depending on occupancy rate and shift. No scheduled breaks. Must be willing to work alone"
good,"Average days consist of being a host at the restaurant and making sure everyone is happy and taken care of. Being a host has made me learn alot about guest services and the responsibility to balance and multitask many things professionally. Management is pretty good. All managers as far as i'm concerned always make sure that both guests and employees are happy and taken care of in the best of standards. The workplace environments themselves can be very easy paced or challenging depending on the situation of what's happening at the Marriott. For example: weekends are busy so the workplace is always fast paced and sometime sophisticated."
good,The managers attitude made the work environment awful so therefore everything and every work day was a bad experience so all I know is to do it right the first time and you won’t have to worry about anything
good,"Marriott International is a great company to work for. Employee suggestions are often acted on to enhance the productivity of the workplace. Marriott international has been voted as the best place to work for on multiple occasions."
good,"It’s an easy job. Repetitive work but easy. Mostly sitting, answering phones. I make decent money too. Just do your job and go home. It’s not that hard."
good,"Marriott is a demanding company to work for.  They have high expectations for your commitment, hours worked.  But there are rewards for your hard work."
good,"Very busy, always had something to clean or do. Management were wonderful and caring, and made banquets fun. It was hard work and lifting heavy things could be challenging at times."
good,Marriott is a good place to work if you are looking for something to work hard at and you don't care too much about benefits or a great work environment. I was a housekeeper and it was not the best thing but it paid the bills decently enough.
good,"great place to work, horrible management with poor communication skills.  Employees know whats going on more then upper management who doesn't even remember who they hired."
good,"- The management was nice with providing knowledge of job"
good,"Worked at one of many hotels Marriott owns and if it weren't for the general manager I'd probably never think of leaving but they were very vindictive towards their employees. Outside of management however it was a very relaxed work place meeting many new people and forming friendships with many co-workers. Day consisted of occasional stocking of our market along with interaction with guests; Check-in/out, market purchases, general conversation."
good,Great company for associates to work for.  The transition from Starwood to Marriott had a few growing pains but it is much smoother now and a more enjoyable company to work.
good,It's cool I liked it worked ar my own pace as long as you do what you suppose to do tou won't have any problems. Management could have been better....
good,"One of the busiest hotels in the downtown area that struggles to deal with how busy it is. Most days are pretty straight forward but you get some days that are just out of your control and you're forced to deal with angry guest and people looking to beg for any form of compensation they can get."
good,"Marriott International is an American multinational diversified hospitality company that manages and franchises a "
good,"I would come in early in the morning and once everyone was there, we would have a team meeting of everyone's task and what was expected for that event. The hardest part of the job is that not everyone contributes the same effort as some and the most enjoyable part was the 30 minute break."
good,"I enjoyed the pace, the continuous exchange with guests, solving problems, and each day I had the opportunity to make someone happy with service that went above and beyond their expectations."
good,"A fun place to work. You get to meet all kinds of people in movies, sports teams, you never know who you will run into. I really enjoyed working here except for the management."
good,You should take more interest to trainee's motivate them .. and they should provide uniforms to trainee's. And they should do other activities for trainee's
good,"Teaches you to be more proactive and to anticipate guests needs. Always thinks about the welfare of their employees. and they believe that if you take care of your employees, your employees will take care of your business. Makes good employee recognition with Brilliant Host program."
good,"Great supplement job. I wouldn’t have this as my only job because during certain seasons, it can be inconsistent. If you are committed you will be great"
good,this establishment offers advancement opportunities in the hotel and tourism field. It also allows growth in-house from entry level to management. a great place to work.
good,"Great location, really pleasant place to work , but the thing that makes this such a good place to work are the staff. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice.Initially i star my career in Food and  beverage then i moved to butler in front office and i got to know more about all the department.Brand like St Regis its my pleasure to work there as a butler."
good,"A lot of the employee-management interaction was a lot of high school gossip. They loved talking about other people and make fun of them. People with children got what hours they wanted via people who could work anytime. Too many people hired for part-time than full-time. Address are important and doing other peoples testing, they need to do that themselves."
good,a typical is never typical you meet many different people from all over the world which is great. Being able to do different things is helpful and never a dull momnt.
good,"The only thing that I was dissatisfied with was the rate of pay.  Other than that it was an enjoyable job.  If you don't have a family to support and you like dealing with people, this is  a great place to work."
good,"No structure in management"
good,The hotel has a strong and positive attitude for a newly branded location under the Marriott name.  The management is very understanding and flexible for the needs of the employees.  The environment is near a union based atmosphere.
good,"Collaborative environment, but at the expense of decision-making and speed. Great work-life balance. Excellent career longevity path - many employees stay for years!"
good,"work was fair and management seemingly peaked my interest. personal relationships with management left me at a disadvantage reporting any deficiencies with work production. housekeeping team communicated poorly and because of this several employees were left unaccountable at times and many areas of the hotel were left unattended. reprimanding employees  (in a manner to which the employee felt personally attacked by supervisors) only left the team to perform less for work overall effecting the hotels cleanness in the towns place sweet section. personal relationships between the general manager and the housekeeping manager put supervisors at a disadvantage to want to speak up about any issues pertaining to the hotel, inventory, or team communication."
good,Es una buena empresa para iniciarse en la Industria Hotelera solo que necesitan mejorar sus prestaciones.
good,"The Marriott name covers over 20+ different hotel brands - this  gives you a multitude of different places to transfer to and expand. Each property is unique in its own way.  My experience at this particular one was great benefits, good leadership and an overall awesome time."
good,Starwood Hotels and Resorts provided a challenging and rewarding workplace with opportunities to promote.  The corporate employees werer dynamic and smart; I learned a lot from all of them.
good,Management was professional. Fun job for the 5 years I worked there. Answered customer questions via the internet.  Low stress and little to no phone calls.
good,"I work for a Franchise of Marriott, therefore I feel that much of the Marriott culture and mission is lost.  I would love the opportunity to work for a Marriott Corporate property to truly understand, learn, and value the culture Marriott is trying to bring into the workplace and community."
good,goede werksfeer leuke collega's managers zijn ook gezellig
good,Most of the employees are students and the pay was low unless you were either a manager or working for tips.  Most managers only stay for 2-3 years before moving up in position at another location so things never really stabilize.
good,"The Company on a whole is a fun, exciting, and family oriented work place. Opportunities to grow and  improve a career. Working for the biggest Hotel chain was a challenge that i accepted on a daily basis."
good,"working the early morning shift in a fast pace environment. everything is based on daily routine which consist of prep work and side duties. management is always willing to assist during busy time. the most difficult part of the job is time of delivery. and therefore, time management, prioritize and organize is key to successful deleivery."
good,"I enjoyed working with a lot of people at the Marriott, definitely one of the better things at the hotel. "
good,Great place to work if you enjoy working with guests !!! Every day was different which made it fun. Employees could use better pay because they work so hard. They need a real cafeteria too.
good,"Marriott Culture is very employee friendly "
good,fast turnover in this environment being at the front desk you get the constant complaints. when I left Marriott there was no desk workers there from when I started.
good,"option for fast pace growth"
good,"Management was a little disorganized, but that can be attributed to the size of the property. Regular staffing complained about not feeling like all their needs to work most efficiently and to be in the most comfortable working environment were met, or their needs were brushed off. Otherwise, pay was pretty well compensated and on time. Overall, everyone was very nice and had a good family culture."
good,I start work also as I come in the door. It is very fast paced work to do if you are by yourself but the pay is great. I guest and the worker are very nice and care for your needs
good,If you are looking for a fun loving caring employer working for this company is the best place to be It’s all about teamwork management make sure that you are taking care of all time they have an open door policy
good,Marriott has wonderful managers and supervisors tat are wiling to help when you don't know Ann answer to a question that the customer has. Also has many benefits that most people are looking for.
good,I enjoy working for Marriott they put employees first I've been working for them for what 28 years I worked at the New York Marriott Marquis for 9 years and I've been employed at the Westin for 18 years Marriott a great company
good,"If you are in hospitality industry Marriott is one of the best places to work, they give to you confidence and security to do perfect your job! Good rates and benefits."
good,"I would recommend Marriott International, Inc to someone looking for a new job. Working at the front desk made it difficult to find life-work balance, but the pay is fair and competitive and there are great benefits that come with the job."
good,"Pay rate is good but hotel is getting slow so u might not get 40 hours even sometimes only get 10 hours."
good,Good pay for the few hours I work I would definitely recommend getting a second job if you work part time. Managers are nice and the company has its perks
good,I was hard making a pay check being part time. Manager started cutting more hours when I was already part time. The manager was not being fare. And it was to much favoritism at the work place
good,I have been there for 3 years+. It is definitely a revolving door. Management is great. I would recommend as a temporary job or a permanent career. One perk is discounts on Hotels under Starwood and Marriott brand.
good,Marriott is very guest focused and is known for creating loyal guests that return time and time again. They believe in growth within the company and development of their associates.
good,It's a good company with benefits that help you sleep a bit easier. You meet people from all over the globe and that only benefits you as a person. They give free life insurance also.
good,"I was in house keeping and felt over work and it would be a stressful job for anyone, it's less pay for a huge amount of work, housekeepers are under paid. It causes back issue later in life."
good,"I love working in hotels, so I may have some bias. I really enjoyed the grounds because they were maintained so well. The you edule and staff, as well as HR were dependable, however it was pretty much an unwritten law that you had to work overtime every week, and it was slightly understaffed. I understand that it's hard to fill a seasonal position with workers because of the extreme range of business, but there was a lot of work placed on the backs of the pool servers. When season slowed down, they weren't quick to let people go home, and it was hard to keep busy when you only had 3 guests in your area for the entire day."
good,"You will work long hard hours, but that is to be expected with almost anywhere in the hospitality industry and they do their best to keep you out of overtime"
good,"Marriott International es una buena corporación, pero hay muy mal manejo local del Sheraton de Lima"
good,Marriott is still a great place tgere is a marriott where ever you go now a days great staff depending where you go awesome food very accommodating and clean.
good,"A typical day at Sheraton is being at work at 5 am working at a Club Lounge. Setting up a continental breakfast for the SPG members and business people. Many of the business people who attend the lounge work for the airport. Monday through Friday is the same routine, some days are busy some days are not. Communication skills are what I have learned the most. Different cultures, environment everyday, and attitudes. I have to say that I do like my job, why? Because we have the same business people weekly they all treat me like family and they bring their families to stay at the hotel. I have to say what i do like about my job its an early shift and i get to go home at noon. Some times there is lack of management especially when we need equipment especially uniforms"
good,Overall Marriott is a great company to work for. They provide good benefits and do care for their employees well being. Work/Life balance can be difficult depending on the department you are in. Alot of holiday and weekend work makes it tough sometimes.
good,"Tout simplement une très belle entreprise, un cadre agréable pour travailler, le salaire est très correct, et il y a un bon management dans cette société."
good,"Management was hired by the franchise that ran the hotel. He is horrible which is why I left after employment of 10 years! The most enjoyable part of the job was all the repore I had with the guests. The hardest part of the job was conflicting with management- I learned I do not have to subjected to harassment, name calling, and being threatened as an employee if management did not like you or your looks you would be terminated."
good,It was a great honor and opportunity working for this high end world famous luxury hotel. Just the interview process alone would make you shiver as it is intense but all for the purpose of weeding out the bad and hiring the best. The customer service and people skills that I learned truly refined me in addressing any customer opportunities and bringing an excellent resolution. I was able to meet important and successful people from all over the wold. I feel that I truly have bragging rights from working in such an environment where everyone is top notch at what they do. I left because I wanted to relocate to another state and pursue other ventures.
good,Like i said its a great place to work but some of the lower management positions need new training. Howevet debroah is a great gm to work for. Head housekeeping gossips a lot about workers which is poor work ethic.
good,"I enjoyed working with Marriott, during my earlier years with the company.  We had good benefits and were treated as part of the family.  Marriott bought Sodexho and things changed, since Sodexho managed all other divisions except for the hotels.  Most of the benefits were taken away and it seemed that THE GOOD OLD BOYS were the ones getting promotions. "
good,Great supervisor with nice benefits. I never worked in maintenance before I started at the hotel. I was trained by some great co-workers. I enjoy my travel discount
good,Great benefits. Having the right management will allow work / life balance. Have to be able to work a fast pace and multi task. Have to be able to handle stressful environment.
good,"Salary for this country is not enough. outing for staff will be help. "
good,"Good place to work, employees are great and friendly, everything is provided for you to get your job done. Hardest part is the hustle of cleaning rooms,and making sure that everything is done correctly and efficiently."
good,It was a great experience working with Sheraton Kuwait. I have started my Sheraton life in 2012 as a reservation agent and in 4 years I have become a shift leader and a supervisor in anothe one year.
good,"a typical day at work consists of answering phone calls and emails about possible bookings. These include; lunch, dinner, gin tastings, afternoon teas and large parties."
good,I worked at Tan-Tar-A out of college. The pay was not great but the working environment was great. I was treated to many free meals and banquets. The pay was not enough for family of three. I progessed to higher paying jobs.
good,"Our office was fun and challenging, so I have no complaints. But I had an advanced college degree and years of experience and made $15 an hour. Not great, certainly not respectful of my abilities. Nice people, but ironically for a business school they had no idea how to pay fair wages."
good,"Fast tempo, requires a lot of the individual, each each is something new. Over all good place to work be readying to work hard. The management was fair, push you to do better and ask a lot of the worker"
good,"Definitely a place you can learn so much, from banquets to room service and the restaurant, since it is a fairly small hotel you will most likely be asked to cover different areas which leads to more knowledge and better opportunities of career advancement"
good,"A day would start with a round of checking the building equipment and doing the pool tests. Twice a week of setting the building fan schedules. The remainder of the day would be working on PMs. or filling in on room calls for unfilled positions."
good,"Over all it has been great, good staff, good management as well,I started as a banquet server, they have an internal program which is call working as lateral services, which consists of giving the employees the opportunity to work in different hotel departments within the same property, allowing them to acquire different working experiences to learn and grow within the company."
good,Working in the hospitality industry is great.  Lots of perks.  Offices were located in a high end shopping center.  I learned about how and how not to manage people.  I think the best part of the job was the perks.  Being able to get discounted hotel rooms around the world is amazing.
good,these places are the best and a interesting environment because of the different features that nationalities have. able to pickup new languages and it is equal to the hospitality of a hospital people get's better in places like this.
good,Everyone who works at my property is a happy go lucky person. Everyone picks each other up. Of coarse there are a few bad apples. But they usually don't stay long
good,Starwood is now owned by Marriott so it might not still be named that but this is a fun work environment with a lot of leeway to how you handle your customers. They reward diligence and hard work.
good,"The housekeeping department is and can be a demanding busy to be in, however the team at Marriott make the pace fun and exciting, lots of fun competition games though the week."
good,The position I had was fun and the guests were great to work with.  I feel the ending of several positions in my department affected my ability to do my job well.  The company itself offers great benefits for associates and I would recommend Marriott to others.  I was working evenings until 2-4 am and would love to work a 9-5 with weekend off for a change.
good,"stable employment, good people"
good,Trabajar en Marriott este año ha Sido muy interesante .he aprendido muchas cosas de este país y ellos me han tratado muy bien.
good,"I did not mind working at the Marriott, housekeeping you where by yourself 90% of the time so it was easy to work faster. Management was decent,  puke have been better. I would recommend friends and family to apply there."
good,"Always learning and growing.  Day to day can be challenging, but pay and potential for advancement are worth it.  If learned a lot while working here."
good,Fortunate to have various opportunities but there always seemed to be restructure and reorg which made it difficult to advance and/or feel secure in the role. Your success depends on your department and your relationship development.
good,"the work enviorment was friendly and very helpful."
good,Some updates needed. management is by the books and expect their employees the same but have no problem training to achieve the goal. Customers are nice.
good,"team work makes the dream work in this collabartively-oriented environment... dealing with guests, guest needs, bookkeeping, and everything else that goes on a hotel requires you to work well with others"
good,I enjoyed interacting with the customers. I would have liked to have gone further but I would have had to take a pay cut to go to another position to get to where I wanted to go. I couldn't afford that.
good,"a very productive and driven daily operation. good co-workers, and the management team was easy to talk with. positive feedback was always given and the necessary one-on-one."
good,"There is always something to do, and as long as you are focused and willing to work there will be no issues.  A lot of the work is a bit repetitive but that means that the focus is perfection and replication."
good,Marriott is a good company with lots of long-term employees who care about the brand and delivering good service to guests of the hotel. The hotel was recently sold to a franchisee and the transition was poorly handled.
good,"Working as a lounge server was interesting because some nights you would be very busy but other days it may be slow. If you got there first, if it was slow, you could leave first. But if the first person did not want to leave, because there wasn't enough business at the beginning, the manager would choose who to cut and basically cut their pay that day. Seems unfair in the end."
good,"A wonderful place to work but the business was not consistent in my outlet.  I had numerous repeat guests, which always made my day.  My coworkers were amazing, as we were a pooled outlet so therefore the strength of the team was always strong.  The most difficult part of the job was not having the correct and necessary tools to work with."
good,"Very fast paced, lots of hands on experience. The employees are great and very fun to work with, management could be a lot better. Excellent benefits, but holidays and the busy season make it hard to have a life outside of work."
good,"It was a typical hotel resort atmosphere. Constant changes & goals to exceed guests' expectations. During my last few months, management was poor however in the past, I had wonderful experiences with previous leaders."
good,"I like working at Marriott, I just haven't had any career advancement in 15 years. I have worked the same position without much variation for too long."
good,"-its good to work with a challenge from there becuase its my first time abroad before."
good,They have nice people working there. I learned new things there. Met a lot of great people and friends there. Learned how to host. Liked working as a team.
good,"The managers are great, I love everyone I work with, they're always someone you can ask if you have questions or concerns, overall it's a great environment."
good,"They trusted their managers.  It was a goo working environment where you did you job and achieved your goals you were rewarded."
good,"Good group to work for, but the hotel management could to a better job in recruiting people with more experience and give staff a chance to move within the hotel."
good,"it is a good place to start your career in the industry and i am enjoying to work there. the management is very professional and friendly , the environment is quiet and provide a good work production"
good,"A typical work day is following a specific check list assigned to each person. In the Engineering department. The manager rotates job duties between 6 people, by doing so it allowed me to learn in different areas of the department"
good,This position allowed me gain administrative skills and also how to work in a fast paste environment. this position will also teach you how to multi task and learn how to manage reports and phone call siwtchboards. This position requires one with a lot of hotel knowledge and also how to work with its own programs. You will definitely need to have assertiveness when dealing with demanding guests. you will also need to use your patience and exceptional customer service skils.
good,Typical day prepare food for banquets and plated events. I learned to be a better cook. Management was very good and helpful. Culture was a soothing place to work for stress relief. Hardest part was preparing for multiple events. The most enjoyable was learning new ways to cook
good,"It was a good way to get my foot in the door with Front Desk of a hotel, summer was crazy busy, winters were dead. Overall, I enjoyed working there, with the co workers I had."
good,"Starwood is a high paced high production job, you have to be aware of sales goals, talk time on the phone, guest relations, as well as your time off the phone, definitely a plusm that you can work from home"
good,"Awesome place to work, specially when you see the place to grow from ground up. Great team and people. Becomes a bit tricky when it comes to Work/ life balance."
good,It is not healthy environment to work in. The management doesn't care about employees. The job involves dealing with a lot of people including guests and employees from different departments.
good,"Great work environment, fast paced and challenging. Worked mornings, arrived before 5am. Constant exposure to public gave me the chance to exercise my PR skills."
good,"Had fun working for the company. Its busy place and great company to work for, i made friends there. The only thing i left was family emgency, and took so long  to goback and they replace me."
good,The day used to be good at work. I learned how to work as good associate and learned all the method of cleaning. management of hotel was good and supportive to associate.
good,Nice work environment. Willing to work around your schedule. Good discounts but getting up early in the morning can be a bear.  Few opportunities for advancement.
good,"Lots of adhoc excel model and presentation making. The issue at the time was they were going through transition of being acquired.  I dont think that my review of the company is representative of operations under ""normal"" circumstances."
good,"I like working in this company.Great company to work for. Responsible for assigning sales leads to the sales Managers. "
good,"A typical day started with a meeting at 8am and we had another meeting at 4pm daily. Overkill on the meetings when we should have been selling. I learned that it is great to be part of a team and I miss it.  Management style could have been less overbearing. Expectations where high and really pushed.  High pressure. Hardest part was making sure you made your numbers and had your reports in daily, weekly, monthly. Best part of my job was the friends I made."
good,"In Westin Hotel was the first part time job in hotel industry, I was in restaurant industry as a waitress, the most hardest part was that there were many repeat guest, as a need server, I need to remember guest's preferences, what they like and dislike, also being a host to welcome the register the guest."
good,"Set Ups the table and same decoration, Dinner serve with different Styles , buffer or passing food ,serve the pake of the food, in the Calgary Marriott hotel restaurant event ,meeting ,wedding ,electron,bar,and more..."
good,"husband and wife should not work in the same building, too many favors, jealousy. made it discriminating."
good,"What I learned working at Lexington Gift Corporation is to always please the customer. Whether it is the pricing of products or retrieving a product out of stock for the customer, the customer deserves full attention and must be pleased in order for the company and business to succeed. The hardest part of my job would probably be a dissatisfied customer since it may get difficult most times with impatient or not understanding individuals."
good,"good benefits good salary. But if you don't like the hotels for place to work, this place isn't the place for you.  You have to work under a lot of stress"
good,"Good place for starting ur career in UAE, when ever you have your experience you will point to bad cobdition of accomodation, unpaid extra hours what could go over 12-13 hour per day, etc. "
good,It is a fast paced environment with many chances to continue learning. The job was very close to where I live and the people I worked with were very welcoming.
good,"The Westin Hotel was, overall, a pretty great company to work for. Just needs improvement on getting some solid management, and preferably, permanent management."
good,"I truly enjoyed my time here, however it was a job I kept while going to school full time. I am not sure if I would recommend this location/property as a full time position until after all the building in the area has been completed. There is too much affecting business at the moment for it to be worth your while yet! However, it really was a fun place to work."
good,"Company gives significant freedom to consultants/engineers to learn and grow their careers.  But, it is challenging to balance personal life with this company culture."
good,It was very nice to work with people that wanted to be happy. The product is great. Loved to stay at the resorts and hotels. The discounts were great.
good,Buen trabajo pero muy complicado conciliar con vida familiar
good,"Gaylord is a great place to work. My work day, has me always running around the gather items that we need for service. The Gaylord/ Marriott company is great hotel (s) to work for."
good,Great place to work just a far distance to drive for the pay.Wasnt there long enough to relocate within the company.Meet tons of new people from all over.Stay in some of the best hotels for a small fee.
good,15 Rooms to clean per shift learned how to properly flood towles and tissue management was ok just strict workplace culture was manily burned out older women or young ignorant women
good,"Fun to work .But less salary hikes.There is not good hieracy in engineering department, because of that employees get promotion inly after long time.."
good,The company is very dedicated of well-being of their employees. The job can get very stressful when there is events going on everywhere but there also can be a significant down time when there are no functions at all.
good,"Il y a une très bonne ambiance entre les différents services, les responsables étaient à l'écoute, disponible."
good,"To start the day we need to collect our Cash fund at the cashier, then morning/mid/night shift briefing. We are busy usually in the morning and in the afternoon because of the c/n and c/out of the guest. It was hard if you do not have any experience in the hotel but day by day  you learned from it. I was so blessed because a lot of Filipino working in that hotel it was easy for me to adjust. Other than a lot of Filipino working there we have also discounted rate if we want to check in in other sister company of the hotel.  About the management, they send us in trainings which is good, we really need that."
good,"great staff with good management. it's a fast pace hotel. as I worked there, I get to build my network with staff from different departments. it's a wonderful hotel to work for"
good,I was phased out of the department that I worked in due to a lack of education. The job requirements changed and management decided that I lacked the qualifications to continue.
good,Marriott is a good company that gives several options for advancement. The starting pay is low but the benefits are good. Work life balance can be hard depending on the department you work in and the position.
good,"A typical day at work as a Housemen consist of stripping rooms, answering radio calls from the base, delivering the request the guest have to their rooms, taking out the trash, sorting laundry, and vacuuming."
good,"As a server in the hotel restaurant I waited on guests in the restaurant, bar area and private parties. Occasionally when needed I would also run room service orders."
good,"Was a Front Office Associate, responsibilities was high because i solely handled the desk and operations Sometimes. Good platform to learn the basics and Starwood Benefits."
good,"Hotel is great and wonderful, work environment is tough, people are not to friendly in all areas, and company management is looking at every detail everyone does,  to see if they are good on performance, that makes people scared of working on their own, and thinking they might fired."
good,"I had to wear every hat in the hotel as I was the only one there, from the front desk to the concerierge to the laundry to the maintenance. But I was given opportunities to advance and I did; I became a supervisor. I enjoyed my work there"
good,overall great place to have worked only draw back new management did not know how to treat employees. Each area of hotel worked together well. Staff great to work with enjoyed meeting new people  daily and see the excitement on special events
good,"i enjoy the culture here and my Rewards family. I love my managers and everyone is inclusive. "
good,Not the perfect job but I enjoy those that I work with. My managers are nice and the environment is nice.  Not too shabby but I want something better for my life.
good,My typical day consists of assisting 4 managers in different selling markets; I train all new Admins; I enjoy the discounts we receive for at least 500 hotels.
good,"Proactive and reactive sales.  Contracting events and processing business event orders for all departments,  appointmennts with clients. Telephone enquiries and booking bedrooms. Ownership of events"
good,Over all good place to work. Management needs some work. Compensation is not where it needs to be. But they do provide great benefits and employee incentives.
good,Very deadline oriented with a focus on performing a day audit and reporting revenue to the GM and AGM every morning before 10 AM.  I was also the General Cashier with a Cash bank of $75000.
good,"Starwood was a great place to work for several years. However, like many larger corporations it was susceptible to politics. People were kept in roles for too long, or given the wrong roles because of who they were which was only a detriment to Starwood's potential. Compensation packages were not very competitive and yearly increases were laughable. All that aside it was for the most part a fun and creative environment, but sadly came to an end with the merger with Marriott."
good,"The working day starts at 7 am.First of all,our task is to organizaand deliver desserts to the function rooms,coffee breaks,lunches.then start work on harvesting the next day.Sometimes it seizes several jobs simultaneously.I even got used to such a volume of work that sometimes i can not just sit.A lot of work."

good,"I worked at the Westin Huntsville for almost three years and i enjoyed coming to work everyday. I worked in the kitchen, but also did front of house training and it was difficult working in that department due to lack of good management during the day time hours. But overall it is a pleasant place to work."
good,"Great place that emphasizes close talent connections.  Great collaboration between different departments with strong leadership at the helm."
good,"My typical day of work would consist of helping my colleagues to mitigate customer check-ins to hotel property and also to mitigate potential disputes. Paying attention to detail and ensuring quality customer service as well as personal characteristics as patience, comprehensive listening skills, and open communication were key components to being successful on the job. I enjoyed my daily interactions with our over 1,000 guest daily. I learned the value of teamwork, the ability to empathize with customer needs, and to be better organized."
good,"The hotel creates a one big happy family environmental, very welcoming and work with pride great benefits for rooms for yourself, family and friends. However a big lack of competitive wages and advancement."
good,Enjoyed working at the westin and until union rules allowed other people to take my shifts due to seniority I had no plan's of leaving. Management allowed some employees to get by with much lower standards than should be expected at a high end hotel
good,Good place to intern at. I was able to bounce around n multiple departments and learn the inner workings of the place. A fairly large hotel with lots of friendly workers.
good,It was very nice the staff is kind and friendly nice big rooms nice viewings it's very spacious the beds are nice and big the hotel is very clean and comfortable
good,"Be prepared to work any shift possible, and not garner a lot of praise for the small steps taken to please guests. When the day is slow the work is easy but when there is a lot of work you will be constantly busy. Also, you may be harasses, yelled at, cursed at, or unknown customers wanting five star treatment, and even want you to bend the rules when you cannot deviate from them. I did love the people I worked with and the regular customers that came into the hotel as they were always nice and sweet."
good,"If you want to be in the hospitality industry, The Westin Denver Downtown is a great place to start your career.  There is advancement and great opportunity to learn different aspects of the hotel business."

good,Marriott is a great company to work for. It is no suprise that they are the #1 hotel company in the world. I ook forward to staying at Marriotts and possibly working for them again.
good,"o	Welcome guests as they check in and out and perform necessary services."

good,Marriott ist ein sehr gutes Hotel aber weit vom marriott standarts entfernt aber die Arbeit passt dort
good,Being a Loss Prevention Officer was interesting. You got a chance to interact with guest and other employees. You also got a chance to see how the hotel business works behind the scenes. Only a couple of misunderstandings with fellow officers about my training and work schedule
good,"As I only worked here for a week, my judgement on the everyday life of working here would not be very accurate, however I enjoyed the aspect of working outdoors. I learned how to pull a proper pint of beer as well as how to clear down tables. Many of the customers spoke very little English which was slightly difficult for me since my german was quite limited at the time."
good,"everyday doing the same job. make platter, salad, tapas, cut fruits and sandwich for function or coffee break. i'm learned how to cut food at same size, give the beautiful garnishing. the management is okay. co workers okay but still not all give good teamwork. the hardest part of the job when it time to deco the food because i dont like it. the most enjoyable when food is ready to served and guest give a good feedback about the food"
good,"Hospitality is a great place to work in."

good,"I enjoyed working with my co workers on a daily basis, interacting with guests. Also making sure my job duty was completed on time and to guests standards."

good,"More special training for the employees to make then more multlyfuntional."
good,"As a Banquet Manager, My days differ but the basics remain the same.    one thing that never changes are the long hours.   If you work less than 11 hours it's  short day.  But the Westin is a great place to work. solid foundation, great product, great people."
good,overall its a pretty good job but like any other place of employment it could stand some changes especially in management.
good,"Great place to start in customer service if you love working with people! Great culture, not too many  growth opportunities within certain management companies."
good,"Daily opportunities for growth in the hospitality industry, strong management leaders, worked well with co-workers because of high employee morale, hardest part of the position was the jobs events & activities with guests, the most enjoyable part of the position was satisfied guests & great reviews at the end of their stay"
good,"Excellent hotel itself, great co-workers and team players.  Shift is from 7am-3pm, bustling hotel with ongoing activity throughout the day.  Always on your feet, always active, moving and doing something.  Consistently tracking, updating and gathering information regarding customers stays.  The hardest part is keeping up with everything and managing your organizational skills. Great multitasker is a must in this industry.  The computer system FOSSE is a little difficult to learn at first and takes about 2 weeks to really understand everything!!  The most enjoyable part is dealing with people directly and being engaged.  The only con about this job is the pay. I wish they payed more decent for the amount of work you do."
good,"Not great comp, but awesome group. Awesome had a fun time and great work-life balance. My manager was a bit harsh and sometimes made it difficult to focus."
good,Marriott is a great company to work for in general. They provide great benefits and pretty good pay. The management at my property could use serious improvement though.
good,the co-workers are nice. The salary is good and as worker you have some benefits from Marriott Inc. It is a good place to work.
good,Enjoyed working here until we had a management over haul.  The place was built in prime location and was the staple for growth in the area.

good,"Marriott, Residence Inn is a great place to work for! There is a lot of room for growth. The culture and management is great! Some days I forgot I was on the clock. I really enjoyed meeting new people"
good,"On a daily basis deal with external and internal customers. Assist and provide professional customer service to external customers (owners, title companies, etc) via emails, faxes and phone queue.  Specific department is a call center with high volume of incoming calls from customers in USA and different countries.  Company provides around the year training for team building and new programs.  Work environment is a multi cultural and friendly place."
good,"You have to be crazy to work in the hospitality field but if you do, Marriott is a great company to work for.  It ia an international company with a great reputation."
good,"Some people have been there so long that they feel their job security is so strong, that they don't need to do anything anymore.  They are just taking up a job/paycheck that someone else would work harder to have."
good,"Great place to work, especially if you like working in a busy work environment. Everyone is super friendly and welcoming to new employees. It's fun, and if you are in a position that is allowed to take tips, they are great.  Main cons:: The schedule comes out on a week to week basis so it makes it very hard to plan anything in the future in the span of one week.... Management is cool, but they don't know how to lead and encourage a team (nor schedule). They also lack experience within the hotel industry, and it shows in their management. Management also lacks acknowledgement for other departments beside the front desk. The company drills people to learn the 15/5 rule."
good,"receiving phone calls, updating booking system, handling minor complains, making a daily roster for my co guest relations. its a fun workplace fun people to be with and best thing is making them motivated."
good,"I parked the residents at the Marriott ""Grand Chateau"" as they came and left the Hotel. Customer Service Skills is a must. I loved working there. I love dealing and interacting with people."
good,"The climate and culture are decent.  A Typical day is getting briefed from previous shift, receiving post assignment for the day.  Posts in the lobby at base or floor patrols are standard.  Interaction with employees and guests are frequent.  All and all, it's a good place to start a career."
good,"At the time they were very understaffed but everyone made the best of it. It was a very positive work environment, but it just wasn't for me. You are allowed to keep the tips you find. You receive a break every two hours. Everyone was friendly with each other and plenty of communication."
good,"I enjoyed working at this location until its closure. A typical day required DSR, Bank deposits,mailing etc. I learned a lot from my manager and enjoyed the atmosphere at this store."
good,"Good company, management, They only moved on my recommendations after I left. Would have stayed otherwise. Past due for renovations, but now in process."
good,Great environment to work in.  Lots of movement.    Exposure to regional and corporate leadership.  Highly motivate team and driven staff.
good,"The company itself is a great company, one that I'd recommend to just about anyone. But the specific location I work in is a call center, and as such has the usual call center issues."
good,"Work was exciting to come into each and every day! The service culture provided by not only management staff levels but the front line was exceptional! "
good,"each day is have to learn something new.learn a lot of thing about our operation to how to get smooth operation. management is giving right way to work there,co workers helping each others. there is no have to get hardest.with clickes and guest,"
good,"Handled any and everything that involves a rewards department.  In this case, documenting hotel stays, awarding reward points even if unearned.  Travel planning and reservations.  Having to keep up with stats was probably the hardest part of the job as it is difficult to give superb customer service on a time limit."
good,"Positive:"
good,"I enjoy the job and the guest and employees. My only issue is the pay and not 40 full time hours, their full time is 32 hours."
good,"As a Supervisor my ultimate objective is to manage, motivate, and mentor agent development with organization, dedication, and integrity. I am expected to work independently with minimal supervision, yet drive associate performance levels that demonstrate a pattern of replicated success on a monthly continuum. As a Platinum Concierge specialist, I was responsible for administering strong salesmanship qualities and a keen ability to problem solve. I was required to assist the elite personnel by being a persuasive communicator that initiated a positive impacting experience for consumers, utilizing first class sales solutions to overcome objections, while cultivating profitable rapport with company clientele."
good,The Sheraton is a wonderful a place to be employed. The work culture is top notch and it's strive for excellence is unwavering. The Sheraton is a busy place as many large conversion hotels are and you tend to send a lot of time at the office. I have learned an enormous amount at the Sheraton that will assist me in what ever new opportunities I will have in the future.
good,"I love this hotel but in my opinion they need to become more organized and have better communication. they had the wrong liene a lot of the time which slowed us down a lot due to having to find more, the linen closet was not stocked like it should have been."
good,"Recently changed management, for the most part a good hotel. Newly updated, Clean and enjoyable to stay in."
good,Marriott is a very good company to work for but it's not a career for me. It's very good for people to get into if they'd like to get into hospiality as it can be for anyone from all different cultures.
good,"the job was very easy, I loved it the job was very nice and the people was well rounded that was a great good. I had to greet and set the customers and take orders and assist the customers with their food."

good,I enjoy my co-workers and the new management they put into place is very fair and understanding.  They are trying to turn it into more of a family culture but they need to find more ways and options for advancement in the company
good,"Marriott is a fast growing company with an amazing culture! Iv'e learned a great about cooking, like honing knife skills, faster hands while cooking, faster multitasking, and overall knowledge of the hospitality occupation."
good,"Fun work place and great learning opportunities. Not east to balance work and personal life."
good,"I love the environment, the people, the fast pace environment, I didn't like how I wasn't able to move forward. I know some people do, however I had a lot of difficulty. Management is okay, I honestly have the best manager possible right now and I don't want to leave because of her, however I do need to better myself and keep moving forward in life."
good,"Bom esse trabalho me rendeu muita experiência pois além de conhecer muitas pessoas tive o prazer de aprender a fazer decorações em bolos , e descobri q tenho uma facilidade enorme em atendimento pois fazia com amor ,e trabalho feito com amor é muito bem feito e o resultado aparece"

good,"Daily operation start with Animation meeting. Meeting with team and explaining to all team members their duties and informing them regarding Guest INHouse, VIP guest, Repeater guest and etc . Following kids club activities with kids club supervisor and ensure guest satisfaction."
good,"learned a lot, and met some very good people along the way. it offers pay and benefits that are competitive. Management wasn't at its best in my opinion."
good,Great place to work. Compensation could have been better. Typical work day was fast and continually busy. If you work for a Marriott property make sure u work for a corporate property instead of a franchise.
good,I like working here since it's a job where you can learn a lot of cleaning skills. (If you like to clean). It is also a full time job but it's also a minimum wage pay so the paychecks are just enough to help pay the bills. Everyone's friendly but it is a very fast-paced environment.
good,"Great place to work, especially due to the colleagues that work there."
good,Ottimi rapporti con i colleghi tuttavia sono poche le possibilità di carriera verticale e l'azienda opta per il precariato
good,"I went in for an interview and was hired within three days.  The management, all the way up to the GM, were kind, caring, helpful people and I felt that everyone there genuinely cared about my success in the company!  Day to day, the responsibilities were demanding but manageable.  However, the scheduling was very inconsistent.  There were weeks when I was scheduled for a double shift or only had a few hours between shifts, and I was switched a lot between overnight and morning."
good,i like working for this company just wish they were more organized. i would stay at this company if the pay was more but i cant take 7.50 for cleaning rooms
good,"I honestly love my job! My job is one of the easiest jobs I have ever had but unfortunately made difficult if management becomes involved. The workplace actually runs more efficiently without the involvement of management! When associates attempt to involve management, management sometimes cause a further liability. My co-workers are amazing and I feel as though I can honestly say I speak for myself and my fellow coworkers."
good,"The hourly people are fun to work with and usually have a positive attitude.  When the hotel is sold out, day to day operations are very fast paced."
good,"Management isn't too great, but if it wasn't for the Marriott team members and Human Resources, The Marriott would be ranked at the bottom of the totem pole for a good Management staff, especially in Shulas 347"
good,"staff cafeteria food is not good."
good,"washing dishes after banquets functions, as well as setting up for banquets function, getting food at function on time"
good,Check guests in and out of the hotel. Balance bills and assist with all guest request. Accommodate with amenity requests.
good,Very busy place to work and easy to do.  I learned to make sure the rooms are perfect and spotless. The manager was nice. The co-workers are great teams. The hardest part of the job was doing too many rooms. The most enjoyable was working and helping out with co workers.
good,"My typical work day would technically be a work night. In at 11pm recap with the departing manager about any issues or things to know or follow up on. If I have support for the night a game plan if any regarding any pass on from the departing manager. Making sure my support isn't taken by surprise in any way."
good,Enjoyed working for the Marriott!  The Management were very informative of all of my job duties and were always willing to answer questions.  My co-workers were also great!  My job as a Front Desk Receptionist was fun and at was great meeting people from around the world.  Fun place to work!
good,"Working for the Suites has been quite an educational experience. It has had it's challenges, but I have always thought that if you want to prepare yourself to work anywhere else, this is the best place to make your bones. If you seek a management position, you must have serious delegation skills with an emphasis on how to explain specifically what you want from your associates. For kitchen management, there is not a great life work balance."
good,"I enjoy working for hotels. Keeps you on your feet and active. You meet new people all the time. there is room for growth if you strive towards it. "
good,"En un día típico en el trabajo, la atención y servicio hacia el cliente es algo fundamental. Ocurre en todo momento."
good,"I enjoyed working for the Courtyard by Marriott, it was a very professional and consistent work environment. I would recommend this location to anyone interested in the industry."
good,"A typical day at work is like taking care of one of your friends or family members. I have learned to be an active listener, understand behavior or habits, show sincerity in the job, and to make effective decisions. The hardest part of the job is knowing hospitality ins and outs because most of the time you are doing them all, from room service to sales. Because I get to interact with new and old faces of roaming visitors, and each associate I work with is personable and upbeat, I adore my job. As well, the management here strives to make guests and the staff happy and are always flexible to their needs while staying profitable."
good,Working in the heart of Happy Valley puts some people in your path whom you would never expect to meet...it was an amazing work experience & I loved every second of it.
good,Open Kitchen and Restaurant at 05:30. Check all production sheets for accuracy and meet with associates to discuss day. Check to make sure all product is ordered properly for next day deliveries. Ensure all associates are keeping productive and maintaining food quality.
good,I understand Marriott does a lot for the community but when it comes to employees we can't even get a free cup of coffee without getting stared or talked to manager... even though the coffee is going to waste. Mood swings were seen quite frequently. Really look into who is getting promotions and not go with who they get along with the best or who is kissing a**. This goes toward the property I worked for personally. I feel like Marriott in general needs to give a little more to employees other than just room discounts. More honest/truful reconization needs to be applied. Its the little things that makes us keep going.
good,"Professional group of management who cared for employees and client served equally. In the Hotel were two restaurant that in my unbiased opinion had the best service and food quality. Stepping back and putting myself in the customers shoes, I see why they are repeated comers and leave great reviews. High Velocity venue was at max capacity often and the staff work relentlessly in appeasing, catering , and meeting the optimum service mark across the board. "
good,"uma boa empresa onde visa muito em cuidar dos funcionários para que eles possam cuidar dos hospedes e lientes, e assim eles voltem e gere lucros para todos nós."
good,I would go in work on laundry between checking in on guest into the hotel. making sure the hotel lobby was kept clean and functional. Guest were able to come to me with any questions and or concerns. I enjoyed working with everyone and learning new ways to handle sticky situations.
good,"Here i learned all top skills & ethics under the very inspiring leadership of Mr Jaswinder Narang(general Manager),I had utmost security about my job & yet always having a tightrope walk while delivering the services,very very cooperative staffers."
good,"Help guest for work related"
good,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts is a great company to work for with great benefits. They admire the hard work and dedication the associates put forth and enjoy to promote from within. "
good,the benefits were great. the company offered great rates to employee s that wanted to stay at another hotel. It was easy on the pocket
good,Within Marriott the opportunities are available and the perks are phenomenal. In my time Ive learned a lot and enjoyed it as a hold.
good,I enjoyed working at this franchise property due to the ability of growth. I came into the business with no knowledge of the computer software. I now am able to train new hires and others. This job was simple.. Customer Service. Checking guest in and out.Handing payment types and issue that may have occurred.
good,"Great place to begin your hospitality and culinary career. In the heart of a fun city, Orlando, where there are so many activities available for the whole family, you can't go wrong with a job at one of the best hotels in the area. Near all the theme parks and the best weather all year round. Fiorella's restaurant at Westin Universal Boulevard where you can experience some of the best Italian cuisine and wines without leaving the states. Also great staff to work with."
good,I loved what I did but the only part I didn't like is working every single weekend. Time away from home can affect your relationship when you work in hospitality.
good,Learned to be organized and to work quickly in order to keep hours from running into overtime so as to stay within department budget.
good,The days went by quickly due to the fast pace. I liked that environment. I learned patience and sales strategies. Management was supportive. The hardest part of the job was not being able to assist a customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a customer happy and getting the sale.
good,"Being one of the best companies to work for in the world is great! I really enjoy meeting new people everyday from different cultures and backgrounds, it keeps the job ""fresh"". The coworkers are amazing, and the management will support you in everything you do. The hardest part of the job is that you're on call 24-7, and sometimes the job will interfere or impede upon your personal life. But if you love meeting new people and everyday of work being a new experience, I'd recommend the Marriott hotel business"
good,A very out going job in which had great reviews and specials treatment. Every day at work here was exciting and amusing. I learn a lot about management  and managing. I was able to direct  weeding plans and set ups according to design specialist.

good,"Very nice to work in a young environment, events for every kind of customers and many different locations, the restaurant El Cid very classy"

good,Each day is different. There is no typical day at the Courtyard. Being here I've learned how to be professional is a customer service world. The people that I work with are truly amazing! With all of us working there is never a boring day! Management on the other hand is difficult to work with. The GM is not to quick to give a compliment. Hardest part of the job is when you have an upset guest and nothing you do can make them happy. I've learned it's part of the job and you can't make everyone happy. The best part of this job is the people that you meet! They are all in the professional world and if you are going to school they support you 100%.
good,"An average day at work consists of answering phones, helping guests, creating reservations for future guests, doing laundry and cleaning around the hotel.  Ultimately providing excellent customer service and ensuring the guests have a wonderful and enjoyable stay.  The managers are very friendly and helpful and make the work atmosphere fun.  The hardest part of the job would probably be balancing time between doing the laundry and working the front desk.  During busy season it can sometimes get hectic, but once you settle into a groove, it's a breeze.  I love this job because it allows me to meet interesting new people and build relationships with guests who stay with us on a regular basis.  I love being able to help and assist people."

He was convinced and later on he thanked me."

I learned something new just about everyday, pertaining to the general maintenance industry. The co workers and management were great. Would definitely recommend this company."
good,It's been some years since I worked there but you had the usual smattering of people in their early 20s trying to calm down frequent flyer corporate types who were always upset that the hotel had Victorian sized rooms. I believe they have done construction since then but there was a lot of turnover in the time I was there due to the hours and the pay and the way the frontdesk was treated by the customers.
good,"Very good place to work, good management and coworkers, but not much opportunities for growing in my career."

good,"The staff is fun and the job does not require too much, however, the hours are long, and the pay is low for the work required. A lot of inconsistency with staffing, very high turnover rate. Would consider staying, if the pay was better and it didn't seem like we were constantly training new people"

good,the rooms controller who is my manager is hardly ever there when needed. schedules people not by their work quality but rather than their seniority.co- workers are enjoyable to be around and very friendly. the hardest part of the job is that you're not getting very many hours which makes it hard to make a guaranteed pay check to meet your needs. the most enjoyable part for me is that i like the environment its more on a professional setting.
good,"nothing special , you can find more things to learn"
good,Marriott hotels are a class act and are industry leaders in hospitality.

While the people and the company culture was great.  The job itself was VERY boring and slow.  I did like learning how the interworking’s of hotel planning behind the scenes comes together, it is really interesting.  If positioned in the right department, you could really learn a lot, grow and excel here."
good,The job was good but management wasnt the greatest. The union is very good if you like unions.
good,"I truly enjoyed my brief employment with this company.  Unfortunately the pay rate for their Supervisors was very low, which is the only reason I had to make a difficult decision to leave.

Very open and honest, but willing to listen and receptive to new ideas."

good,"This job was awesome for me during college. The hours were very flexible because the departments I dealt with were open late into the evening so I was able to work after class each night. However, when it came time to summer I really had no life as working in Myrtle Beach during the summer is basically the only time you can make any money or get any hours. I really loved this job and all the different people from all different cultures. I was in charge of numerous employees on a daily basis and made sure all guests were happy with their stay at the resort. The hardest part of the job was definitely working until 3 am one night and then having to be back a mere 4 hours later to open."

good,"Management and owners know how to treat employees.   Wonderful advancement opportunities.  Long hours, but I loved it."
good,"The best part of the job was that it wad always different. It was a Hotel, so the traffic would range from almost no one to a filled up and busy Hotel. It was very rewarding also meeting different people from around the world, as it was located about only two miles away from the Los Angeles Airport.

Was able to learn all area of the hotel by having a chance to work and learn each department.  The most difficult part of the job was not having management that followed through.  The best part of the job was customer service and guest interaction.

I deal with very lazy co-workers and also very hard working co-workers. We balance each other out.

Whenever there's an issue, Loss Prevention is the first department that is called and when i'm able to turn a bad situation into something wonderful for a guest. Its the best feeling ever."
good,"Working in hospitality has taught me many valuable lessons in life. At times you have to wear many different hats. The front desk is the powerhouse behind each hotel. Everything comes together as long as we do our jobs correctly. Multitasking is a must with this job. I can answer the phone, check people in, dispatch airport shuttles, and ring up a guest's food purchase all at the same time. This has made me a hard worker and I believe I would make a great asset to any company."

good,"I enjoyed working here, although it is a high pressure job. Great if you are strong in sales. Not great if you want a flexible schedule."
good,You have to be able to keep up with the fast pace hotel business and be able to remain very flexible with your schedule (aka. this is not a 9 to 5 job with weekends and holidays off). Marriott is a great company to work for and can take you were ever you want to go around the world and in your career path. This hotel although it is an airport property that your average guest stay is only one night this hotel remains at the top 10% of the company in guest satisfaction.

I would go through an annual Audit performed by the management co, Sage Hospitality... Year after year there was an improvement in the score I achieved."
good,"It's a great place to work..but i wouldn't see myself working there in the near future. Mangament and orginazation skills are very up to par. There all about satisfying the guest, and employees there priority."

Management is good, they are very helpful for me when I most need it. I have to work graveyard, and if I am unsure about something, when I call on mgmt they are always there for support. My co-workers ALL are awsome, I love working with them. I really don't have a hard part of the night audit job. The most enjoyable part about my job is that I get to meet a vast amount of different people from all walks of life."
good,"Working for Marriott is ideal for someone looking to advance, great retirement benefits, and major discounts for employees. Not ideal for someone who can not work weekends."
good,"I worked as a guest services rep. This was a great oppurtunity for me to sharpen my customer service experience, something that has brought great value to my life."
good,"The company was good for the most part. When I tried to advance, I was always halted. Didn't find that to be very fair."
good,"Fun place to work, opening the bar at 1pm. make sure bar is set up correctly,clean bar, have your bank, fruit andjuices are fresh, happy hour drink tents are on bar and tables. Have stocked bar with enough beer, wine and spirits for h.h. and rest of evening.Have learned to coordinate and host events in the bar especially during sports or games that are televised in the bar. Management cks from time to timeto offer help if needed or extra staffing if need."
good,"Atmosphere was pleasant to work in. Guests were patient. Co-workers were a joy to work with, quick paced environment, everyday brought something new."
good,"Daily opening and closing, Team leadership, Maintaining a Four Diamond Level of service"
good,I really enjoyed working here. They give all employees the perfect opportunity to advance in the company. They offer full benefits and over time. In addition to this it is very structured and the supervisors make sure that they take time to coach you so that your performance improves and you are able to service your callers efficiently.
good,A typical day at work would be managing event operation that would consist of the timely execution of food functions and meeting space function as well as managing staff. I learned that the hospitality environment is a diverse and challenging but rewarding environment in work in. There was quite a bit of turnover in my department as it results to keeping a knowledgeably manager who could deal with the intense banquet operations. My co-workers consist of a very diverse group of individuals from many different socioeconomic backgrounds. The hardest part of the job was managing and deligation of large food functions as this requires you to think on your feet while managing high volume of staff and effectively communicating with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people from all over the world and creating new professional relationships
good,"My job was great, management knew their business.as far as co-workers ,working with all women can be messy,the hardest part of my job was: It wasn`t hard,and what i enjojed most about the job is the moment i got a chance to go home for the day"
good,I am in training right now for the eCommunications department and I am already looking for another position. This company is very large and it is so large that they no longer care about work/life balance. I think that the company is over-servicing customers and under servicing their employees.
good,"work for this company was hard at the beginner, a hard part with the"
good,"I work in a highly fast paced environment. The Starwood Irish office comprises of 300 employees. The team I manage directly is made up of 20 members. I work closely with them. I am their main point of contact: I review their performance and provide them with the necessary tools to develop and advance. I also assist my team in the day-to-day management of their work whereby they need guidance in resolving customers' issues they have challenges with. I have learnt that all employees wish to feel special and need to be treated as such. In view of this, i have learnt that while company's goals ought to be achieved, the path to undertake in order to accomplish these has to be varied. Flexibility is key to me when managing people's performance and development. The Leadership team I am part of is made up of 10 members. I look after my peers' teams from time to time and am always keen to assist the whole floor (200 associates) as well as my colleagues in different departments in whatever capacity they need me to work in (scheduling, forecasting, training, helpdesk, etc). The hardest part of my job consists in the challenges that the high turnover brings with it. One of its consequences is the loss of talents and the starting from scratch of activities that need to be carried quite repetitively (i.e. training). I enjoy the most the interaction with team members, the part that preceeds the put in place of a development plan, the influencing, the inspiring. I also very much take pride and enjoy in working on six sigma projects with the aim to make things better, for the organisation as"
good,My co-workers are the BESTpart of my job.
good,Overall I enjoyed working here. I loved the guests and associates.
good,"Great company to work for, in addition to the great location, and actual hotel."
good,It is a productive company in which to have a career. The values of the company are wonderful and people are promoted on a regular basis.
good,"Good hotel,good co-workers,great chef,good training materials"
good,As an employee you are able to meet a wide variety of people.
good,Great place to learn and grow quickly. Cares how the employees feels about their prospective areas. The management team holds everyone accountable and expect the beat from them.
good,"New training is needed with all the updates. I want to find more opportunities to help my growth knowledge and work experience within the company."
good,"MARRIOTT ES LO MEJOR QUE ME PUDO HABER PASADO TRABAJE EN UN J.W EN QUITO CUANDO SE INAUGURÓ."
good,"I can't really say much since I was an intern for my practicum but, the experience is really nice and working there gave me a good learning experience."
good,"As a hospitality management student, this is one of the best places to gain practical experience and knowledge. At the end of my 4 month training at Westin, I could notice the changes in my personality, communication and customer service skills."
good,great comapny to work for. There was something new everyday given the location of the hotel i worked at. My Security Director and Supervisors were very helpful in my development.
good,"A typical day at work is greeting guests, making conversation, answering phone calls and doing paperwork. I learned all my duties for front desk in a short amount of time. Management was good in the beginning, its okay now. The hardest part of the job was trying to get management to complete a task that needed to be done for a guest asap. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to accommodate guests needs and they enjoy my service and compliment me."
good,"Working for Marriott reservations is great. You can learn a lot of transferable job skills through this job. Their benefits are eh. The hotel discount is obviously the most popular, but with good reason. The training started out very great, but they change out the systems so quickly due to the merger, that there really is no solid training anymore, and if there is, the procedures change just as quick. Other than that, if you can hold your ground, it is a decent atmosphere, and a great place to start working in the hospitality biz."
good,"Tasks assigned at the beginning of the week or even possibly day of events. Enough time to complete tasks and talk with fellow associates. Crunch time a bit hectic but team would always come together to complete necessary tasks. BTS a bit lacking at times and often short-staffed. But when all necessary tools, support, & personnel provided job was very enjoyable and productive."
good,I enjoy working for hotels but I didn’t think that job I was doing was for me I needed some to keep me busy and going the whole shift not just for an hour
good,"I learned so much about people, leadership, pushing myself to the limit, food science, organizational hierarchy, budgeting, coding invoices, and standing up for my team and myself. I appreciate all of it."
good,It's great place to work. Located in the middle of the city which makes it easy to commute to work. The energy is great and staff help one another most of the time.
good,i happen to be very customer service oriented. Working weekends stink but having the flexibility to work on the weekends helped me finish my bachelors and work full time. Won't have changed working for a Marriott Property.
good,Valet is outdoors so prepare to be cold in the winters and hot in the summers. The pay isn't great and you share tips at the end of the shift. Just know how to drive a car safely and you'll do fine.
good,"I liked working there, my colleagues and I managed to make a good team, we supported each other, and we tried to fix the problems together looking for a good solution, I learned to be patient and be consistent with the guests, always try to give the best possible service with a smile and human quality"
good,It really depends what property you are at   It seems every property has its own culture which can make or break the quality of life at work  It seems like smaller properties are better
good,The Marriott has a nice employee area to eat your lunch and free soda machines for the people who like sodas.  There are TV's in there as well to focus on while there.
good,Focus to detail in your work and specially when you are in the customer services make sure your body reflect your positive. Always do your best because it must comes to you in the Future.
good,"Great Company, Quick to advance, promote, give raises, however was supposed to result in work from home job which was what had me willing to tolerate the long commute in the beginning until date was pushed further and further back and I was no longer willing to sacrifice the time and money"
good,As the W Insider Manager I oversaw Concierge and Experience to perpetuate W Hotel's culture. It was a great learning experience to flex my creativity skills through brand values.
good,"I've learned with Marriott so much, that if I start typing about everything that I've learned, I would need a couple of hours to finish. Great company to develop skills and take advantage of opportunities."
good,I loved to work at Marriott. They had an immersive workplace culture and a great management team. A typical day at work was was always putting the guest first and the best part of the job was being able to make personal connections with guests(remembering their name if they stayed multiple days or remembering their coffee order)
good,Constantly interacting with people and have to stay on your feet. Everyone is very nice and you have to have a good attitude. Does get very busy on the weekends and there is a low amount of employees so they are always hiring
good,"Was a busy place, we meet a lot of new people every day. I love to help others, Was a challenge for me. I learned so much about other cultures. I will refer others to there."
good,"good environment"
good,"Feeling good, there stuff are very friendly and i refer to my othwr friends , i learned more things from there , and i develop my speed , my capacity, because there have too much work load."
good,Working there was great and the people I worked with where happy and positive  We had meeting on how to better our system and what things could be improved
good,I was excited to develop more professional postures and services to the guests at Marriott. But the management still needs to work more on the work life balance in the industry. The employees need to be happy and have fun providing exceptional services to the guests. the top executive take well care of the employees and the employees create the wonderful assistances to the guests.
good,"I was  valet runner at the JW Marriott, i was able to meet a lot of new people and make great connection. I was able to helpe all types of people from all over the world"
good,"Grand groupe Hôtelier avec des possibilités d'évolutions à l'international.  Emploi stimulant , jamais de routine."
good,The environment was great meet alot of interesting people and made great connections. The management was shady and promised you things they couldn't keep. They management just wanted you to do there jobs while they kicked back and got paid.
good,A very eventful place and fun place to work at. Balanced Culture and provided opportunities for growth. Good Management. Good and fun Place to work at.
good,"Wonderful benefits, management and HR help to accommodate, but I would not recommended working here if you are easily flustered or frustrated because the customers are the worst people on the planet"
good,easy basic job and stress free for the most part. Good set 40 hour a week schedule and decent benefits. Job culture was enjoyable. Management was ok. Good job for someone who doesnt care about alot of money but wants a simple gig.
good,"Fast-paced, increasingly youthful environment, more exciting than ever but the work hours are long.  Be prepared to give it all.  Great culture, not always the best pay compared to other hospitality companies. Most on property and at corporate will tell  you there are enough resources as they keep teams lean. The best part of the job is the people you work with.  Especially on property, your co-workers are like family. Great place to get experience at least for a few years, and especially when you are young. There is upward career mobility especially on property, less so at corporate."
good,The typical day at work is like working with friends and family.  The Management team is approachable and supportive.  Employee ideas are respected and appreciated and if possible implemented
good,"i enjoyed working with different experts that were responsible to deploy field machines on the site, meaning electrical and mechanical equipment."
good,"fast paced, but you have to work at your pace to figure out how to make the job more easier for you. enjoyable part are when you assist people and the say something good about you to your manager"
good,When starting out for a career path Marriott is a great place to start. Even if your career is in hospitality its a great place to get your foot through the door.
good,greeting guest with a warm welcome and making sure they enjoy their time from home.  I made sure that all their needs were met and with high expectations.
good,"Hard to tell about Marriott specifically. I did not work directly for Marriott, but one of the companies in their umbrella, and it was managed by another company."
good,"flexible hours and vacation but bonuses were hard to attain."
good,Fun environment to work in. Friendly staff. Sometimes it can get a little hectic with customers but overall its a good place to work. Make sure to write everything down take notes which will help your training.
good,A real family environment that helps the employees operate at a high level. Within in the company there is room to grow as the management team prep you to become a better employee for yourself and the company.
good,"Great part-time job especially if you want to make a little extra money."
good,Wonderful place to get to meet all different kinds of ppl. Great Opportunity to move through different departments. Marriott helps you progress if you wanna train in different departments
good,"Is too hard the work, the communication is too poor with the Hispanic or Latin people. I think so that they need more people in the administration that speak Spanish."
good,"For myself, a union hotel is a lot different and less desirable place to manage associates. New laundry washers were purchased and did make it a lot better for hotel production."
good,Working at Marriott has many benefits especially when you have associate discount when staying at Marriott hotels.  Corp reorg happens all the time across the entire company.  You will need to reapply your own position and go through interviews and compete with peers.  It is all about network within the company
good,"working for Mariott International I am  very proud but we have poor managment  Marriott need good management and workers .campany  is the best"
good,"Seasonal Jobs there are very limited and they often don't give a lot of hours. Marriot has a great starting pay. If you are looking for a second job or a weekend job for extra cash , this job would be great for you!"
good,"A typical day included taking incoming calls, making reservations, canceling reservations, and helping customers with their accounts. I learned how to work at a call center and take the steps to make customers happy. Most of the management was easy to work for/with."
good,Very welcoming. Front of house employees are fun.As soon as you walk in there welcoming you.They also sit on a beach front and that vIDs is just breathtaking and beautiful
good,I enjoyed working with my banquet family. Theyre bery helpful and fun to work with. They treat me like a baby and we also helping each other to make sure that  our service and assigned tables are  good.
good,There are so many opportunities within the company to advance. Great for those trying to start a career in hospitality industry. Leadership is very supportive.
good,"Every hotel is different; no matter where you work, there will be things you don't particularly care for. However, Marriott is a very open, friendly, hospitable work environment who takes great care of their employees. As long as you do your job and do it well, you should love it! Employee discounts on rooms are phenomenal! Immediate family gets employee rates as well."
good,Great work environment. High expectations of mangers of un paid over time. Nice perks . great deals on hotels etc. Poor roll out of new Marriott branded programs.
good,Friendly place to work with many opportunities to grow. The workplace culture was very nice and supportive. Management was also supportive and willing to teach.
good,Nice Place to Work.  Enjoyed what i did.  Love customer service work.  Took pride in my work.  Worked independently.  Took direction when given.  Multitasker.
good,Se trabaja duro siempre están falta de personal y hago dos trabajo por tan solo un salario esta empresa debería de contratar o aumentar más el salario
good,They definitely make you work and keep you busy and it can get very exhausting. At first the pay seemed good but I quickly realized it wasn't worth it if I had to come in at 5 AM and end up doing over time when I didn't plan on it. I worked for a new hotel in Irvine and even after being open for a year didn't have their act together. Management tried their best and I honestly feel bad for them. Marriott is so rich so they should start paying more in addition to the good benefits.
good,"Great experience. I learned a lot at the Westin. Met a lot of new people, different characters and personalities. Always enjoyed serving guest and finding out how there day was going or what happened to leave them so stressed out. Loved talking to customers and allowing them to vent while they relax and have a meal."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Marriott , I learned how to work faced paced as well as they disciplined me with how to work effectively and appearance was a must . I enjoyed working with the employyees there ."
good,"Very busy two years, but also great group of people.  Former company bought out by Marriott and we were kept on until the Starwood hotels were fully integrated with Marriott."
good,"I had a lot of hard work and not a lot of time to do it sometimes. My bosses were understanding but often got frustrated first. The benefits from working here were great, however. I also learned a lot about events and guest care."
good,"I enjoy meeting people  so I was always a hard worker and was gifted to receive awards all year by guest  plus the great people I have met and continue to stay in contact. "
good,I enjoyed my time at the Marriott. It was a great lace to work. I learned a lot about the food industry and what it takes to make it in that business.
good,"As with all things, people make the difference.  My last years with Marriott (formerly Starwood) were the exception to the rule but overall, it was a great experience.  They are a great mix of people to work with and work for."
good,Overall Marriott company cares about their workers but explore different places to work during your career with Marriott because not every hotel environment is the same.
good,"There was a real buzz and sense of teamwork and personal importance at the Forest of Arden. Long hours and irregular hours can be off-putting, but the buzz of big events meant enjoyable and rewarding shifts."
good,"Working for Marriott can be beneficial to a person life. Weekly pay, benefits, 401k, medical dental, vision insurance. tuition reimbursement only if what your going to school for benefits Marriott somehow."
good,I loved working at the Marriott. The teams was great as were the managers. They took time to do proper training and always recognized employees that went above and beyond. They truley care about guest satisfaction and were always willing to go above and beyond for their guests and employees.
good,"Before Marriott merged with Starwood, it was a much more personable place to work."
good,I enjoy being employed with this company.  They are structured around family and treat the associates as such.  Learning and development are strongly suggested and recommended to advance within your career field.
good,"The days are average and they gave me suggestions on what do to make my working experience easier ,the manager was the kindest most supportive person I've had known overall it was good except that there should've been one individual other than me to support my health and wellbeing."
good,Fun and learned about the hospitality industry. Helped me broaden my knowledge about my desired field and now I am pursuing and studying hospitality again in a different country to contribute more in this industry.
good,"Marriott Vacation Club, specifically Marriott Shadow Ridge in Palm Desert, was a great place to work. I was referred by a friend and entered as a lifeguard and in less than a year i was able to transfer to the Loss Prevention department. Many great departments to work for and networking is as easy as it is essential. The hiring process was quick and very easy after taking a short assessment test online.  Depending on various elements such as season, department, guest occupancy, etc, your schedule can vary every week or you may be on a fixed schedule."
good,Well I was moved up quickly! It is a Hotel with alot conventions events. Alot of people attend and come with there companies. There a couple of restaurants and they all are busy. Practically everyone helps each other.
good,"The hotel I work for closed for renovation so great opportunity to shop around for a newer/better place to work."
good,"La mia giornata lavorativa iniziava alle ore 9.00 e finiva alle ore 18.00."
good,Workplace culture was fine.  Working in corporate was a different sort of beast.  It was easy to keep to myself and slip into a routine. Would recommend to someone who is looking for a steady job.
good,"Advancement opportunity"
good,"I will always appreciate the skills I learned, however, it is a shift work job and thus can have the drawbacks associated with such work. The culture is progressive and accepting of all peoples. Work load, tasks, and challenges are pretty standard to other hotel and hospitality jobs."
good,Has good advancement opportunities and was always a fun place to work.  Opening hotels was the mos exciting times I had while working for Marriott.  Overall loved working there.
good,The company is true to their overall mission statement - Take care of the customer and they will take care of you. Overall it is a great place to work.
good,"Marriott Boston Copley is a great way to begin your career. You definitely learn a lot and gain an extensive amount of skills working here. The hosts work great together, we really support one another well."
good,"The typical day was all about the guests first and then paperwork and reports. Teamwork was amazing. I very much enjoyed all teams I was with. Management was tricky to figure out sometimes because of their lack of clear communication until things went wrong. Overall I had the best job, and never expected it. There are many times for multi-tasking and I was good at that, as well as training all new hires. My hours were always very flexible and being trained at night-audit as a back up helped my value to my team. I love being at the front desk."
good,Thank u for the opportunity to work for this company . Learned much needed guest service skills.  Love communicating with guests. Making their stay exceptional
good,"Working with Marriott is a nice place to work especially the pay and hour, the benefits for !e and my family and the guest are really friendly and you can talk to them to give advice on the area."
good,the food was very good and the service was quick as we needed to make it to the theater. We went with appetizers and salad that were delicious and plenty of food. Our waiter was very nice and accommodating but forgot a few things which is disappointing at this level of restaurant. We asked for oil with the bread and it never got to the table. We looked for the waiter but were in a back room and did not see him to remind him for the oil so went without.
good,"My day consist of taking care of our guest, and making sure they're satisfied. "
good,"I worked while attending school, along with other students. the hours were flexible and it they worked around my busy schedule as a student athlete. I also learned a lot."
good,"Working at the Marriott was one of the highlights of my life. The people I worked with were some of the best relationships I've ever formed. It became my second family, and I learned things there that took me years to fully appreciate. The complexities of that kind of environment really help you to grow as a person."
good,"Each property is different but, you can find one that fits your personality. The rest is always up to you as a person. This industry is better suited for extroverted individuals. It takes some time when it comes to moving up but, as long as you network well and stay focused to your  goal it will happen."
good,"Learned a great deal on how a hotel works and operates.  Working overnights, they paid a dollar an hour premium.  Very busy hotel with many staff members.  Staff were required to be flexible for scheduling.  Management was fair and also flexible for day off requests and vacation times.  You are treated with respect and valued as part of an important team.  There are staff incentives, like prizes for nominated for best employee of the week, helping other staff members, etc."
good,hubieron muy buenas cosas en el hotel nada que decir
good,"As I stated in my previous answer, The new GM needed to work on his leadership skills and it effected the staff as a whole. I could not be productive and ensure my guests were well taken care of with his constant interference."
good,"Marriott offers great training and provides employees with excellent benefits. I loved my co-workers and my management team. I learned a lot about customer service and hospitality, overall."
good,"Im here for the benefits. Management  is never around and totally uninvolved which can be nice, but there is no consistency or standards. We are rebranding soon, maybe all of this will change"
good,"The company is great overall, offers great benefits and has a promising future for those who are willing to work hard and make the necessary sacrifices to advance into the positions desired. Work-life balance its the major con of working in the hospitality/hotel industry because it is a year round business and you have to be willing to work hard and work often. Other than that, keep a positive attitude and good things can come from that anywhere you work."
good,"Fast paced environment with great benefits, however the pay is a little low.  Learned a great deal about the ins and outs of the claims department.  Great learning experience!"
good,I love working at the Courtyard! It is a fun environment that gives you the opportunity to create long lasting impressions on guests and an amazing stay experience. The hotel gives you opportunities to advance and it teaches you many valuable skills that you may not learn in other industries.
good,"Louisville Marriott East is a great environment to work in, but advancement was not really available, but the overall management was great to work with."
good,"In hospitality the days fluctuate depending on occupancy.  I do enjoy working with my colleagues in offering the best hotel product possible."
good,"A typical day at work in the field I work in is never the same.  I can never expect what my day will look like, but that is one of the things I like about the job.  It truly never gets boring.  I have learned a multitude of leadership and discipline-related skills.  I have very little resources, so I have been forced into learning roles I don't necessarily posses the job title for.  The hardest part of the job is the work-life balance.  Because I am stretched so thin, I have to compromise a lot of my time in order to excel in my role.  It is hard when my commute totals at least 2.5 hours per day plus a 10-12 hour work day.  By the time I come home, it's time to start all over again.  I do enjoy the exorbitant amount of experience and knowledge I have gained.  I know that I can go anywhere and do anything I set my mind to after working here."
good,I love marriott they are an awesome company that always has your back. They help and always ask if you need anything to do the best job you can. Management is good but could work on it.
good,I enjoyed meeting lots of people and keeping up with all the tours and entertainment in Savannah. the other employees there were friendly and professional.
good,Enjoyed my experience with other staff and guest the break times were comfortable with work schedule and if it was really needed you could have time if needed.
good,I worked early morning hours and was off at 2:00 pm each day. I was cooking in a cook per order environment called exhibition cooking where I would be able to cook for two people at a time. It was fun and the clients enjoyed watching me cook.
good,It's quite tiring but the customers there are quite friendly. Moreover I've learned how to do things fast and  accurately and how to deal with customers in  the service industry.
good,"associates were given a free lunch each day choice of 1-2 meats; 3 vegetables; large salad bar. coke, etc. drinks for your meal and anytime of the day you were thirsty."
good,"ben euh préparation buffet ptit déjeuner"
good,Company values staff and provides opportunities for advancement whenever possible. Company provides ample training and development. Work Life balance can be difficult at times in a busy high volume environment.
good,el buen servicio y amabilidad con los clientes en todo momento
good,"8 hours of work"
good,A great place to work as long as it isn't franchised by a company known for having a large turn over rate. If you hear about a big turn over rate try to get into a actual Marriott owned property you'll be treated fairly and will actually enjoy working in hospitality.
good,"Typical work day at the Marriott consist of collecting trash and linen cleaning guest room mopping, buffing, stripping, and waxing floors. My enjoyable part of my job is working with my co worker and the good aura"
good,This is a fast paced environment but I truly enjoyed my employment with Marriott and intend to pursue other opportunities with the company. The employee discount is great especially if you travel.
good,"Good place to work.  Management is fair.  We have a nice restaurant.Hardest part of job is dealing with guest when they are upset.  No matter what we have to be nice and apologize, even when the guests are screaming and cursing at you."
good,"enjoyed it alot woud love to come back enjoyed the great wages and the outstanding employees , always had great food . hardest part was nesting hours yu work till about 2am but ther than that its great"
good,"Working for Marriott is fast-paced and sometimes unpredictable, but the culture is generally friendly. Everyone works together to make operations go smoothly. Most positions are equal in terms of importance."
good,I love Marriott brand.They giving great training .I enjoyed taking care of the broad range of guest.I love that they had  standards that made us great and I was proud to tell people I worked for Marriott.I did a great deal of traveling using paid vacation time and brand discounts.
good,"I am still currently working here, and the job is decent. You get your hours, and the pay is decent. Its either 7-3 or 3-11 those are only two shifts."
good,"I love working for a Marriott Establishment. The employee rate is great if you love traveling and don't want to spend much for a hotel room. The discount is offered at both Starwood and Marriott. "
good,"The place where i learned to do multi tasking. We learned how to do time management. My former supervisor knew what's the meaning of married life, giving me extra days off when my kids was sick or in the hospital. Work environment was nice helping each other. most enjoyable part, once a year we had summer outing where everybody enjoyed"
good,Marriott offers a lot but still can be improved with better salary especially to the staffs on the lower grades. Meals and accommodation is fine. Good training facilities also provided.
good,I worked overnight. Social interactions were limited to early morning risers and the security guard. That was 11 years ago. Hotel isn't even there anymore.
good,Whenever there is an event the host more than likely has instructions for the workers and that can interfere with the flow of things but we get them done.
good,Fast paced work setting up the event to be on time before opening the doors. Not everyone that fast. Some can't pick up 10 entrees. Like working indoors to stay out of bad weather. In Atlanta you can make banquet work a network to stay busy.
good,"The work culture is overall positive, though due to lack of movement can be troublesome for long term work goals. If you enjoy a relaxed environment apply here"
good,Working in the casino security division was a fun and beneficial experience.  Management was friendly and cooperative and treated employees fairly.  Only issue was frequent under staffing.
good,"Liked the job. Like any CS job, you'll have guests that make it hard, but overall a good place. Hours usually change depending on business needs so you have to be flexible."
good,coming to work check on the bookings of the day then do my MEP set up for service i learnt to work with different  cultures management here is very unfair
good,"Hotels seem relaxed and calm places of occupation from the outside in, but the reality would actually have it be a very high-paced, stressful environment."
good,This company overall is very well run. I would say that they do care about their employees for the most part. There was always something new for us there. They had the canteen and we had food days regularly.
good,"1-Room for growth  "
good,"An average day for a manager is 10+hours, and the work place can be fast paced and stressful. However, the company provides great benefits, and job security."
good,"Working in the hospitality industry can be relaxed at times when dealing with customers who can be pleased. At times there are customers that aren't satisfied, but taking care of them and meeting their needs is a rewarding feeling."

good,I enjoyed working for the Marriott I learned a lot about hospitality and customer service. If I went back to the company I would like a higher wage and a full time position.

good,Marriott has a great workplace culture. Assuring every guest expectation is succeeded and every employee is acknowledged. Working with a great supportive team was very enjoyable.
good,The Hotel has some wonderful people to work with.  There was never a dull moment and the Events were outstanding.  Pay grade for all is way under standard industry.  The hard work/pay does not equal out and it's hard to move up in a small Hotel.

good,"The job was part time, with limited benefits.  If the job was full time with benefits, I would still be there.  They were great people to work for.  Management took their time to train me, and answer my questions."
good,"Problem solving skills are a must for this job. Greeted customers, handled card/cash payments. Mid and night shift were responsible for washing/drying/folding all laundry that housekeeping striped from the rooms that morning. A lot of work and exhausting for an 8 hour shift. Impossible to get all your work done. What you didn't finish was passed to the next shift to hopefully finish before morning."

good,"I really enjoyed working at Sheraton/LeMeridan Hotel for the last year. I truly wish it was closer and busier at this time. The lack of hours makes the drive unattractive, but I will remain working there as an on-call employee."
good,"I enjoy greeting guest for a breakfast I know they enjoy. The management is great. My day starts by setting up the breakfast food, made up the previous day. then the hot foods are cooked , panned and set out. Make coffee as needed..I  stock any thing that need to be stocked. I keep tables, and bar area clean. talk to customers, making shore everything is to their liking. After breakfast, I break down the bar, put everything away. cut and prepare any food needed for next day. Vacuum, and mop breakfast area and lobby."
good,"Has a houseman I do enjoyed be at work early in the morning to get the morning product ready for the team , I also like to be in the lobby to keep it clean and  meat a lot of people from all different places"
good,"All Marriott hotels in this area are franchised, so we are following Marriott standards as well as the management company's standards.  This hotel has just about 400 rooms and a very small meeting space so a lot of the large groups will take place next door at the Convention center."
good,"This was a perfect job to have and I wish I could have had it longer than I did.  Management was perfect and always appreciative, my co-workers were fantastic, and the work was enjoyable with a surprising amount of job recognition from the guests."
good,"I love working for this company, its a friendly peaceful environment"
good,Working as a telemarketer for Mariott was enjoyable because my coworkers were great and it was a very relaxed atmosphere.  The time on the bus to Branson was a fun ride.
good,"Its never about the facility you work in, its all about who you work with, the associates and managers you work with and learn from. I happen to have a great team for training. Management was new and needed some transitioning time. Overall, I enjoyed meeting new people and even the regulars. I enjoyed being able to give a little extra to guests when they didn't expect it."
good,"My experience has been decent so far at the hotel Saskatchewan. Being an autograph collection property, you have complete freedom for food programming in the hotel. which allows to bring out your best creativity."
good,You have too stay down and make an positive impact on yourself keep a good attitude at all times keep your composure cause it's so easy too give up and loss your cool
good,"i really did enjoy working here, i experienced a of different foods and desserts i learned alot about how to handle cutlery and set tables as well as how to serve people politely."
good,"Marriott was definitely an enjoyable place to work. Supportive management and work/life balances were keen on most of the supervisors minds. Support teams were slightly lacking in communication, but over all the experience was one of learning and progress."
good,I ready enjoy my job my co worker are the best. The atmosphere  is beautiful which allows positive energy to flow through everyone. Makes it easy to smile.
good,"I was hired to work for Marriott by a friend I had known in California who was the resort general manager. I was hired to work in catering because of my background as at country clubs in California.  Ended up doing such a good job that I could not get a day off,  Was made Director of Services, housekeeping, a job that I loved. Was moved to a 1000 room resort in Missouri and then trained to be Front office Manager. Moved back to old resort inArizona because of my wife's health. I became front office Manager there.  The structure of the job changed and I was not as happy with no control over reservations. I decided to go to wrk for myself."
good,"The Westin Desert Willows is fun and the supervisors are well tuned to handle the common discrepancies that occur in the hospitality industry. The staff in the service express department lack a lot of important communication skills and practices, but that may be due to a high turn over rate. The guests that stay there are mostly pleasant to interact with and accommodate. Overall a great place to work."
good,to many managers being turned over because of the amount they got paid. i made more the the mangers did and i think they left because of the hours they had to put in
good,"El hotel funciona como un solo organismo, servir al huésped. La relación con otros departamentos es muy buena."
good,The hours were sometimes long with several down times. The busiest hours were early morning or late evening transporting guests to and from the airport. Had great opportunities to meet people and earn extra dollars in tips
good,I learned a significant amount customer service and guest services while working in this position. The workplace culture was the greatest I have ever been a part of-the general manager of the entire property knew all the interns by name!
good,learnt a lot during my tanning period management and colleagues were really very supportive and always guide us how to adopt the hotel culture and atmosphere.
good,"As a waiter tasks, everyday we need to make sure we are ready to serve all costumers come to the restaurant or lounge/ bar. All the preparations need to be done and we need to follow the marmots standard, like go faster is possible to the table (less than a minute), call costumers by their names etc."
good,I had clean up to 16 rooms daily and I to make sure any item that was left behind for the guests was sent to the lost and find department. When I clean the rooms I had to make sure there wasn't anything health hazardous was on the sheets or on the floor like blood or vomit as I had had to make sure safety was apart of my daily cleaning. I had to report and dangerous situations was going on in the rooms to clean.
good,"Like going to school, great work place,fun, love being there. Not competitive with salary, great experience but better for resume with best incentives of any job but poor pay not a long term place."
good,"Very busy on days that Banquets are going on. Learned on how to order chemicals and how things work in the Banquets area, like plating and sorting the proper way of dishes"
good,Learned about guest relations and how to resolve guest opportunities. Very regimented place to work. Mostly enjoyable. The hardest part about job is satisfying difficult guests. Management isn't always connected with employees.
good,"When I worked for this company it was originally a Starwood property and had just been bought by Marriott a few months before I left. The money, the staff, the benefits were AMAZING.  There was ALWAYS opportunity for over time, and they were great for approving vacation time.Once Marriott took over and new management came in everything changed. We were barely getting breaks, management stopped coming around anc checking on us, and if we were busy instead of helping us, they were often adding to the rush by eating in the restaurant and acting like VIP guests."
good,"Nice benefits as Marriott employee, lot of non work related activities for staff and free barbaque! "
good,"I had a lot of fun working at the Marriott, my compensation was lower, but this may be due to the fact I worked in a business hotel in a small city in western Massachusetts"
good,The employees are great to work with and guest love them! they make the hotel! We have a great restaurant that is loved by out of towners and the locals.
good,"I start my work by preparing all the required safety gadgets such as side pocket (pocket rescue mask & gloves). arranging sun beds, pool towels & umbrellas. Getting ready for the guest to come. Cleaning & vacuuming pool. In my everyday work I've learned how to build trust with work colleague, talk and approach guest professionally. Our management here has an open door policy that they are listening to our concern and suggestion to improve customer service. We have different culture diversity in our Hotel. As a matter of fact we are 12 different nationality working in Spa and Recreation in our team. I can say that the hardest part of my job is on summer season that i need to stay outside the heat the whole 9 hours of duty, And yet til I found it enjoyable because of the people around me that working together as a team."
good,"If you looking to grow and better your self - this is the hotel to strengthen ALL your skills... and teach you new ones... Full service hotel, 24hr room service, amazing people and beautiful hotel - known as the ""Old Lady"" of the beachfront area in its ripe age of 106 years - this Grande Dame keeps you on your toes."
good,For many years this job was a great place to work.  Overall team work was conducive to making this job very satisfying. Changes in supervisors was the most difficult part of the job and sometimes you'd wonder why certain people were moved in management positions.  Overall a good place to work.
good,"Great place to work, awesome perks, dealing with guest can be great meeting people from all over. One thing that got to me was that I like to be more active and at times the front desk can be at slow and boring."
good,"In my current role, customer service is a priority. Unfortunately there is no position upward that would be available to myself. Despite the company having fantastic culture, there is no room to move upward which has prompted me to look for other opportunities outside the company."
good,"this place taught me a lot about cooking,great place to work at the time with some great people. Long hours at times but it was all worth it and was like working with a little family in that kitchen."
good,"The pay was alright. I was a pool attendant and enjoyed meeting with and assisting guests at the villas. The winters were a little slow, but the summers pay well."
good,"Majority of the time job is fast pace, everyone is usually help each other and the environment is friendly place to work. Management is fair and easy to talk to."
good,"Great place to work. Easy, laid back and they work with employees.  The work atmosphere can't be beat. Great people.  Travel benefits are good.  Management truly cares about employees."
good,Marriott is a very good company to work for and they have very good staff benefits. The company policy is to keep the team members happy so they are satisfied and perform well. The management in this property is not as good as the company policies are.
good,"You have to be wiling to work evenings and weekends. Having small children makes this difficult.  Otherwise, It's a perfect job.  If you don't have children, it's smooth sailing."
good,Preparing the the banquets along with a busy weekend breakfast buffet especially on Sundays there is a lot of foot traffic from the local community it is always packed at the bar during the football season the pack it in there
good,"great flexibility due to zero hour contracts, easy work place as it was mostly young people around 17 years old, minimal authority on shift due to large amounts of staff, can be physically demanding needing to do room turn around and set up but doable with others help"
good,Always busy with volume out growing physical plant many years ago. Food has evolved from everything fresh made to about half fresh made to keep up with increased volume. Management is very transient while hourly staff has remained solid with many staff members working here over 10 years. Culture is very lax on discipline with several areas being allowed to maintain themselves with little management influence. 12 hour days are too often especially in the summer. When you finish a day here it is a great accomplishment and fulfilling.
good,My position can be fast paced and stressful. I like to work at pace where am constantly doing something productive. My management does a great job of advising and assisting. I like the satisfaction I get from helping others. Being able to tell when someone is smiling on the other end of the phone is important and let's me know I'm doing my job well.
good,"My experience working for the westin hotel was overall a great experience.  Fast paste, outgoing people, very high pase environment! Workin at the westin hotel was a fun learning experience.  Hospitality is one of the things i love doing. From stewarding, to banquet serving, too cooking/ chef experience. Really enjoyed working with overall great people who put in hard work to make things so great! Weddings, birthday parties, company lynchings, etc. So i will day overall, workin for the westin hotel / hospitality was AMAZING and will like to experience once more."
good,"I have 6 days, 8 hours and 1-hour break, I learn food hygiene, fire safety, communication Arabic language * also English language about the management they are very good, I have a separate room for doing my job, the hardest part of my job is ice carving & tyro set up for wall & sculptures, decorating the most enjoyable part of my job because this is my life."
good,"The team at Marriott is friendly and welcoming, always a pleasure to work with. I learned a lot of team work skills, as well as learning the ins and outs of large corporate events. The pay was not great though."
good,very fun workplace no ping pong table  but food is good and cafeteria is good bingo is very good fun this hotel  newly remodel  is beautiful hotel  in this aria 635 room biggest hotel in Denver Dtc center our restaurant  nice and new and food is very good bar aria is very big and beautiful  to many Tv  around the bar also hotel have M club is very beautiful and big
good,Worked for senior level executives. I enjoyed my time at Marriott International Inc.  They push their employees to excel.  They expect all employees to do their best work.  Give back to community.
good,"A typical day at work at Starwood hotels would be prioritizing invoices based on relevant terms, 3 way matching, batching, coding invoices to appropriate General Ledger accounts; reconcile bank and credit card statements, filing various documents; and entering data into the Accounts Payable system (AccPac) for payment, printing and distributing vendor checks."
good,"This company just opened up in March of 2017. As a member of our opening team I was shown how much our ""assistant"" managers worked. Since then, we've had 6 manager position turnovers."
good,"Great opportunity to work with the public in small town environ, with management choices that undermine the talented associates.  Hard work is not rewarded by people who know (and have vast experience) in what they are doing ."
good,"It's not very often you find someone willing to pay you 15+/hr to sit on the phones and talk to people. The job can be mentally demanding as you climb the ranks, but it isn't usually a hard one. When you have time between calls, the people around you are often the best part of the job, but you don't get those breaks often because it is a world-wide chain. All in all, a good place to work, so long as you don't have any other responsibilities."
good,"Overall, good place to work. There's a good mix of managing styles.          "
good,"My managers and the whole interdepartmental team was positive and lively.  My only problem was that the banquet department hours are too seasonal and sporadic.  "
good,"Always busy fast paced doing something."
good,I worked for a few months over the winter and found it to be a way to save up the money I needed for a Church choir tour. I worked with those I knew and was pleased to do so.
good,"Mis mejores años de vida."
good,"The company is fantastic, my only issue, is with the particular hotel i work for. The movement is not there, no opportunity to grow. Most of the staff in Management roles have been at the property for over 15 years and don't plan on moving. "
good,"Great Experience working in a commercial kitchen setting. Perfect place to work if one has another career/job. However, the place is not 100% diverse."
good,I enjoy my job because I had to be able to multitask every call was different. I make hotel reservations around the globe. I learned how specific the guests were and the importance of details for each reservation.
good,"Administrar y coordinar la fidelidad del programa SPG(Starwood Preferred Guest), motivar al equipo y dar seguimiento al objetivo asignado."
good,I worked at the airport and got to meet a lot of different people from all over the world. I stayed busy and felt very secure working for them . After 911 attack everything changed and lost over half the customers.
good,"productive job and well paid at the time, along with union benefits."
good,"Typically, always hot. Very busy. Alot of diverse cultures i've had plenty crazy conversations with some individuals. Big groups of people in an out from different events. I have never heard of them but their activities were astounding. I can tell they had crazy fun from the mess left. I've learn to work faster than i usually do."
good,Great job for college students for the position I was working. There was flexibility with my hours. I would average 6 hours a day 5 night a week. With a very comprehensive environment and teem work.
good,"All ways smile and greet the guest ,and team work is very important, when everyone work together everything go much smoother,because team work makes the dream work"
good,I have enjoyed my time with this company.  The opportunity for advancement has significantly changed and I feel they are not showing very much loyalty to their employees. Therefore it is time for a change
good,"Starwood made it's mark in the hotel & hospitality industry as an innovative leader with many industry firsts, distinctive brands and great hotels around the world.  The company focused beyond simply the hotel guest experience, incorporating the concept of lifestyle brands, its partnerships and loyalty programs.  At the heart it all were its people."
good,"Leuk en internationaal bedrijf, veel verschillende afdelingen en diverse werkzaamheden."
good,"handling entire hotel housekeeping operation with 2 self checkers and  manage occupied rooms  successfully and release arrival room on time."
good,I enjoyed working for this company until I received an opportunity to relocate. The position I applied and interviewed for was not the position they placed me in.
good,"Marriott is an incredible company and culture to be a part of, however there are a few short-comings. For one, some teams tend to be micromanaged. IE, no autonomy.  Teams work in an agile function which, at times, can limit how creative teams are able to be when producing features. "
good,"Great location hotel in heart of London. Multicultural staff, well organised management and safe place to work. Beautiful Bar and restaurant located serving great cocktail and foods. Regular return hotel guests mostly Americans. Consider as a business and family hotel with indoor swimming pool as well. Great duty meals are served in staff canteen and provide staff uniform as well. There are few events hall for conference and banqueting. Most of the staff are very friendly with each other and welling to help whenever necessary."

good,"Typical day was getting in before 0730, especially since I'm an early riser.  Making sure employees are doing well, if they've been there for the night, or before your arrival.  I enjoyed assisting my employees, because making them happy was a priority.  If my employees are not happy, then neither will my guests.  "
good,TownePlace Suites employed a great group of people. They are more like family than coworkers. The work atmosphere was great.
good,"As part of the finance team, in general I am able to manage my work schedule and ask for support whenever needed. The team is the best part of the job, where everyone look after each other. Career progress is fast in other areas of the hotel."

good,"Work with them years ago.  Very good experience, still in communication with my supervisors.  The hardest part of the job was the schedule."
good,Overall the job was fun and I enjoyed coming in every day. The only downside was being put down by the inbound phone calls where callers would have very bad attitudes.
good,"I love having the freedom and empowered position to truly serve my guest. I find the position of department heads challenging. Working with associates, discovering their talents and aspirations is like a breath of fresh air."
good,"Everyone that i worked with was always willing to help with anything, always tried to stay in a positive happy mood, and did everything they could to keep a productive work flow."

While working for the hotel you will learn many new things, not only about the history of the hotel itself but also of the culture and special attributes of the hotel's location. "
good,Starwood Corporate was a new organization when I started working with them in 1998. Over the years I watched the organization grow but I did not have the opportunity to grow with them. I started in 1998 as an admin assistant and I left as an admin assistant. Starwood has great employee advancement programs and benefits but for some reason I never advanced to a higher position.

I enjoy my co-workers. We all pitch in to make sure that everyone can have a productive and successful shift. Management at times is very helpful when needed. They do run food for us and take guests orders when needed. The hardest part of my job is really to ensure that the guest is enjoying their stay at the hotel. The reason this is sometime difficult is because there may  have been something  experienced that is out of my control and it is sometimes difficult to make them happy. I enjoy when I can make a guests day by doing simple things, such as remembering a drink order or food order from a previous visit, or just having a good genuine conversation."

El hotel Marriott se encuentra en la Av. 8N No. 10-18 barr. Granada. Mis colegas era la mejor parte del trabajo, era una unión como una familia, teníamos nuestras indiferencias pero siempre sobresalía nuestra amistad, incluyendo nuestros jefes. Lo mas difícil del trabajo era cuando se quejaba un huésped oh nos bajaban el puntaje a nivel de trip avisor.

Working there i learned the demands of needing enough rooms to satisfy customers checking into the hotel, meaning needing to be quick but thorough and efficient. The management was decent, they were flexible with my schedule due to the fact i have a 2 year old daughter. The hardest part of the job would be if the rooms were very messy and we were in need of all rooms assigned it takes longer then usual to get them back if very dirty.

We had many guests from the Middle East so my Arabic language skills were exercised almost daily. Management came to rely on me to interpret on their behalf to Spanish speaking house keepers. Organization was an essential aspect to the job. Keeping track of billing cycles (when particular long term guests are billed), credit card authorizations, and other information that could be required at last minute notice was of utmost importance. I was often left unsupervised for extended periods of time during both day and night. Being knowledgeable of company policies, self relient, trustworthy, and responsible were necessary."

good,Daily took reservations and cross-sold hotel rooms to customers based on their need. Served as on the job trainer for new associates and participated in pilot testing for different hotel brand.  Incentive programs were a boost to morale.  Enjoyed particularly servicing customers who weren't familiar with the areas and seeing that they stayed in the most comfort.  The hardest part was the closing of my center and the loss of the culture of working in that environment.
good,"quality comes before quantity"
good,"Managed BOH and FOH."
good,"Great place to work. However, I work on the 3rd shift which is not appealing to me."
good,"A typical day at work requires monitoring camera systems for any breach in hotel policy, writing reports when needed. I always try going above and beyond my expectations without causing problems with upper leadership."
good,"I got this job as soon a summer began for me. As a college student is a perfect job to have during to summer to make a pretty decent income. Especially if you work full-time. My team was AMAZING you train for about 3 mths and at first it takes awhile to get used to all the responsibility. But if you work often you'll quickly get the hang of using the computer system, handling guests complaints and disturbances, doing 6 things at one time, and always displaying EXCEPTIONAL guest service. I have never worked for a company that required such high standards of guest service, but it didn't go unappreciated. The guests would always thank you, which is very rewarding. Shifts are very long, especially if you work from 3pm-11pm so get used to being on your feet for long hours and having to have high energy for long hours. Overall good company to work for just not flexible hours."
good,"I had worked on large systems before working at Marriott but I have learned many new system that they use daily. I learned CA7 and TWS (Tivoli Workload System) scheduling programs to control all batch work used in all areas of support. I also was able to learn their TPF system for Marriott that controls all worldwide reservations. Each day you might work at these or other areas as needed to support over 2000 properties (employees and guests). Most of my co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part was dealing with the management. One of the best benefits was the free coffee in the break area, We also had great discounts on rooms."
good,"I started as a porter.  I worked mostly on tips and really enjoyed my interaction with the guest.  "
good,"I have learned so much through this company but yet they still do not treat everyone equally. I understand that there is a thing called seniority, but at the same time, there is a thing called EQUALITY which they do not seem to understand or even consider. Plus the management seems to think so highly of themselves that they treat you like you are nothing."
good,I loved working here....most of the time. There is almost zero room for advancement and the property is no longer a Marriott. A typical day for me was coming in at night (night auditor) and beginning the audit. I also had to keep an eye on the front desk and monitor phones for any guest needs. I had great co-workers and we meshed rather well. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the lack of communication and organization.
good,I love this job and I did do the review on this position. I really love up sales and inbound and outbound calls. I also like the fact of making people happy about their reservation was in place.
good,"Era un ambiente de trabajo  muy divertido porque  a veces  nos tocaba viajar y  recorrer los desarrollos para conocerlos perfectamente, conocer los servicios para ofrecer al cliente un producto convincente a sus  exigencias y necesidades."
good,"Questa esperienza mi ha arricchito sia professionalmente che umanamente per la disponibilità dei colleghi e per la simpatia che mi hanno dimostrato."

good,good in explaining the vision and motivating the staff for it
good,"Working at Marriott can be summed up in the phrase ""The Spirit to Serve"", which is the title of Mr. Marriott's book. The company has a strong culture of continuous improvement, market research and customer service. Creation and cultivation of distinct brands that also possess common threats is paramount."
good,Marriott is a good solid company to work for. They pay appropriately and have a good system in place.
good,"nothing negative to say, beautiful hotel, minimum wage pay, benefits are great."
good,This hotel has come a long way. I'm excited to start a new beginning in revamping the banquets department due to new meeting space that was put in place for extra revenue. Many new thing to come and many exciting things to come. It will not be easy but once there is structure put into place than it will run smoothly. I have learned a lot from my fellow peers and they are always willing to help and listen when I need them. The hardest part of the job is feeling like there isn't enough hours in the day to get things done due to my hourly restraints. The management company is all for moving people up from within and will do what's necessary to help employees.
good,Work load was great! Everyone was nice and got along. Management didn't work with school schedules that well.
good,"Worked from home. Awesome in the beginning. When the service dropped, lost hours and pay."
good,When I come into work everyone and myself would say hello followed with how steady work has been. When busy we would assist each other with out asking. Share responsibility with out complaints. The atmosphere was team and family oriented.
good,Great department with excellent associates.  Great manager with a teaching philosophy and terrific team building skills.
good,Assist guests with check in/check out; Also serve as concierge
good,"i stared my hotel life from my home and then i move to hotel school in sri lanka and i learn basic knowledge and  practically. in my 8 years of hotel industry carrier i love to work under pressure with my senior chefs and my colleges."
good,"no comments at this time."
good,washing pots and pans always learning new things great people to work with hardest part of the job was scrubing pots and pans for several hours straight most enjoyable part of the job were the people workmates
good,"Same company as before they asked me to come back after the property declined after I left"
good,"a typical day is 3pm to 11pm you're the server, cook, and cashier. you will talk to really interesting people, that stay at the hotel. upper management is great. the hardest part is you are the only one there to take care of any amount of people that come in. the most enjoyable part is getting to know the regulars"
good,A great hotel to start your future career within. Low salary without any extra compensation when you work as an trainee. Good opportunities to grow further within the company.
good,"-	Monitor all aspects of property and enforce policies and regulations to ensure the safety of guests and employees."
good,"Enjoy working at the Westin La Cantera Resort. The property is gorgeous and the clientele is great!"
good,GTE was a great place to work. During the time I was there they were awarded the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award
good,Campus pursuit of excellence was rewarding. Campus gave everyone sense of Family.
good,This particular marriott could use some improvement in dealing with their staff members and enhance their overall service experience.
good,"Fast pace environment"
good,"Typical day at work greeting guest while eating breakfast and asking about their stay. Entering numbers in system and doing tax exempt."
good,I interned at the Marriott in Irvine for a semester during my senior year of high school as part of my ROP culinary course. I enjoyed working there and i learned how a restaurant operates.
good,"Very productive and interesting,withiin meeting different people from all over the world."
good,"My day starts at 6am making sure everything has been set out for my guests and everything is plentiful.  from there, I shift into my Houseman role, visit the pool and gather wet towels from the night before.  Check the work out room for cleanliness and gather towels from there as well.  I return to being breakfast attendant after that, checking on guests, making sure there's coffee and plentiful breakfast items, do some light cleaning and busing tables.  Switch to Houseman again and check trash levels and dispose of it if needed.  Back to breakfast, back to Houseman.  This continues till around 11am when breakfast has been completed, everything restocked and ready for the next day and all areas cleaned.  From there, I switch to Houseman again and make sure the hotel is clean from clutter.  All trash is emptied.  Bathrooms cleaned and stocked, carpets vacuumed, elevators cleaned and polished, entryways swept and mopped, towels restocked in the pool and gym.  All workout equipment cleaned.  Ice machines cleaned, picture frames free from dust, etc.  This sounds like a lot, and it is usually accomplished by 2 people, however I am very good at what I do and can keep up with everything.  I also have great co-workers who jump in to help from time to time.  I enjoy it when it gets busy and looks like things may fall apart.  I shift into a different mode, do my job and never miss a beat, it's fun!"
good,"Very easy to work, nice people working and helping. Events were normally easy to handle, small property."
good,"The typical day at this job was that every one all ways was happy and full of joy. I learned how to work good under strees  and presser when the house count is up or down , My MANAGEMENT TEAM was very friendly and helpful at all tines . The co- workers was very helpful and happy all the time , they care about there workers and staff members at all times if need be . The hardest part of the job  is when some one call off work for no reason or if some one do not show up for work at all. But the most enjoyable part of the job is when every one is there and doing there part as a team player and meeting new people on the job  .We had party's on days that was for the whole team and staff."
good,Marriott has provided me with the opportunity to explore multiple avenues within the organization.
good,"Depending on what department you work every review is different but as for In Room Dining I STRONGLY disliked it. There was a high turn over rate cause to work more hours, harassment that was never dealt with and poor supervisor/management. In room dining is treated like the red headed step child of the hotel."
good,"This is a fun place to work, most people are quite friendly."
good,A typical day at work was setting tables with the correct silverware and making sure the guest were comfortable. We didnt consider ourselves as coworkers at work we consider the banquet team a family.  The hardest part of the job was going outside when the weather was bad because the contact might have still wanted their function held outside. But overral it was a good hotel to work for.
good,"Great place, and very professional. This was an internship, so I was constantly learning every day."
good,"A typical day at work will include answer telephone calls through out your entire shift, resolving guest issues, and relaying information to various departments. "
good,Management and staff work diligently as a team to be a productive hotel
good,"As it was only a 5 day work experience I was not shown all aspects of working there. During a typical day i would clean the gym equipment regularly, serve at the reception which consisted of allowing people entry to the leisure facility, serving cold beverages and meeting and greeting customers. I also carried out regular pool chemical level checks. My co-workers were fun, caring and hardworking employees they made sure I was doing everything correctly and accurately. Management was perfect, they were kind and always keen on making sure I was ok and had everything I needed. The hardest part of the jobs was the cleaning of the equipment as it had to be spotless. The most enjoyable part was being with the co-workers at they make the job enjoyable, fun and made the workplace an all round good place to be. "
good,very much like a family.  Good place to work just not a good fit for me
good,A regular day at work is being in the company of your own home while following your regularly scheduled breaks and lunches just like if youn were in the center as well as assisting all customers and Marriott members with reservations.
good,"Very nice place to work. They give a lot of incentives, they keep you motivated. The benefits are great. "
good,"Working at Marriott International at the Eaton Centre location is interesting to say the least. It's the flagship location in Toronto and the foot traffic can relate that the popularity of its location. "
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my job as a concierge. My typical day involves assisting guests with questions, recommending restaurants and entertainment options, and the occasional ride to the airport. I take advantage of the knowledge I have learned from the job, as well as the knowledge of others to provide the best experience I can for the guest. I even help others if they are not staying in the hotel. The most enjoyable part of my job is the reaction I receive from the guests who loved where I sent them; the satisfaction of suggesting the perfect place is unparalleled. Not only am I showing the guest great service in the hotel, but by recommending great places, I help the city as well. People are more likely to visit the city if they are enjoying their time in the hotel, and the more they enjoy the city, the more they will want to return. And recommend it to their friends and family. "
good,Good job if you like hospitality. To many different jobs to explain
good,"This job was very valuable, as Marriott is a large, growing corporation with significant benefits and an exciting work environment. Most of all, my position involved customer service, as Marriott has many standards that employees need to uphold and a very specific image to represent. Overall, I learned a lot about sustainable, farm-to-table dining and concerned myself most with the customer experience."
good,"overall a good work place where I enjoyed working a lot, very good and supportive co-workers and seniors"
good,"A typical day is enjoyable, the other associates are friendly and so are most of the supervisors/managers. I have learned a lot over the past five years, but I have had to really ask to learn new skills. I have learned food and alcohol and how to properly sever them. The management sometimes is extremely friendly but most of the time it feels a little cold and that they are trying to find mistakes. I have always enjoyed my coworkers with only two exceptions. We have a family mentality to how we approach each other. We fight for and with each other but we always have each others backs. The hardest part is dealing with the management because they talk at us not to us, suggestions are hard to get across and often take weeks to get someone to really listen. The best part is my co-workers. I have made some great friends and even when people leave we still stay friends so my co-workers are more like friends than co-workers."
good,All day receiving inbound calls from different people all over the world.  Making reservations all day.  
good,"Great people to work with but the company was too nice that people were being ineffective.  It took 1 year to probably make a simple decision because of the ""PROCESS"". "

good,"Typical day at work. Would be dealing with customers,inventory,phone calls and data entry."
good,In a typical day at work I check in about 30-50 guest answer about 75-100 phone calls and do loads of paperwork. I have learned how to navigate a complicated system and work side by side with my co-workers. Management takes the role off the guide. They give us free range to do what we feel should be done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the amount of work that has to be done. The most enjoyable part is knowing that we are contributing to a great hotel.
good,Can have a little stress but overall great. The pay is not that great. They did have good benefits.
good,I enjoy the variety of projects and different jobs the Marriott has given to me. I would want to stay with them if offered another position.
good,"Call center related work, I learned skills related to customer service in a highly emotional drama environment."
good,"It's a great place to work, but it's hard to advance in a career."
good,"During my tenure with Starwood, there were several industry changes taking place. Through these changes, one constant that remained was the company's ability to identify client's needs and create brands and experiences that craft client loyalty. These examples include, enhancing the company guest loyalty program; identifying, marketing and diversifying the different brands within the company's portfolio and training employee's on the company's values and customer services standards. The company's strength's in numbers and brand identity helps to establish more opportunities for personal growth and career development for employee's."

good,Very fast paced work enviorment. While with the company I was able to learn and get a complete understanding of the hospitality industry.I was fortunate to have outstanding management that truely believed in developing there employees. The hardest thing about this position was trying to manage work/life balance.The most enjoyable part was the opportunity to meet people from all over the nation.
good,"Great job, great pay, tough position at this particular location"
good,"I do my best to make my all of guests as happy as possible while making sure management's bottom line is being met, and that all of the front office reports are done. As a supervisor, I assist the agents with any problems they might be having (scheduling, computer, guest) and try to come up with a solution. The hardest part of the job is making sure every guest checking in to the hotel checks in happy and has a thoroughly enjoyable stay. The most enjoyable part is when the guest comes back at the end and tells you how wonderful their stay was and thanks you!"
good,"very busy, checking guest in and out of hotel, manager's great at what they did, co-workers also great, hardest part was letting someone leave hotel not satisfied, most enjoyable part was making guest happy and loved to see them return"

good,"A typical day of work at Marriott is hard work, but very rewarding. If you don,t already possess these skills you will learn how to work as a team and you will learn great customer service skills."
good,A typical day at the W Hotel is fulll of lots of work to do. Also very unpredictable. I have learned to not take my job or anyone else's job forgranted. Employees at the W work very hard to keep business running smooth. Management also work hard to do the same. The hardest part of my job is the physical pain that comes with it. Some days I have to push really hard to get through the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around people who work just as hard as I do and having an understanding of each other.
good,i enjoyed working here at Grand National. Love working in a fast paced environment with wonderful people.
good,Managing 5 different systems with 30 different Hotels - that could be challenge at times.

I make journal entries and perform cashier bank audits. I work closely with each department to ensure all payments are processed in a timely manner. I also take on other projects given to me by my manager. The hardest part or more challenging part of my job is making sure each department has completed the period end process on time. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I have a great working relationship with my co-workers."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, great managers. It is a lot of work,the worst part is the co-workers dont speak english at all."

good,Managers are great and supportive. Good work/life balance. Hotel discounts if you can snag one are good.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Marriott though I felt as if I couldn't really instill my full potential into the job. I like bigger challenges and being able to put the skills I've obtained as an accountant to use. Working for Marriott, I felt I was a bit limited in doing that. I enjoy working with customers however, and working at the hotel has significantly helped me improve my communication skills. I was able to come into the office in the morning and have productive conversations with my co-workers while looking at the guest memos for the day. The guests were always very appreciative of our services and friendly personalities so it was very fulfilling to know I was able to assist others."

An initial six-week training program provides the basis from which we build an ever more detailed picture of the entire program, which better enables us to assist its members. Our calls are spot-monitored by a quality control staff who provide useful feedback on a regular basis. Management is readily accessible and open to input."
good,"I have learned quite alot from this place of employment, but they do not give you a chance for advancement,I worked there for six years and the only way you advance if someone quits or they get fired. Management is awsome co workers are great but the most enjoyable part of my job was attending to my guests needs. I enjoyed every person that came to my rooms and complimented me on such a great job I had done and I looked forward to go to work everyday just to see the smiles on thier faces. The hardest part of my job was leaving the Marriott for good, I loved it there but it was time to move on."

good,"The job was great and I learned a lot about the industry and I really liked working with the crew, everyone did what we were suppose to do, it was like a well oiled machine. The company gives lots of incentives and benefits and the pay was incredible. Through out the year management would have a party to show its appreciation to the associates.

good,Perusahaan yang baik dan sangat bermanfaat buat masa depan
good,"Since I was new a typical day would be me clocking in to start the day and going to shadow whoever was working for the day. After a while i got my own login and started to work more on my on. While i was there I learned a lot as far as how everything worked in the hotel. The system was complicated and it took some getting used to to really understand. The culture was very high energy and fast paced, which wasn't a bad thing but it was hard to always match the energy of everyone else. The hardest part of the job was trying to branch off from shadowing to being on my on because i didn't want to mess anything up. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet so many different people in that one environment."
good,"I worked from Sunday to Friday and Saturday is my day off"
good,Everyone is respectful. The rooom are very nice and comfy just another typically work day. The pool area is the most comfy of the hotel. it's easy work but I won't want to work there again.

good,Workplace culture is based on diversity and helping everyone advance into their career. The most enjoyable part of the job was giving back to guests when they would visit and making their entire day with something simple.
good,I was a banquet server at the Marriott for several years. There were weeks we only work 20th as a week and there were weeks we worked 70 hours a week over all it was a good place to work
good,I enjoyed working there meet alot of good people i had to move back home is the only reason i left. I was also willing to go the extra mile i used to work front desk as well
good,"It is an usually hotel job but the way how is doing the jub and the appreciation makes the differences between Marriott and another hotel. It has a name which is toking by it self, nothing more to say."
good,Overall performance Marriott was a great place to work and I’ve learned a lot. The pay and benefits were great I hate that I had to relocate. But I’m a firm believer that if you use hard work and dedication it will pay off.
good,Çalışan turnover rate yüksek bun nedenle çalışan iş yükü çok ancak otel kültürü kuvvetli
good,"Is all the different people I get to meet and interact with from all over the world one of my favorite guest is from marocco, and we have regulars that I have become really close with"
good,"It's truly a great company and can open doors for you. It all falls down to what department/position you hold. If you're at a hotel, be prepared to work hard and around the clock. You are compensated for it but there is close to no work life balance. "
good,Group meetings before work began review all work orders asks questions when unsure ask for assistant when needed make sure all work is completed if not leave report on why.
good,"Marriott was a good place to work, the pay was bad, but everything else was ok. I liked my last manager I had, the ones before that, not so much. Like all companies you have your politics, but overall it was a good job.  The benefits are good, and discounts are also good."
good,"It was overall a good work place, I wanted to finish my last year of high school so I stopped working for a bit. I always worked for 3pm- til midnight sometimes 2am during school day and still showed up"
good,"Wonderful place to work, so many possibilities for cross-training. This is very much a family environment or every department will help you out. Management it's a little bit unrealistic expectations but other than that they're very kind people."
good,"A lot of work but all hospitality is - covered a lot of shifts, and underpaid and but appreciated and respected overall. Brand is well established and you can be proud to work for them and meet their goals"
good,"It is a very renowned company no doubt. We can balance your life, they are providing food, accomodation , pick up and drop, accomodation is also very standard."
good,Work needed some organization and re awaken team work. I have learned to be careful with how I say personal information. Management is great and have great intentions. Hardest part of my job was trying to get some employees to follow new policies.  Most enjoyable part of my job was to make sure that guest satisfaction was to Marriott standard and going above and beyond for the guest.
good,I love what i do and of course being in charge of customer service department  patience and genuine care should be a strong hold.Best management rest assured of job security .Most enjoyable part is working as a team and meeting the goals .
good,"The people there always had your back. The only downfall was the work life balance. If it was busy, you are not going home. If it was slow, don't expect going to work unless it was training."
good,Super friendly environment. Management is awesome!! Understanding and supportive. They are willing to work with your schedule if need be and its easy to find coverage.
good,Some days could be relaxed while others were quite challenging. Guests have a tendency to treat you as lesser because they are guests and you are an employee but coworkers and management usually help out. Best shift is morning shift as all of management and housekeeping/maintenance is usually there (weekends has less management). Evening shifts includes you and a coworker (where I worked at) so any problems that we could not resolve ourselves did lead to slight issues but anything out of our hands did lead to management coming in to resolve themselves as needed.
good,Marriott International is pretty good about ensuring a good Work/Life Balance. They offer on site child care and allow for flexible entry and exit times. They also offer Remote Work for those days that you are unable to make it in to work. There are some jobs that offer Remote Work as a permanent solution.
good,"I had a good experience working at Marriott 🙂"
good,"Fun place to work - especially at Gaylord Opryland. Lots of perks and benefits working for Marriott. Pay is extremely low for the cost of living in Nashville, Tennessee in 2018."
good,"Management was like a family, everyone is very helpful with one another. Every day was a good day when working in Marriott. If I had the chance to work in Marriott again, I would for sure."
good,"Marriott is an amazing company to work for if you are a work horse. If you don't care about moving up then its also a good company. Marriott will allow you to move internally if you show 110% dedication. In some occasions management sucks and politics run the show, in other areas you can make a difference and work that way. Pay is ok, with plenty of OT so that pays off long term."
good,"Working here was a great thing. I liked the fast-paced atmosphere, the friendly team that I was apart of, the manager's ability to give people kudos for their hard work and effort."
good,this company has so many hotels the only things stopping you is your own limitations. they even have a division that helps with all things needed for relocation.
good,"What people should 1st understand is that you don't actually work for MARRIOTT! You work for the management company. For me that's Auro hotels. The great thing is I can transfer to any Marriott in the world. Bad thing is my team is used to getting away with not fully doing their job so when a person like me comes along, they complain that I'm too ""by the book"" but hey, it's my job as the Front Desk Supervisor."
good,"If you love to assist others and feel like you are part of a great team, this is the company for you!  "
good,Great place to work.  Room for advancement.  Would recommend Marriott to anyone that is look for a position with a great company. Could do slightly better with compensation.
good,It’s just that the management wasn’t all that at the time so things were confusing sometimes because the computer systems always were being changed etc
good,"Good Pay, Hard Hours, Sometimes Flexable Schedule, Busy, Fast Paced, Nice Working Environment, Nice Managers, Growth Opportunities, Nice and Accommodating Environment."
good,Working at the marriot hotel taught me a lot about guest appreciation. It also taught me how to interact with different people around the world. I enjoyed serving guests and getting to know them. It was a fun work environment.
good,"Marriott it is good place and competitive job is safety, good environment work, very good benefits and good staff of managers and administrative personnel."
good,"A typical day at work would involve receiving, stocking and checking the inventory, prepare the breakfast buffet, refill breakfast buffet and coffee pots, assist guests with their seatings, welcome guests into the restaurant with a warm genuine smile."
good,"I worked at Marriott full time . It was a great job,productive and fun work place, communicative and friendly environment,  but  has low wages, no overtime."
good,Echt leuk company. Super team work. it was super 7 years
good,"The hardest part of this job would be the challenging guests. Surprisingly it can be a very hostile environment with particular travelers. Overall, the team and management support we have in house is exceptional. I enjoy the room discounts when we have the opportunity to travel, however, the pay scale is very low for this area. We emphasize team at our location and we work very hard to maintain a cohesive work environment among all of our departments. Effective communication is key. We empower our employees to make decisions and strengthen their knowledge and ability to take the reigns so-to-speak. Overall this has been an enjoyable career and company to work for."
good,It’s a good place to work if you are looking for something thematic is full time and offers good benefits. I would suggest this but be warned it can get stressful at times.
good,The rooms are big so was hard too work there but I liked people from this job. Lunch was very delicious.
good,"Overall, Starwood (now Marriott) was a good place to work. The management in my department was top-notch and hugely supportive. The directors at my call center in Austin would often take the time to meet with associates one-on-one to discuss career goals and assist with any challenges."
good,"I have worked at several Marriott properties- corporate is the way to go. My job is a lot of work and is not for everyone, but if you like working alone and having minimal interaction with bosses etc, this is the perfect job."
good,"Provides flexible hours, however there is little to no work during the months of October until December, and January until mid April. It provides a fair wage."
good,"Before working at Marriott, I had never worked in hospitality. I learned a lot while working there and gained insight. However, I do not see myself advancing in this environment."
good,"For only working for a week with no salary, i enjoyed the new environment as well as interacting with my new team and peers. it also showed me an aspect of the real world."
good,Working for Marriott exposes you to so many different career opportunities and skill sets. The diversity within is without equal. I have always believed that no matter what your career path; everyone should work in the Hospitality Industry. The experience is life altering.
good,"If you work as a manager, most likely your coworkers is not a team player. Im glad that my department was very helpful and we always cover each other. We dont mind doing each other works. My team was very responsible but I always hears other department that everyone just care for themselves and always pointing fingers"
good,"El ambiente laboral fluctua mucho, unos días está bien y otros muy mal. las hab. necesitan remodelarse, huelen mal y los huespedes se quejan mucho, influyendo esto en las evaluaciones y hasta en las propinas."
good,I worked in the breakfast area serving and setting up the buffet for the guests. I also stocked and cleaned after the service was over. I learned how to work in a hotel breakfast dining room. The management was great!  The culture was interesting! The hardest part was when you had everyone come in to eat at the same time. I enjoyed mingling with the guests and knowing what they liked or disliked.
good,"If you want a good head start in customer service, Marriott its a great place to start, but mind you it will take a while for you to get consider for advancement."
good,Une esprit d'équipe sein et tres valorisant et le client est le patron
good,"As a company, Marriott is great. Benefits, reasonable pay, time off, hotel discounts for you, friends and family. The challenges I found were based on lack of definition structure and job expectations. It isn’t always clearly defined what to do and who is responsible."
good,"Enjoyed seeing the customers satisfied"
good,I love to work here good people good service and Company and more good place to stay good service and overall it's a big hotel with good comfortable rooms and clean room
good,"This job is very organized , I love it. They have everything in place in order for you o complete your job on time. They have great food.The maintenance is very well taken care of."
good,"It might take a while to adjust, but its like that at any job. At least from my location are very kind people who only want you to succeed. Listen to the coaching and feedback. Don't feed into drama. Keep your head down and into your work. and you will do great."
good,"Daily check list in morning, pool and spa testing, guest issues over night to handle, set up work task check schedule for upcoming hotel needs."
good,Great company to work for. employers were very knowledgeable of their jobs.I would recommend anyone who would like to start a career with Marriott. I would work there again if given the chance
good,A very good company to work for. A lot of scope to grow for hoteliers. Have hotels all over the world. It is the largest hotel chain in the world with more than 3000 hotels across the globe.
good,"I worked for Marriott at two different hotels (Residence Inn and Towneplace Suites) over the course of multiple summers and during my time living at home with my parents in college. Housekeeping is what you would expect it to be: long hours, labor-intensive, not much recognition, and dirty. However, if you like to work alone/away from people, this job is right for you. You generally worked alone and had your own list of rooms to clean within a typical 8-hour time frame; however, this meant if you had 25 or so rooms to clean before your eight hours was up, you were hauling some you-know-what. Overall, it is a good job if you want a little bit more control with your hours and are willing to break a sweat."
good,"My job with a hotel within the Marriott Intl. umbrella was fine for a first-time manager.  I got experience managing employees, resolving guest issues, making decisions and learning the financial aspects of the industry.  The work-life balance could have improved, as I was working at least 50 hours per week, often times more, but I figure that is the industry sometimes."
good,Management is unreasonably strict for a slow night shift but the work pays fairly decent and the work is easy so its worth putting up with. Just don't get on your phone and you'll be fine
good,"Although working for the Marriott had many benefits, there needs to be more opportunities for employees to grow. The pay and hours were pretty decent."
good,Great fun place to work.Great career progression if you are willing to move out of the UK once worked here.Good team work and you are appreciated as an individual.
good,"I was hired as the Director of Advertising and PR for what was then Westin management and ownership."
good,I really liked working for Marriott and would go back except the lay offs during the slow times and having to work the holidays. Not enough hours so I had to leave.
good,Very good company to work with and the people are very friendly and hospitable. I have no complain about the company. The workplace culture is decent and friendly.
good,"Make it simple, but good ! Lots of customers in banquets and the restaurant for a small amount of cook/chef. So , there is no really fancy plate, but still good food !"
good,"Get to meet many different kinds of people, from different ways of life. Big on teamwork, steady work but some times tendious.  Hardest part is work working weekends and holidays."
good,Marriott is definitely a place I would recommend to anyone to work at. You feel like you are part of a family and everyone is always willing to assist and help with anything you may need. With hospitality you either have it or you don't. Taking care of guests is something I strive for.
good,"Rewarding interactions with people from all walks of life. Typical day involves making a difference in a person's day by providing customer service, knowledge of things to do and/or area, and being a part of a company that provides a home away from home."
good,"It’s good company to work just cannot balance your personal life with work loard .. and also depend on your dreams what you want to achieve in life , if you sacrifice your time to this company it will pay you latter just matter of your priorities..."
good,"Good company culture. Made their employees feel valued. Great hotel discount benefits and health care benefits. Long hiring processes, very strategic."
good,"For the most part everyone is friendly, welcoming, and helpful. There are fun quarterly gatherings for associates where you can win prizes. The General Manager (JC) knows most associates by name. (that is impressive)"
good,working for marriott is really fun you can start from the buttom and really climbed up to the top its just family matters happened to me.i can go back if i want to but for now i wanna try a different job to learn more.
good,"Beautiful place to work with a ocean view, excellent training for employees.good benefits and discount in hotel rooms.one of the best customer service."
good,"Ici, ma tâche consistait à la réception des hôtes, l'enregistrement des réservations d'hôtels, l'établissement des confirmations de réservations, recevoir, enregistrer et distribuer le courrier entrant. Durant mon séjour dans cette entreprise, j'ai appris à être organisée et j'ai également amélioré mon Anglais. C'est une entreprise qui valorise son personnel, offrant continuellement des formations afin de répondre aux standards internationaux; le repas était offert gratuitement et quotidiennement au personnel. L'aspect le plus agréable était le fait de contribuer à offrir un séjour mémorable aux clients et aussi de faire face à une diversité de de cultures"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at the Marriott, but in my job position I wasn't making enough (Food Running at one of the hotel's restaurants,) so I was forced to find new employment."
good,I enjoyed my time with Starwood. It was definitely a great company. The experiences and knowledge I gained definitely helped me prepare to advance in my career
good,"A typical day is doing daily paperwork, answering phone calls and helping guests with their reservations. The management is good, when they are there. There are times a manager is needed but they are not in the office, forcing the front desk staff to either handle the issue themselves or give the guest a business card. Sometimes you'll see the schedule with a manager coming in at one time but when you look again later the time had been changed so you can't promise a guest that a manager will be in at a certain time to deal with an issue. No matter how hard of a worker you are, there is lack of raises and advancement. The people you work with keep the day light and fun. Asking days off isn't usually an issue which really helps with work/life balance.You do have to work a certain amount of hours in a year to be eligible for any benefits."
good,I got promoted to front desk but getting the same pay as house keeping could be better if the managers would listen to their workers I feel i should get more then get
good,I love to influence studets with the exposure n skills that I had at Switzerland to our Malaysian students as I found Hospitality & Tourism Industry is picking up.
good,Customer service is key. Customer service keeps the guest loyal to the brand and returning for more service. The hardest part of the job is managing the minds of the staff to ensure the best customer service is delivered to each guest everyday that stay at our hotel.
good,"Supporting the Sales dept is fast paced and stressful. Good workmates mandatory for achieving success. Duties include a wide range: IT support, paycheck support, troubleshooting, etc"
good,The bottom line is extremely important here and its apparent.  The benefits are decent but hours can be given and taken away at any given moment if your services aren't considered necessary.
good,Great benifits! It was a wonderful learning atmosphere. It was certainly a place that I had to learn how to think on my feet and I was empowered to make decisions without getting approval first (within reason). Marriott is certainly about making sure the guest is happy and the associates are happy as well.
good,"Excellent place to work for, worked there for almost 26 years; friendly crew and management."
good,Marriott will offer a wide range of growth opportunity to its employees. Training and development to get to the next step is key to future success. Networking is also keep to great success and Marriott leaders are always there to help!
good,"With the particular hotel I worked for, the clientele could be very difficult. Marriot has one of the largest loyalty programs in the world which can create a whole other type of guest. But brand standards and staff care always exceeded expectations."
good,"Great organization, good training programs, provide 100% customer satisfaction, clean place, great food, great facilities, such as the gym, swimming pool, few restaurants, well trained staff, very clean, and always kept up with all the repairs. They provide an excellent management training programs and benefits."
good,"buena lugar para ir a trabajar, cobrar y listo.  tienes muchos beneficios si eres de planta no como eventual"
good,Great company to work for. Having benefits for the family is a necessity in today’s society.  Always room for advancement and always updated on policies and procedures.
good,One of the coolest jobs ive had so far rhey are very busy but somehow find a way to make it all feel magavke and the employees are welcome to soeak to management
good,It was just my career starting with Le Meridien Bangaluru and really I learned a lot through working with Le Meridien Bangaluru. And I found time to develop my career.
good,As a housekeeper there's just a lot work expected of us. There's a reason why people come and go. In a way it's good because those who want hours can work more.
good,Love working here because my GM is amazing and the crew we have is great we all work together. We have very busy days here. I love the guest that we have here it makes it a bit more special.
good,"wonderful colleagues at work very strict operation manager but helpful especially when you are doing your work carefully and to perfection,challenges a bit at work as usual but manageable"
good,"Work starts with setup as a banquet server. We carry all our decorations, utensils, and whatever else is required for the occasions. it takes about two hours on average to setup a large event. This time can be repetitive and exhausting if we are on a tight turnover. The employees are all from very diverse backgrounds, so it has its moments where there will be disagreements, but we all work it out as a team. You have to be very team oriented and ready to help guests at a moments notice. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with miscommunications with different departments that are involved with the banquet event. And the most enjoyable part would be the feedback you get from the guests and clients that enjoy your service."
good,"Welcome guests and escort them to their preferred seating"
good,"It is an interesting place to work for sure. Work can be much with patience with guests, and the pay varies. Management was great and same with the co-workers."
good,"Busy atmosphere, the different cultures of people who visit the city,.... It's a Joy working for a company that has such high standards . And has the ability to reinvent themselves."
good,"Great benefits within the hotel, also great team to work with, multicultural workplace and over all a great experience to get to know the hospitality industry as there is also cross training in various departments. Would recommend to anyone willing to gain knowledge and experience in hospitality and tourism"
good,I never worked for the marriott. I only worked at the marriott as a vendor. They were ok to work with. nothing to brag. some of the marriott locations are better than others
good,I had the pleasure of working for Marriott International a great company that believes in putting the welfare of their employees f first. Was very sad when I had to leave.
good,Marriott Reservation Center is a great place to work. They create a good culture for anyone that wants to work there. If you're an extrovert it is a great culture for you but also if you're an introvert you also will enjoy the culture as well. You are able to join in on activities and challenges the company puts out but you are also can just clock in and get your job done and clock out. Overall its a great ran company with great management that takes their job seriously.
good,"Nice place to work in. It is one of the best place to work in, The people working there are so nice and always willing to help you so there is a lot to learn."
good,"You must be able to multitask at a high level.  Also, it is imperative that close attention is paid to current events that will assist in the procurement of products."
good,A typical day of work is getting 16 to 24 rooms a day
good,"I lobed the place due to the fact that everyone was open to each others request  to finish a job more efficientky. Learned "
good,"I had a good experience working in the merriott, I learn arround my co-workers and managers to be a bether person and profecional, I felt good to be part of the latin culture in this community."
good,"Sodexho was a good company to work for in the stage of life that was in.  I had 2 young children which allowed me to work solely around their schedule.  The company was the food service for Morningside College.  I did the bookwork for them and was able to have the same schedule as the college.  It allowed me to have summers off and the same holiday schedule as the students. "
good,"Spent years with Westin in several cities.  Love the brand, and the pros outweighed the cons for me.  Hotel discounts are huge benefit for my family and I.  I enjoyed the pace most of the time, huge turnover with hotels and its hard to retain people."
good,"Marriott is a fair workplace that takes into account how their employees are feeling and doing, they treat all their employees like family instead of like just another employee."
good,"Working in a Hospitality is a great way to get into customer service. It is fast paced and the system is complex, you have to be able to multi-task to this job. Through this i was able to learn many things, and pick up skills I had no idea i was using."
good,"Great place. I would go back if possible. Great management, great coworkers, benefits are good. Lunch room had machines to buy stuff so you didnt jave to leave. Great team and trainings."
good,"Malta is great place to live and work, but only for a while. I would possibly stay at work longer, but there was nothing to do on the Island. "
good,"Good experience at this location and meet people from all over. Good work enviroment. The hardest part was just making sure every thing gets done on time, but the best co worker are always there to help."
good,"Hotels in Hawaii are it's mainstay.  I worked for two of the larger ones and there was always work for everyone who wanted it.  Working at a resort meant that the vacationers were always happy, it was a pleasure serving them."
good,I actually did not work for Marriot but directly for the owning company as a consultant for their renovation projects. Owners really liked my independent and honest advising. Had a good relationship and would not hesitate to work for them again.
good,"Overall, I would rate it as excellent. My work is exactly what I expected as listed on the job description. I'm having fun and working with other people and was able to develop further my skills especially in Housekeeping department. They are always open and supportive to their employees as they allow us to have a training to other department if we wish to be transferred to improve our skills. Hence, I am very satisfied during my stay at their hotel and given a chance, I would like to work and be part of their company again."
good,Love everything I have learned from this job. making sure the guest receive the service they need is the most enjoyable. Working with different people from different background have grown my love for people!
good,I checked people into their rooms and helped answer questions about the hotel or about the location of places to eat and activities to do. I like meeting new people.
good,"Work is good, as long as you do your work you will have no issues.  Many mangers but I've never had any issues with any of them.  Hardest part of the job are the varied shifts, good shifts are hard to come by and can take tens of years to get.  Therefore, many workers sacrifice a healthy work life balance."
good,I learned alot from management to staff it was fun always something to learn from for every bad it was mad up with positive out come didn't always agree with the things they did but always did my assigned duties
good,You learn a lot about yourself working for a place like Marriott International.  You learn about where you want to go and who you want to be.  In the process you meet amazing people.
good,"Work closing shift"
good,"considero que fue un hotel con muchas prestaciones, aunque el sueldo no era tan bueno, el ambiente era bueno en ocaciones  o no debido al trabajo, con constantes capacitaciones y cursos muy buenos."
good,"I don't think this will be the fairest review, the hotel I specifically worked at had communication problems and a complete disconnection between management and workers. I enjoy Marriott and working for them, the benefits were good it's just that a few people made working there difficult."
good,When I strated I was very young an ready to venture into the working world soon as I was in i stated making friend the money was really good I never wanted to live most of the people there were there for years I was able to take what they taught me an make it my own
good,Great company to work for! Great place to start your career in hospitality. I enjoy working for the Marriott. I learned the ins and outs of the front office duties and had plenty opportunities to cross train in other departments.
good,I sold tickets for the many live shows we had. It was nice being able to see some of the show that was running. I learn to talk to different customer.
good,It was a good working atmosphere but i want the experience of working in more places and also helps to develop my knowledge on the field .....it also helps to know about the different properties...
good,I have learn so much thing during my internship in this place. Everyone in my department is friendly and this company provide much benefits to their staff and trainee
good,Placing water for meeting guests and also any amenities for morning meetings. Breaking down rooms and setting them up for lunches or dinners provided by vendors.
good,Very positive and fun place to work.  Jobs in leadership became unstable after the merger.  Learned how to be a salesman.  I very much enjoyed my time working on the phones.
good,"I enjoyed my time here and learned a lot about management and the Marriott Company as a whole. The job itself was very stressful due to high turnover rates and many upset guests, which is typical of the hospitality industry. I enjoyed working with all of my employees and managers. There were many training opportunities available in order to better manage ourselves, our time, and our employees. The downside of working at a downtown hotel is that you had to pay for parking even to go to work."
good,"I had the greatest management team.  I learned a wealth of knowledge from all of them.  The job was physically demanding, with long hours, but the people I worked with made my day a success."
good,"Very nice hotel, clean and cutting edge excitement. Promotions are always from within the company. My advancement and direction was stopped by new management with different thinking and more of a financial focus than a hospitality focus."
good,"Great property, located on the Savannah River and historic Downtown Augusta. Home of MASTERS Golf Tournament  Great wi-fi and great working enviroment."
good,Marriott acquired Starwood in 2016. Starwood was an innovative company with some of the best talent i have seen.  Some of the culture is making its way into Marriott.
good,"The work environment was a great place to be. Management was ok a power struggle took place while working there. Due to the change over to a Union hotel. "
good,I arrive at 5 am and bring up supplies for the morning. I get everything set up for a successful morning. At 5:30 I go downstairs and get the food for the morning breakfast. Guest start to arrive at 6 AM. I greet them with a smile and make them feel welcome while explaining what is on the menu that morning .I clean up and keep food updated throughout the morning wishing everyone a great day as they depart. I also answer questions about the area if they ask. We close at 10:00 am . I then clean up and get the lounge ready for P.M. shift so they have a successful night..
good,"Marriott is a great company to get your foot in the door with. However, the Irvine Marriott has issues with understaffing and inexperienced management. But overall, it is a great place to work with great company culture"
good,Despite what all is said about Starwood I left because I didn’t like the amount of working alone I had to do I used to be able to consult with co workers and be able to enjoy being not so much as trapped as I was there
good,I liked working here for 16 years.  There are opportunities to advance.  It's nice because most people come in entry-level and work their way up.  The people are fun to work with.
good,I love meeting new co workers from different countries........................Meeting guests from different places is exciting too especially when the guest are frequent stayers. This company cares a lot for their employees.
good,Easy paced 89 room hotel. Mandatory 40 hours every week. Strict but fun management and kick a** coworkers. Friendly guests. By yourself most of the time with no problems.
good,"I did enjoy my time working at Merriott."
good,"we have a daily preshift where we give information to the assocites  daily. There is no such thing hard job , Managers are good, Cultures ifs great 3 different cultures I work with,"
good,"Overall the hotel has been a very busy environment to work. Sell outs and corporate management company changes have led to an even faster paced environment. There is a lot of positive to be said however, in that the staff really do give their all every day. And no guest is left unaccounted for."
good,"management is weak"
good,"Pleasant place to work  and  it feels like family. Everybody's looking at each other and it is always fun working in here.Problem may arise but everybody  were involved in finding a solution so that in the future, we know how to address a certain issue"
good,Very busy day is every day. I loved the job and the coworkers. Management was okay. Maybe needed attitude adjustment at times. Work life balance is impossible when working here. Things have changed recently. Benefits are great.
good,I absoulutely loved it ! You get a chance to interact with many people from diffrent places and diffrent ethic backgrounds . The food at sear is amazing but its a little over priced for me but hey if you got it spend it lol 😌
good,"I've learned a lot working here.  I've been in training to be ready for our Marriott turnover for almost 6 months.  However, this is an ongoing process with Marriott.  There is a more to learn with Marriott than anyone could foresee...  Also, becoming the Business Travel/Corporate Sales Manager had brought with it a good many challenges.  This position is more of on the job training than anything else.  The more I learn the more I realize I need to learn.  Very interesting and challenging."

Our guests are mainly business travelers, so we do have our regular guests. We also have a ton of guests who come to us for a conference or a special event. The best part of the job is my co-workers.

I learned how to check, how to manage and be succesful in that, how to finish in time when you have a lot of guests in hotel, my co-workers did same things well, we helped each other in any situations. The hardest part of this job was to prepare clean glasses, because you couldn't to make them all clean in time also we had to put all the bottles in minibars. There are 210 rooms and to fill all of this rooms immediately was hard. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people, to talk with them and to know something new. Also I met a lot of famous guy there."
good,"I had worked in the hotel industry for a while but was limited to the back of house areas.  This was a new learning experience and something I really enjoyed. With my background in management it was an easy switch."
good,"I started working for the Springhill Suites as a night auditor and did eventually move to front desk agent. I absolutely loved my job and I had planned to keep it for as long as I could. Unfortunately, there are negatives to every great job. While the management is friendly, they are easily bothered and there are certain cliques around the hotel that will make you  feel less than welcome. The pay is much lower than most hotels pay, and night audit is not paid anymore than front desk agent. The head housekeeper is someone to avoid. She is not a good person; as in, she is judgmental, rude, and makes the smartest person feel inadequate and stupid. She might even try to get you fired. But, those are small aspects of the job. The other front desk staff is wonderful, but again, there is a clique feel. The breakfast staff exceeds and the head breakfast person is just so wonderful and caring. And the other housekeepers and maintenance are usually very responsive and positive. Overall, this is a great place to work and I'm glad I had the opportunity."

good,"Great place to work. I love it here. I'm still working here and I love the people that I work with and the people that come in. Everyone is friendly and they work well with my life and school schedule. I work in the restaurant in the hotel. I come in, set up my station and do my side work and prepare for the shift. I serve customers, take their orders, serve them drinks, bring their food, run their payments, then clean up and leave for the night. Hardest part is our business is heavily affected by the convention center across the street. So when we're full I make good money and business is good. However, when there are no conventions during the off season it can be very slow. Overall it's a great place to work. You can transfer to different positions not just in the food and beverage department but others in the hotel as well. You can always pick up a shift somewhere if you're not making enough money. Good part-time job."

good,"Had a great work experience here, despite two hispanic women that caused drama on the daily. I spoke to both of my managers about sitting down and resolving the issues several times and nothing was done. Other than that, I was promised full time hours and for the majority of the time I worked at Residence Inn I did until business slowed down and everyone's hours were cut tremendously. For example, mine were cut in half. I went from a little over forty hours a week to less than twenty a week. I had my own apartment and bills to pay. I tried to hang in there for a few months, but I struggled a lot. This predicament made me see Newcrest Image in a whole new light. I was made under the impression that I, as well as my employees were cared for by our company and that was not the case. Everything else was perfect. I LOVED the work atmosphere and meeting new guests everyday. Overall, I do not regret my time working for Residence Inn."

good,"I have never done housekeeping before until I decided it might be convenient and good to apply at the International Courtyard Marriott in Morrisville NC. I have experienced the Marriott hotel brands over the years and considered it to be very reputable business, which made me comfortable and happy to join there team. The workers fit the international hotels theme since there are different ethnic backgrounds through out each department, and this hotel commonly have guests from all walks of life staying with us for mostly business and occasional leisure during holidays and weekends . A typical day is very busy giving the fact that this hotel is located a few short minutes from the airport. Most of the workers are trained in multiple departments within Marriott to keep production running smoothly, which makes this a highly team oriented environment. Management are fairly friendly and try to accommodate as best as they can even when staff is short often at times, also they reward there workers in a variety of ways, by giving incentives on your check or staff meals, local tickets to area events etc, also they keep the workers abreast of whats to come in coming weeks as far as occupation. Co-workers although different backgrounds are very fun,relate able and like family, they make the time your there go by quickly. The hardest part about this job is trying to keep up with the allotted time and getting down the dirty linen to the laundry attendant in a timely manner, That usually spells being behind which means being there longer then you'd anticipate (although this can be a pro for"
good,"Beautiful property, friendliest staff in Arizona, great leadership, always promoting within, and the management takes care of the staff.

Follow and complete direct recipes. Come up with new recipes. Hardest part of the job when we get extremely busy and overflowed with tickets and we run out of room to put our plates so trying to maintain perfection and efficiency is the difficult task, but the task still becomes complete when it's all said and done. Most enjoyable part of work was being able to work with a good group of people and become a team, plus the pool table in the break room was always a big plus for me."

good,"a typical day at work can be either very ruff with having 15+ full refresh rooms or some days are easy having 7 full refreshes. working there has shown me a lot of things, to cleanness to breaking things down to become more organized. the management their was fair, but in a way had somewhat poor communication as far as last minute notices of picking up more rooms for call offs. my co-workers was pretty cool. same time we got our jobs done and supported each other who needed help with their rooms after our own work was finished. the hardest part of the job is keeping track with time. you get so into cleaning the rooms and in your own zone you forget you only have a certain amount of time to full clean the room before it can be available to be booked. the most enjoyable part of my job was employee appreciation week, made the workers feel appreciated and special, felt good to be noticed."

Around 2am I start running my audit reports and then do any other reports management has left for me to do ( monthly taxes, ordering food for the kitchen, monthly inventory, payable accounts). Once the audit reports have finished I then print out receipts for the guests that are departing in the morning and pass them under their doors. Once I'm done passing our receipts I then start setting up breakfast and make fresh coffee. After all that is done I then do an inspection of the pool/courtyard area to make sure there is no trash or towels to pick up. At 6am I start closing my shift and count the cash drawer and make any safe drops that are needed. "
good,I have enjoyed my time at Marriott International. I have gotten a lot of experience in all areas of the hotel. I don't think that Id want to move up to management here though. Seems like the managers are overwhelmed. I get the needed time off and needed breaks. It s a paycheck!
good,"You work hard at Marriott but have fun working there.I learned to be flexible and willing to do more,with plenty of opportunity for advancement."
good,"A typical work day at the Marriott was alluring I couldn't argue with the view of Waikiki Beach right where I worked. Everyday I worked at the bar my duties included cutting garnishes, stocking the bar, prepping the back room and control inventory stock. Most of my customer service experience came from working in the hotel industry. Overall management was good, there were times when a certain situation would arise and they didn't know how to handle it correctly but overall experience was good. My Co-workers were always the highlight of my day we all got along quite well and always worked as a team to provide our guest with the best over all experience at the Marriott. The hardest part of my job was my work schedule because I was on the bottom of the seniority list I always got the hours that no one wanted so I worked nights weekends and even holidays if they needed me.

Management sets no limits on customer satisfaction and we always deliver. Gluten-free,Cajun,Southern, Authentic Italian you name it. Our team is like the colors of Benetton, very diverse and better for it. We all learn from one another. The hardest part is mentoring new personnel to our standard of cooking and most enjoyable part is mentoring new personnel to our standard. They get it when they see the customer smiling and enjoying food we have prepared from scratch. I love to get them hooked on doing things right everytime because that's who I am. The company appreciates it as well."

I met a lot of people in the field, I liked that aspect of my job."
good,A typical day at work as a room inspector was waiting patiently for the housekeepers to clean up the dirty room. As one of my responsibilities was to clean up on around 4-8 housekeepers in 1-4 buildings at times. when they are finish i would spent around 15-20 mins in the rooms to see if there are clean and nothing is missing from the room. when and if there was something i found missing/unclean i would have to ask the housekeeper to come back to the work and redue the things she missed.

good,"I learned about how hotel management works. As an intern, I made a decision to have my career in a hospitality administration.  I enjoyed interacting with guests and co-workers."
good,"I would work behind the bar and in the restaurant, I would also attend to room service. This was a great opportunity to work for a large international company, I enjoyed following the standards and Marriott code. This was a great place to work for, my co-workers and management felt like family, it was a strong team bond. This role was very demanding in regards to the hours and it was shift work. I did enjoy working behind the bar making cocktails and expanding my food and beverage knowledge. I learnt a lot about wine and finer foods. The most challenging part of this role was dealing with customer needs on the spot and maintaining standards with such a busy restaurant."

good,The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people from different parts of the world.
good,"deal with changes or additions a client may have to start their day, start set ups for the afternoon sessions, parties or other events we may have, or get preparation of equipment for the next shift. management and co-workers come from different backgrounds and cultures, in the beginning is better if you ask them or if they ask you questions to get to know them better. the hardest part of the job would be anytime you don't have an elevator and you need to get to your destination 10 or 15 minutes ago, the most enjoyable part would be lunch time where you get to spend time with others, catch up on the news, sports and other subjects, sometimes just getting off your feet will do the trick"
good,"answer phone calls"
good,"Management is extremely poor, they completely disregard any concerns an employee has and play favorites. Also very sarcastic, and not in the good funny way but rude. I never once took a lunch, don't know if they would take time off of my hours at the end of each week to make it look like I was taking lunches or what? But anytime someone would try to take a break or lunch it was almost a bad thing, like no one is allowed to break or lunch and somewhat even looked down on if you chose to break."
good,"A typical day at work would be go in clock in count the cash drawer follow the check list of things to do update the computer system. Check people into their rooms, check people out of their rooms. Give directions when they ask where certain places are."
good,I worked for Starwood for 10 years. I would stay with Starwood forever if I could. Unfortunately they left California and I couldn't go with them even though they offered. I will forever have a special place in my heart for that company.
good,That was my fist job in the hospitality field so basically I had to learn everything from the beginning. All the team is very helpful and understanding
good,"has its ups and downs, fast paced, good benefits and discounts"
good,"A typical day at work is checking guest into their rooms, taking care of any special needs they may request for such as a ride, or set up to deliver an amenity to guests depending on their occasion.  I have learned how to keep the guests happy or make their day better in the end.  management here is great, the managers actually help out and work with you if the lines are backed up, or if something needs to be delivered to a guests room.  We're like a big family here, everyone is friendly and gets along with one another.  There really isn't a hard part at doing my job.  The most enjoyable part of my job is sending guest home with a memorable stay and making them welcomed each time they do come here."
good,It was a place where there are opportunities to learn as long as you grab them and take responsibility of it.  i was lucky enough to have a supervisor who was so patient on my transition to becoming the best that i can be.

good,"Marriott/Saga gave me the opportunity to work in a contract food environment. I was employed in a Health Care setting. There was a learning curve for me to deal with special diets, patient needs and cycle menus. I managed a hospital cafeteria but responsibilities included tray line management and diet office supervision."
good,"As the Front office manager, mornings are always busy times of the day. This when you hear about all the problems that happened at night. All the room problems and all the problems with the late arrivals check in. Your day will be determined by what happened the previous night."
good,"A typical day included reviewing billing details and current accounts, coordinating services and guest-initiated responses among different departments, providing customers with high-quality service, and overseeing all guest interactions."
good,"Hospitality jobs are quite demanding of your full attention, time, energy and positive vibe. Our typical day at work starts with preparations, then starting opening procedures for the restaurant. Dinner service starts at 5 but usually gets busy around 7pm. The most challenging part for me was to focus on many things in the same time and set the priorities very right. We have to welcome each an every guest with the same service quality which gets quite hard when we have many guests in the same time. But the reward is to see happy guests thanking you with a smile on their face. Co-workers and managers are quite helpful and supportive. Whenever you feel like you are getting too busy there is at least one person around you to support. Especially senior management is very caring and understanding to the employees. There is a general culture of doing the things right, and keeping the customer needs in the first place which is the best thing I like about this company."
good,I really enjoy to work with the Marriott. I would like to develop my experience with other companies. And learn new job rolls.
good,I was responsible for making hotel reservations and providing efficient customer service. I learned many aspects of the hotel business in different locations across the world which were covered under the Starwood company. Management was fair and impartial to many of their employees. Many of my fellow co-workers were willing to help one another. The most difficult part came when the job recession started making the business for Starwood slower than usual. The most enjoyable part of my job was supplying customers with great deals for their future vacation and job related travels.
good,A typical work day for me starts by going in before clock in time and stock my cleaning cart for all supplies needed for the day. Then after I clock in I start cleaning the rooms I'm assigned for the day. While for the hotel I have learned to calculate the amount of times to be spent cleaning each room. The management team are very polite and helpful when needed. My co-workers are fun to work with and we so our best to help each other out when needed. The hardest part of the job is getting into the checkouts in the morning.The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to talk with some of the guest on the elevators.
good,"Only working for Marriott for 6 months, I had no real feel for the job except that it was important, (you represented the whole hotel) and provided every thing the day staff did and more. The hotel was new and the clientele was new. I enjoyed working overnight and management rewarded me right before I had to cut the position short and aid my mother whom had a terminal illness. I learned that you can have fun working by yourself yet miss being able to converse with people like day shifts do."
good,Working in the food and beverage industry equals long hours however the customer service skills I have gained and experience as a supervisor are irreplaceable. Room for growth was always available and concerns were listened to and addressed. The culture of the organization was positive and upbeat and besides the extremely long work hours I found the hotel business to be most enjoyable as I was able to learn about different cultures and languages from all my guests.
good,Working in an environment where you had to interface the clients is wasn't easy due to the fact that most of the time we were understaffed.Providing   good customer service and keeping up to date  with all duties was some achievement.
good,"I work the night shift, so often it is very slow due to most guest being sleep. Co workers and Management makes job easier due to the Family feel. Everyone is very helpful. The hardest part of the day would be the actual audit, making sure everything is correct before sending to the corporate office. The most enjoyable part of the day would be check out. To be able to interact with the guest is very enjoyable to me."
good,"clean guests' room "
good,Marriott's management style is good and empowering. The company puts a lot of efforts to develop its associates.
good,Checking People in keeps you busy you meet all kinds of different people from all around the world. When trying to get coffee made phone ringing and three people are wanting to be checked in at one time can make your eyes cross but its all worth it because you get to tell these people where everything is in your home town all the little things that only locals know about it so worth it.
good,"Executive Chef was tough but fair with everything in the kitchen."
good,"The service express department is responsible for any internal or external calls that are received within the hotel. As an attendant it is my job to provide outstanding customer service to our guest by anticipating and exceeding their expectations."
good,"It was enjoyable place to work,I had a chance to see big executives and famous people,expecially celebrities."
good,"Presently i am working as a similar role for Emirates Technical Associates where i am responsible for properly receiving, processing, filling and reporting all official documents.

We enjoy the intelligence of the customers while talking with them."

good,"Hard working employees.  Great learning experience.  Hard company to get a job with, but once your in there is great chance for advancement."
good,"salaries, however, unless you are in upper management are traditionally very low"
good,"Marriott is a great place to work. If you are able to grow in the company, it can be an amazing place to become a lifelong employee of. I have learned so much after becoming a supervisor. Inventory is the one thing I have developed and grown on my own but because of my manager I was able to learn the ends and outs. The hardest part of my job is not being able to move up because no one above me is going anywhere. The most enjoyable part of my job is coming in everyday to somewhere that is acceptable of who I am and who my employees are. They let us be ourselves and want to help us grow."
good,empowering environment that allows you to make decisions based on circumstance
good,"Management was accessible, helpful and effectively trained me in preparation for my position. I would answer potential guest calls and take reservations, convert inquiries to reservation confirmations upsell room types, and review daily reports for accuracy in Galaxy. I learned to thoroughly ensure accuracy of daily reports, conversion ratios, and all administrative work included in follow-through. "
good,a typical day consists of setting up banquet events set to customer and marriott standards. slight manual labor consisting of lifting tray up to 50lbs.

good,"I absolutely loved working at the Courtyard. The team, that was there, was like a family. we all worked so well together that things came off seamlessly, like a well oiled machine."
good,Every day was new. Learning existed on the fly. Assistant managers were consistently more competent than their overseers.
good,"Great benefits, everyone from management to co-workers we're wonderful. I left because I moved to a different state and there was not a Westin near my town."
good,I enjoyed working at springhill suits alot. A typical day at work was very intresting and very defferent each day. I would always check the paper work from the prior shift and begin the paper work with the other shift workers coming on to the shift i was working. I learned that everyday was a different day and also to be kind and a=have a smile on your face to everyone. My managers and other coworkers were a nice bunch of people i enjoyed working with them very much.The hardest part of my job was learning how to work a 8 hour shift which i have never done before but as i continued to do it i learned that i loved it. The most enjoyable part of my day with meeting alot of new people.

good,"In my tenure at Residence Inn, I was satisfied with how well of a job my managers did. They were always there to offer help and constantly recognized when someone did a good job or said thank you. Even if it was their required duty, the managers still showed appreciation and said thank you."
good,Being that it is a hotel on Mondays it is always busy and the guest will expect what they expect because they come to the hotel like every week and i have learned them by names and when they don't get there way that's when things don't go smoothly.
good,"En tant que Barman on desire faire des cocktails certes. "
good,I had a great internship with them. However they practically told me if I took the internship I would get a job. But after the internship there was no job. This was a problem with corporate and not the location I worked. The hotel I worked at was fantastic!

good,"Handles the financial side of the hotel such as running credit card settlements, posting room and tax, making sure all hotel revenue is correct, filling out standard DSR reports for the CEO.  I handle all complaints from guests all through the night in an appropriate fashion.  I also handle security which entails having people leave the hotel who aren't guests as well as evicting guests if they become too loud or disorderly."

The guest, who stays our hotels allways been taking care of their needs all their needs. checking guest out on their departures and taking reservation. Hardest part of the job that i do not want miss any of our guest leave unhappily from our hotel. The most enjoyable part of my job is, when guest comes to us and appreciate our hard work and be satistied with their stay."
good,"Any corporate culture is based on the type of people the company attracts and hires.  The culture at the Ritz-Carlton (Marriott Intl) is one of empowerment and trust, and just like in any organization there are people who will try to minimize your efforts and those that make you a rock star. "

good,"- Every day I need to be in charge of the enrolments results of the fidelity program SPG (goal of the day, monthly results, motivation of the team, etc)."
good,"Marriott is a great company to work for in general.  They have great core values and an awesome company culture.  However, working for them is not for everyone, as they can be unwilling and unable to provide adequate tech support for all of their employees who use computers, who have special needs. Their Adaptive Computing interface lacks.   As a result, you may be able  to do your job, but not in the most efficient manner which can be quite frustrating. It can be the difference between limping along, and running freely.  If you don't have special computing needs, then I highly recommend this company."
good,Learned a lot and would have liked to stay with the company.  An opportunity for travel came my way and decided to come to the USA.
good,"Loved working with a diverse workforce, which was a encouraged value of Marriott. Working in a fast paced and ever changing enviroment made tha tjob interesting and fun.  I went from never working in this field to a manager in 3 years.  Expectations of work were a bit extreme at the management level as 50 hours quickly turned into 80 hours expected a week and days off were non exsistant which ended up making the job into my life and gave no oppurtunity for getting a break which quickly lead to burnout."

I learned about communication, organization and to keep myself informed in orther to give the clients and the guest the best of the best. Manegment is as expected, hard working, strict, and with little room for dissapointements.  My co-workers are the best part of my job.  We are a family. Noting else matters, we keep each other alive in a harsh world that is the kitchen. The hardest part of the job is the hours, but they are necessary to keep you station ready and on point. My favorite part of the job is writing my menus for the A la Carte, and the days we get to present it.  I live for the rush of a busy service and a couple days off in between."

Les opportunités de développement et de management sont nombreuses car au Westin la priorité est la satisfaction du client qui passe par le meilleur traitement donné aux employés ainsi qu'une formation adéquate permettant aux employés de pouvoir relever partout les défis de leurs rêves."
good,Aprendi muito com o concierge de la que e o quarto melhor do mundo.E geralmente a empresa era muito boa.
good,"I was an intern at the Grand. My main job was being a server at the poolside restaurant but I also worked as a banquets server and in any other department they needed me. The hardest part of the job was being outside in the heat all day, the actual work was enjoyable and pretty easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with the various types of  guests at the hotel and getting to know them during their stay at the hotel. I learned a lot about the running of a restaurant, that it is a team effort and everyone has to work together and rely on each other for everything to run smoothly. We had three different supervisors who all had different styles of management but they all worked well."
good,"I loved working here. I learned a lot more about working in a team that I wouldn't have known otherwise. There were a couple bumps in the road, but I have learned a lot about myself that way. I made friends and made a better worker of myself."
good,"Marriott is certainly a benchmark provider of the positive guest/hotel experience. There is an evident commitment to excellence. The guests are amicable, the work is challenging and fulfilling. There are fantastic opportunities for advancement within the chains. The hardest part of the job is the 24/7 nature of the business that minimizes the ability to maintain work/life balance."
good,"orchestrating day to day operations from resturant to banquet functions, scheduling, payroll, banquet menus and production charts"
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy walking guest and dealing with guest complaints"
good,i will set up tables then organise cutlery and then i will attend to the customers with their meals an deal with any additional requests that they might have.

good,"I would come in  start the food for the 250 employees that ate in the cafeteria. My team cooked everything from scratch. We would have the food done and out in  time for lunch. After lunch we would begin prep for tomorrow. As anyone knows who works in a kitchen , all prep and little cooking!"
good,Front Desk at the Marriott Courtyard had plenty of duties other that check in and out. I was also the drivers for the shuttle and had to drop off and pick up guest. We would also had to delivery items and fix broken one because we did not have 24 hour housekeeping and engineering. Management was great and was very understanding about the problems we would address to them. The hardest part of the job was to juggle so many duties with just two front desk staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was the staff worked very well together.
good,"I would consider a typical day at work as different everyday. I have learned so much over the years about different food, cultures and people. If you go to the right manager, they are there to help you grow both personally and professionally. Just like there is a variety off guests it goes the same for your co-workers and I have had the best laughs with them. The hardest part about the job is being away from your friends and family on special occasions and holidays. In closing, the most enjoyable part about the job is the people you meet and work with."
good,"Great in working with single woman with kids."
good,I worked over night and never had an issue with guest. They made sure another person was working over night as well so I wouldn't be alone. The staff was great and the discounts were good as well. 
good,"It seems that almost every job I have had you have to be part of the ""club"" to have job security. What happened to working hard, constantly improving work performance, going above and beyond, and advancement?  The Company has excellent benefits and the compensation is great. But heed my warning, if you are not ready to brown nose your way to keep your job or to advance, do not apply."
good,"Working for a large hotel has its advantages. There are great benefits, 401k, pension, vacation and sick pay and good medical/dental. In my years there I moved up several times. I went from breakfast cook, to lunch/ pantry, to lunch-grill, expediter, hot prep, pm expediter, to steakhouse, purchasing. I became the only employee to know all aspects of the kitchen . This was useful in case of call-outs. and blizzard. "
good,"Great Staff, everyone is like family. we all help each other when its needed"
good,Good company to work for.  Many opportunities to learn new skills and interact with people from around the world.
good,"Excellente culture d'entreprise, idéal pour découvrir le management à l'anglaise"
good,"There is no typical day at work.  Each moment and each call is something in its own.  Management is great.  Your bonuses are based on your performance.  The most enjoyable part of the job is how quickly it changes from one moment to the next, while still providing and enforcing structure.  The hardest part is being auto-progressed.  Just when you feel comfortable in a department you are sent to the next."
good,"You will make life long friends. If you are open to new experiences"
good,"A typical day at work is meeting with the captain of the day when you first arrive and discussing the day's event and schedule, as well as everyone's assignments. We are given a BEO sheet, which tells us what the event is, how many people it is set for, what the menu is, and any other special notes we may have to use. I really like the organization management and captains have with employees. Giving everyone an assignment makes it easier for all of us and gets the job done faster. My co-workers are very helpful and they strive to work as a team and meet high expectations from our guests.The hardest part of the job I think would be is carrying heavy trays of dishes, food, and glasses. Sometimes you want to get your tables cleared fast, and so you pile up your tray until it is too heavy to lift. The most enjoyable part of this job is watching people dance at weddings and other events. I also enjoy eating the food on the menu for the day."
good,"Aside from doing all the par stocking and preparations for the operations, everyday has always been a new experience for me. I learned how to become an efficient and effective staff."
good,"In charge of food preparation and daily special for the pool kitchen."
good,The culture of the company is unique.  They have a great training program in the Global Source.  This is a great tool for all of its manager and associates alike.  The manager do their best to motivate and train at the same time at the Marriott Executive Park. The GM there was a gentleman by the name of Leon Cox which was the best GM I have ever had the pleasure of working with.
good,"All good except the salary"
good,"This place was a very nice place to work, but during off seasons I would find myself very bored and making no money."
good,"good brand to work in, its culture & values are in place and we have to follow it strictly.."

good,"2011-Present   Marriott Hotel"
good,Very Nice hotel and staff. They take pride in their company and their people.
good,Muy lindo trabajo ya que el horario me permitia dedicar mi tirmpo libre a mi
good,"I've been working for Marriott Hotels for seven years in total. I'm highly motivated, I started as a receptionist and progressed my career. I stepped up to a Shift Leader's position months later. When I returned from maternity leave I moved to the Royal Marriott as a Night Manager. Six months later I was offered a Front Office Management position at the City Centre Marriott which I accepted. The following year I moved to Food and Beverage department to expand my operational experience. I worked as an Assistant Food & Beverage Manager and unfortunately this position has been made redundant. I see this as an opportunity to learn new skills and utilise my experience."
good,"I was able to advance up the ranks to an assistant manager. I gained knowledge in the different concepts and this expanded my ability to become adaptable to changes throughout my years working here. The employees under my management were mostly teenagers, as I was in charge of the afternoon running of the plaza. Working here allowed for me to hone my skills in customer service."
good,Unos de los mejores años de toda mi vida laboral. un equipo fuerte de trabajo con apoyo constante entre trabajadores y supervision. La facilitacion y cooperación eran elementos fundamentales.
good,It was an awesome experience. Nothing can compare working in the HR department at the WCT Marriott.
good,Excellent experience..... loved the campus environment. I was responsible for 4 buildings. Very unique and exciting.
good,Overall is was great experience and I learned a great deal. Especailly in all aspects of Human Resources Management within the hospitality industry.
good,"My day-to-day activities included guest requests were taken care of and accommodations were made for any special circumstances. Working in a hotel setting has changed my views on how to handle everyday situations better and how not to ""crack"" under pressure. My co-workers and I made our work experience as enjoyable as possible. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a life outside of work because a hotel is open 24/7 and can be straining on your everyday life. I enjoyed this job because it stood over Atlanta. You can see the airport and even further. The view is an amazing one and made working there a treat."
good,"I really liked working at Marriott. Excellent teamwork, a great point to your resume. The salary could be better, but it was not important thing for me. Overall, it was great experience."
good,When I landed a job with Marriott I was thrilled. As a college student who is studying hospitality I have worked for this opportunity for a long time. My GM is very understanding and pushes me to improve the hotel. We review our GSS scores almost everyday which drives us to work as a team. There was also a fair amount of opportunity for cross training which I find valuable as I would like to continue rising up in the industry.
good,"Management has high expectations for employees and quality of service. I was able to learn restaurant's menu, system and sequence of service efficiently and quickly. I enjoy working as a team with all my co-workers. There is a lot of multitasking involved in my duo- positions, but I am able to handle it well. The most enjoyable part of my job is building friendships with co-workers and helping as a team."
good,"hard work, how to really clean a room, management was awful. my coworkers we`re ok. the hard part having 16 check outs. the good part meeting new people."
good,I was working in a 24 hour restaurant named La brasserie. co-workers are excellent. I like to work in this restaurant. Most enjoyable part of the job is may be when different festivals we did in the restaurant like Lebanese. And i think hardest part of the job is doing double shift ncontinuously two days. But overall management is good and work experience as well.
good,un rythme de travail soutenu mais très plaisant
good,"I worked Night Audit so I typically worked alone until about 5 AM. The job was easy to learn. The hardest part was the shift I was on because I had an infant at home so sleep was hard to come by, the best part of the job was knowing how to do the job and doing it well. Lots of quiet time which was nice."
good,"Exhibition days are long hour working days which we always have fun and enjoy working. I have learned/observed Quite a lot of skills like working flair, knowledge. the hardest part of the job is only when we have last minute changes for the events. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we have private parties and Vip reservations."
good,"Good company to gain experience and go further, but salary very low even if you worked for them before and did good progress."
good,"there r not too much pressure on work, but u can learn everything, down to bottom, if u work properly here u can work any other hotel with any pressure, good coworkers, each moment u can enjoy there r typical moment r there but that's fine, u can interestlly work there."
good,"some of the supervisor did nothing yet took all the glory. Yet again, expected to cover several position just about every day."
good,"aseo de las habitaciones , y aveces de los salones para eventos buen ambiente y compañerismo"
good,basically i get to work clock in put linen in dryer if anything needs to go in washer put it in washer if not fold the linen that`s in the dryer and wait till the throw linen in the shute separate it and once i have enough wash it same routine this is my first experience in housekeeping and laundry.i learned how to do things in a timely matter. managers are good i watch and learn from them and i know that i can become a manager.co-workers are fun to be around its all about team work with my team if someone is behind in their work someone will help who needs help. when we got 78 rooms and its one person in laundry and i gotta keep running from the shute to the washer to the dryer to folding back to the shute over and over and i am getting behind but i maintain that is the hardest part. the most enjoyable part is when i got one load in the washer and one in the dryer.
good,Hyatt has a great ability to employee staff that are in tune with the various business markets making specialized sales people whom form fabulous client relationships and steal the lions share of the relevant markets
good,-I make sure all of our Marriott Platinum Rewards members have a pleasant experience in the VIP lounge for the morning breakfast buffett rotation.
good,"Started with company in December of 1997 as a Cashier, was promoted to store Supervisor in January 1999. Effectively managed the daily store operations, including customer relations, staffing, scheduling, loss prevention, inventory marketing and merchandising. Handled cash, store closing and maintained closing reports. Also trained new employees on services"
good,Everyone is friendly and works as a team. They are always willing to work around your schedule.
good,"Working at 500 south bar and grill was a great experience all the way to the end. It was a very healthy environment and the staff worked well together. We had daily meetings to ensure that all ran smoothly. The biggest part that made this job feel at home was the food and beverage manager. He has to be the best most organized manager that I have had to date. He cared about his staff and it showed which made us want to work harder for him. The kitchen staff was also a bute. Always prompt and perfect food. Like a well cogged machine. The hours were hard but that was just because of my school schedule. Besides HR putting their hand into the restraunt and making it harder for us to do our jobs, and them having us to answer to them verses our own managers, then it was the perfect place to work. i would work for 500 south agian."
good,"It is an excellent job to have if you are a people person. You will receive a lot of one on one customer interactions. Management at my particular property are pretty decently, though they can be a little standoffish and micromanage a bit."
good,"Perfecto para trabajar agusto, un poco estresante pero muy ameno."
good,"My morning started at 8:00 a.m and ended at 3:30 p.m. My duties was cutting grass, driving the truck to diffferent spot on and off the job."
good,"As a Residential Aid, it is my job to make sure students who attend Mt. Edgecumbe boarding school stay in line with department of education standards."
good,"The property I work for is a franchise property but I enjoy working here. I have been here for a while and received promotions. I love my coworkers, they are very friendly. In the sales department the most difficult part is keeping up with budget expectations once business slows down. During the end of the year when business is slow employee hours are cut back."
good,loved the people i worked with just didnt want to do it as a life career.
good,Old hotel all associates are local.But still Marriott good to work.
good,"Working with Marriott in Cork city is a great experience flexible hours and excellent multicultural environment nice place to work. My job includes provide information about hotels, room types, I have learned that hospitality job is much more than claning rooms and making beds, with Marriott everyone is equal that makes it enjoyable."
good,"I learned a great deal from the Marriott, they taught me how to be a better leader and person. The associates I worked with where great they took hospitality to a whole new level, a lot of them have been there for years some have been there since the building first opened."
good,"Everyone is really respectful and it makes it easy to get along with them all, because of this, it makes work a fun environment to be in ."
good,- Très bonne formation
good,"working here is like working at the best hotel in key west. grate servise, fun and flerty guests and lots of tips."
good,I wouldn't have lasted here six years if I didn't find something oddly appealing about this little extended-stay hotel. It was like working at home...except in a fest.
good,"Trully a great place to work! Excellent benefits. Really in-depth training; they expect alot from you but they prepare you to deliver what they expect. They go out of their way to care for their employees. They say there's an open door policy and there is; sometimes management will claim this because it sounds good but then never deliver. This wasn't the case there. The only dowside would be being tethered to a cubicle for practically your entire shift; even bathroom breaks are kept track of. However, if you can handle that, it's an excellent work environment; one of the best!"
good,"Great company to work for,it taught me alot about sales,and gave me alot of call center experience."
good,"Great management, Customer Service and Workplace. Somewhere you can learn to express your skills and improve them. Somewhere you feel like family."
good,"Overall, this job introduced me to Hotel Management, It allowed me to travel, and learn about Hospitality all over the country"
good,"started as a restaurant lead and really liked it, again, it was hard to advance and would love to stay if i had opportunity, Portland was very limited to moving to higher management so my family and i moved to Arizona. would recommend to work for this company."
good,according to me working in marriott is good for an individual to develop his or her personal and professional career but the h.r policies are quite lazy but i have learnt a lot of things related to my field in that property my co workers were very good.the most enjoyable part of the job was to interact with the guest personally
good,Working for and with Marriott International for the last 19 years have been amazing journey. Not only did I enjoy serving my internal guests but also my external guests.
good,"Totaly Loved this Job but I was not making enough money to cover my Bills, Needed to find something that paid better"
good,Respectful and proffesional atmosphere. Good benefits and incentivs
good,"A typical day at work begins with a rooms meeting with all the executive staff of the hotel including the General Manager. Next I would pull reports on schedule customers to review any VIP members or guest that required express check ins, upgrades on room types. Next, meet with front desk agents and brief them on those members and any related information needed to be passed onto them from the rooms meeting. Depending on the day of the week, we did what we called ""set the house"" for any up coming events for sold out dates. Which included corresponding with the reservation department supervisor on room availability. The hardest part of the job was transferring customers to other hotels on sold out nights, or not having a certain room type form customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting the cast members of Walker Texas Rangers and being able to get on the set."
good,Job was fun and enjoyable loved the travel perks Would have stayed with the company longer was let go do to a layoff
good,"Head cashier for all departments also did front desk. Learned how to do adp. I was accounts payable, did payroll for the hotel."
good,"I learned how to plan and work "" working hard is not matter working smart is good"""
good,"Must be very customer service oriented, learned to deal with many different personality types."
good,"Prepared deposit....distributed tips/due backs...then posted invoices, made change...audit banks. Once a week did a check run. Reponsible but not limited to all account payables duties. Management and co workers would rate average. Job was not hard..but if i had to say what was the hardest was meeting close out for the month..making sure banks were audited and all invoices were posted."
good,Able to meet all types of great people. Have the best benefit for employees. Work alone side of great co-workers.
good,"Typical workday consists of preparing journal entries, analyzing and preparing reports. Learned the hotel business. Management treats employees fairly. Co-worker work together to reach goals. Hardest part of the job is not being utilized to my full extent."
good,"I learned a lot from this job. First, the orientation for new emplyees was very good. It provided a lot of information to me. Second, I like the work atmosphere that everyone helped each other and everyone respected each other. Third, the educational plan for employees was wonderful. We had a meeting every month and employees had chances to do presentations or express their thoughts by talking to supervisors and managers. I think the team work in Westin Hotel inspired me the most."
good,I'm a home based employee. I run morning reports and look over my schedule for the day. I'm usually out in the field at different apartment communities. I have learned how to work from home which I thought it might be difficult. My managers have been great to work with. They have provided guidance and have been there to answer questions. Working from home however can be hard at times with communicating with my home office. They forget about you and may not pass on valuable information.

good,Great company to work with. Fun and good career growth. The experience will always be different at Marriott.
good,"I work at the Austin call center off Cameron as an in house agent. The first thing to realize is that you will start with the company with the latest shift (until 1:00 A.M) and work most weekends and until you get enough time in, most holidays. There are a lot of chances to change departments because the turnover is so high. Most people want a daytime shift so they can be with their families, etc. but the young people who love to stay up most of the night and sleep late into the morning will adapt easily.Your calls will be monitored and scored. You must follow the format or not receive a bonus. There are opportunities for over time and the management seems to care about people by providing the in house agents lots of fun things to do. I think the insurance and benefits are good."
good,"While working at the Westin Hotel I had a very positive interaction with all the staff, they were friendly. The job also had great benefits.I learned great personal skills like leadership & teamwork ethics that made my experience at the Westin a constructive one."
good,"I woked at Austin Marriott North. It was a very interesting experience. It was my first time ever not working in Banquets or Restaurants. I was a front desk supervisor. They really gave me an opportunity to really learn and test my ability to manage a team and still maintain exception guest service. It was a very humbling experience and it gave me new respect for what the front of house does. I moved from that position to an Assistant Banquet Manager position, which I was far more in my element. The hotel was very understanding that I was always wanting to move to the banquet team and when the opportunity arose, they really supported me."
good,The Marriott was an experience! I enjoyed working there. All the staff was great. Could have got paid more. Loved the environment and the assistant managers

good,"El trabajo es fuerte y exigente, pero muchas veces no tienen las herramientas necesarias para que el empleado pueda hacer su trabajo correctamente. Según las leyes laborales de Chicago y la empresa, el empleado tiene derecho a 30 minutos de almuerzo y 30 minutos de break (divididos en 15 minutos), pero el trabajo era tanto que difícilmente se podían tomar los breaks. A parte de eso, el personal era muy amable y respetuoso. Mi experiencia con ellos, a pesar de todo, fue buena y volvería a trabajar con ellos, si solucionaran esos detalles."
good,Great company to work for however it is difficult to move on. The culture and coworkers are the best. The only reason I left was because of a higher pay opportunity.

good,"Ho trovato un bell'ambiente, nonostante il lavoro fosse sostanzialmente solo di parcheggiatore, portiere e usciere. Gran professionalità e regole ferree: dove ho lavorato non erano ammesse barba e capelli lunghi, quindi ogni mattina dovevo farmi la barba con la lametta (il rasoio elettrico non era abbastanza: se pensavano avessi usato solo quello, ti rimandavano indietro con un kit da barba e dovevi farla al momento). "

Just wished i had more of a morning schedule to comply with my schedule with my toddler."
good,"Working in a position dealing with customer service is bound to be stressful at times. The environment at the Marriott was rather friendly. It would get rather busy around holidays, but nothing too much to handle."
good,Great place to work as Front desk management is very professional. The Hotel Proprietary system is so old you need a week training to learn it which mostly uses the keyboard unlike newer systems.  The best to learn how to work the ins and outs of the system is to work Night Audit. The duties you do actually demand effort and brainwork unlike other Night Audit jobs where you just stare at a wall until morning. This place will teach you the sense of urgency and vastly improve your organizational skills.

good,I have learned so much in this Company I have never experience such work but I have learned so much in this Job. Specific to general . Positive and negative. But both are essential. It was a noce experience working here its hard but I've learned more about being a harworking person.
good,working with Marriott was a great experience but due to some unforeseen circumstances I have to change my job and this is a decision from my  employers
good,"Very corporate atmosphere. The culture of Marriott is largely dictated by the location you're at. They are very strict on clocking in/out, dress policy, etc., but the benefits are amazing and you can't find better job security."

good,It was a great job to have. Work with amazing people and the management busts their butts along side you. They also go out of their way to take care of their employees. We'd sometimes have to work through lunch and they would always order food for us if that was the case. We were well cared for. Only issue was we were poorly staffed and the few of us couldn't keep up.
good,A typical work day was to park cars and to retrieve cars. I also gave directions to customers who was not from town. Work days could be long and will be on your feet for a long period of time.
good,Report to my supervisor at the front drive way then proceed to ask the doorman if it's any car need to be park after I have parked the car come back to the front drive way and get in line of the valet area to wait for my turn again.
good,help me learn about Hospitality learn more about customer service and how to carry myself around people also how to treat customer's on a daily Basis a good place to work
good,"Overall this was a good job. It was hard and you have to stay on task while sometimes having to speak with guest. A typical day at work would be cleaning all twelve rooms that you are assigned to do. The management was not the best, but not all of the management was horrible."

good,"I'm not even sure why it is having me write this review but, usually work was relatively laid back. We just brought the buffets out to, usually business people having conferences; we would bring them breakfast, lunch, and an afternoon snack. At that point, my shift would usually end (about 4:00 - 5:00) The dinner or evening events was a different shift. I worked those too, particularly for large events like weddings, but mostly the morning shift."
good,"Great Company Nice Property Good Benefits/ Great Business Model and Good management team and very cordial team members"
good,Staff and leadership were very supportive. They made it fun to come to work with special events and daily activities. People were great to work with. They provided plenty of support and training.
good,Really needs to have Supervisors do their job.  Lacks in being responsible for all shifts.A lot of time I'm doing 2 ppls job and getting paid for one.
good,"Marriott is a big company, with many sub section parts I was working for one of the sub section parts that probably did not receive the full Marriott experience"

good,Marriott is a great place to work. Great environment.  I would still be there if I had not got sick. The employees are great they work as a team. Each month the company gave lunches.
good,"Dengan Hormat, "
good,Not at this time.  I would overall rate this a good place to work as its easy paced and its a big company.  Some of the negatives is that the hourly staff is treated better than the management.
good,"Very nice work culture and balance of work-life. Completed daily paperwork, weekly payroll for over 30 associates, and weekly scheduling. The most difficult part of the job is ensuring we have a positive work space and associates are working as a team to reach the common goal of the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture and the small employee appreciation events. All employees want to feel valued and little gestures throughout the year goes a long way to help build teamwork and the workplace environment."

good,very fun place to work. nice and friendly. Had company parties with food and drinks. employee of the month awards. get time to be around the same people everyday
good,I have enjoyed my years at working with Marriott but I would like to relocate and start a new opportunity. Working in a hotel is very rewarding but also takes a lot of hard work and LONG hours. I do not have the perfect work/life balance I would like to achieve. I also don't make enough money to live a productive life outside of work. I enjoyed the people I worked with though and the management is getting a lot better. You can make great tips and they do fully believe in career advancement and promoting associates within the company which I love.

good,"While working as a reservation specialist, the atmosphere was fantastic. This was the first 3/4 of my time employed. I then shifted to maintenance. My boss didn't know how to supervise. I also believe he was intimidated by me, maybe because I was 15 years older than him. I heard through the grapevine he was fired several months later."
good,"Marriott International offers Good pay and room discounts,,.. Checking In and Out guest some guess are jerks but others are ok. Management good as well ."
good,A lot happened in the kitchens. Coming from a professional culinary background I was not the biggest fan of how some of their food handling was practiced. Food has to be out of the kitchen is under 5 minutes or it is considered late. If you work here consider it fast food.
good,"Productive and fun workplace with a lot of good people and a family atmostphere that makes work it fun to come to work each and every day ,It can be hard but fun at the same time!"

The Bistro manager is easily accessible and wants you to succeed. Front Desk staff is ready and willing to support you whenever you need a favor -- anything from a five minute break to use the restroom to helping you decide whether a guest wrote down a 4 or a 9 in their room number. The General Manager can sometimes be a pain, but she is a great manager and does what she can to make sure everything is running smoothly and everyone is happy."

Also you have to have the Duster, Queen sheets, King sheets, double bed sheets and pillow cases it's a lot of work.next you have to go check your list to see what rooms need to be cleaned there two sections there are check out and they're occupied you have to make sure you get every room. sometimes customers will come out their rooms when they're see housekeeping to ask them for more towels or anything they need but it's hard work I enjoyed it and I had fun at my workplace."
good,In this business it's all about the team you're surrounded with. From mgmt to sales to housekeeping. all are very important for your hotel to be successful.
good,"To be completely honest. If I weren't in my current position in the bar, I may not stay. It is because of the high hourly combined with tips, that I do well financially. I would not want to be a manager... I make double what they make and work a literal fraction of the time. Stay in the tip based positions and you will be happy. Never become salary... Some managers have (to my face) told me that they are going on 24 straight hours of work. And Marriott gets away with it because of how they structure break periods etc. However, this is because of the fact that some managers care more than others. If you always just say, ""yes I will do it"" -  then you will be over worked. If you stick to your guns, I've seen multiple managers leave/go home (pretty much all at once, from different departments); and leave the rest of the responsibility to the few that are devoted kind managers."
good,"If you are looking to stay busy all day, working here is for you. You meet new people each day and the is always the need to help, with is so rewarding. Management is usual good and you can always rely on someone to give you a helping hand."

good,"I worked a couple night audit shifts as well as a couple PM shifts at a wonderful, unique, historical propoerty in the downtown area. Even tho it ended so abruptly and not in any way I could have thought of due to outside circumstances, the management company along with the brand standard of Residence Inn/Marriott, it was not just a job. To me it was not just something I had to do, it was walking in to a family. Whether it be fellow co-workers or even guests, I felt proud to be there and offer my ethics and knowedge yet eagerness to learn. The work was thorough and routine; no surprises from upper management or even upper management not hovering over ones shoulder. It's a great feeling when one can find employment at a business where one feels of wortt, trusted, and valued."

I'm talking 12 hours a day in the sun just blazing. The hotel didn't provide fans for the first 7 months, only had one computer for a super huge and busy rooftop bar for all servers.

Between the regional sales leader, GM and AGM there is always someone available and happy to assist you.  The only reason I am transferring positions is the work hours.  You are required to work 52.5 hours per week in this position.  My work life balance is tilted in the wrong direction right now and I just want more personal time.

By far the worst aspect was a new management company selected by ownership coming in and eliminating positions and replacing positions with their internal candidates. Sadly, I was one who's position was eliminated. If it wasn't, I could have seen myself there for several more years. There is a good core team in place, especially on the culinary end."

Marriott unfortunately, withheld a large amount of information in regards to the changes it intended to implement after acquiring Starwood. However, I cannot say it was a wholly bad experience.

Taking tips was discouraged, but a lot of people wanted to tip me (and I may have taken a few). Schedule was alright. Night shift is terrible, but other guards will often help out and fill in if there's a good reason you won't be around. The bar on the main floor of the hotel ensures that you will probably see a few interesting things and will probably have to escort a few people out (beautiful undressing women, druggies in the bathroom, pot smokers on the balcony, rowdy drunkards, etc.)."

The management and staff are all so very friendly and willing to help you if you have any questions and what not. The culture of the job is demanding but also guaranteed to benefit you in many ways such as developing patience and doing the best you can to help satisfy the customer. The hardest part of the job was to be able to recognize the customer's needs and help them immediately. This was hard because many times we could not help the customer right away or appeal to their circumstances. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see a customer satisfied with your service and work you have put into your job."

The pay could have been more seeing we deal with locations world wide and have to navigate from multiple programs to ensure we are booking the consumer in a hotel that has availability and in the correct area they are looking for either business, pleasure or for a convention. Listening is a big part in your role cause every detail comes in handy and avoids the guest from repeating themselves multiple times"
good,"I took this as a second job. I liked it overall, but the workload was much worse than other serving jobs I've had and the pay was worse. Pay was also much more variable than other serving jobs. The management team was fantastic, and so were the benefits. Permanent, full-time workers get a full benefits package."

The staff is so nice and they really work with you. The hardest part Ive found in this job is that as you advance you will end up with alot of down time between calls. It sounds nice at first, but the time drags by if you cant occupy yourself. The only other downfall is how hard it is to get an earlier shift once you move up."

good,"After working for Cabana Beach club, i have met many wonderful and important faces. Coming to work every day wasn't so hard because i had the view of the ocean the whole time.Members who have been there for 25 years or more knew me by name and preferred my service a lot of the time. The club felt like a home away from home.A lot of members have known each other for a long time and the same goes for couple of employees there. I enjoyed working with my coworkers there.Over time they became close friends of mine and remain close friends until this day. I also have a couple members that check up on me from time to time. The hardest part of the job was working with such low staff during high volume season. That mainly was determined by management, and recruiting new employees seemed like forever. I would say that the Management at the time of my employment could have improved. Management made promises to the members and staff that major renovations were taking place over winter break, and once spring came back around they promised that the club would look completely different. Unfortunately management skipped a couple steps and realized they were not able to carry out these promises and kept on telling members that these changes were coming soon, but in reality nothing was changing. Overall i loved working at Cabana club i just wish management could have gotten it together."

My co-workers are team players who will always go the extra mile to make sure our hotel is in order, however, management can be a little unfair at times. The hardest thing about my job is that I have to work fluctuating shifts, and I would rather work a set shift with weekends, or at least Sundays off.

As a young adult growing up, I learned a lot about Marriott International, the hospitality industry, how to handle numerous responsibilities at once, dealing with guests, and learned a lot about myself. My co-workers helped me learn more and more about the industry and trained me to better myself for the long run within the hospitality industry.

good,"good company to work for only it is union and never worked for union before and had many rules to follow, treated worker fairly and fairly."
good,A typical day at work is starting off setting a goal for yourself on how many calls you will make into a sale. Practice one of the things you aren't good at with your supervisor. The hardest part if any is dealing with the hotel workers that don't want to help the guest out as much as you do.

I had never worked for a company where everyone got along and training well I started in the Ventoso restaurant filling the buffet working the omelet station, prep work, stocking, and anything else that was needed. then off to banquets for bulk prep, from searing and grilling chicken, filets, durock pork chops, to making risotto and all orther things that I had never even heard of I was in heaven loving every minute. Now I became the lead cook for room service and the Harvest restaurant helping with interviews learning menu development individual plating something I was not quite use to even though I thought otherwise, boy was i wrong. My plating got better over time and one year later I became a culinary supervisor and took part in our charcuterie program where I learned to make our pork breakfast, italian, cheddarwurst, and andouille sausages. Plus house made canadian and regular bacon. Now I spent most of my time working with my team and keeping them on their toes with the menus that I write showing them how these things all tie together with my orders.

Would trouble shoot or problem solve issues with the guests. Depending on the shift the calls maybe back to back or slow. I also got to use my creativity on small projects thought up by me or my supervisor. I learned about a lot of great hotels and how to read people's needs when it came to what they were looking for. I loved my supervisor and all the people on my team, coming to work was always something to look forward to. The hardest part of the job to me was getting those calls when someone had lost a loved one, I did my best to help them find what they were looking for and offered my most sincere condolences. There's not a lot of comfort that can come through a call like that, but most people appreciate that you did try. The most enjoyable part about working at Starwood I would say was the people. When you spend that kind of time around people, learning, helping, and sharing tips together, you build up a comradery, It's not easy to say goodbye when you never really wanted to go. Working for Starwood Hotels & Resorts was a great experience that I will not easily forget."
good,"This is a tough industry and almost everyone has to start out at the bottom and work their way up unless they have family in upper management.  This is an excellent company to work for if you want to develop yourself in the hospitality industry and not afraid of long hours, taking a lot of responsibility, and getting the job done no matter what it takes.  If you are aggressive enough to knock out obstacles (e.g. powerful, immovable 100-year industry veterans, aggressive cost cutting due to low room rate even at max occupancy, and rapid turnover in some departments) while at the same time putting your best foot forward for guest service and keeping good working relationships with the rest of the team you will do well in this company.  You will get knocked down by failures no matter how good you are and you will need to get back up again or you will not survive.  Sometimes, you will think you are doing the best job in the world and then you will be torn down to nothing for something completely out of your control.  You will be surrounded by excellent role models and top-notch colleagues in many fields. It may be difficult to make a living if you are working at the hotel-level and not in a union or high-level management."
good,"Wonderful company to work for with lots of opportunity for growth. Only busy when groups are in house. Marriott puts their employees first so that in turn, the employee delivers exceptional service to the guests."

good,This is my first time working night audit and it has been a pretty good experience so far.  I tend to get more things accomplished at night and the training for this job wasn't difficult.

Even when traveling to other Marriott locations the other employees really make you feel like you are apart of a family.
good,Nice Hotel and  nice co worker I gained additional experience.
good,I Learned quite a bit about what was expected from me as an Associate. I Love working with customers and people in general so It was also a fun-filled experience. I Just regret not answering my last 14 questions that would have brought my average grade higher and I would have passed or had the opportunity to re-take my Mid-Term Test.( I feel that was something that my trainer /supervisor (Brett Mayberry) could have stressed a lot more.!!!!!!!!
good,"Convenient working in Galleria Mall.  Management was great at the time, advanced within company. Co-workers great as well, meaningful relationships made."
good,Fun nice place where you interacted with different people. I learned how to treat customers and how to satisfy their expectations. It was a short volunteer but is till got to learn what each person the hotel did and how to handle the front desk. I loved working front desk and getting to meet different people. It is hard when you have to work front desk and it is full but once you learn you get the hang of it.

good,"I enjoyed working for Starwood.  I had the opportunity to open the W Hotel in Boston, participate in the Associate Development Program, and I was given many responsibilities related to training of new associates/managers."
good,"Marriott In housekeeping is a experience, you have a set day schedule but not weekly you have an option to request off but at the end of the day it is just a request. the coworkers in the Housekeeping department are at times childish the do things like play around and the take things from others cart and run in and start snatching and pushing but its never everybody. management there is not fair they do not listen to you half the time and when they do they change up your story. a learning experience from housekeeping just do your job and at the end of the day you will be just fine and make sure to have a smile. An enjoyable part of my job is just knowing after i clean a room how happy the customer is going to be. That's really all I want to do is make the customer happy. So at times dealing with the ladies that do weird things its worth it when a customer leaves me a note thanking me for my service. I do enjoy my job."
good,"Great place for entry level sales."
good,"One of the best college employments Ive had. Opportunites to work with all types of job titles, such as bellman, front desk agent, and concierge, all in one day. upbeat coworkers. Wish i couldve stayed but needed to pursue higher education after my Bachelors Degree."
good,"A typical day at work would include answering phones, booking hotel reservations for guest and assisting them with their membership accounts as well as advertising promotions, building customer loyalty, sales, and cross selling to addition properties based on guests needs. The service culture is better than any company I've ever worked for, because when learning how to build loyalty with guests, we are actually taught the importance of personal connections and how it affects us in everyday life. My co workers are friendly and always willing to help with questions or information that I may not know, but there is also always an assistance line to call if I am not able to access an immediate answer for the guest through our learning center. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with irrate, rude or nasty guests, but just like any field where you deal with customer service, it's all about finding a solution that makes sense to the company and makes sense for the guest. I also know that as long as I service the guest to the best of my ability I can enjoy the fruits of my labor, having the opportunity to bonus every month. I'd recommend Starwood hotels and Resort to anyone interested in Customer Service/Relations and the Hotel industry."
good,Hours were always standard. Management was great and days went by quickly

good,"a typical day at work was very busy, sometimes calm. i learned to work and a face pace business. i learn that practically being in charge of your own store space wasn't very hard to do. My co workers were very nice to work with. And we were all there for the same reason, to make guest happy. The hardest part of my job was i had 2 days of gravyard shifts and trying to stay up most of the night. The most enjoyable part of my job was just being there able to help people out as much as possible and selling items that they wanted. I really did like my job at the time i was there, it just didn't pay enough. So i transferred to the warehouse part and started delivering the products that was being sold in the shops. It paid alittle bit more but it was alittle bit more work. I got sick after being there for a while and had to resign."
good,"A day at the hotel will be filled with lots of hard work. You will meet someone new every day people working in the corporate sector. The management is about what you'd expect working in the hospitality industry. The hardest part about the job is the continuous heavy lifting and moving furniture. The best part about the job is the experiance of interacting with the patrons you'll meet people from different walks of life, and set up rooms from conferences to sporting events.

good,I learned a lot being a front desk clerk for the summer. They made sure that my training was full and informative. I got a lot of on the job training but there was a standardized program as well.
good,"A typical day at work here was always fun from the staff to the customers. Ive learned Professonalism, punctuality. I really worked with a great group of people everyone was professional and encouraging. I would say the hardest part of the job was over booking and the most enjoyable part is working with the people"
good,"Marriott is really a great company to work for. Personally, only downside is having to work holidays. Working in the call center can become a little routine. Marriott does do it's best to keep it fun by providing food, raffles, and contests."
good,Certified Kaizen Facilitator
good,"On a normal day I start my day with a pre-shift where management discusses what is going on that day, I find out what groups are in house and what the key points of their stay are so that I can ensure I do eveything possible to make them feel welcome and comfortable. Everyday I meet with my managers and every week we discuss what our scores are and what we can do personally to increase them to meet our company goals. My co workers and I work very closely to ensure we communicate our guests needs and maintain structure so we can accommodate them as best as possible. The part of my job that may be challenging is our software that we use, it can be slow at times which may be a time consuming process for data entry. Although during that time i've come to embrace that time issue by conversating with the guest which allows me to personalize my experience with them and that is something that is important to me for their arrival experience."

Management was always available to you even if it was a phone call away. The hotel was always busy but when you had to walk someone to a different property that could get difficult didn't happen to often but was difficult when needed to be done. There was wonderful teamwork if you need a break of help your co-workers were there to give that helping hand.

A atuação comercial era no Sul de Minas, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro e São Paulo;"

good,This was a wonderful place to work. I think the pay was less then it should be.
good,"My time with the Marriott International Hotel company has been a pleasant one and sometime a rocky experience. The work has been pleasant, but it can get overwhelming at times - due to the sheer size of some of the rooms that I clean on a daily basis."
good,"Although I wasn't there long due to my husbands job change, I loved working at the Marriott Corporate Offices outside of Washington, D.C. They were a family oriented organization and treated their employees with respect and celebrated all sorts of milestones for employees not just at the Management level, but all the way down. It was a great place to work."
good,I started in Sales with this company where I performed above average but disliked the competitive nature of the sales floor. I was then placed into confirmations which is more of a service position. I enjoyed being able to inform guests of their amenities and responsibilities as well as answer any questions they had. Unfortunately due to the economic downturn the call center I worked at was shut down and the majority of employees were laid off.
good,"The morning started checking the meeting and banquets rooms set ups, set up coffee breaks, greet the costumers, serve breakfast and coffee breaks supervise servers and house persons.

good,"Most days began reading through emails to filter content for Starwood Style, the company magazine. As the writer and publisher, I managed the intranet site and wrote the stories. This was also my first opportunity writing a blog and posting for the web. I learned to work in cross-functional teams and collaborate acorss departments. This became my preferred working style. The hardest part was getting my partners in PR to turn in story ideas by the deadline. The best part was the finished product published every month and the great hotel discount benefits!"
good,Energetic ways as to going from room to room and cleaning. The cleaning in the rooms are different between stays and checkouts. I learned that there are many different ways of cleaning. With the different chemicals that are needed and what they are used for.
good,"Arriving at work with a smile and everyone is glad to say, ""hello how are you"" A typical day at work is hardly ever typical. Its our pleasure to show guest that we are pleased to serve them even though our day might not be so great. Guest ask the most oddest questions but my answer is never no. I tell them i'm not sure at the moment but let me transfer you to someone that can better assist you with that. The guest are the most important and are most likely to entertain you while your in the hotel. Managemnet is different then what i expected but overall they are management. I would like to see more fun bonding though. I feel that our managers sometimes think that work has to always be so serious but the bubbly free personality is what keep guest returning. I enjoy the co-workers although i only see Guest service Reps often but I enjoy getting to know everyone and that our personalities are so different. The hardest part about the job is trying to please a guest while everything esle seems to go wrong. I enjoy meeting alot of different cultures though. Learning different languages and seeing what everyone is interested in. Guest Services can be very tricky even a challenge but i would't give it up without a fight."
good,"I would come in and do my job. I feel that they did not treat some co-workers fairly. When machines would go down the workload would get behind and the management, would panic to get rooms turned over. They would have monthly and yearly employee appreciate meetings."
good,"I worked with the cotroller of the hotel with ar aging ,accts payable& receivables and direct billing ,general cashier and the night auditors along with the sales managers"
good,checked pool made sure it was good every morning with its chemicals and was able to open.

good,"My stay with the Marriott was a short one, but it was not an issue with the Marriott. Professionalism and teamwork are the two best words to describe the work environment."
good,I enjoy working here. The people are very nice. You work outside a lot. The have a kid club there.
good,The beginning of a shift you want to make sure your booth is fully stock with supplies you will need.
good,The Waterford is a great place to the care about the Guest and the Employees just as much. I learned that when you work hard and as a teamplayer that your reward of seeing happy guest is priceless.
good,"During the season it's very busy. I like to stay busy, makes the day go by much faster. I learned how to use a check machine. Management has been going through lots of changes lately. I like my co-workers as people but would prefer not to have to work with a few of them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with constantly changing or contradictory policies and practices. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with a guest and making them smile."
good,As result of working here off and on i found managment is a bit stingy when you ask for a raise..I was promised a raise if i continued to keep working hard and show my aptitude. On several occurances i shown i was indeed a good hard worker who went over my limits of duitys..Yet i did not get the pay raise offered 3x

good,everyone work together there was times the management would take off there suit coats and pitch in I loved my job there I only left because I was offered a job with week end and holidays off
good,"I am curious why is it so difficult to get back into Marriott once you leave? Even with a ""honorable discharge"" it is very hard to get connected a second time, unless you know someone. It is like a secret society. Went through a layoff some years ago with Marriott International and cannot get in the front door, so to speak. Unless I can be proved wrong, I think it's a conspiracy :)"
good,"good company for the most parts, try to be fair with everyone."
good,"My day starts very busy every morning because every days is different, the hotel is getting busier more than usual. I have learned to work more close to manager to acomplish the company goal. I have been developed more manager skills to advance in my career. The hardest part of my job is to keep the highest the best customer score every week . The best part of my job is create daily strategies to complete my work on time and and to satisfy every customer request."
good,"I loved working for this Company. From the workers to the environment. I learned to deal with hard situations that included upset guest, calling the fire/police dept. The pay was great and the benefits were awesome."

good,it was a cool place to work i jus wasnt making enough hours. everyone there is friendly and i liked the job but it was too far from my home so the commute was crazy and i wasnt making enough hours
good,Working for Dressbarn was a great experience with supportive upper management. My DSM was hands on and was always excited when she visited the store. When you have managers who lead by example employees are motivated to do their best.
good,"Marriott is a great place to work they have great benifits and wonderful people you can become great friends with, the only problem is the pay is horrible you just cant live on this salary alone."
good,"excelent place for work respectfully team work,great communications including ability to listen to you"
good,had room for learning
good,I enjoyed working there as A Banquet Captain and learned a lot to use in the future
good,I appreciate the culture of Marriott/EDITION . i would recommend this company to any potential  person looking for employment. the hotels are beautiful and the people are interesting.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Marriott. I really appreciate the ability to work from home. The hours can be fairly inflexible,  but sometimes you get lucky enough to be offered the shift you prefer. "
good,"The job I held at Marriott International was very demanding in terms of physical labor. When you're a houseman, you take on many responsibilities, such as: property tours, janitorial duties, guest deliveries, security, and light maintenance. You become the person who others turn to for assistance, so you take on many different roles within the hotel. With so many responsibilities, you are bound to have many hard days at work, but your co-workers will always understand and have your back. At the end of the day, you'll know that your work was appreciated by another and that you made a difference in that person's hotel experience."
good,"The team is awesome, and always changing! If you want a challenge and a good experience with customer service, this is the place to work. The management will respect your schedule if you ask!"
good,As a Food & Beverage manager build a team of 12 people with great expectation as professional. For me the costumers are number one and also feel so happy and energy every time we comes to work. Grown up my career in the Food and Beverage industry additional to make fantastic networking
good,"Enjoyed working there, learned a lot, many opportunities to learn and move up in the company. Good benefits and vacation time."
good,I loved it there being emotional and pregnant there did not work out for me. If I had the opportunity to work with Marriott again I would in a heart beat
good,The Marriott overall mentors and takes care of it's employees and ranks very high compared to other companies and/or organizations I've worked for. They have Great Benefits including an outstanding 401K and great pay for the position I hold. A typical day as a Bartender starts by setting up the bar and learning what the items presented for the day are like soup and vegetable of the day and setting the bar up to service the guests when the bar opens. The Bartending job is very fast-paced and you must move and think on your feet fast which is the hardest part of the job.
good,I work for an amazing company that offers great benefits. I work a good schedule for me and the pay is equally beneficial. The location is just an issue at times and it would be beneficial in multiple ways if I could work closer to home.
good,como era en venezuela no hay mucho que decir por la situacion del pais
good,"Good employees, fun place to work, fair pair, don’t get paid for showing up early......."

good,"I work there as a housekeeper and although adjusting to the physical aspect of the job was a challenge, the people are great and really care about the guests and the company. Advancement there is you are willing to put in the effort. Cross training with other departments is highly advised."
good,No this should make no difference to my looking for a job and I prefer not to answer question.  I worked for Greystone Hotels which owned the Marriotts.
good,I absolutely loved working here my boss was amazing and the Hotel manager was also a great guy. Learned new skills as well and the co workers were always willing to help. Environment here was totally different  from the strip they actually make you feel like a human being and understand that you have a family and sometimes emergencies to tend to. Not once did I have a problem if I had to leave early for a doctors appointment or other reason vs last property I worked at that  wasn't even directly on the strip they would tell me to call out and get points.
good,"Es un lugar con mucho trabajo en el cual se aprende día a día, una empresa con buena dirección y cultura laboral, la más difícil del giro es atender eventos confirmados de último momento que nos hacen correr a varios departamentos."
good,They have made alot of changes at Marriott Inc.  I love the way they have alot of events and great place to grow. It has changed since the Starwood merger!  But still not a bad place
good,"Time flies when you work here, at first they partner you up with someone for training, then after three days they put you on your own, very relaxed environment, they allow you more than enough time to properly clean the rooms."
good,"This is a secondary.  College job  when  working  in the  restaurant. I think great customer  service skills should get paid more.. I had an associate  that was in front desk. And man she was amazing  . Come to find out she was only getting paid 8 bucks  n some change..like  no she needs 13 but 11.50 would have been  great for her she was spectacular."
good,Great company with awesome benefits. There is a lot of supportive staff members. The guest are amazing. The work environment is exciting and fast paced. Wonderful place to work and grow
good,Great company to work for room for growth and fair treatment. Fast working environment but opportunity to lean from great individuals. I would recommend applying.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Marriott. Excellent management that enables you to develop and grow within your department, as well as engaging and helpful colleagues."
good,"Expedting customers orders, making everything is straight A1. I really enjoyed working there with all different types of people. It was a job that I loved so much"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job working as one team in any challenging we have and meet the team goals .The hardest part of the job when you do not have enough information.
good,It’s been extremely happy to worked in Marriott Marquis with wonderful family.all the Co-worker are very nice and we all work as Team to achieve the goals. It’s great experience to be in this hotel where everything is doing great and wonderful.
good,"Well the best part of my job is the people i work with,and the benefits of working there,the worst part of my job,is when we have alot of checkouts,we have a good supervisor"
good,Saya mau kerja di perusahaan bapak..saya sudah ada pengalaman di bidang restaurant 3.5 thn dan 3 tahun ...mungkin bapak bisa pertimbangkan..terimakasih
good,I learned many things learned how to tuck in the beds a certain way organize everything in the rooms bathrooms   cleaning rooms was a lot of hard work
good,"Dishes always coming"
good,Small Management Company but the people are very close.  I  enjoyed my time there.  The hotel has been renovated and is in a great location for employees to reach as well as guests.  Has great security within and contracted.
good,"Offered a day to day work environment of setting up and breaking down meeting rooms for business based conventions and seminars.  As with all hospitality jobs, all hands approach was required for high volume days.  Great industry and people to work with, would recommend to anyone."
good,Typical Day very busy. Alot of face to face customer interaction. Work place culture has shifted to a team environment. The most enjoyable for me was meeting the different type of people from all over the world.
good,Working at this company was good can not complain.i was able to meet so kind co-workers that like their job. It would have been good if there was more overtime given. But other than that it is a great place to work.
good,"Aprendi bastante com os funcionários, como trabalhar em equipe e como podemos crescer dentro da empresa"
good,I worked in the sales office and loved it. all of my coworkers and managers were very nice and always willing to help.  there is a lot of growth opportunity and managers will help you  get to the next step if you ask for there help.
good,"A typical day would be swarmed with users with IT issues, it was always busy & the day would pass by without notice. loved it. great team & leadership. I've learned that any goal can be achieved with team work and constant collaboration. work place culture was friendly and every engaging. the most enjoyable part of the job was timings were flexible, where I started early and finished early."
good,"Marriott support open work environment. good work life balance. new and advance technology are used."
good,It was a good experience to have under your belt but it is not for me it hurts my back and nees and i just couldn't do it no more but i will recommend this job to someone who likes this kind of work.
good,"The discounts are amazing and working here has its advantages. I meet people from all over the world, I've enjoyed some of the best conversations as well."
good,They had great benefits and pay.  Hated leaving there. And they have hotels all over the world if you wanted to travel or relocate.  But the hotel industry can be hard with a family
good,"This is one of those places where the job advancement opportunities are great, pay is good, hours are good, management is not bad... but everyone is not with the ""team player"" mentality. Everyone in the front office acts like friends, but all talk about each other behind their backs like high-schoolers. It was un-enjoyable to come to work knowing the culture was poisonous like that.It's a shame because everything else was so great... not to mention training is WAY TOO MUCH."
good,Cebu City Marriott Hotel's training was very helpful in terms of the proper procedures to follow in the Food and Beverage Service and makes sure that the standards are being followed to offer its guest a memorable experience.
good,"Les condition de travail et le respect du personnel est admirable chez Marriott, les journée sont très occuper mais la motivation de nos responsable font que l'on ce surpasse chaque jours."
good,I enjoy working for Marriott. There’s great growth potential and learning opportunities. Their standards are kept high. Overall it’s a great company to work for.
good,I worked at three Marriott hotels in Latin America and was a good experience to learn about a strong chain and wonderful brand of hotels. I recommend it.
good,"It's a good job with good benefits. Work pace is moderate with a few stressful moments,   but a satisfactory position if one is looking for easy work."
good,"Best company I've worked for so far. The start out pay is pretty good, the employees are nice for the most part. There's a huge amount of room to move around in the hotel as far as advancement"
good,"I love working here. the culture is caring and upbeat. we meet every morning so we are all on the same page with guests and other happenings. There is always something to learn, and work life balance is very important to the management here."
good,"Managed a small accounting team with a dotted line to IT. Concentrated on Month End duties, and Reconciliations. Management was very helpful in getting me ready for my next position. I enjoyed the team and still remain friends. I got the opportunity to set up 2 other accounting hourly people to get to a management position"
good,"i was given amazing opportunities to learn so many roles with the support of my management team. staff is more like family. there were many opportunities for advancement and pay was awesome. benefits were also great. managers always made it a point to make sure we have all the tools we needed to get our jobs done with very little issues. only downside is there is very little room for a personal life. most of my nights, weekends, and holidays were spent at work. especially the holidays."
good,Great team to work for but management needs a lot of critiquing. I built more patience then I already had. Detailed attention was perfected always looking for mistakes.
good,It’s a great place to work.... Everyone were friendly caring and pleasant.  Well maintained hotel.  They are approximately 800 employees working there
good,"vacuum, change linen,  according to facility requirements,  stock carts according to room volume, met room requirements for schedule special guest adding the required request"
good,"Great job opportunity. Able to work with different office systems and data entry. Fun and exciting. Able to network through the company. Excellent benefits, however very poor job advancement."
good,"Opportunity to become creative, ability to provide secure work environment for the staff. Assuring that all associates feel welcome, appreciated and love coming to work,"
good,Very good place to work and one thing is best if we are doing long hours duty they are giving over time and lieu days and they are providing good food to satff
good,"I liked the work, done on a computer. Taking inbound calls, speaking with customers, & taking credit card information! You had to bid for your shift which was hard for me at the time to juggle family obligations! Since then, my family had grown up!"
good,"You have to be made for hospitality, you have to be genuine in wanting to help others. An upbeat attitude is someone everyone wants to deal with but, you have to be that the whole time you are at work. When you come to work it is showtime, no time for personal affairs here. You will be treated like family but, you need to realize that people are here to stay with you. YOU are the host and need the confidences and backbone to know what you are doing and to make the right judgement call for different types of situations (after you have worked for a few months). You either love it or hate, no other job is like being in hospitality. Customer service, you hang up the phone or the customer finally walk away; in a hotel they are here to stay, maybe longer then a night too."
good,Es un trabajo sumamente fuerte pero donde se aprende
good,"Excellent training provided. They emphasize on work/life balance.  Additionally, management is very encouraging and motivating and is always trying to find new and fun ways to keep up employee morale."
good,"Marriott is a caring enterprise. All employees feel warm and secured working there."
good,"Great working environment, with fast paced environment. Plenty of room for growth."
good,"""Work life balance is good"" even in that stressful environment. Company benefit is good. But, salary is poor in comparison to other company out there. The work load is not evenly distributed.  Moving within the job ladder is not automatic even though you are a ""Solid Performance Associate""."
good,Marriott is very strict on following a blueprint which has been a proven to work based on the revenue and number of properties which they have under their name.
good,"Best experience of life. The Co-workers are so kind & we always have fun their . They take care of us so well . They teach us do many things. When you do something out of your comfort zone and the experience make you realize how hard is doing work rather than pointing or saying something to other."
good,"Ideal place to work and still have time for your private life, most of the time everything is well-organized, real teamwork on every step, high worklpace culture. Highly recommend !"
good,"Free medication "
good,Es una empresa que aunque es una cadena grande le falta mucha inversión en su producción la escases de materia prima es un problema para la calidad
good,If you want to keep busy work hard. Work side by side with others. Meet people from all over the world. It's a very busy fast pass job in summer months.  Much slower in winter months.
good,Great place to work with a lot of room for growth. Managers will spot your potential right away and make sure you get to the position you want. Guests can be rude and demanding but it is part of the industry. Do not get into hospitality if you are not truly passionate about it.
good,typical day goes do at Marriott and l learn t to as team and alone but also learn t how to handle a customer . workplace culture is to work as a team and growth .the hardest part is to deal with a customer who is in a bad mode and the enjoyable part is when you're dealing with kids
good,Enjoyed working the hospitality / customer service industry. Opportunity for growth or relocation if needed. Nominated twice as employee of the month. Good management.
good,There are plenty of opportunities for growth but they typically require long hours and self sacrifice. The compensation was often low at my location except during the busy season when the workers are often expected to work 6-7 days a week.
good,I had really good managers when I worked there. The coworkers were great. The company that owned the location I worked at took care of us and gave us.
good,"A typical day is a day when you have like 500 guest to cover in the banquet function, and they would like to take their meal in the restaurant."
good,I recommend working for a bigger location. That way there is more opportunities for growth. The standards are very high and every year we get a raise.
good,"Intresting place to work and meet new people , i would recomend to any one who  is willing to work at 5 star hotel , good culture and friendly people."
good,"The Adolphus Hotel is a wonderful place to work, the culture they have newly developed due to being bought out by a new property management company has currently in place great executives and a management team that works hard and does the best they can. I do believe they are a bit understaffed at times but despite the challenges and renovation the hotel has now finished after 5 years, it is truly an extraordinary work environment."
good,"Non-stressful job, I do not have any real complaints, I wish our lunch breaks were longer than 30min. I wish I did not have to work every weekend. Working every other weekend would have been great."
good,I here by declare the above mentioned information is true and fair as per of my knowledge and belief and given a chance to serve your organization .I shall do my best.
good,"Tons of growth and learning takes place in a fast paced environment.  Varying business from conventions, to award shows, sports to concerts.  You experience everything!"
good,"Very adaptable and considerate to employee needs. "
good,"Plenty of job opportunities within the company, especially if you are willing to relocate. Largest hotel company. Corporate or local positions available."
good,"Working for the Dallas Sheraton Hotel really changed my whole mindset of hotels, its nothing of what you see on TV its most definitely more to it, but once you learn the basics you can move up easily with the job."
good,"good management,some manager didnt have any qualified,lots of eqipment already ages need to renew,overall have a good team work,sometime bad food for employee"
good,"As Night Manager my duty and responsible for all hotel operations during overnight shift hours, focusing on Front Office operations, night audit and hotel safety/security. I learn to be more responsible and acting wisely during the most difficult situations at night. During my journey where work right now I had the opportunity to work with different management with a different way of thinking that had a strong impact to change n my way of thinking and adjust some defaults in my character.The hardest part of Night Manage you need to work during the day and night, but the most enjoyable part while you find the efficient work of the night reflect the other shifts and made service which was given to the guest much better."
good,"I interned  with this Hotel and had an amazing experience with them. everyone was friendly and helpful, and I was able to learn a lot in a short amount of time. Overall Great company and I would love to work for them again (with pay this time of course)"
good,"Great benefits on hotel deals and restaurants"
good,"this job was excellent to me ,good benefits, great income, 401k, the problems was a little lack of respect getting bullied at the job during the time. it was ok"
good,I enjoyed working with the corporate team but unfortunately it was sold to a company that had centralized accounting therefore I was no longer needed at the Marriott
good,"This company provides training, knowledge and support to help you be successful in whatever position you go after. There are many opportunities for growth. Everyone was treated fairly and paid graciously for their efforts. The company pays salary plus commission. My family was able to travel often due to perks provided by the company. In addition, I had the privilege of working from home, saving me money and allowing more quality time with my wife and children."
good,I can learn so much about hospitality and serving. Their staff are warm and friendly. Good management. The most enjoyable part of the job is to serve guests.
good,"The best part of it was having 12 free nights a year and great rates on hotel rooms - it was believed that you could sell better if you had firsthand knowledge of the product."
good,When there were large events all areas of the pastry team would step up and work together to make sure everything went out smoothly. The guests were always happy with our work and would then become frequent clients.
good,I like working for the Renaissance Hotel. In my department you must prioritize and make sure that if you have a second job manager know will work w/you.
good,"RAS Société très professionnel, groupe très bien.."
good,"good enviroment to work with, and minimal supervision. fun working enviroment, staff are friendly. I have started as Training executive, with minimal knowledge and then have learned many upcoming training based from brand training that was atteded by myself. I have experience in managing manual payroll and also manage foreign trainee."
good,"As being my first job, the colleagues where helpful and supportive in training me and for making me a professional in that field. Work was fun filled with productivity."
good,Working at the Marriott allowed growth in areas of my career as well as my skill set. During my career at the company I was able to meet people from different cultures and career positions.
