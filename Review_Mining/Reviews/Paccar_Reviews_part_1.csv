bad,"Favoritism"
bad,"It will always be a company first everything else a distant second.  A couple of years ago there was a sudden snow storm with 14 inches of snow that hit the ground in the matter of 2-3 hours.  People left due to fear of getting kids, etc.   They wrote up and/or fired a bunch of them.  Absolutely insane."
bad,I had planned time off in advance and was written up for it. I was also offered a new position after working there for eight months and was intentionally written up again to prevent me from accelling within the company.
bad,If you're not a middle-aged white man you'll never get promoted in this company  whenever this company makes mistakes it's not the engineers they get rid of it's the  temps through them straight under the bus  they hire mostly African-American employees so they can feel like they're running a slave  Field  and then they work you like a slave and pay you crumbs $12 an hour when you can make 20 at other companies  and no how matter how much experience you have you all come in making 12 freaking dollars while the big bosses are making all the good money
bad,The worst job i ever had they treat you as if you are a child or as its a priveledge to work for paccar employee's are definetly not #1 if u looking to retire in the next few years then its the place for you
bad,"Workplace culture is a sad place to work, PACCAR gets new people in all the time, but they don't stay very long and the ones that do are lots of ""yes"" men."
bad,Only one thing is on managment mind and that is to get engines out as fast as possible. Any issue holding engines back or stopping production will lead to termination of any employee unless you where hired exactly when the plant was getting started. There is a buddy system in place so choose who you conversate with wisely.
bad,"Culture is about profit and being lean; people are just a tool.  Expected to work under Agile sprints regardless of job functions.  Controlling work environment, does not allow managers to do any tele-commuting."
bad,"Steady work, but low salary. Not much engineering here so throw that degree out the window. Had several engineering managers without 4year college degrees. Typical day is answering the phone, and typing reports. If your a stellar performer but your manager doesn't like you then it's the end of the road for moving up."
bad,"PACCAR is a firm where an engineering degree whether mechanical or electrical ""gets you in the door"" but after that you'll never use any of the education you learned in you engineering studies; say for example your an EE, forget about PLC's, VFD's, LT Spice, Matlab, Simulink, Labview. Yes it is true that some engineers will find their way and can get a niche job doing Labview at PACCAR's PTC tech center, for the majority what you learn over time is how to answer the phone (when dealing with cross functional silos), set up meetings, answer missed BOM calls or work orders known as REI's. Work in the industry a decade or two at a commercial truck manufacturing firm and go look for work as an EE elsewhere and you'll find you won't be able to call yourself an experienced EE as ""power systems, high voltage power, three phase, etc"" things that are expected of Senior engineers just aren't things you'll do here. You will need to be good at presenting in meetings, creating powerpoint presentations and supporting the truck manufacturing plants. The overall morale at PACCAR is low at times due to the culture at PACCAR where employees are asked to do something they might not like to; such as come in clean shaven as the perception that engineers look a certain way is enforced. Pay at this particular employer is only average. Opportunity for advancement exists as long as your manager likes you. PACCAR is a great firm to gain intern experience and then you can decide to leave while I would not recommend it as a dream employer firm."
bad,Over worked under paid in corporate accounting. I was working on weekends and coming in early or most time working very late for month end closing which started ME -5 and went up to ME 7. So almost 3 weeks of month end. It’s a good company if you want to get experience.
bad,Canadian operations of this company sucks. I was interviewed by this company and has horrible experience. I was told by hiring manager during interview that if you are accustomed to fast packed work culture then this company is not for you. We do things at our pace. Great way to sell your company to potential employee. Then I did some research and their clients prefer to deal with other companies. This company takes for ever to make any credit decision.
bad,"Management rewards people who can look good and make mundane daily activities look good. "
bad,"Stable company and job security, but it will eat you alive working there unless you are like amish or grew up in a very sheltered 60s traditional culture."
bad,Awful work life balance.  Expectation is for employees to live to work rather than work to live. Very cut throat IT environment
bad,"You will need the right mindset to work here.  Management is very old school and hasn't yet figured out how to compete for talent, especially in the Pacific NW.  "
bad,"This company has a Huge communication problem - as in there isn't any.  I find out what's going on from production - not from my boss or coworkers.  Often things that impact my daily work are withheld until they become problems, then I am held accountable (even if I didn't know about them).  There is no training....at all.  I have had to fight for my job numerous times because I haven't been able to quickly do the things I haven't been trained on."
bad,This company is good for a person that just wants a job and to check in and out.  If you want to advance to management you MUST become part of the good ol boy system.  People are not promoted on ability but rather friendship and relationship.
bad,"at TEST department, correcting anomalies on the trucks, making safety tests on all systems, general mechanical inspection before paint detailing. The job was fine, but at the end of the day, you are just a number, you will be sent home sooner than later. If you try to manage before they call back 6 months later (work, school, whatever), there will be no flexibility to accomodate you (needed a 15 minutes overlap to get to the job site from school for the evening shift, not negotiable. Job termination mentioned I quited). If you go there for the money, it's a good temporary solution, but dont get overwhelmed, put some coins aside and beware of easy credit lines! Most co-workers where nice to work with! "
bad,"Senior management creates a culture of intimidation that is not healthy for the employees. Focus is too heavy on shareholder return rather than career development and longevity of the company. There is a ""do what your told"" mentality rather than collaborating to find the best solution."
bad,"Un département de RH qui ont oublié le mot Humaine, ils ne pensent qu’au mot Ressource qu’ils considère comme du bétails."
bad,"I had a good experience working at PACCAR and learned a lot working in the accounting department. The company is definitely behind the times and needs to start adapting to the current job market or they won't be able to attract new talent. Overall I don't regret working at PACCAR because of how much I learned, but the company definitely needs a cultural overhaul."
bad,Uber conservative...and very micro-managed. Extremely strict on dress and cell phones. My dept was just audited and it is very unorganized. Didn't realize what I was walking into.....
bad,"Lots of options in Bellevue and surrounding area, management needs to be less restrictive about superficial things and focus on how to generate excitement about the company and the work"
bad,"I was so excited when I started my job with paccar. I felt very welcomed at first... Then imwhen it became time for work..... It went downhill. The Cherry picker that I was provided to use was very old and outdated. It was one of the oldest ones in the building. I would get stuck in the air and it was very slow and it effected my numbers. I brought it up to management and they just brushed it off their shoulders. They wouldn't even let the mechanics look at it.. I feel I was set up for failure from day one. I approached them with respect regarding the situation and nothing was done....I remember one day, another employee had a problem and he was cussing at the supervisor.... they took care of his issue and not mine.  The equipment I was using was a safety issue according to Osha........"
bad,Company is stable and secure. Job in my area has quick track to management of your interested. Work hard and your rewarded. Pay is very low and company is not going to combat this strongly provided past GM stances and company culture.
bad,"Everyone is expected to do multiple jobs.  When someone leaves or is fired, their job is split up among others and thats the new normal.  Save money save money save money.  Employees are seen as replaceable instead of an asset."
bad,"Dynamic environment, hands on experience gained in terms of logistics, reading drawings, material management, supplier quality, project management. The commodity manager is the point of contact for any issues that happen anywhere in the supply chain at any point in time. Great learning ground, however long term career growth, management development, or mentoring programs are a major weakness at PACCAR."
bad,"Paccar is an extremely old school company. They put a lot more value in time of service rather than individual ability. In my experience, the work isn't very challenging. I rarely work more than 40 hrs a week. In the embedded engineering division they are really bad about giving out promotions. Outside of promotions the only raises you will receive are ""merit raises"" which usually range from 2-4 % depending on the year. There are some really good people working here but the company itself does not recognize those who go above and beyond. This doesn't promote a a great atmosphere and most of the time it feels like everyone is just trying to get to Friday."
bad,I would logon to the computer and chick my emails. Then I work on any and everything I was told to do. What I did most was edit videos and I did work on some photos.
bad,"Good job for college students, cool up beat vibe. The company takes care of their employees."
good,"For a Fortune 500 company it is astonishing how much  it operates in the past. The only thing advanced about it is its product. Management does not invest in their people or care about their opinions. Sure, you'll hear them mention work-life balance but they don't show they even know its meaning. Example: The company's first employee survey was taken in 2015 and again in 2017. Both times, the #1 complaint was outdated systems. And yet, they do nothing about it. Theyre more concerned with pleasing the owners and will bend over backwards for them. I highly suggest one does not work at Corporate unless you can handle the ""good ol' boys"" mentality and mandatory brown-nosing. "
good,"Positif : salaire, assurance"
good,"PACCAR is a ""lean"" organization, which translates into not having enough resources to do day-to-day work AND all the other problem resolution events that will come your way."
good,Low management system. Supervisors wouldnt answer office calls no voicemail system. Best plan of action is to expect to be treated like a low end scrub. The advancement in the company is little to extinct. Its not a bad job though the work is easy but the way its ran is sloppy and poor. The higher ups definately have a god aspect thinking they are the top of the world acting as if the general operators are just a work force to order and walk over.
good,"I learned a lot of PACCAR and its culture.  We were overworked and underpaid, but everyone brought great food to the potluck dinners we had on month end nights.  Management would pay overtime, but they did pay for the pizza!"
good,strangest place ive ever worked.  no one seemed to be held accountable for anything they did or any mistakes that were made.  I was on 8 different shifts in the 6 months that I was employed there.
good,"paccar une entreprise qui paye très bien c'est le seul avantage"
good,Love love it  the people around you. They become your family. Wouldn’t trade it for nothing. Easy work enjoy messy workers good benefits depending on packages
good,"Everything moved slow. Low accountability and management did not reward work or effort. Work life balance was excellent, and more experienced engineers were able to create their own projects. Productivity improvements were not encouraged, and investment in productivity saving tools or technologies was at a minimum. Company culture didn't reward defining a process or cross group communication. Low level management was pushing for change but operated in the same atmosphere. Last generation they had mechanical engineers designing electrical systems, now they have electrical engineers designing software systems."
good,"Old School approach to business. Has a history of doing very well, but is also pretty inflexible with their business practices. This means that there are not a lot of young people who work there."
good,PACCAR is as stable as it gets. It is a very conservative company but treats people well and provides good benefits. Median salary employer but opportunity to grow.
good,"Paccar offre de bon salaire et de bons avantages, mais la mentalité de l'entreprise est à revoir"
good,"Very fast pace physical job that has great pay and benefits. Politics play a great part in this occupation. The jobs vary in easy to hard but you dont get to choose where you are put and some jobs are a lot more physically demanding than others. Most management got to where they are by knowing a friend that was already in management and got an interview with them to get moved up, not by knowing skills or job qualifications. You get two 10 min breaks at which you mainly work through or are trying to gather tools for the next truck leaving barely enough time to use the restroom, and one 30 min lunch. Recommended you bring your own because by the time you get to the cafeteria there is a long line not giving enough time to sit down to enjoy the meal. The best part of the job is the benefits and pay handsdown!"
good,"HR needs to work on training for their supervisors, specially those who have never been managers."
good,Easiest job I've ever had. Changes don't happen very often. Leaders aren't held accountable. Salesmen sell trucks and workers build them. No changes to vacation for Employees who only get 2 weeks for five years and you have to accrue it one hour a week.
good,"travail a la chaine, production élevé , une belle équipe de travail ,"
good,"Minimal opportunities for advancement, and training.  A company that does not value there floor level/production workers. Expensive insurance and employer offered programs."
good,"dépend de la vente de camion."
good,PACCAR is a global leader in heavy duty truck production and in the secondary (parts) market. PACCAR is a very professional company and has a very conservative business culture.
good,"Working to improve processes, and does not provide flexibility with work/life balance.  Required to dress business professional.  People there are very nice."
good,"This company has a definite work culture unique in its own, I think, and that is geared around the Truck Manufacturing industry in general since they own 3 major global truck lines. So one has to conform and it's not bad, it's productive but if one doesn't like it, they would struggle to be happy there."
good,"Paccar is a good company with very good benefits, unfortunately it is easier to find a better job than being promoted, and the job culture is very old."
good,"Traditional, fast paced environment. Global, stabil company with benefits and room for advancement if you are dedicated and hard working. I loved my time in the purchasing department."
good,"In my nearly 5 years with Paccar I found a typical workday to be physically and sometimes mentally challenging as deadlines needed to be met, and products needed to ship. The overall morale of the employees in my area was generally low, due to poor management conditions. Compensation, however was good. So most employees kept their heads down, did their jobs, and waited on the supervisor to leave before complaining."
good,If you find an ideal position where you enjoy your work and supervising management then you can grow a career here.
good,"Typical day at work is starting at 5am. Prepping all my breakfast and setting up my line before service. fast pace environment, averaging about 50-70 orders for breakfast. cleaning up breakfast to set up for lunch and getting everything prepped. opening up service and averaging about 50- 70 orders for lunch. clean up lunch and do all dishes and prep for tomorrows work day."
good,"Assemblage des camions, emploi de jour, tres chaud l'été car pas d air climatisé"
good,It’s ok. I been here two years. I don’t like culture and some people aren’t friendly. Starting pay is cool. I just wish raises were more. But it’s a new company in Texas.
good,Management was afraid to make decisions form the plant manager level down. Corporate was a constant threat to plant salary personnel.  Plant management tried to hide production issues from corporate. Annual loss was over 50 million dollars  per year since the engine plant opened. This was a very odd company with a culture that needed revamping.
good,"8-5 Monday thru Friday"
good,"Really exited to work there just not a good fit for designers as I was the only one. Culture was very 'engineering"" focus and not so much for the 'design team' they offered to me when I first got the job. I was like where's the team and they awkwardly said 'your it'. Never a good fit to be a lone wolf and literally had to compete with the design agency they said was 'my team'"
good,"The only thing I can say is that they are focused on creating a professional work environment for their employees."
good,Heavy duty manufacturing environment on a moving assembly line. Good mechanical and computer skills required. Troubleshooting and problem solving abilities are a big plus. Attendance policy is strict and requires a strong dedication to the job
good,"Review the reviews via glassdoor... Things may have changed since when I worked there. When I worked there, there were a ton of rules implemented by the ""Chairman"" such as 1) do not cross the street to purchase Starbucks. Instead go downstairs to purchase from the Co cafeteria, 2) If you are going one floor up or down, you are not allowed to use the elevator. Instead, you need to use the stairs and 3) Every time you leave your work area, you MUST be wearing a suit jacket."
good,"Peterbilt is a good company to work for."
good,"-Enjoyable and challenging role in Technical Recruiting."
good,"In general, PACCAR is a good company. It is male-oriented and no development space for minority woman.  It is partially because it is HD industry which is male-oriented."
good,"Joined the IT Service Management team as the Process Owner to develop, train, troubleshoot and manage IT service management process in North America. I was handling IT business & internal customer communication; reporting to Senior Management; coordinating with Service Owners & IT Application teams; generating KPIs & data analysis; troubleshooting issues, process improvement, implementation and user documentation; maintaining Service Level Agreements; training employees and organizing meetings. Planning, scheduling, coordinating and tracking process activities and generating KPI for management reporting purposes."
good,The position is interesting but very little involved with this job is moving forward.
good,Almost all of the people I worked with were friendly and helpful. Management keep telling you to move faster and work harder when you are already at 100%.
good,Business formal environment. Pretty conservative for being in the Pacific Northwest. Provides great foundational knowledge that sets you up for success outside of organization.
good,"PACCAR is a global technology leader in the design, manufacture and customer support of premium light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates. PACCAR also designs and manufactures advanced diesel engines, provides financial services, information technology, and distributes truck parts related to its principal business."
good,"It was a good internship and I learned a lot, it isnt a particularly exciting company to work for. Has a great work life balance, would be great if you already have a family. Not great to start."
good,Very lean company with multiple conflicting responsibilities and limited resources. Software and technology needs to be updated and systems are outdated.
good,"Extremely conservative company with very old school policies.  All decisions are made at very senior levels.  Suits, and ties for men.  Shaved faces required."
good,Great over all company great leadership and training program. Very helpful and involved in your growth as a person not just an employee. You can count on working for your pay but know that you have the support of a great company to work with you.
good,"bonne entreprise,,offre des bon avantages ,avec de l'ancienneté peut "
good,Fast paced with plenty of task to keep time moving.  Great team work and daily goals set always provided extra enthusiasm to get higher production levels.
good,"PACCAR Inc has an extremely positive work/life balance - the best I have seen in my 19 years in the Information Technology industry.  Their IT division is composed of very seasoned and professional leaders who are very good at mentoring.  Overall, it has been a very positive experience for me."
good,PACCAR has multiple divisions that allows for room for advancement withing the company and provide good benefits. The corporate office can be very conservative.
good,"Though there were many serious work times, out accounting team managed to have alot of fun. We had little mini games on a ""game desk"" to play if we need a break from a difficult task."
good,"The owner is a little off like Howard Hughes. There are dozens of crazy stories about him. He fires people because he doesn't like the way they look, for example. This chaotic management trickles down through the management structure and makes it an odd place to work."
good,Paccar has a good working environment. Management doesn't stay in touch with employees enough. I've learned a lot there with some great supervisors in certain areas of the plant and also with Diesel engines. Hardest part of the job is opportunities for advancement
good,"good entry level job, old school company not really intune with the changing job market. "
good,"A professional workplace with an opportunity to learn many skill sets including Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing."
good,"Takes business seriously, room for occupational growth can be a challenge, needs to revamp compensation strategy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team of people who are strongly committed to the strength of the Kenworth truck"
good,Very conservative culture with high turn over. Management is easy to work with but not willing to stand up to higher levels. Top management is out of touch with reality.
good,"PACCAR is a dynamic, team-oriented collaborative company with plenty of opportunities to contribute.  Great place to work if you want a long career with one company."
good,"Very good work life balance, slow work lot of senior people. "
good,Lots of room for growing and advancing. Work-life balance culture is good. Rarely do you find a company that has a pension plan. This is the company that has one. It is business attire everyday.
good,"pas d'avenir, manque de travail, mise a pied"
good,managers are lacking in training of new personnel that are unfamiliar with the trucking industry.  has its fun days and slow days. hills and valleys with work.
good,"I was not there long enough to accomplish much, slow business conditions, which  caused a layoff.  I enjoyed the work I was able to do."
good,The co-workers are great to work with.  Supervisors allow you to learn each area as it interests you and promotes within.
good,Paccar is a growing company that has a lot to offer to those that know how to operate forklifts. It can get real busy at times during the spring/summer seasons. I learned how to operate forklifts and other equipment.
good,agreable a travailler bonne condition de travail et bonne embiance
good,"I have learned how to work with different applications and tools to provide the best customer service. Multitasking, productivity and working under stress were important feature of the life."
good,Information Technology Division has a lot to offer. Salaried employees are offered the flexibility depending on role. Good operations environment to learn about IT in the corporate enterprise. Management is a mix; you never know who you will have to work with next. Peers are great and respectful to make the work spaces comfortable.
good,"Decent place to work, you can get alot of experience here. The work culture is very 1970's and very old school. They need to change the culture to get the best employees pssoible"
good,Must be a driven individual. Highly competitive manufacturing company. A bit 'old school' when it comes to dress attire at the corporate level. Working a standard 8am-5pm work day is required.
good,"Secure job but not the fastest-paced environment. Very formal culture -- be ready to dress up and guys, no facial hair. Pay and benefits aren't great compared to other places but again it's a stable job at least."
good,"bonne compagnie, mais très instable, emploi pas stable, bonne ambiance de travail, très sécuritaire, pour éviter les blessure a long terme comme tandinite, nous alternons, a toute les semaines nous changeons de poste de travail, sur 3 semaines"
good,I enjoyed my time their as an employee it unfortunately came to a quick end after a layoff. There were chances of moving up and management was generally good and helpful. HR was also helpful and responsive.
good,"A typical 9 to 5 if that's what you're looking for.  Management leaves something to be desired, but there are a couple good managers there. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with other teams."
good,I learned/gained a whole lot of new tools at PACCAR that I will carry with me forever. They encouraged me to think outside of the box and chase my dreams. I appreciate their generosity and wish them all the best.
good,"I've learned a lot at PACCAR. Management tends to give promotions to folks who actively try to make PACCAR a better company. It doesn't matter what your job is, your experience is based on what you make of it."
good,Solid place to work. Good compensation and benefits. Management can be baised and show favoritism. Dont like the old school work culture. Overall a good company to work for.
good,"This company has implemented PPS which is a half-hearted effort to copy TPS (Toyota Production System). Managers tend not to spend much time on the floor. Orientation is toward quality, but not much training given to employees. Some managers, engineers and salaried people do not have a good work ethic. The shop floor employees basically run the company. Standard Work Instructions exist but are not available to employees only through computers which are not readily available to operators. They seem to treat long term employees well."
good,"They have a rather strict dress code for a northwest company.  Awesome people doing their best to maintain very old systems, so if you're looking for the latest and greatest technology to work on, it may not be the best place.  The people were what made every day a joy to work there!"
good,"Great retirement. Great advancement opportunities. Very political. NO work/life balance. They expect blood sweat and tears everyday and no complaining, please. Your family will suffer. Your health will suffer. You will only be successful if you are single and can devote your entire energy to making them successful. But they pay you well for it. They give sick days but write you up for using them."
good,"100% Autonomy in remote work scenario to handle job tasks.  Learned quite a bit about industry, PACCAR culture, etc.  Compensation was low in comparison to like jobs within the industry."
good,PACCAR is a great place to work if you're a go-getter and want to be able to get diversified experience in several roles. If you produce great work you are recognized and often compensated with moving up in the organization.
good,"For the first 10 years I felt that the management was making every effort for the employees to succeed. This included all ""levels"" from the janitorial crew up to the high level supervisors.I was greatly motivated to continue to learn and ""evolve"". "
good,Highlight of my career allowing me job advancement replete with stock options and excellent compensation and benefits. Very demanding culture but very rewarding experience representing the finest products in the heavy truck industry
good,"Bonnes conditions de travail mais celui-ci est l routinier en tant qu' assembleur, les opprtunités de progressions sont minimes."
good,Good job. However  there is a problem.  There is a buddy system there that allows certain people promotions while there are others who are qualified get passed over because they are not part of the buddy system.
good,PACCAR needs to adapt to the new wave of engineers. They are losing top talent out of school for two reasons. Low pay and formal dress code. This dress code definitely hurt my performance and was rather annoying.
good,Je considère que ces un bon employeur et que les avantages sociales son bien
good,"No complaints so far. It's been a great place to work. From an engineering standpoint, there is a lot of support and autonomy. They also provide a pension."
good,"I loved the job, I had t o relocate after being reunited with some family members. I had to work my way up the ladder, in order to get the daytime shifts."
good,"I came on board to re-brand the company, to bring my vision and creative style on board to help promote the brands and the company.  While working there I made some great friends."
good,tres bon salaire avantage sociau club social ligne de montage
good,"Excellent job security, lot of opportunities to switch jobs within the organization. They are improving on systems now. No jeans allowed, except for few days."
good,J'ai apprécié mon court séjour avec une équipe dynamique ou le côté humain était de mise. La seul contrainte était la difficulté d'avoir une permanence dans l'entreprise et malgré le bon rendement des employés il s'avère qu'il faut parfois passé par le licenciement du à un gros nombre d'employés qui on fait du remplacement durant les vacances.
good,tres bonne ambiance de travail tres bon salaire et avantages sociaux vetement payer et bottes fond de pension bon
good,None I was a contractor for PACCAR.  Worked in the Claims Processing group performing mainteance and enhancements to the existing system.   Flexible work hours.
good,J'aime les nouveaux défis alors que cette emploi était vraiment répétitif
good,"During my 5 1/2 years working there I truly enjoyed the atmosphere of everyone there. Hard working, open minded and eager to listen and grown the company, as well as build friendships."
good,"Bien que le travail de production est plutôt monotone, j'ai bien aimé le travail d'équipe surtout lors de la préparation de la journée et la fabrication de pièces ainsi que l'entretien à l'aire de travail se qui incluait les changements de types de production."
good,Close to 30 calls a day. Most issues were resolved immediately over the phone or remotely. My goal was to have no more than 2 tickets created daily. I learned to troubleshoot proprietary applications very quickly. Management was awesome. We were given the freedom to work on our own. Discuss issues with members of the team. It was a good environment and very helpful. Hardest part of the job was making sure that every customer I dealt with was assured they were in good hands. I truly enjoyed not only fixing an issue but discovering the root of the problem.
good,"It's a pretty easy going workplace. It's just not very secure at the moment with the economy the way it is. My supervisor did his job very well, and did his best to accommodate everyone under his authority."
good,You start with a little meeting in the morning.  What you will learn is managing your time and inventory. Management is alright.  Your co-workers will help you whenever you need it.  The hardest part is working with limited space.  You will like the working hours which is different from other companies.
good,"Wonderful experience.  Too bad oil industry tanked and took a lot of our business with it. Good hours, good pay, great team work, nice people, autonomy to get your job done, opportunities to work across departments."
good,"I took this position to get my foot in the door. I don't regret it at all. This is a hard job, but you are paid well for it. Plus the night differential pay makes it worth it. Like anywhere else there are very unworthy managers. If you go and do your job you have nothing to worry about. I wasn't in this position long. I applied for many other positions as soon I started. I find the healthcare very affordable."
good,Good place to work at conservative workplace though. Not for everyone
good,Great place to work. Loved the employees and their attitudes. Learned how to assemble 18 wheeler engine. Wore uniforms so no one knew who was who. Everyone looked the same.
good,bonne condition de travail mais aimerais mieux travailler dans l`aéronautique.
good,Great company to work for. Corporate is a little out of date. But the benefit's are great. The managers are really nice but definitely stay on your toes.
good,It nice to work at Paccar with family since their schedule is flexible and the work balance so good but i want new challenge for two reason one the commute issue  and prefer to work remote
good,Long history of excellent quality products with a strong and profitable financial history. They provide good working environment along with necessary tools to perform your job.
good,I learned a lot at this company even in the short amount of time I was there. My experience was an internship and I would love to consider employment with PACCAR after graduation.
good,I started out with the company doing data entry in the fuel tax department. I was in that position for about a year before I was promoted to Rental Coordinator. I was in charge of a rental fleet of roughly 200 trucks and scheduled rentals. I was also required to access any new or exiting damages to the semi trucks as well as daily invoicing. I had no knowledge of semi trucks before working for Paccar and it taught me a great deal of the trucking industry. Towards the end of my career at Paccar I also did some accounts payable / receivables as well as payroll for the diesel mechanics.
good,"During my typical workday, I am responsible for overseeing my teams as they progress on various development tasks. I check in and help them with any issues they may be having such as doing mock-ups. I keep in touch with clients, update them on our progress and make sure they are satisfied with the promotional materials."
good,"- Professional working environment"
good,Paccar is a great and clean place to work. Very professional. They are a tier 2 manufacturer with great pay and benefits.
good,"The workplace is a friendly, laid back environment where you could have fun and work at the same time. The management is always cooperating with you if you need help with anything on the job as well as making arrangements if there is a day when needed to be off or emergency matter."
good,"Good interaction with team"

good,ligne de production pas de conciliation travail-famille. entreprise tres organisé
good,"Excellent company to work for. Good benefits and pay, but not good for pay raises. If you are looking for a stable employer PACCAR is a good choice. PACCAR has given me quite a bit of latitude in defining my role as an engineer within the company, although I would say that electrical engineering is not treated with the same respect as mechanical engineering."

good,Very good work environment.. Loved my bosses and work wasn't that hard just sometimes very busy and hard to keep up.loved my job.it was easy would love to go back.
good,Rarely were there days with little to do. I learned a lot about making decisions and standing by them and being given the freedom to do my job.

good,"I enjoyed the daily routines I performed at Paccar because I was constantly busy at task which made the time fly by quite quickly. I learned a lot about using RF menu computer systems while pulling orders and how to properly package and ship merchandise out after picking it. My managers were always very personable, understanding and helpfu. My co-workers were awesome and made work ""that much easier"" being the cool people and characters they were. The hardest part of the job was staying under Paccar's standard error rate which was 3.5 errors allowed per 10,000 lines."
