bad,"If you are single and have no friends or family you can do this and make some money. If you have a family or people you love, you will be so beat after a shift you won't see them and half the time you'll be picking up mandatory weekends to make up numbers because some part was out or the numbers changed or management says you are not doing enough. It is a place where you will rot and fester until you get out. They care only about the numbers, that is all you will ever be, and a number is easy to replace if you complain."
bad,Manager was terrible.  You were expected to work 60 hours a week and no thanks was given.  Manager felt threatened by my expertise.  I was laid off after I trained in 2 additional people.
bad,"Lots of verbal abuse lots of harassment and mistreatment against innocent people arrogance is off the chain at this company work someplace else"
bad,"Horse bleep place to work, push you hard and you can't make a mistake. Force you to work Saturdays then send you home because no parts. My lead was a great guy production manager was a jack wagon who didn't know what he was doing, When he filled in he would make mistakes but if we did we were written up and to many you were fired 3 months and I said screw it after I was written up, and you don't get hired by Polaris you are a temp you might get kept on if your lucky. Don't waist your time go somewhere else"
bad,"Do not work here. You are just a number. They sacrifice safety for quantity. Good example an employee air lifted to a hospital because a crate fell on his head that was poorly put away by a over worked, stressed fork lift driver. "
bad,"Granted Polaris is a ""start up"" company but it is absolutely ridiculous that the mangers, supervisors, and HR are so caught up in sticking up for each other than for the actual employees that bust their cans 10 to 12 hours a day. You never know what time you will be getting off work from day to day because no matter how hard you work, you are ALWAYS behind schedule. They do NOT care about the employees what so ever. HR is the biggest issue with the plant. They have NO idea what to do or how to help with any problem. If you are not in the so called click out there you might as well not even be there. They let bad parts go out... Problems that are easily fixable are not because that may stop production for 5 minutes. You get two 12 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch no matter how many hours are forced upon you that day. The vacation you work to build up is almost never granted because production is so far behind that one person cannot use their own vacation.... Most of the employees are straight out of high school without families. The members with families you might as well guarantee you will not be seeing them but on Sundays. It's a horrible and I mean horrible place to work period!!!! I have worked there from the day it opened until now and nothing has changed. Lies, lies, and more lies is all  it is. They pay stinks, the benefits are pathetic, and the abuse and conduct out there is beyond ridiculous but if anything is said...you get punished for it for being the victim. I would rather flip burgers they to work for that miserable place. And every employee you talk to would"
bad,"Will be docked you if your beyond your work space. Depending  on supervisors  and leads ,...if you have personal issues then they suck . Dont have personal  issues,. Be a robot they like that! Be a zombie, they like that too! , be conformative , be a team!."
bad,Absolutely by far the worst company I’ve ever worked for! Management is clueless and doesn’t know how to run a company. If you work hard they treat you like trash. If your lazy and spend more time sucking up to upper management then this is the job for you. I came in early a few days before my shift started to help get the line up and running that much faster and the company manager actually got on to me and told me to not come in anymore before the shift starts. You build paid time off and sick leave but you might as well forget being able to use it. It’s often neglected and never approved or denied. The only way to get a day off is to call out and not show up. Don’t ignore the bad reviews like I did. Stray far away from this company and save yourself the headache! I’m almost positive anywhere else that is hiring would be a better option. There’s not enough money in the world to put up with how they treat you there.
bad,Management is clueless as they ( Polaris) is bringing their people which are just kids from Minnesota. Depressing place to work!! Run you been warned!
bad,"Polaris is a horrible company to work for. They do not pay their employees a competitive wage. This year at the huntsville facility those eligible to receive their pay for promotion and yearly cost of living adjustment only received the pay for promotion. The same thing was done last year. That means someone just starting out made $.10 less than someone who had been there over a year. "
bad,people there are a**holes if you are not their friend your an enemy and you cant be friends with everyone cause they all have their own little groups...... this place is worse than high school
bad,"Don't even waste your time applying for this place. Management has no idea as to what they're doing. No motivation what so ever, and very low moral. Communication between management and operators is absolutely terrible, and the pay terrible.  The only thing management cares about is the bonuses they get from production. I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy."
bad,"Polaris has the worst Human Resource I’ve ever seen they blame the people who aren’t in the wrong , fire people for a reason that was out of their control."
bad,The management was horrible. They didn’t take anyone’s opinion into consideration other than for them to meet their numbers. I worked a 12 hour shift and only received one 30 min lunch break and 2 15 min breaks. There is no respect given and you are treated like trash if you aren’t liked. The team leads in injection mold are the laziest people I have ever come across in my life. They disappear for 30 mins at a time and are nowhere to be found and would rather go and tell on you if you annoy them to get you in trouble rather than talk to you. I felt like I was in high school working at Polaris and wild NEVER recommend working here to anyone
bad,"Line 2 went down hill. The lady supervisor had everything organized and together. The supervisor who replaced her also ran a tight shift, they moved him to zone 1. The supervisor who took his place is disrespectful rude and condescending. He talks at you not to you and he thinks he’s smarter than everyone. Before he came I loved my job and never missed a day. HR isn’t about their business either because they back everything he does. It’s a sad place now and they wonder why everyone is quitting! Nobody is going to put up with that mess. They write you up for breathing to hard, he has turned the job into a stressful environment. Before it was a fun enjoyable place to work."
bad,The worst management team I have ever worked for. Don't plan on any advancement within this company unless you are a brown noser. Management has no time for anyone who won't tell them they are the best. Worst company I have ever worked for.
bad,"Promises never fulfilled. Management that doesn't care. HR doesn't seem to know whats going on either or care for the concerns of the employee. They can't even answer questions about new rules implemented. They have the ""ac"" set to 10 degrees cooler than it is outside, but really its probably at least 10 degrees warmer. The talk of promotions all the time but there always seems to be a hiring freeze. You can have 10 years experience in a field, and they will hire a kid out of high school over you.There is no real set schedule other than show up at seven and ""leave whenever we say you're done."" So if you have kids its sort of a problem for after school care or day care or a babysitter. I had very high hopes when i started with the company, but its been more than a year and every day it goes worse and worse down hill. Wouldn't recommend to anyone unless they were desperate without a job."
bad,I helped start the new plant in Huntsville and it was a horrible experience. They are trying to use lean manufacturing principles but none of the management really believes in them so it's just very confusing in what's going on.
bad,Management sucked no advancement for smart people. If you have no experience with assemble line and motors you will advance. If you have a brain you will not advance. I would not recommend Polaris to my enemies
bad,"I was a group lead in Osceola.  I heard great things about other locations but osceola is horrible.  They treat people like garbage.  The leaders are condescending, the engineering team is a group of lazy alcoholics who blame all issues on operators and take no responsibility for their mistakes.  You'll get paid ok, but you won't get hired full time and you won't get vacation. You get 74 seconds to perform your job, if you don't make it in time a loud buzzer let's everbody know."
bad,"Management has more or less a ""Good Old Boys"" Mentality.  The company admittedly has grown faster than could keep up with regards to integrated processes.  Very difficult to find the true Subject Matter Expert on various vehicles and products."
bad,"Come work here if you enjoy having to beg to use your PTO to actually enjoy a day off.  However plan on using it to cover hours lost due to poor planning by management, etc."
bad,Polaris is not a good place to work. It's not about your experience as far as advancement. They dont make good quality vehicles.  You dont feel appreciated as an employee. They fill you with lies and promises to keep you going until one day you wake up and say ok enough. Management is a joke!. People like 22 23 yr old working as head of HR that should tell you enough.
bad,"this is a good company to work for, it is full time and a fast pace environment. You are solely responsible for your work. When a unit comes to your station you are responsible for doing your part and installing your parts on the vehicle"
bad,"I worked for this company for years. Always got screwed over for something, but kept giving them the benefit of the doubt and kept working for them. Relocated & it was even worse! Management is horrible. Someone who is HR again now is horribly mean & selfish. Have to sleep with someone or be buddies to even go anywhere besides a simple grade 5 position!!! Also it’s either you get tons of overtime to the point of working 12+ days in a row for a month or so & then you have to wonder if you’re going to get laid off the next! Would never recommend this place to anyone ever again"
bad,"Watch your back working at this company. Most of the management lies. Document everything. They fired me and had to pay me on my way out. "
bad,"In my time at Polaris, I really enjoyed the work and made some friends. I wish that hadn't stopped. Over time, I began to realize that all of us temps were not to be treated like human beings. We all got laid off the week before Thanksgiving."
bad,"Polaris went from the perfect place to work to the worst place to work over the last 2-3 years. Where they were focused on collaboration, thought leadership and delivery, now all that matters is politics, who you know and how much you are willing to compromise your values. Very very sad to see such a great company lose its integrity and future"
bad,Its extremely hot in the new plant..management is oblivious to what their employees need to perform or to be productive..The hardest part of the job is just listening to upper management say what their going to do and knowing that its not going to happen
bad,Empresa transnacional que divide su trato entre dos oficinas una siendo la planta y otra oficinas en San Pedro que favorece a conveniencia.
bad,"Management doesn't know what they're doing. It's all about the numbers. Not quality, so don't let them lie to you with that BS. They underpay you, they avoid you if you get hurt. Insurance sucks, dental sucks. They offer OT, but after taxes its basically like nothing. Always work Saturdays. There are people there that have 19 occurances but decide to fire the good workers who miss a few days because of family. Don't let them see that you actually work, then they'll work you and only you. No rotation on jobs (like they're supposed to). Nurse sucks, I'm surprised she actually has a job there. Literally doesn't know anything medical except how to put liquid bandage on you. All the management will tell you is, ""we're working on it"" for every question you ask them. Everyone there are pretty much tools. The only people I enjoyed were the co-workers (a select few) because they actually did something. You only get 16 hours of personal time PER YEAR. After that, don't miss a day. They rarely approve vacation time, so people just take off anyways. Moral is basically dead. Do yourself a favor, don't work here."
bad,"They make you feel like just another warm body to fill a position and make you feel like they could replace you tomorrow with another warm body. My supervisor and lead has threatened our painter jobs, saying that they will replace us or move us to lower paying jobs if they don't get this or that or 100% good quality."
bad,"Only advancement through a buddy system. Injured employees are ignored. Mandatory overtime is a constant. The combination of poor management, communication, and lack of care for employees is praised instead of corrected. They often violate their own company policies."
bad,"-Hours are not flexible. Resource MFG who hires temps for Polaris  back up Polaris in the practice of giving little notice to overtime changes with little to plan for family needs or personal medical appointments. "
bad,"Terrible work environment, all about the numbers they can produce. No steady work schedule and often threats of layoffs. Would not recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"It is a real shame that my experience wasn't what it could have been. So much opportunity for great things with this company. However, there is no one to look at the big picture. You could find all sorts of ways to make improvements with no one to match the desire. It was a virtual set of stairs with every member of management buying their time to climb the next flight. No one ready for their current role and no one capable of developing their replacement. This all due to a lack of investment in people and process development at all levels of employment. No accountability for any programs that are in place. There are some very hard working people their at every level, but without development, no one performs to the unreachable standard."
bad,Polaris has a long way to go. Giving the benefit of a doubt they are a start up company but they are very un-organized in everything they attempt to do. Management does not have a clue and does not get in a hurry for anything. The wages are descent but the benefits are terrible so they cancel each other out.
bad,The only way to move up is to be buddy buddy with someone in that dept. It’s a job to make money....nothing to make a career out of. The only thing this company cares about (Huntsville plant) is how many units goes out the door!!!
bad,"Great Pay and Benefits. If you just want a clock in and clock out job that throws you to the wolves as soon as you get there for training this job is for you. "
bad,"Was released from the job there trying to defend myself from being threatened by another employee.  Management said they would stand behind me , that I had nothing to worry about ... Hr people suck there and management does too . None of them there have any spine !! Maintainence has nothing but clicks and all for show , kissing their way up the hourly pay rates !"
bad,"Polaris could be a great company, but it frequently fails to get out of its own way in many regards. Its failures can be summed up with the following:"
bad,Many people did not like working there. Management was not there for the people when they needed them. People were talked down to and treated very poorly.
bad,"Very long days, stressful and difficult work, you work with a lot people on a line that has a convers belt and different tools all around you to work with."
bad,"Expect to get work butt worked with very little appreciation, seniority means nothing! Majority of coworkers are friendly other than the negative attitudes because they are burnt out and very tired from being run ragged! A lot of people don't last long there because it is very fast pasted and they can't handle that. Most jobs on the assembly lines are either very overwhelming or to simple the jobs are not very well balanced."
bad,"Hard fast paced work. Hard on your body. Some people helpful others not. Not an enjoyable place to work.  Some managers are great, others NO.  Don't really want to hear how things are going, even tho they say they do. Pay is good, benefits are there, but costly.  You do meet some nice people.  Not equal advancement.  Depends on who you know or are related to.  Some co-workers get away with only doing part of their job and you get the blame.  Especially if they have been there many years. Employees that have been there the longest have easiest jobs."
bad,The only good thing about working there was the people I got to work. The management team didn't care one bit about the employees just about hitting their numbers. You are just another number to the bosses there.
bad,"Started as an assembly worker for a few years, than got promoted to a quality position, worked for 4 years and got demoted because of lack of work. They posted job again and had to re apply and they ended up giving it to someone with less experience and less seniority than me."
bad,Very Hot and extreme amounts of overtime. Unless your 20 - 25 and in the click you will never advance no matter how well you do your job. Very much buddy buddy system to move up in company. Also you will be laid off for about 6 - 8 weeks from Thanksgiving till after New Years
bad,All I’d say is document everything that a manager tells you they will do for you because chances are they will lie about it later. Also keep your head low and don’t cause waves because that will only put a target on your back
bad,I was a contractor and the culture was not good for contractors due to the cliques. It was a very lonely contract. The benefits were good though. Managers would include contractors on team events.
bad,"Used to work at Polaris in Spirit Lake, Iowa. Overall the facility was nice and up to date. But, if you work on the wrong line it could be rough. Arrogant and cocky supervisors and production managers. Line Engineers who feel like they own you and place all blame on you if issues arise. Get whipped for hours in 2 months. Then everything goes stale rest of year for hours and fighting unemployment office just to get enough money for food and gas to survive. A true paycheck to paycheck job."
bad,"Excellent pay if you know how to work the system: It's all about getting certified through each mod; that's how you build up your raises. Also helps if management likes you otherwise you will not be put on equipment. Long hours and Saturday work are required or you will not be in ""good standing"" Expect hours to be cut if part-time or seasonal-seems they want full time+ employees. Fire at will and work culture is low. Gossip runs rampant, lots of back stabbers. Noticed that no one get's to know your name as you will probably not work there for long. You get a number to punch in and out:that's all that is required-don't add more value or you will be expected to perform under those conditions for the rest of your career at the same pay grade."
bad,You work a ton of overtime. the insurance sucks. the pay is okay. If management was organized you would not have to work as much overtime as you do. They leave the employees in the dark about everything.
good,"You never leave the work, just the management. Was hired on by a great manager, they were promoted and replaced by a person without -any- managment experiance for a shift of 20+ people. Couldn't even do the work themselves that they were supposedly managing the team to do on high demand."
good,"Co-workers for the most part were hard working and easy to get along with."
good,A typical day at Polaris is doing the same work for 8-9 hours a day. I have learned to build motorcycle engines on the line and be a productive member of the team.
good,"I feel like polaris puts itself in a bind by taking on so many orders a year that they are only thinking about the money and not the performance of creating it. The job is not hard at all but the continuous MANDATORY overtime on weekdays and weekends is absurd and ridiculous. You make people choose between their families and keeping Polaris industries afloat. I understand working to provide for your family but Polaris takes the theory and runs way to far with it. There should be more concern for the workers safety, physical, and mental stauses verses just getting the job done. A couple people committed suicide this year and last year and know one knows why nor did it raise any concerns for any of the other workers. There should've been a meeting to let the workers know that they care about our well being and not just blow through the fact that people are losing their families and minds trying to be all that polaris is requiring of them to be and the end result....they are taking their own lives. Is the money really worth it??? Let that marinate for a minute. Thank you."
good,"The internship I had with Polaris was great! I gained experience and made great contacts in the Vermillion SD community. I was covering a maternity leave, and worked closely with the full time payroll admin. The HR manager was very organized and worked well with everyone at the SD location."
good,HR plays games with hiring qualified people. Wants to keep it local but the small town environment doesn't have the experience in manufacturing to compliment the workforce..
good,Very Busy work day flies by fast opportunity for OT/ and volunteer work. Good products and friendly environment. Profit sharing and retirement programs.
good,"Typical Job site You get what you learn . poor management . Poor HR department. Fast pace. You get out of it , what you put into it. no training. Never a fixed schedule."
good,"Polaris makes some amazing products, and are truly working to push boundaries, but the role was not what I had expected. "
good,A typical work day was consistent with a positive work environment. I wish I had a worked there fulltime instead of part-time maybe we'll have more for management
good,Some great memories and great experiences.  Could work on following their own policies and code of ethics and code of conduct a bit closer.  Some phenomenal talent has been attracted to the world of Polaris.  Only issue is the ability to keep that talent.  There seems to be a disconnect between recognizing talent and maximizing their potential.
good,"This is a very large, world wide company. They, like most businesses are driven by numbers, and that is exactly how they treat people. They have a handful of people that are actually recognized in the company, otherwise you are basically a robot just there to get products out the door."
good,"strict, fast paced, no communication, HR is really bad ND some of the managers have no clue what they are doing. This goes from cooperate all the way through the system."
good,"Short timelines for projects lead to long working days, never have enough time to consider every detail that should be looked at. "
good,Was great job with great benefits but management was not quick to discipline poor performance. Quality suffered. Plant was consolidated and shutdown with short notice and very little severance.
good,"There was very little support for my role. I worked 45-57 hours a week and didn't take breaks to try and stay on top of my work. There was just too much chaos in the department. I believe the work environment will improve over the next 12-18 months, however it isn't a good fit for an external hire."
good,"Polaris makes off road vehicles, work many weekends and  a lot of overtime. They may have their ducks in a row by now, worked many weekends even sundays."
good,"Stressful place to work, very bad communication and poor management. The culture in this place is a very interesting one, but it had become a place where everyone plays hide and seek. Never make plans on a saturday with the family, because most of the time if they didn't made their numbers, your saturday is going to be mandatory at the last minute. They are not family oriented."
good,Fast paced time goes by pretty fast with three breaks and a huge luck room that serve food so you don't have to leave the job site and have time to eat
good,The Huntsville Manufacturing Facility was relatively new when I started working for them. As it was a new facility there was lack of communication between all of the different teams involved in the manufacturing process that sometimes made it hard for the production teams to communicate what they needed from the materials operators. Sometimes this caused lines to be down for several hours at a time. Depending on how long the line would be shut down. They would either send you home or to a new area to learn or send your whole line home. Training was difficult but manageable. Might be more efficient to have an employee led training program before new hires are brought to the production lines to work full-time. Be prepared to work more than 40 hours a week some weeks due to mandatory overtime which you can be penalized for opting out of. Moderately fair pay with room for quarterly raises and performance evaluation raises based on how you are doing at your job and your determination level to learn more. Most of the management teams are very knowledgeable and friendly.
good,"never knew how many hours you would have to work."
good,No job opportunities...started out a great company to work for but they don't care about their long term employees. Bring in other employees making twice as much..human resource resources scared of managers if employees got an issue
good,"Lunches were short but they were paid lunches so that was a bonus, the machines from plant 1 were moved to other Polaris companies.  The hardest part was not having family time because the company wanted us to work a lot."
good,"Work 6-7 days a week thats ok if you dont have a life or famiy.Need pay raise and better benefits, actually enjoy it if you can enjoy work, but on a point sysyem and scared to be sick or ask off could get fired"
good,"Awesome job if you can keep it.  Design issues are hurting the brand. Great people to work with, very fast paced, but mostly professional.   Worth the ride."
good,If you don't have a degree you are not able to advance into higher level positions. It's not easy to come in as a temp and get hired on as a full time official P.I. employee.
good,"A lot of the leadership is unprofessional and the cause for a high turnover rate within the company. The product they sell is FUN and recreational vehicles, however the work environment is anything but. Competitive pay is the only reason I stayed as long as I did."
good,"Face paced and exciting place to work"
good,"typical corporate environment involving multiple departments spread across the state - outsourcing for design and construction work, access to a unique design structure"
good,"Busy work day, most of the time worked with purchasing and strategic sourcing team to resource parts to chosen suppliers and transferred tool from exit suppliers to new suppliers, reviewed and approved PPAP"
good,Poor company culture. Management has a way of making you feel terrible and like you are incapable of doing your job. Some positions are overworked and have to wear too many hats in order to make sure task are completed. Free lunch each month there no recordable injuries occur.
good,Build all types of models of a tv working a variety of your hours running power tools reading diagram troubleshooting problems standing for 8 plus hrs
good,Good place to work and learn about and how to build the atvs. Good learning and educational skills dealing with that trade. Good place to work and advance in life. Great experience. Production and floors Management is good. The h. R. Department is the only problem I saw at the Polaris Industries company
good,"Love the products.  The product discounts are really great.  Management only looks out for themselves and advancement is reserved for ""buddies"" rather than skills."
good,Went from a 500k a year company to 5 billion in less than 7/8 years. High technology dynamic work place. Management is primarily focused on covering their departments issues rather than looking at the overall solution for largesse company benefit. Company does reinvest and is committed to new industries and technologies
good,"I stayed working a Polaris for a five year period because of benefits and consistent working hours until the very end.  Then the hours became unpredictable, long and without notification of start or end times."
good,"The conditions were not the best; no heat or air conditioning. High up management was not great, the actual leads were usually pretty fair and nice. Easy and repetitive job. Pay was alright. They work really well around school schedules."
good,The company is transitioning from a small mid-cap company structure and culture to a large company structure and culture.  The management team has undergone some turnover as a result of this transition.
good,"mechanical assembly, fast paced, poor materials planning, shutdowns January February March, not enough training, hired workers not skilled for the job"
good,Its cool being able to work with power sports products and learn how they are made they supply all tools and process know how in order to have a successful productive day.
good,Be aware they have a high turn around here. They lay you off seasonally and even when you do a great job they dont call you back. They also dont do call backs. If you have had an injury on the job with them. They are great if you can get full time but if you are in the right plant that is.
good,"Great place to work, Benefits were great, Then the company decided to move to Mexico. They came back. Whish I would or could have stayed."
good,"-Quality checks on parts"
good,Enjoyed my time at Polaris. Left Polaris to pursue my passion in Accounting. It was a unique and rewarding experience working at Polaris
good,"Work, work, work and you must work at home or your supervisor thinks you do not care about your job.  40 hours a week quickly turns into 60-70 Hrs."
good,"Well-run company, meets financial goals.  Need to be a ""manufacturing person"" to work there."
good,able to run air tools able to rotate jobs
good,"3 stars for work life balance: mandatory overtime if production behind schedule with short notice, a few hours if same day, by Thursday if working Saturday that week."
good,"The culture oozed comradery. Until we were bought out by a larger company, working at Transamerican (now Polaris) was a fluid learning environment. Worked right under a savvy finance director and CFO. Was exposed to projects that challenged me which I thoroughly enjoyed."
good,Lugar de empleo muy bueno con buen salario pero pocas oportunidades
good,"My supervisor isn't knowledgeable of the welding area, just a company whip cracker. Benefits are solid, promotion is possible with degree or friends.."
good,Work eight hours a day five days a week. Big facility with lots of workers. Heated in the winters. Big parking lot for all departments. Great atmosphere inside.
good,Great products and could be a great company again.  Significant turnover among executives suggests lack of focus that previously existed.  Critical to see how how they respond to competitive challenges.
good,Polaris is a good place to work it's a steady pace an a positive attitude. You can always take ur time your not being rushed at ur job or scope of work ur allowed to work in a positive environment
good,"Very busy on the production floor."
good,I enjoyed the fast pace and work environment. The hours were great and my coworkers were like family. I enjoyed working on many different models on the Brutus line and continuling learning something new each day and facing the challenges with ease.
good,"Good employer. Human resources works for the company, not the employees.  A lot of hours but then cuts back significantly.  Feast or famine. Overall, good to their employees."
good,"Our processes and tools are years behind and we are are trying to play catch up."
good,I enjoyed my time at Taylor-Dunn / Polaris and the people I worked with. I loved the products we sold and produced and the distribution dealership network I helped build. I have many long term friends in the industry because of my relationships built over time.
good,I enjoyed working at Polaris and would still be there had I not chosen to move out of state. The pay was good for that area and they have an end of the year profit sharing bonus
good,Overall an ok place to work. Hours per week can be unpredictable. The insurance benefits are ok. The profit sharing bonuses are decent. They have employee appreciation events through out the year.
good,"Fast paced producton and assembly. Technical skills, such as paint or welding or forklift can make for a proporous career. Management professional somewhat compassionate to hourly emploees. A mix of co-workers some friendly some not, some good for you. being on concrete and repetitive work. Co-workers you can work-together with."
good,I really enjoyed my time there at Polaris.  I loved seeing all the beautiful motorcycles everyday and my co-workers made the work seem fun and enjoyable.
good,"In my opinion, Polaris is a good place to work. I have learned about teamwork and how to interact with others. The management at Polaris is decent and they know how to get the job done. The hardest part about working at Polaris is the unset work hours. We could have a ten hour workday or an eight hour workday. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is the people I work with."
good,location was not family oriented and hours shifted too much. no room for advancement. Pay scale was not all that well. Shifts were all over the place not very organized.
good,Fast paced .  Rewards for meeting goals . Lots of time off for meeting goals . Lack of loyalty. Pay is good . Lots of free t shirts for your hard work.  A lot of good hearted people. Free t shirts
good,"depends on where you ate located at as to what a day is like. warehouse is an area you can get 40+ hour weeks, frok lift driver doing different things everyday, "
good,well this is one place you can not rely on like you have a job because they so many lay off like now over 300 people are going to be jobless due one factory closer
good,"They talk a lot about internal advancement and they will, not base on skill or work performance but sucking up. Clean cool work environment that is very nice. If you wanna be stuck in the same spot you hired in at then work very hard and don't complain. After you get past the backward promotions, awful management, and low pay its good place to work."
good,"Polaris has a lot to offer fast pace work environment, competitive work field, opportunities for advancement all tied up in a small community away from the city life."
good,Good place to work and people are friendly. Not too much room for growth at the Ocseola Plant.
good,"Off-Road and On-Road groups are totally different cultures. Salary/benefits/profit sharing are good, but you will earn every penny by working 60-70 hours per week and constantly under pressure. Not much time to enjoy the product when you spend your waking moments staring at a computer screen or herding cats to complete projects. Depending on your position, there are ample opportunities to travel. Management is hit and miss, most are good but many are overworked and aren't able to focus on improvements. Don't expect any OJT after week 2, this company is not great on continuing training. However, I was constantly impressed with the level of talent that I worked with on a daily basis."
good,"Great company, tried real hard to make it a nice place to come to."
good,"A typical day depended on your position in the company. As assembly operator, you would be placed on an assembly line and given a set of instructions for your specific job. You would repeat this task until the end of the day. The line speed varied. If parts ran short, or there were problems, the line would stop or slow down. In most positions, you are required to use certain tools/equipment to complete your task. You're also responsible for checking work done prior to the unit arriving at your station."
good,"For the most part, its solid. No pay over the Holiday shutdown makes it tough, but the pay is good. Need more opportunities for training and more raises."
good,Great innovation and high performance products. Company drives innovation and strives to maintain its number one position in power sports. Continues to grow and diversify.
good,Polaris was an overall nice environment to work in. Management was very good. The only problem I had was that the plant did not always have enough parts to keep production running eight hours a day.
good,Fun place to work at. I absolutely got along with all of my coworkers they were a blessing to be around. Everyone worked hard to always meet the designated quota at all times.
good,Nice place to work for to start building a better life for yourself. Not to much of a good place if you are married with little children or new borns .
good,"overall I guess I cant complain from where I come from. People just don't care for what is going on with you or your family. Which is real sad because things happen in our lives as well as managements, but they hold things that's out of our control against us, and some situations in life you can't always get a doctors excuse for."
good,I don't have a lot to say in a review of Polaris. I only worked a few months in a contract position. I had a very good experience and would have taken a full-time hire position if one had been available.
good,"Great place to work, very fun, just be ready to sacrifice your income.  There is a huge disparity between management and ""workers"" when it comes to compensation. Unless you are already in Polaris for a long time, there is little chance for career growth."
good,"Polaris bought Indian Motorcycles so they opened up a Plant in Spearfish, SD. It is very rewarding to see the finished product when its on the show room floor"
good,"Energizing place to work.  Great leadership, long term strategies and team.  Provides great career opportunities and is innovative and cutting edge"
good,"A fun working environment, reasonably good corporate culture, very fast paced, requires someone who is fairly nimble to work with multiple simultaneous challenges."

good,"Working as Software Engineer at Polaris India Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad from January 2011 to till date it is nice environment they provide to work comfortably they take care of there employees."
good,"Dynamic pace and exciting workplace but poor internal systems."
good,"Lots of opportunities to learn.  Great fun staff that is hungry to learn and better the company.  Their are great benefits for working there from employee demos, profit sharing, health etc.  Workplace culture is quick paced and you must adapt to change quickly.  Hardest thing to do is manage work/life balance."
good,"Within my position, I have the opportunity to collaborate with many departments, which allows me to learn and is a challenge..Very enjoyable position."
good,I put the shocks and springs together and make hubs so the station for tires can put the tires on to make a unit. we would build different units from day to day.
good,"Good place to work ,good pay,good  benefits ,good hours,good work environment ,good people to work with. "
good,Polaris is a great place to work if you like assembly work. It is a more fast paced work environment. They were very focused on quality with everything that is produced.
good,High energy facility. Fun to be part of the up and coming off and on road vehicles. Ensuring the correct specifications were met for national versus international vehicles was very important
good,"It's a solid job I'm just working with a temp service which is coast. They told me in 90days I would get a raise and I have been there 8,9 months & still haven't considered giving me one. I'm a good hard worker, and also easy to get along with. I like the job, the people, and also like what I do."
good,"if you are on the right team, people all get along well & work to move the group forward for the benefit of all & the company. fun environment with smart, passionate people."
good,"Polaris is a fast paced, highly competitive work environment. As a District Retail Manager, I had to learn to be highly agile and adaptable in my approach to driving retail for the dealers I cover as well as revenue for the corporation."
good,"I have worked for this company for 10 years and then they said they were closing so I went to school in hopes to utilize that experience and hoping a degree in business management would help me obtain another job in either manufacturing or in a business office that I could learn and grow with all my experiences. I worked as an assembler for several years and then was in materials until I went to school. I worked in an office for three months before returning to Polaris for another two years of work. Basically I have done general labor with assembly and done shipping, receiving, parts delivery to the assembly lines, picked the parts, unloaded trailers and loaded trailers.  The company was still under part of the restructure with personnel and leadership when I decided to leave and try an office job as I was not feeling that there was much chance for advancement even with all the experience and a degree due to all the changes the company was still going through."
good,"Working at Polaris was a great experience where I learned a lot of new skills. They do take care of their employees. "
good,a newer distribution center.  lower management was typically helpful and told you what was needed for the day or month.  Slower Paced than Amazon but you do need to be moving quickly to get your numbers
good,Good place to work and help provide for your family.  Days are good and nights are better.  Evertyone there likes to work and be productive eachxh and every night
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, and I was allowed to feel free to add my input without judgment. As a contractor I was also allowed to participate in come of the company activities which gaive a feeling of inclusion."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Polaris, i found the work to be challenging and i found that they weren't afraid to give you work that was above your ability in order to create challenge and opportunity and room for potential advancement. All of my co-workers were really fun to work with, and everyone shares the common goal of wanting the company to be successful, there is a lot of pride at the company for the success of the company. I learned technologies that i never thought i'd touch while in the position, and this has propelled my career forward. Polaris has grown fast in recent years and this brings a lot of new opportunities."
good,"Lots of good things to say about the company including an awesome product, great work culture, vehicle perks, and profit sharing."
good,"Extremely competitive environment with very top-heavy compensation structure.  Although, DSMs were paid fairly, the work-life balance was challenging.  Buying into the Polaris culture is the key to staying in the Polaris game as you progress through your career there.  There will be opportunities for advancement, and they will be rapid and plentiful."
good,My experience with polaris was short because of the change of jobs and my health was not right. I tried different methods to succeed as an employee.  didn't like the pace of work
good,Good company growing fast and with oportunities in the manufacturing areas.
good,"The company is a very typical Minnesota company with great work life balance, decent pay and friendly coworkers. The benefits are good with the extra perks of getting to use the products."
good,"Polaris is a leader in the power sports industry.  The fast response to its customers and the customer loyalty is key to our success.  The environment is very fast past.  A typical day at work could be running a requirement gathering meeting, or spending an entire day transition documentation into templates.  We could have an all day/Week Testing with a project team, or a 4 hr conference call to our Asia team on training of the new software.  Creating communications to learning how to query, there is no typical day at Polaris.  The culture encourages this.  You are not a project manager, engineer, or buyer, you are a Polaris employee.  The most enjoyable part of the job is you will never get bored.  There are always a challenge."
good,"Enjoyed the interaction with customers and associates,  Left due to new schedule of 4 days on 2 off, was hard to balance time with family and friend"
good,The company looks to advance employees within the company before they advertising outside the company. Which gives employees something to work for.
good,Polaris is a growing company. Many opportunities for growth. Company is forward looking and on the fast track to new development.
good,"Get to work half hour before shift starts to go over daily production schedule. Make sure there are enough parts to start daily production in Team area and order right away if not. Give morning meeting with Team and go over any issues from previous day. Keep Team running smoothly assisting with any issues that may happen. Report end of day to Supervisor and make sure there are parts for next shift to start. "
good,They need a better health care policy. I rarely go to the doctor but if i did i woyld have to pay 1200 deductible before it paid 80/20. So its like i dont even have insurance.
good,Plenty of opportunity to advance in the company if you have the required skills and educational background. Competitive pay grade. Worldwide brand name recognition.
good,I had to hit rock bottom before I found my spot in this place. I would enjoy going back one day if I could. Sadly I had to move away and start over aging in another place.
good,"Small town, mostly good people. Offers great benefits. Most of the shifts went by quickly. They have a cafeteria which is nice too. If you want to move to Roseau then its a good place to work."
good,"The work is very up and down. One week you'll be working +40 hrs and the next you'll be waiting for parts for 3 days. The co-workers were decent for the most part. A few supervisors were good, but mostly they just look out for themselves and will step on just about anyone to get ahead. The line ""if there's a problem let us know"" was quite common. Then again not doing anything to alleviate the issue was just as common. "
good,I enjoyed my internship at Polaris. Management was great and I was given tough projects to work on which helped me develop. I would definitely recommend working here.
good,I wish I could still be working here because they treat their employees very very well. The pay is very excellent and the benefits are the best thing for the employees.
good,Works not very hard and never had to worry about job security. Always more work to be done. Definitely will keep you busy.
good,"first i clock in then i find which machine i work on go to it set it up for that part it is in production, clean my work area if needed, inspect the part for any defects then cut/assemble the part then put it in a box intended for its location.  I learned what was acceptible according to the parts which is known as quality assurance. worked well with others helped my co workers all the time. the most enjoyable part of my job was talking and helping out my fellow co workers"
good,"Supervised the tubing department, worked with great people. Gained extremely valuable Lean manufacturing training and experience. Was trained in Toyota lean problem solving methods by a former Toyota executive. I was also able to ride and test the latest snowmobiles, ATV's, UTV's, and Motorcycles from Polaris and Victory. Really fun place to work. Unfortunately Polaris closed the manufacturing facility and moved it to Monterey Mexico. Great job, hard to lose. Would definitely work for Polaris again if I had the chance."
good,"Everyone is willing to help you and train you, the employees are very nice.  You change jobs after each break so your not stuck on the same thing all day long."
good,"Polaris was a good place to work in the small community of Roseau. Family picnics in the summers, profit sharing in winter, make for something to look forward to."
good,Non-stop moving from the time you clock in until you clock out.  The line can not stop you must keep it stocked. It's your job to inform the next shift of any shortages to keep the line from stopping.
good,Great people to work with and easy to pick up and learn the jobs. Great work environment and the line leads are helpful. It is a lot of fun on and off the line.
good,Overall Polaris is a good company to work at. The pay and benefits are pretty on par with the cost of living for the area. They are a Lean based company and therefore are very structured with their processes and material flow from raw to finished goods. There is opportunity for career advancement.
good,Fast paced environment. Your normally always working by people so it’s easy to talk and have fun as long as your getting your job done. They will make sure you get the hang of your job before leaving you on your own.

good,I liked the company love the job. They make good products just had issues with 40 hours at the time I left. When I first started it was crazy working 12 hour days 6 days a week. Then they shut Victory down and work got slower. I decided it was time for a career change.

good,I had work with Polaris for Four and a half year. IT was ok but a lot of days were a pain in the butt. The people tho made it nice to work there from time to time

good,"I enjoy working at Polaris however, it is a temporary construction job. I would like to have a more permanent place to work so I can provide for my family without the fear of the job coming to an end"
good,"A typical day at Polaris Industries consists of work pertinent to the operations of a distribution center. From working at Polaris I have learned hands on how operations is applied in a real world setting, and how to operate various heavy machinery. The management is transparent, goal oriented, social, and fun to work under. Typical co-workers are mostly comprised of college students. Thus providing a fun work environment in which to work along side friends. The hardest part of the job is dealing with temperature. The warehouse reflects the outside temperature and can be very cold and very hot at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things about operations and management, and the ability to work hard and have my efforts reflected by tracking productivity."
good,"I worked as a contractor for Polaris Industries.	"

good,"over all it was a great place to work and the culture there was great, they were very flexible with work/life balance. I enjoyed the 8 years I was there but decided to do something new."
good,Day at Polaris is very quick and easy. very fast paced environment. The management and staff are very polite. The job duties are not at all hard. Overall its a very family oriented company. Pay is on the low end in my personal opinion. I feel they pay should be hirer and that's one thing that hurts the company and causes a high turnover rate because companies around the Huntsville Polaris are starting out paying hire rates than Polaris and that is what hurts the company.
good,"Polaris Industries is a great place to work if you like to assemble.  I liked it, but when it came down to it, I like the food industry versus the factory industry."
good,Cool place to work. Everyone is passionate about the outdoors. The building is cool and there is a lot of great marketing of the products inside the building to get you excited about your job.
good,I found I really liked the culture there. They listen to thier employees concerns. Benifits are great. You work hard but are paid fairly. My manager was competent and professional. Safety is one of the top concerns.

good,Polaris is a great place to work if you are looking for the ability to make immediate positive change.  The company grew so quickly so there are many opportunities to innovate and contribute.
good,Muy buen comedor transporte todo perfecto gracias.
good,It's a good job pay is good always full time breaks are a little short and the work is not very fast paced so its easy to get tired when getting trained 3rd shift and kind of a high goal everyday so they make you feel afraid of losing your job but good place nice people
good,Overall a good company.  Very fast paced work environment and very passionate people.  Company closely watched quarterly results and will adjust plans accordingly to make budget
good,"Polaris' vision is to fuel the passion of riders, workers and outdoors enthusiasts around the world by delivering innovative, high-quality vehicles, products, services and experiences that enrich their lives."
good,I'm a very hard worker & Im always willing to learn new things that would help me on my other skills I'm a quick learner no more then a day for me to learn
good,"Great place to work, lots of advancement opportunities in a fast-growing industry-leader. Only constraints are that most operations, production, manufacturing and corporate jobs are limited to midwestern region."
good,The company has been very selective in choosing their employees for their skill sets as well as how well they would fit within the teams. The company genuinely cares about their employees and tried to ensure a good work / life balance. They encourage employees to make use of company provided off road vehicles and are very open to feedback for improvements. Very solid company with good pay and benefits.
good,good company.  Pretty strait forward for a distribution center.  Id say that this place offers better benefits than most though.
good,I enjoyed building snowmobiles for the company. It was a friendly work environment. The team leads & supervisors were helpful.
good,"Assembled parts for ATV's, Watercraft, Snowmobiles, and Motorcycles. Learned a lot."
good,"Polaris was a great place to work. The culture is very supportive of out-going people and individuals that love the out doors. However, Polaris is a fairly cut throat environment and if you aren't providing the value that they believe you should be providing they will be happy to replace you. They won't give you a heads up or an explanation."
good,One can experience a lot of learning. Good exposure and support to / from the senior level team. They understand employees well and treat them accordingly.
good,A very fast paced environment. I feel that the benefits and pay are not to Alabama standards. Also that experience should count for something. The hours are also off structure for the area.
good,Best part of job was traveling to different sites and states. Able to test drive units. Use stae of the art testing equipment. Work with engineers and management to further the product
good,"Polaris is a factory. Good place to work, I would recommend Polaris to any of my friends and family. I really didn't want to quit, but my body wasn't strong enough to with stand the cement flooring. Also, unless you were sleeping with or knew the right people you wouldn't advance up. Some of the managers never really took the line workers seriously, and treated them poorly. However, I was lucky enough to have some of the few managers that actually cared about you and listened to your problems and concerns. If I could physically work there without pain, I would go back in a heart beat."
good,Its fun until the managers slow you down from all the task you have to complete them they try to hold you on the account of something they did wrong but other than that a cool place to work

I work with a great team of people with a single goal in mind; delivering the an awesome product to all the great people that drive Polaris. It's a family. Innovative, working hard, walking away from my job at the end of the day feeling like I put it all on the floor. Sense of satisfaction. Been working for Polaris for 3 years and can honestly say that I like this job better then any other job I've ever had. Definitely recommended.  Build it, drive it, live it is not just words."
good,"Polaris is one of the best jobs ive had, only reason im leaving is to be closer to home. the hours are alittle demanding, 12 hour shifts, 2 on 2 off, and every other weekend, 7pm to 7am."
good,I have worked at Polaris for almost 6 years.I work from 6-230. I have become a effective leader and built my leaderships skills during my time at Polaris. I have a great supervisor who has taught me a lot.  I lead a small group of people within my department.

The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see the results of your own success in the workplace."
good,"I worked my way up in the company until I was in the tooling department, so I was pretty content with the roles I had. Some of the people that worked on the line were not very happy with their jobs, but I was. I miss the people there. I had to re-locate, so if not for that I would still be there."
good,"Getting the job at Polaris was the best thing that had ever happened to me. My family as so proud of me, I worked so hard within the probation period to make sure I was there on time every day that I was scheduled to work.

We had a super clean, well organized , well run department. Pot lucks, it seemed like weekly were going on, regular information meetings, update meetings, we had a stand up meeting every morning on what was coming up in the next few day's, where we needed to be on schedule for Friday.....overtime was present and for the most part on a voluntary basis for Saturdays. Otherwise we always tried to make up our time during the week....I worked 6-2:30 awesome hours, killer time off during Nov.- Jan. Voluntary lay-offs if wanted....lost my job in 2011..most devastating day of my life, best job, best company, best people....."

good,"I loved working for Polaris Industries, Polaris Acceptence. At the time of my employment, I had to make necessary changes."
good,"Nice atmosphere to learn work, good teammates..Company gave me all the freedom to grow...I have learned Corporate culture in this Company.."
good,Polaris industries is a very awesome place to work at with great co-workers and a very friendly and kind staff. Pretty much a typical day at the workplace would be assembling awesome off road toys that every person loves to ride. Also just like every other job there is a hard part to it and for me I was putting in the engines and also crating them up which is one of the hardest and most physical job to perform with the facility.  All in all I loved the job it was pretty far away in a different state and chose to come back home to Michigan to exceed in my education.
good,Ay un excelente ambiente de trabajo y oportunidad de crecer y muchas prestaciones
good,Encouraged and empowered to continuously improve the organization and products.
