rating,review
good,I get to work on a variety of greenfield projects where I can pick the technologies I use. I've been able to get experience with a variety of cutting-edge tech which has been enjoyable. The pay is great and the expectation to deliver is low so it's a rather great gig. The problem is there's no consistent direction and quite a few of the projects I've worked on have gone nowhere and not because the project failed but because whoever asked for it no longer wanted it. It's hard watching all that work be laid aside time and time again.
good,"at At&T you can work on the latest in industry,spend on projects that others are hesitant to take initiatives  ,ATT research help improve industry standards.Work place culture is really awesome for me I love here,Hardest part of the job is when you don,t have a job to do...means transition time between one project to another."
good,AT&T was good to me and allowed me to advance into management after proving myself as an associate.  Training and Tuition is available and they have steadily improved over the years.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your ideas being put into place and making a big difference in the workflow and bottom line.  Dealing with absenteeism was the hardest part of the job since there are at times many different functions that need addressed on a daily basis in the production environment.  The workplace culture has steadily improved as well with more employee appreciation and teamwork being recognized.
good,"Es una excelente empresa el cual puedes trabajar con un muy buen ambiente laboral, es agradable estar en esta empresa por que no solo somos empleados, tambien somos personas importartantes"
good,I enjoy working for AT&T and the benefits & discounts can not be beat.  It's a great ethical company to work for.  Job security is the biggest downfall.  We have been through lay offs 4 times this year.

good,"Over-all after 28 years I can honestly say AT&T was an awesome Company to work for.  The Departments and Contractors I worked with were the BEST...... There were the ever-present challenges of putting in many hours per Project to achieve a successful outcome, and time away from Home, but in the end it paid off with the development of rapport with Customers that made them want to  continue their relationship with AT&T.It was nice to know  that I helped create that outcome."
good,"Until there was an unexplained change in policy regarding co-location, AT&T was a great place to have spend almost all of my career! if you do get an opportunity, do grab a job here. The only reasons for me to leave would be to try and advance in career."
good,"Un día de trabajo Típico era revisar productividad de puntos de Venta  de los diferentes canales (Retail, Venta Directa, Canal Alterno, CAP& CAES), buscar estrategias según ubicación para poder incrementar ventas y posicionar a la Compañía como un operador confiable de Comunicación, al tener varios canales de Venta aprendes a optimizar las estrategias según  canal, aprendes a trabajar bajo objetivos y lograrlos, ya que se establecen metas el logro de las mismas nos permite obtener un mayor ingreso, por parte de la dirección y Gerencia se conto con el apoyo necesario para el logro de los resultados, una comunicación personal y acertada."

good,"At&T has amazing healthcare and benefits packages, in addition to an open and fun work environment. No complaints about the caliber of employees; however, the company is growing rapidly and experiencing it's own growing pains. You MUST be comfortable with EVER changing strategy and goals, and slow career growth"
good,Good Company with Good Pay. I would recommend working here. It is a fast paced and ever changing company with loads of opportunity if you are willing to relocate.
good,"You need to be very competitive to be successful at ATT.  You also need to be prepaired to join the IBEW union. There are a variety of shifts, but bids are strictly tenure based."
good,"AT&T is an excellent company with opportunities for career advancement at every level. The benefits package, pay, and paid time off are strong. Most of the leaders I dealt with are good people, but with any company, there are a few I would rather not work with."
good,"This was not an hourly paid position but a commission and an overall base pay agreement met with Organization and Standards!  "
good,"Great place to work with great benefits. This is a very stable company that has been around since the dawn of the telephone. However, because it is so stable, do not expect a lot of upward mobility."
good,"I worked in the new 20/20 work environment, which allowed continuous networking and collaboration.  Balanced work life and home life was high priority."
good,AT&T is an amazing place to work.  The culture of perpetual learning and personal advancement is second to none.  There is always work to do and plenty of horizontal movement available.
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for, they have a wonderful diversity and inclusion policy. They strictly adhere to this policy and are supporters of each individuals uniqueness"

good,"nice enviroment, good managers, very competitive "
good,AT&T offers great benefits and comfortable work surroundings.  The only problem is lay-offs with the probability to return to current or a different position. The testing for a position may be hard to some.
good,"Lots of fun, Great people. Poor compensation. Have to go into alot of smelly houses, customers with terrible attitudes. People are fun to work with and you get to work at you home pace."
good,"At&t was a great career and provided great compensation and benefits.  After the divestiture, it was even better.  At that time is was Southwestern Bell.  When it went back to being At&t global, that is when the benefits started being cut, and the senior employees were being replaced by minimum wage workers"
good,"The job as a technical support specialist can be stressful, as people are relying on your expertise for communication. When you are able to resolve the problems, its very satisfactory."
good,This job keeps you on your toes. The customers are interesting and different. Situations can change the environment quickly. The meetings are intense and you must be above reproach in carrying out your duties.
good,"Employees have to get accustom to quick changes in processes and demands, very competitive with demanding hours and not for people who get offended easily. Quick paced.."
good,"A typical day at work with the union employees was fun, I learned and was trained in almost everything that dealt with sales and culture ongoing, the management team that reported to me was the best work family I could ask for, the culture within the office was a work in progress but we supported each other, the hardest part of the job were the goals that were changed all the time right in the middle of a month, and the most enjoyable part of the job was hands down the people in the call center."
good,"AT&T has great benefits and work life balance; however, since the DirecTV merger there has been continual layoffs leading to a lack of job security."
good,Good career job but in a disappearing industry...will have to climb poles and go in customer residences..ATT technical school is one of the best around..
good,"This place is the pits. You start out making barely minimum wage. You are given a sales goal and if you do not reach the goal you do not get any commission. You are placed in a tiny store with several other employees where customers rarely appear, so when they come in you have to basically rush to them to get any kind of commission. The management took it personally when you asked for time off and they were happy to promise you whatever you wanted to hire you only to pull the rug from under you when you reminded them of their promises. Have a personal life? Kiss it goodbye."

good,Would love to go back and work for At&t. Very competitive pay and they care about their employees.  Always room for growth and they have a great benefits package including a 401K where they match dollar for dollar.
good,I love working for this company it was the best job i have had so far. the reason im not working with them now is that i thought i was going to move and it didn't work out and at the same time the company was changing managers so i would have to interview over again so i didn't go back.but this is a wonderful company to work for.
good,att has good benefits but strict guidelines about answering phones. its like a grading system. the pay was ok but I believe its much better now. its was almost ten years ago since I worked there
good,"In the early 2000s the pay and compensation bonuses were amazing. I made a ton of money had great friends and enjoyed the people I worked with, Once AT&T completely took over the BellSouth Company the culture changed to what it is now, which is all about sales and not what the customer needs"

good,"I learned many different computer programs used in the analysis of cable replacement plus Excel & Microsoft Word.  I was in the Rehab Analysis Organization.  Management and union employees worked well together, mutual respect for each others work and ethics.  The hardest part of my job was trying to determine exactly where the technicians in the field were requesting cable replacement when they didn't prove all the information needed to locate it on a map.  That was also my most enjoyable part of my job, it was like trying to solve a mystery with only bare minimal information."

good,"It's a great place to work, but it can be difficult to meet numbers at times, however, if you have a great leadership team you won't be discouraged and will succeed.  You just have to be receptive to feedback and coaching."
good,"As a Data Network Account Executive I was able to advance my technical sales skills."
good,"Good Place to work"
good,"Within the telecommunications world you have to be ready for change and AT&T is consistent with change. The environment is one of work and fun combined, but can be tedious with schedules and flexibility. It is a full time position, requires the ability to research and exert patience with customers and management alike. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a positive attitude while being in a difficult situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people around you and the family vibe."
good,"A great company, their were many opportunity for advancement, great benefits for the time I work there, but as many company's benefits, and opportunities has change, but overall still a great company to work for."

We also had continuous on the job training for any updates in computer functions or job functions. I especially enjoyed the rapport I had with co workers and the field technicians,managers and other inter-company employees, as we all  had to work together to make sure the customers were happy and service was working properly. I learned the importance of teamwork and being able to do a job I wasn't sure I could handle. The hardest part was mostly being overloaded with work at times. We also enjoyed office parties to celebrate birthdays and promoting company products. Overall, I enjoyed my career."
good,Awesome work culture. Lots of room to grow and advance your career.  Management and leadership is great at communication and setting expectations to employees.

good,"I love AT&T and I would continue to work for them, but to advance it requires me moving to undesired location. AT&T had a great remote worker policy but as the company changes, so do their needs."
good,"Initially it was bit challenging to me but slowly I picked up the things and given the deliverable on time and learnt lot of work."
good,"Start the day off by getting job assignments for the day. Verify you have the proper equipment loaded on your van."
good,This is a good job. You get to work outside and see some beautiful homes. You can't be afraid of heights or small spaces. Technology is always changing and this is challenging. The more work you can complete the more money you can make.
good,I enjoyed my time at AT&t met a lot of good people co workers as well as customers. I can actually say it felt like I had a second family when I worked there.
good,easy going and a great place to see balance in. hardest part about this is not getting to talk to customers or getting a job to land on you after running your main routes. In this line of work you learn of how to be a big team player instead of being just a 1 man crew.  the most enjoyable part of this job is you get to communicate with every one and customers and being able to help them to get what they are looking for and getting the job done to how they like and wanted to be done.
good,A  great company to work for without needing a college degree. Great training to successfully do your job. Better insurance then comparable companys and good amount of vacation time. Work inviroment is good. Being a installer/repairer you work alone most of the time but when help is readly available needed. Management does its best to give adequate training and support to acomplish goals. The best part of the job was being to provide the customer great service installing new service or repairing existing. For me the hardest part of the job was not beining able to resolve issues due to the sorce of the problem.
good,"Eight hour workdays, fielding inbound calls for technical support and billing questions. Working in a team environment. Learn how to make use of company based tools and tools for Apple iOS support."

good,"AT@T is a great place to work. The company offers opportunities for advancement and encourages continuing education. The office atmosphere, though structured is one where ""down time""  is available. At the office, there is a pool table , big screen TV with the latest games attached and so much more. The hardest  part of  the job is the sales quota imposed on the customer service rep, which can be daunting if you don't see yourself as a salesman. The company offers the best healthcare and vacation package around."
good,Great place to work. Friendly atmosphere. Fast paced and never boring. Job advancement opportunities. Great benefits package. Good commission checks for outstanding sales reps.

good,Room for advancement. Great people. Overall great job with benefits. Flexible hours. I enjoyed working for this company. Installing cable meeting new people always a positive.
good,"Meet and greet customers, learned a lot about sales in a retail environment and how to lead a team of sales professionals. You rely on your fellow team members to get vital information about promotions and merchandise as well as motivation. Management could use more work but overall the team of sales professionals is where you learn the ins and outs of the business. Hardest part of the job is having to be on your feet all day but if you can keep working without getting complacent then you in for nothing more than success."
good,"When I was here I never had to worry abut money, we were constantly getting prizes and being awarded awesome incentives through AT&T, the stock options as well as benefits were amazing, however I was never home and my days off were never really days off since customers had my card and number."
good,"AT&T was the development of myself, Everything I know about sales, customer service skills, building relationships all came from their Management. They develop you into being the best you can be."
good,"Its a competitive work environment rules by numbers and productivity. The pressure is on for you to excel and meet quotas every day. Customer service is held in very high regard and the customer is always right, which as an employee makes you strive to be the best that you can be. i only wish that the compensation was better due to the fact we are paid about $10.00 less a hour then our closest competitor Frontier Communications."

We work with customers to build a complete solution that would meet their needs from simply mobile phone services, to home services and security systems. A rapidly growing company in many different fields of service. I loved that there was always something new to learn and the promote growth within the company. Unfortunately the positions are limited in the Louisville area, and moving away for a management position at this time doesn't work with my family."

good,most of the days were pretty busy depending on the location i was in . the manager was well organized and extremely fair when it came to scheduling and work duties. easy to learn systems as well
good,"Great Company!  The benefits keep me here. The insurance is great and affordable. They are paying for my college! I just wish the compensation did not continue to decrease, but I do see the benefits/comp as a package deal. As far as management goes, the business partners are silo . The job is not hard, but you will deal with your share of jerks. Corporate politics, and just remember, it's not what but who you know if you want to advance."

Being a Trainer, they groomed me to handle great pressure while supervising and managing responsibilities in a timely manner. I enjoy working here because I am able to meet a lot of people. One of the hardest thing that I had to encounter was to get adjust to the switch shifts, but with the help of my manager, co-workers and family it was easy for me to adjust."
good,"This was the best job I have had yet. The office culture was professional yet relaxed. We were all college students, therefore we all had something in common. We chose when we worked and for how long. The only restriction was that it is a part time job. We had vacation time as well as discounts from ATT services. Unfortunately,  the company took a different direction and we were outsourced to Malaysia and India."
good,"Sales driven days are fun when busy.  There is always a ""what have you done for me today"" company culture.  There is an attendance point system that is unforgiving when it comes to emergencies."

Learned how to install high speed internet, phones and television services in homes, and how to run and operate all equipment tied to the use of. Management was great but I think the communication between departments needed to be stronger. Co-workers were very helpful when needed and very informative with years of experience. The hardest part was trying to learn new information on equipment and procedures in a limited time. What I enjoyed most about the job was getting to help and meat new people in my field of work and attempting to learn anything new about it"
good,AT&T Alascom was a great place to work and the people were a great bunch of people. The company cared about their employees and the workload was never too much.
good,"Working at AT&T has taught me great organizational skills, time management, and how to work well with others.

I am constantly challenged with client requests in a secure enterprise data center environment.  AT&T management is very open to the engineering staff in regards to recommendations and seeks advice on a daily basis.  Life at AT&T is rewarding as the company notices and rewards outstanding service to both the company and its clients.
good,Great place to work depending on organization.  Some organizations are well known for their investment in people while others are too reactive in their day to day operations that development is not a priority.  Many of the cultures are positive and I would highly recommend this company.

Take advantage of the training courses and tuition reimbursement, as they prefer to promote within and having building your skillset is the only way to move up."
good,The best telecommunications company in the world. I learned to view my job with a focus in how my activity can support the core business areas and how my job can open ways to increase the sales and reduce losses.

good,"Although I left due to lack of advancement potential, this in no way should detract from working for DIRECTV.  It was a BIG small company and felt like it.  They were family and community minded and truly cared for the customer.  I can't speak for all call centers or managers company-wide but the culture was in place for excellence at all levels.  Highly recommend it as a great place to work."
good,AT&T has good learning scope and very good work culture where you don't feel like leaving the company. There will be no one who watches you continuously and keep on monitoring. We will have freedom of work which I love the most.
good,"This was my first call center experience.  I was nervous about working for such a reputable company and what would be expected of me.  "
good,AT&T is a very nice employer and gives you the opportunity to grow in the company in as little as 6 months. Also most of the benefits are really nice. I would recommend this workplace to anyone who likes helping others.
good,at&t has been a great experience..however the needs of the business have changed & my service is no longer needed.I enjoyed my job and worked hard at it.I showed up all the time & built great friendships.Testing for my position was tuff and learning all the systems was a challenge.After becoming an expert being surplussed hurts to my core.Now I must seek new employment and a new life adventure.
good,High pressure but very comfortable place to work. About 50% of my job is performed remotely. Great team of supportive coworker. Working at AT&T gives you a doorway into emerging technologies. Management is cool and flexible within the wireless/mobility division.
good,"Great place to work. The company provides an excilent environment that allows team building and growth. The company provides the opportunity to interact with great clientele and perform a problem/solution based attitude to create future clientele. "
good,"I loved this job and was saddened when I was laid off.  The job was very diverse and every day was different.  I worked with mechanics, vendors, supervisors, drivers, and support people in other divisions. I started with this company and knew nothing about vehicles, but in the time I was there, I learned quite a bit about the workings of a vehicle.  Being contracted to AT&T brought me in contact with numerous people on many levels and the relationships built with all of these wonderful people was a blessing.  Helping people learn how to do paperwork, or get the right task codes, or finding a part, or just going the extra mile to help things run smoothly was the most rewarding part of my job.  Team work and a positive attitude made the job enjoyable.  The hardest part of my job was saying good bye to a great group of people."
good,I used my customer service and technical skills to help sale and resolve problems for customers to help boost my rapport  and sales with customers.
good,"After 6 months of service with USA Mobility, I was promoted to management for a 2 state geographical region and quickly promoted to corporate management. I worked for both a 4 State and 4 warehouse inventory management system and managed Human Resources, Accounts Receivable/Payable, Large Account Management, Project Management, etc... I enjoyed the job and made good friends at work. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being there!"
good,"Too many numbers to meet by management, not enough focus on customer.  Job is too structured and employees not allowed to think on their own."
good,A great opportunity to help others and be hands on with all of the new technology. High stress towards goals creating a very pushy sales environment.
good,"I worked at DIRECTV before the AT&T merger, so some of my experiences may no longer apply. Your satisfaction will depend on your department and your direct manager.  I had both fabulous and mediocre.  Great managers give you lots of career development and push you to do things out of your comfort zone - but are still there to back you up if you need it.  Other managers just have you do the same thing day-after-day.  They had re-orgs almost yearly.  If you survive a re-org, your desk tends to move.  Some employees moved yearly.  Be friendly and learn about other's roles in other departments, this will help you seek other opportunities and you can climb the corporate ladder.  I watched one manager skyrocket to Vice President in 5 years. Others languished in the same non-management role for decades.  Good salary and benefits. I learned a lot of new skills and confidence in my work!"
good,"Same benefits as Walmart, but higher compensations and great benefits.  More technical and soft personal training opportunities. Company under went monolopy Divestiture in1985 and was always in forced management layoffs since the beginning of my hire.  Layoffs eventually affected my team in 2004.  I left the company with many good skills and experiences that I use today."
good,"The day consisted of reviewing data, motivating direct reports, interacting with 3rd party sellers. AT&T taught me how to hire, train, educate, and manage direct reports. My co-workers and I worked together as a team. The most difficult part of the job was imposing discipline in accordance with AT&T guidelines."
good,"Helping customers everyday while resolving everyday issues. I learned that not everyone has the same needs and how diversely you work with individuals, both customer and work related. Management was fair for the most part and ask you to drive to succeed. My co-workers were fun to work with and encouraged me to succeed. We all had each others back!"

good,Answering phones and servicing our customers.  I learned that the customer always comes first and that sales was the hardest part for me for I really enjoyed working with the customer to get their problem or issue resolved.  At at&t we were like family
good,"Like any position the job has more to do with management then the actual work. Management can make or break any position, in this case the management is only getting better but high level management seems to think front line employees are idiots. The pay more than makes up for the idiocy and the benefits are great."
good,"Restocking new inventory and making sure everything is accounted for, closing out cash drawers at the end of night and making nightly deposits."
good,Easy going job and  having fun making the customers feell like family co workers are easy to get along with the dm is even easy to get along with and is always willing to help when needed

good,Derive the most enjoyment from collaborating with clients to develop business solutions that provide maximum impact to their business. The more difficult part of this collaboration effort involves working with multiple vendors/carriers to implement those business solutions.
good,"Find out assigned concession with Bon Apetit Supervisor.  Report and set up with concession manager.  This was pretty fun job since you don't know the concession you will be serving.  It was challenging when some were in their ways of setting up, so you adjust.  Otherwise I have had an entertaining time especially when the Giants made it to the World Series on my first season,"

good,"Worked with this company for over 10 years and had a blast doing it. Was laid off in 2010 but went back briefly in 2011. I learned many job skills that carried over into my current line of work and others I'm am still yet to use. Management was tricky, but workable for the most part. Most mgr's started from among the ranks as myself so you knew who you were dealing with. The was a union based job that did right by family and I for many years."
good,"Enjoyed working for a global leader in communications. The people that make up the body of AT&T make the difference in what orgnaization you work in with the company. People make the difference. Served in several roles - Workforce Management, Payroll & Attendance, Technical Support and Peer Counseling."

good,"From the moment I walked in I was helping customers with bill issues, cell phones, and explaining cell phone plans. AT&T was a company that always kept us knowledgeable about the most recent technology. I had lots of training on cell phones like the IPhone and the different technologies that we offered. The days were long but being so busy you never felt the long hours. I worked from 9am to 6pm on some days and typically worked every weekend. It was a great learning experience."

good,"it was an extraordinary opportunity, I have learned many things,"

good,"Day starts out with a morning meeting. We pick up a job and call the customer to verify order and address. Give them an estimated ETA and go to the premise. Once there we greet the customer and give them a service promise, a list of goals we hope to attain for the customer. Next we go to the Network Interface Device (NID), provided that one is there, and put a tone on it. We head to the crossbox and verify sync (signal) is coming from the CO and is within AT&T standards. Once sync is attained we wire up a cross jumper to the binding post that is toning back to the customers house. We go back to the customers house and verify sync at the NID. If sync is not present or there are errors on line we troubleshoot the line (i.e. find new pair, run new drop, etc.) or escalate it to a service technician. If sync is present we go inside the house and plan the building of customers network. This includes drilling in walls, dropping new lines from attics, running cat5 to modem and more. Once the modem is connected to NID with CAT5 we hook up the set top boxes and back feed dial tone from the modem to the rest of the house. Next we connect devices to internet whether it is hard wired or wireless (i.e. computers, ipads, printers, phones, switches, etc). We also configure router for custom SSID, passwords, hide SSID, change channels for better speed or coverage, firewalls, installing security software, etc. "

good,"A typical day at work for me would be managing, organizing, and bringing the best out of every one around me. I've learned that in order to be a Great Supervisor you have to learn how to be a selfless leader of people. I love the people I work with and we work as a team to accomplish the same goal.

The best part of my job is interacting with my Team and putting smiles on our customers faces."

good,"I functioned as an office manager at this company. My daily duties were answering phones, handling all interaction with customers. Assisting sales representatives in any way needed, while making sure that all resources needed to complete their tasks was readily available. The hardest part of the job was probably around deadlines. It would get a little hectic supporting 10 to 15 employees who all needed my assistance at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job was definitely getting to work with some of the greatest people around."
good,"Develop and attain customer experience and sales objectives for store. Sell all products and services offered by the Company. Meet all sales objectives.

good,"I have learned so much from my experience with this compant.  While intially starting from a clerical position, I was able to grow and advance to project management."
good,It just depends on what department you find yourself in.  At&t's attendance policy is very demanding.  There are NO excuses whatsover.  An occurence is an occurence and you won't be able to move into other departments if you don't have perfect attendance or close to it.  Keep that in mind.
good,Love my job even though my I am currently going through a surplus in my department. AT&T is a great place to work and I have been able to learn so much.
good,"Review cases coming up dealing with CPS.  Gave me an idea of how the system works for the children that are removed from their home and placed in foster care.  Wonderful staff to work with and I learned how difficult it is to make decisions that affect the children.  Hardest part is reading how the children have suffered and how long they have endured this pain.  Most enjoyable is a positive outcome, whether it be children returned to parents or adopted"
good,I worked for At&t for 7 years and would not have stayed there if it was not a good job. I made 50k a year consistently and have met a lot of friends and would not trade the experience there for the world.
good,"Typical day was busy"
good,"I wish i never left! If you're lucky enough to get in, dont take it for granted. Work and love it as long as you can....the grass isnt greener on the other side."

good,"My experience has been mostly on the Wireless side of the company. Things move quickly and you need to stay up to speed with the changes (products, services, business objectives). AT&T spends an enormous amount of resources constantly training and developing its employees every year. Despite the daily pressures It's a fun and upbeat environment and you make a ton of friends along the way. Teamwork is huge within the organization."

good,Good benefits and pay.  Growth after many years but possible.
good,"My work day spanned between 7:00AM and 5:00PM with a core team that expanded across the United States. I constantly learned how to gain information from individuals and build teams with employees I would never neet face to face. At this time, the operating systems in the five national regions were different and did not function seamlessly.which presented a great challenge across the organization. The most enjoyable part of the job was realizing and documenting compliance to federal, state and corporate rules and regulayions."
good,"Very good place to work "
good,"It was pretty easy work. Most people were very nice, you don't stay with the same team for very long. I didn't really like that because just as you get to know people they vanish. It was a friendly place though."

good,"A normal workday includes responding to many, many emails, troubleshooting issues, communicating to workers in the field and numerous meetings. "
good,"A regular day at my job, is helping the pickers with their orders. I find missing product, and make sure our inventory quantity is right. In addition to that i have actually learned a lot here. Like how to pick with RF gun, which i used in three different departments. Out of all the areas i work in here, U-Verse, Break Pack, Direct Fulfillment, Kitting, i really became in love with Inventory Control. The management here is well organize and they care about their workers. Everyone seems to work together to get the work done. My co-workers here are very helpful, and nice. I can honestly say they are like my second family. I really think the hardest thing about my job would be finding product. There are so much research you have to do on tracking missing product down. The more i work at, i seem to become more and more better at it. The most enjoyable thing i get out my job is being able to help people."
good,"ATT is a leader in the industry and a great place to work.  I managed a team of inbound collection call center reps.  The best part of my job was the people I worked with, the leadership and the customers.  The job was fast paced and exciting but could also be tedious dealing with the same customer issues each day."
good,"I loved working in this call center it was fun,professional,and rewarding. A very team oriented place to work. Supervisors had open door policy which was great, I would work for them again."
good,"Campus Sales position - cold calling your territory, contract signing with 4-year universities, setting employee and student events for those schools. Similar to past positions.  New first-time manager located in another state, positive for the most part but spent time doing repetitive reporting.  Co-workers on this team were in other states. However, many with prior campus selling experience were very helpful.  The territory was all of East TN to Cookeville (TN Tech) and was all day travel thus sometimes difficult to cover territory and feel an adequate job was being done.  Enjoyed professional relationships with customers."
good,Best job ever had best money ever made at&t in tallahassee is the best thing ever fun and getting paid

good,"Fast paced, energetic company filled with talented individuals from a variety of disciplines. "
good,"I went through a training process that started at 8am and ended at 4pm every weekday. After training, most of the graduates were placed on weekend a  schedule. My weekend schedule was from 8am to 8pm Saturday and Sunday and then 3pm to 9pm on Monday. The pay was reasonable for my lifestyle so I decided to stay on the weekend schedule and was offered overtime. I was put on a team that did not have a set manager, I was just required to go in, sit at any computer, and clock in and out. I had about a hundred or more co-workers that clocked in and out at different times throughout the day. The hardest part of the day for me was when I had a customer that needed to speak with a supervisor. Most of the times the supervisor line was very busy or there were none available at the time. This caused the customer to have to wait several minutes before I had to inform them that a supervisor would contact them to further assist them with any problems that they were having. The most enjoyable part of my day was successfully solving any customers' issues and keeping them happy so they would stay with our client DIRECTV."
good,I liked working at AT&T you would learn so much on a typical day. Managers were always ready to assist in any way they could. By far the hardest part of the job was always being prepared for very irate customers and quickly figuring out how to defuse the situation.

good,I have learned alot using cutting edge technology and gave me the ability to think out the box. I typically worked over 8 hours each day with the flexibility of working from home.

good,"Most days filled with lots of calls from large businesses or their consultants with questions about what could and could not be included in the white page listings. Inputting and proofing. I learned to be patient and kind in dealing with the public.  My co-workers were the best anyone could ask for. The hardest part of the job was the drive into work everyday, since it was a very long commute. The most enjoyable part was when I could make a difference in the perception of BellSouth/AT&T as a whole."

good,"Its retail, so evaluate and understand this review through the circumstances surrounding the retail industry post great recession and before. Very well paid when compared to average retail salaries. What also must be considered is unequal pressures and power that are befallen on low to no skill workers. It paid for me to go a private university, has tuition reimbursement so success is only capped at your ambition. It was a sales job with commission, started off with great pay then at the start of great recession commissions dropped in half. Pay went from well paid to decent salary. Vertical promotion is difficult without a college degree's or very long tenure. There's a union. If you do what is reasonably expected from you then you will have zero problems and enjoy a stress free career."

This company also instilled in me the importance of /respect for internal and external customers. I was a manager for over 20 years.

good,"Answered 411 calls. As Incharge supervisor on the night shift, I handled the calls from upset customers who wanted to talk to someone about their bill or a problem they were having with their phone-which was a totally different department. I would have to calm them down but satisfy them with a solution. I also handled calls that were 911 calls but customer was so distraught, they dialed 411 instead of 911. The hardest part of this job is when someone would call 411 instead of 911 and would be threatening suicide, but when help got there-it was rewarding because you helped save a life."
good,"Installed Direct TV, wires, satellite. Worked as contract laborer."
good,getting involved with clients and attending various meetings.  Everyday was an oppotunity to enhance team buildilng.

Meeting all the objectives that were presented provided self satisfaction and the desire to maintain harmony in the workplace.

Management was super their caring and diligence was superb.  I keep in touch with many of my co-workers, they were all cooperative and friendly. The hardest part of the job was telling someone the ""dreaded"" news of illness, death, or someone gone missing.  I worked on 9/11 and that was probably one of the worst and best days. Worst letting someone know some horrible news or best being able to tell someone their loved one was found or was ok.  The most enjoyable part was working with the Diversity Committee and  working with my co-workers, and their positive attitude about their lives and our job. This truly was the best job I ever had, and if the job had not moved out of town I would still be there."

I learned patience , understanding , empathy and a knowledge of how the products and company itself operate.  Working weekends sometimes I didn't like too much but all in all every day was fun"
good,"I worked for a 3rd party authorized telesales retailer. Their methods of management I wouldn't put even 50% of the responsibility for onto AT&T. I have met some of the brains behind the operation and they are very classy people with a fantastic sense of professionalism and appreciation for their representatives. The company I worked for didn't offer the greatest health care plans, but I was paid well and commission compensated every month for my sales. If anyone gets the opportunity to work for AT&T, I highly recommend it. It's a life changing experience that will revolutionize the way you think about people on a business level, and also how you treat them regardless of their approach to you."
good,You cant garentee something will work 100% everywhere 100% of the time and I have learned that working for AT&T. It is how you approach the issue and provide resolution even if it is escalting it up to a higher group for troubleshooting. The management is always willing to help in any situation and give their knowlege. All the co workers that I have worked with have been great people and It has been wonderfull getting to know them. The hardest part of my job is not fixing the issue a customer may have while we were talking on the phone. A case is an instance where the issue gets escalated and there is not immediate resolution. The best par of my job is the oposite. When I am able to resolve someone's issue I get a great deal of satifaction out of that.

I learned that doing the job correct and the best that you know how and being confident and proud of your work thanking the customer for being a at&t customer. Good customer service is what people want and expect. Most Co-workers will help you if you get stuck with something, over the phone or they may be able to come and assist you.

good,Customer Services rep - was able to help customers everyday.
good,"It was a very slow store, meaning there wasnt very much traffic coming in and out on a daily basis. I would keep myself busy by doing online training courses, organizing the store inventory, cleaning, and learning about my devices. Management was exceptional. My manager was very chill and relaxed and I love working for him. My co-workers were unreliable, constantly showing up late for work or not at all. The hardest part of the job definetely was the hours. I constantly worked hours i was not scheduled for due to my co-workers not showing up for work on time. The most enjoyable part of my job definetely was being able to ""change peoples lives"" by either giving them the phone theyve been saving up for or simply giving someone their first smartphone."

good,"I work both at home and in an office. I get to use the technology I ultimately help to sell in my daily work. I began my career in the mobile sector and moved over to our landline division supporting Large Businesses and Local & State Governments. The hardest part of my job is knowing when enough is enough. Telecom is a 24/7 demanding career but it must be balanced with the rest of life. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with so many people on a local, state, national , and a rare international basis."
good,Unfortunately the cost to provide customer service resulted in the elimination of the customer service positions. Everything is now contracted.

good,My overall experience with this company was great I only wish they were more independent as to keeping up with other companies as for as benefits for employees. The cut backs on insurance packages because competitive companies were not offering thier employers as much was not fair.

good,-Typical day at work is normal activities throught the day.
good,Excellent cold calling experience with the ability to make 6 figures

good,Company revamped it's IT department and let go most of it's staff. I did learn a lot working here though.
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for, with many benefits. It can be highly stressful but also rewarding!"

Learned how frame-relay works, ATM, learned how to test switches, rebuild pv's, run bidirectional testing. Optimizing circuits. Management there is awesome, can go to them anytime. If had issues they would resolve any problems. Most enjoyable part of the job are the people."
good,Since I have been with AT&T I have learned alot and routing and solving routing issues. I worked with a great team who shared alot of information and there never seemed to issue that we couldnt resolve.
good,"I was first hired 1 week out of high school by the "" Pacific Telephone Company"" in June 1975. Started as an operator answering calls to 411 (directory assistance). This was 1975 till 1979-We had about 3 dozen phone books surrounding a workstation. Yes, it was true! At that time your 411 operator had to thumb through the same phone book that we sent to your home & looked up and gave you the number you requested. And it was provided ""FREE"" (well you did pay for phone calls & phone service I guess!)"
good,A typical day at work for me is productive. My job is as a Credit and Adjustment Analyst with High Level Adjustment experience. I managed my own work pace as long as I meet or exceed my goals at the end of the month. I always set out to super exceed my goal and achieve it. When working my cases I generally never come across the same situation twice. My team is called the Research and Fulfillment. We do all have our separate individual functions. But all our functions are a team effort due to; we all have one common denominator that’s having a satisfied customer. I have a great team manager that is open to assisting me all she can. The hardest thing about my job is trying to figure out what our customer needs when they don’t complete the form correctly when submitting it to my team. The most enjoyable part about my job is we work great as a team but I love the ability to work independent on projects.
good,I loved working at at&t because it allowed me to do what i love which is helping people. I learned everything i know about smartphones working there which was great cause my coworkers used to give me a hard time for my dumb phone. But all in all my coworkers where great and very helpfull any time i needed anything. The hardest part of the job was that there was so much to learn and everything was always changing but it was also the best part there was something new and fun everyday.
good,"AT&T is an ever changing environment, which can be challenging, but also ensure you will never get bored. Keeping up with the latest trends in technology is a must, and i would also consider it a plus. The opportunity to get to know not only you coworkers but also the customers as you uncover their needs and wants is something you won't find at every job. Management is helpful and really there to help the sales reps overcome obstacles and improve in any areas they are struggling in. It is retail, so the schedule could be considered a downside, but it isn't that bad either once you get a little service time under your belt."
good,Would recommend AT&T as a good work Place. It has been several years since I was there and I know the co

good,Southwestern Bell was a very relaxed place to work with great compensation for employees. Company made sure every employee was well trained to perform essential job duties.
good,"DirecTV's environment with co-workers and manager is friendly and engaging. The presentations and group talks about company goals or how to improve the TV business are fair, but not the best. While working there for 3+ years I've assessed that companies like DirecTV are a fun and good working class job, it's also a psychologically tough job."
good,Its a great company to work with.
good,I have recently been declared surplus because the job is moving to Florida.
good,fun and eventful day at work
good,"Great work environment , managers are very helpful and supportive"
good,AT&T was an excellent company to work for. The health benefits were amazing - there was no cost; I was only responsible for my co-pay. The compensation was on the higher end. The work required attention to detail and the ability to multitask and prioritize. Seniority was determined by tenure. Little incentive to work harder as pay is same for all in position.
good,"- Typical day at work, answer all the inbound calls and makes sales also we had to make outbound calls when the customers didn't take the service in the first call."
good,The future prospects remain bright and the company has major firepower to make some opportunistic deals.
good,You never know how your day will start. There were always changes that were implemented without any notice. That kept the environment interesting and the workers on their toes. Tjhis position was high on customer service and you are always part of a team . There was individual work to be done but it was a group effort to start out with. The learning experience was like no other it prepares you for any and everything that is placed in front of you.
good,"Answering calls and helping people out, its busy some of the time and slow a lot of the time"
good,Great place to be if your good at selling. Not so good if your not

good,"Great place to get your foot in the door and level up to different positions especially if you're willing to relocate. I love my job ,the location and what I do. I've been with the company for 13 years and this is where I plan to retire."
good,"Complete work-life balance ( no such thing as a perfect work-life balance), especially on days that tools being used lag and not acting the way they should be hahaha (stressful right?)  AT&T is highly recommended not only through the brand itself but the people and it's benefits ;)  Some days, you might focus more on work, while others you might have more time and energy to pursue your hobbies or spend time with your loved ones. Balance is achieved over time, not each day. - Visions of AT&T"
good,"Door-to-door is not an easy task, but it is very satisfying. By participating in d2d, the agent is tasked with finding potential prospects and challenges them to the best of their communication ability. Walking through neighborhoods, it is important that a representative does that: represent, while still maintaining a competitive hunger and following up with a customer."
good,Had both positive and negatives about the job. Most people who work here need to have a sink or swim attitude. Everyone is a shark in this environment. Great opportunity to make decent money especially for someone in their 20s.
good,I’ve worked for AT&T for many years. I’ve always been paid fairly.  We are moving 20 miles further from my current work location which is my main concern currently.
good,"nice place to work Ii "
good,"Last 10 years has been full of layoffs, ATT  appears to lack job security for employees with 20 plus years employment. Absolutely loved the culture and family oriented approach"
good,The hardest part of the job would be the openness of the cubicle area. All the desks were side by side with little or no privacy. Lots of talking and eating at desks.

I loved the freedom of working as part of a team but then also being able to work alone most of the time. The benefits are great.
good,Working at AT&T provided fantastic experience for sales and other customer-oriented jobs. I have been able to leverage this experience into other endeavors in unrelated fields that has moved into a career.

good,"I enjoyed my time at ATT simply because I’ve never worked for such a team environment, everyone from the team memebers to the managers were excellent so I have no bad reviews"
good,AT&T stands out for it’s ongoing employee development and constant compliance to it’s culture that I miss it a times when I encounter strange behavior in all other kinds of relationships in my daily contact with some other company members.
good,Work life was fun and competitive. AT&T gave me an enormous amount of knowledge in sales tactics. Great environment to start a career. Also rewarding if you present yourself.
good,"I love working for AT&T , I’ve learned a lot of self confidence working with this company . They have great benefits and we are well paid . They also encourage growth and promotions ."
good,"They choose outlay groups to work for att. Some of them are phenomenal,  but some of them are really really bad. I've worked for good and a bad outlet of ATT, and seen some stuff done to me and others that is just not right."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Great company amazing benefits.  Would not recommend to single parents with young children or people with chronic health problems.  They are very strict about attendance. When I worked there 8 pointts w/in 365 days gets you fired. Coming in/ back( clock in/ lunch) more than 4mins late was .25 points and 1 day was 1point per day. There is FMLA after 1 year, but its tricky to use which gets you fired."
good,AT&T rewards those that put in effort and follow the rules.  There is tremendous opportunity to advance if you're able to relocate nearly anywhere in the world.
good,"Teaming was great, completing project tasks was phenomenal.  Challenges was working with 13 swtates and the nuances of the idiosyncrasies of the different systems and platforms - but again once identified and completed it was great."
good,There are opportunities out there if you go above and beyond the rest.  You may work long days but that is part of the job. You will always be learning at this job.
good,"Working for At&t has taught me so much about the safety awareness that needs to be performed in a daily basis to ensure all employees make it home safely everyday. At&t is one of the best companies I’ve ever had the opportunity to work. Jobs can be challenging but that’s what drives me to be the best. I believe in being on time daily, do all work to the best of my ability, completing jobs on time, and always work well with other"
good,Most days are easy going but there are times dealing with the general public it becomes challenging and makes your job very difficult. However it's just part of the retail business and your next customer could brightened your day again.
good,Att es una muy buena empresa  me motivó para generar más ventas
good,Good place to work.  Its a challenging and changing environment.  I like the growth potential in mobility along with the managed services capability. I don't have anything bad to say about the place.
good,"There is no typical day at work which is a good thing. Your job description, working hours / days can change at any time based on the needs of the business. Some days are good when you are able to satisfy the vast majority of customers, and other days it seems like back to back problems. Work environment, pay and management are exceptional. A good job for someone who likes a fast paced environment."
good,I loved working there and I wish I could work there again but it is just hard to get a job there. I apply for a position there every time I see an new application come up.
good,"it was your standard call center experience. they push you to meet metrics but they have many events to boost morale. great benefits. they were going through a merger when i was employed which caused a lot of changes in management that ultimately lead to the job being unenjoyable. they fired the good managers that had tenure in an attempt to ""save money"" by keeping fresher faces that had a smaller salary."
good,"The Management I worked with are excellent people with good leadership experience."
good,Awesome company to work for. I enjoyed learning new skills and overcoming challenges. Perfect work life balance. Management was very on hands and would help whenever needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was traveling.
good,"I worked there for 8 years, regularly got a raise, made many friends and learned a lot. Would love to have stayed longer and if given a 2nd chance - I'd accept it in a heartbeat."
good,"I enjoyed my time there and I learned a lot and really on they work hard and play hard. an innovative company that is great to work for. They have fun clients and work on innovative projects. They aren't a huge company."
good,"Typical sales job, commission based. Learn to close people and upsell them and you'll do well. But keep up with your sales or you might very well find parts of your bonuses missing and you'll be the one responsible for tracking down why you lost XYZ bonuses. Which is all fine, except when it's the corporate bean counters' fault and mistakes and not yours. And it often is. Beyond that, it was a great job."
good,I have really enjoyed my experience working with AT&T.  # years ago I was fresh out of the military without a clue.  20 years in the military with no other work experience left me with only the military for a frame of reference.  My work with AT&T helped me assimilate back into civilian life.  I highly recommend it.  The pay may not be the best you can get but the benefits are top notch and the security of working for a well established company was a great comfort to me and my family.
good,"Very good training methods, team leads and managers know what they're doing and are willing to help. Friendly co-workers and a diverse environment. Lots of fun activities to keep work from becoming boring, or less boring anyways.   Overall medium stress level and rude customers."
good,My job at AT&T was great I started out as a DIRECTV technician and went to AT&T U-verse to work on the Internet side learned all kinds of new technology skills and etc. met people had total of nine years between the two absolutely loved the job the job was so much fun because the customers just they were excited to see me every single time and it was just a really great place to work.
good,Like most places there are some even betters to be explored but for the most part it is a place to make a wonderful career. The people are friendly and the work is challenging yet exciting.
good,Although I found At&T to be a wonderful opportunity I still have personal reasons for not staying. The training is too short and some of the management is too strict but all in all a good place to work.
good,I enjoyed working there. There was a lot learned and training was good. was relaxed environment and got to know a lot of good people. i would work for them again
good,"its a fun company to work for, but layoffs are too much right now. no job security. AT&T will continue to layoff technicians and are changing up their services to save as much money as possible."
good,AT&T management always at logger heads with communications workers of America. Faily good compensation and benefits. Training and certification is key
good,Upper management is open to new ideas. You can have paid continuous education while working which is great. Good benefits and 401K contributions are also good.
good,Loved the my customers and treated them like family. The company states it is a Christian company but they treat their employees like garbage. They want you to WORK AND WORK but get mad when you have overtime. They need NEW PEOPLE to run CORP office.
good,ATT is a wonderful place to work if you like corporate work. They pay well and treat their employees well. Large companies always have challenges but ATT does a decent job of funneling communication.
good,"Great job, a lot of money to be made."
good,"Good company to work for, paid holidays , Union job, however hours are based off of seniority meaning the newer people get all the lame shifts no one wants"
good,AT&T was a great place to work. Always a challenging work environment but rewarding at the same time. Learned a great deal from my fellow peers. I would highly recommend working there.
good,Working with AT&T was time well spent the benefits were great and there was a great work and life balance for a guy like me with extra energy working with AT&T was just what I need it to improve my work ethics and a chance to enhance my knowledgable and skills. Now if  a job comes to me like that one I k owe how to keep it and what to do in the job.
good,Only a term there for 2 1/2 years but learned so much in that time. Hard work as an OPT but very rewarding. Best of all the pay rate was very very good.
good,I was working with a with a big team and were were all helpful with each other.  Everyone was learning off of each other.  Environment was very professional
good,High paced work environment and culture.  Constant change.  Easy to lose work/life balance - but very exciting place to work.  Job advancement typically requires relocation out of state.
good,great work culture and fast paced environment with great benefits and pay as long as you are focused on hitting your goals every month and work as a team.
good,Awesome company to work for. Wide range of technology you can work and the company provide you opportunity to work. Business focused and object oriented leadership
good,If you don’t mind to be stress go for it but if you don’t like don’t do it this job will stress you out. They pay great there insurance is amazing and great perks
good,Good place to work either as a full time employee or a contractor. Lots of technical knowledge to gain with and overall experience in the telecom industry in AT&T is the best.
good,Awesome company to work with. Leadership is always willing to assist. They have constant training. And the availability to work 7 days a week. Lastly you have a uniform to wear daily.
good,I worked here for a total of 5 years. I was hired for a permanent position and took advantage of all the training and promotions offered to me. The job was compensated very well and worked well with my lifestyle. Until the company felt it had to many employees for the area I was hired in and surplussed a large group of employees based on seniority.
good,My experience at At&T was great really helped me grow as a person and help me work related as well I would recommend anyone to work there if there looking for employment
good,My field of work is done outdoors.  Although the weather is sometimes extreme I really enjoy the work I do. I especially like that I work in different sites so not every day is the same.
good,"Good money, hours are annoying, customers can be very hard to deal with, you must have a sales demeanor in order to be successful, you have to hustle."
good,Great place to work..fun..excited. Great benefits. Flexible hours. Excellent working conditions. Great managers. Wonderful co-workers. Lots of incentives.
good,"Extensive training to prepare for success; good pay; union job; we were required to work pretty long hours, but the compensation and raises made it worth it."
good,Loved working for AT&T and plan on going back! only real issues i had was the fact u can get points that could have you terminated even if you have doctor excuse.
good,"This is a great position for anyone new to the field. This position is a great introduction to the many dynamics of this business, from human resources, to customer service."
good,I loved the company and the my position as an technician. The hours were unpredictable but it was ok. The coworkers often complained and made things really hard. The union was rotten and ruined it for me. I loved AT&T and would recommend them to anyone. CWA not so much.
good,The energy at AT&T was amazing. They always had give away items for anyone exceeding the expectations of the company. The work was not hard. The customers were sometimes hard to deal with but the company made it worth the hassle.
good,Since my employment began with AT&T I have grown a lot professionally. I have had numerous of opportunities to enhance my training and develop new skills while being employed here.
good,Im working with AT&T for more than 10 years in the call center in PR and is a great company with great opportunities in the telecommunications industry.
good,"The work load and roles were defined very clearly. it was organized and predictable.  Very intelligent people around, and lots of input when needed. Work like balance was perfect.  Had there not been a budget issue, I would have enjoyed still working there."
good,"Areas of development "
good,"The job is physical so it’s not like you’ll be just driving, but nothing back breaking.  Crawling in attics and crawl spaces jf it’s safe. Ladders and pole climbing set ups. Running cable in and around homes and businesses. Dish set up and mounting. Peaking to satellite. You will be trained on connections. How to terminate all cables. Cat5 into RJ11 and RJ45. Coax to RJ6/59. Fiber end crimp locking. You have an iPad that also has E-Tools to help you run testing and activation accounts. If your not focused you can feel lost at times but if you pay attention to training opportunities by senior techs you should be ok. Union Stewards can also help you get more training if you feel you really need it. "
good,They are a great company. Family oriented. I highly recommend this company. Great benefits friendly employees. They are flexible in work life balance.
good,Very high paced and extremely stressful. Long days of 8-15 hrs. Extended work days as the force 6 days quite a lot. Management varies from different personalities. Benefits are competitive with the completion. Tools and trucks are top notch most of the time.
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T. It was a placement position as Technical support taking care of customer issues over the phone. These included orders for new installations or repairs for existing devices. There was a need not coordinate with other departments and individuals in order to accomplish many of our individual and corporate customers needs promptly.
good,"Great place to work , I always looked forward to seeing what the next day was going to bring me. very competitive. the more you sell the more you make, lots of room for advancement."
good,"A great company to work. Great discounts on products. Many opportunities to learn. For the most part, great teams. Promotion opportunities is limited to hub location but not geographic location. Great benefits, excellent salary."
good,Very smart leaders.  They command performance and the performance is rewarded.  This company will be at the forefront of Technology and will pave the way in many areas.
good,Overall it was a good place to work it did have his times to wear it was work work work and not a lot of customer care and concern overall anyone looking to challenge yourself and provide a good living for their family this is a great job
good,great company to work for if you had room to advice in the company. Ive been with att for 12 year and enjoyed for the most part. But att direction right now does not fit my future needs.
good,Gepokt en gemazeld in optimale dienstverlening voor de target klanten en een continue focus op groei.
good,Very well structured company with many opportunities. Always a vision driven company ready and willing to expand into new and exciting opportunities that will allow growth for the company as well as its employees.
good,Very hard work. Management pushed you a lot and expected a lot. However your pay and benefits were very good all things considered. Just preform at your job and you'll be fine. I just saw it as a way to get rid of those who are not hard workers or scare away when work is asked of them.
good,Big focus on team work. Management readily available within call center. Ongoing training keeps everyone in the same page. Would recommend to anyone considering position with them.
good,In the 8 years spent at AT&T I was treated very well. They have a great baseline of employee benefits and programs in support of employees regardless of their level within the company.
good,Typical day consisted of taking customers and providing each with an integrated solution. I learned a lot because I assisted customer from all backgrounds.
good,"I Loved the team I worked with! Training was great, made me feel like I can handle any objections with confidence."
good,"Good place to get comfortable at, with great benefits. Only downside is advancement is hard to achieve once you've reached a certain level. Management for the most part is great."
good,Great work environment I enjoyed the two stores that I was at and would go back. Typical retail hours learned how to work with new technology management was efficient.
good,"At&t is a great company to work for, it was the best job I’ve ever had, the pay was excellent and the overall experience was amazing, I left because I was having a baby am"
good,"Great benefits, medical, dental, and vision plans. Fair salaries and pay scales. Reasonable, flexible M-F work schedules and advancement opportunities."
good,I had great opportunities from AT&T to succeed and move up in the company not all of the staff have good intentions but most do. The work culture was good everyone tried to be upbeat and positive. This job is daunting and extremely (mentally) hard work. I was at this job for almost 5 years and it was hard to leave but the negatives at the time out weighed the positives.
good,Customers call in with complaints your job is to address and find a solution.  However above all that your suppose to sell them on new services. It's a balancing act to help the customer and sell for management.  And it doesnt matter what excuse they give you your suppose to over come it. In some situations it's just inappropriate.  They called that number for help with problems not to be sold new services. It absolutely cons the customer and makes the representatives job harder.
good,"AT&T is a well-organized goal orientated company for its consumers and stockholders. This company had a role in my development of skills from approving payroll and material ordering, load management to employee relations. Liaison for the customer working with multiple departments to care for our customer demands. Working with such a large organization, have learned to work within various departments, organization, and create relationships with others. AT&T has given me knowledge in operations and performance management for projects, business, and consumers with enterprise technology and strategic planning. Senior management has developed me to become an innovative thinker through process improvement and conflict resolution. I would not be who I am today if I was not apart of this extraordinary company, and I am very thankful for their commitment to their consumers and employees."
good,The Management was great. Fun job that sometimes requires travel. Work on telephone poles fixing wiring issues. Dangerous work with climbing high and electricity. Hot in the summer cold in the winter. Animals & insects to be aware of but great job.
good,"Work life balance is good and work culture is also pretty much good"
good,"I love this job. The people are great. Just stay on top of attendance. It can be stressful at times, but overall the job is awesome. Like any other job"
good,You can make a lot of money and company cares about it's employees. There is advancement within the company if you are good at your position. They give good benefits as well.
good,"When I first started there the management was horrible, the worst I had ever experienced. A year into it I was thinking of quitting because of the management and very stressful. The assistant managers were good, and as soon as we got a new manager, we went from last in our area to number 1. From then on the whole experience was flipped and working there was a blast. Even so, you put a lot of hours in and you will definitely work weekends if your new. You'll get the night shifts and weekends every week (unless you switch). I would honestly still have been there if I was part-time."
good,"The company has since changed from Southwestern Bell to AT&T since I started back in 1996.  Many things have changed from have ing to only pay a small office visit for a doctor to having to pay down a deductible first now.  Never used to pay for insurance premiums until about 6 years ago.  Premiums are still much lower than many companies."
good,"enjoy experience and incentive opportunities"
good,"Excellent  environment working on Agile Development team."
good,If it weren't for the call center closing down I would be going on 7 years there and in the home I was just getting ready to put an offer on. Both I and the wifey worked there
good,Great place to work. I left because I needed a full-time job. I learned various aspect of the managers day to day roll. I was able to meet some great individuals with whom I am still in contact with today.
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T the job was fairly easy and i was told that i had the voice for an ideal representative. i progressed as a representative very quickly and became a FSR/ assistant manager within 3 months of working there.
good,I'm a consultant here so many of these questions are not relevant.  As an Enterprise Agile Coach my time is focused on creating a scalable agile culturein place and organizing teams towards achievable goals.
good,Decent company to work for about 10 years ago.  Company started downsizing continuously over the last 5 years.  Not many jobs to go to or chance for advancement.
good,"Cultura Laboral, con principios de ética, confidencialidad, y compromiso"
good,I truly love AT&T but the fear of layoffs is absolutely maddening. The hours are long but the work is easy for this industry. I’ve never been happier at a job but the stress of layoffs is overwhelming
good,Great working environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers. A typical day consists of installing uverse services while implementing great customer service.
good,A job that leads to a career.  Educational opportunities and always room for promotion from within.  I would work for them again I left to pursue education outside of my career field.
good,"I enjoyed working at AT&T.  My boss was fantastic and my co-workers were eager to help and easy to work with."
good,"AT&T paid well and was a good place to work.  The people are excellent.  Economic times have them in a conundrum that they have yet to figure out, but overall a good place."

good,"I worked for the temp agency Innovative Staffing within the AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. I worked events from JZ & Beonce concerts, Jehovah Witness conferences, Cowboy games, College games & Cotton Bowl, Country Music concerts, and High School Football divisional playoffs. I enjoyed my job and had fun, while I greeted guest , scanned tickets, gave directions, and made sure they got back to their destinations safely."
good,"Working with Att formerly bell south was an exciting, well compensated position. Helping customers achieve valuable placement by selling social media platform ad words was great. The only downside is that the GM Dan HWY 280 had chosen people. to say it clearly he is a good ole boy in the south and depending on your skin color depends on your elevation. I have heard that Dan has been demoted so perhaps they are rewarding employees on a equal playing field now."
good,Fantastic experience which helped me to start my path towards a career in tech. Would recommend AT&T Support to anyone looking to strengthen both technical and soft skills.
good,Long and hard but fun and enjoyable. Safety is key and getting the job done right is a big part of that as well. I loved working with my hands and getting out there to help people.
good,"Fun place to work commission is nice."
good,Very competitive environment.  You must work hard in order to have job security.  Large scale projects are contently in the works so developing your skills is important to a long career.
good,"Loved working for the company, great mentor ship, many perks as a manger. Loved telecommuting. The benefits are equally just as good and loved the stock options."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work because of the people you get to work with.  Like all places of work, you get what you put in and I have been fortunate to work with great teammates and leadership who put in great work.  As long as you are able to follow your position, wherever it may be relocated to, you can have a great career with a great company."

good,"Have a variety of people around you all day who supports you throughout your jobs , management is always looking to help you and coach you if needed . Per business needs your job employment may be in jeopardy if it’s not too busy after s certain period of time."
good,"I had an overall good experience, of course with its ups and down but the environment was motivating and uplifting. For the most part management was fair and knowledgeable."
good,"Work life balance: I would rate 8 out of 10 "
good,I enjoyed my employment at ATT and did not want to leave. They are doing massive layoffs. Wages and benefits were great. The hardest part was constantly learning new programs.
good,"If you enjoy working and making a lot of money, this is a great place to get some fantastic technical experience. They train you thoroughly and help you move forward in your career, but there is no time at home because of the wild hours you keep."
good,Great job I enjoyed working with the people to give the better service and make them happy satisfied customers. I'll give AT&T a great rating they helped me in so many ways
good,"Great environment, family oriented, flexible work hours, not micro management, good benefits, training and opportunities for continue studies, good salary"
good,"Worked for 2 years and everyone is approachable even the bosses. A lot of incentives that's given. However, I'm spending almost 15 hours a day just to get the salary I need. Low salary"
good,"Very laid back place to work. The people I work with are from all nationalities.  Most people get along, for the most part.  Stress free environment.   There are people that have been working here for over 40 years, which says a lot about company today."
good,"Constantly changing workplace. Policies change quite a bit but overall it's a much better place to work than it once was per current employees. Management that ""ruled with an iron fist"" has been removed per the company seeing it as a moral killer. It's a great company to work for. Military personnel would excel in a tech position."
good,"Typical day at work is arrive early, check calendar for call, meetings, etc., meet and greet your employees, review priority work for the day.  "
good,Had a good work career with the company.  It was customer service.  I learned a lot about time management.  It was a great company.  Great people.  The constant customer interaction was one of the hardest thing.

good,"AT&T has evolved over the years.  It is always changing to keep up with the current needs of the business.  A great company to work for, great benefits and perks."
good,"Managers were great! Fun place to work, but can get very stressful when slammed. Great insurance! Get plenty of PTO as long as you show up for work. Would work there again!"
good,"Productive and fun workplace, good management and workplace culture. Freedom to do job with little micromanagement, good team environment and fun team building."
good,"collections;  on phone all day you get 2 15 min breaks and 1 hour lunch you are on computer all days and talk to customer to collect thier bills you are required to meet numbers for collections, talk time, customer surveys, adjustments time off phone and how many calls you take"
good,"Excellent company but much in flux. It is not as innovative as before divestiture. Since acquired by Southwest Bell, it has been nearly silent in introducing innovations without Bell Laboratories."
good,Overall good company with strong benefits. Lot os opportunities to retool and learn new skills. Antiquated corporate culture and can be very bureaucratic.
good,I enjoy working for AT&T very much but my job is a 3 year term job which expires in 8 months and may be termed out early from lack of work. the benefits and pay are great. The work environment is good and my supervisor is great.
good,"ATT seems to be moving away from networking and more towards the Entertainment industry. For the most part, the day-to-day work and coworkers have been positive and uplifting."
good,"In my department we did not have any fun it was all about job. Only once amount birthday celebration.  The employees does give a lot money to charity places, Veterans, etc."

good,At&t and Convergy's were the same company so I did the same work as I did for convergy's they were one in the same. Covergy's was a hub for a multitude of of companies.
good,"Greet customers and help solve there cell phone ,home phone,cable, and accessories needs . Sometimes upgrade their phone to a newer or one that the customer can use ."
good,"The company has a union that does not have the employee's health in mind. They only care about mandatory overtime. They treat it like it is the only thing that maters. This mentality is getting employees injured at an alarming rate."
good,ATT offers experience and job advancement opportunities while providing a competitive and high commission rate. It was a great place for me to begin me customer service experience.
good,"A great place to work.  Great work/life balance and benefits.  My position was working outside of the office, which I enjoyed.  Travel was minimal and mainly just local work."
good,"Mine was a 1-year contract, and it was not renewed due to nationwide manpower reductions at the time of the Direct TV acquisition.  I was happy there and definitely would have accepted a full-time position."
good,"Certain jobs offer job training, but many of the positions that I've had so far have been on the job, which is fine, it tests strength. It has certainly been a great place to work."
good,good Company takes care of its employees. Just like any other company trying to grow there is always room for improvement.  The company puts customers firs.
good,Over all it is a great place to work..  Opportunities for movement out of the sales environment is difficult. It's a fast paced environment and multitasking is a must.
good,"Employee are expected to implement best practices quickly and are provided comprehensive training to learn new skills.  In return, management is open to feedback on tools and processes in order to improve the experience for both customer and employee."
good,At&t offers a vast amount of products and services great benifits great health dental and vision aswell as 401K aswell as service discount. Only negative is constant comission restructure
good,working with customers and help resolving their issues can be satisfying. You definitely have to be a self starter and pay close attention to details. the hardest part of the job is self projecting.
good,Work less stressful therefore more error free. They allowed one to fully learn the technology before employing so one has a good command and understanding before they implemented the technology.
good,I joined as a vendor and a good place to work overall. I work for tata consultancy Services and Tata is a vendor to At&t. We work on Android and ios device application automation.

good,I enjoyed working with a wide variety of people and taking on many different roles during my 11 years at AT&T. It was a great learning experience. I appreciated their great benefits and job opportunities.
good,I was one of the last Engineers that achieved this status without a Bachelor's Degree.  I worked my way up from a Long Distance Operator to an Engineer.

good,"AT&T is a great place to work. It's challenging and always changing. It's never dull, and you get a chance to meet new people every day. It's a great place to work if you enjoy technology, and staying up to date with emerging technology."
good,"great management, great call center to advance to a different position its not that great. They loose a lot of good people because of that. You get hace the knowledge but I think they have to work better with the people from the inside"
good,AT&T was a fantastic place to work. I actually miss working there.  I have been trying to get back on there if they would have me. The training is very detailed and the instructions are clear.
good,"A typical day at work is installing internet, phone and tv for AT&T customers. We work in the heat, in the rain and seven days a week. In attics, up poles and in people’s backyards. I have learned a lot since I started working here. My coworkers are amazing and always willing to help. Management is usually very helpful and encouraging. I have had 7 manager changes in the past 3 years and six of my seven managers were very good. They would coach me and help me better myself as a technician. I have only had my current manager for almost 2 months and he is the only reason I am looking for employment elsewhere. He does not coach, he just puts people down. He does not praise techs for doing a good job just points out their flaws. The manager I had before my current manager was amazing. He still answers his phone whenever I have questions. I learned a lot from him. I do really enjoy my job, it is very rewarding. I am a father of 3 so I know how important technology has become and when I am at a customers house finishing up my install and they are so excited that they have WiFi it makes me feel good. I would highly recommend AT&T to others seeking employment and I want to be clear that the only reason I am looking elsewhere is because of my current manager. Thank you"

good,"The culture, pay and work life balance was excellent.  after close to 11 years with AT&T, there was no room for upward mobility, and that was the only decision to leave. I was looking for a change in direction."
good,"This highly competitive environment is not for everyone. If you work well with others and are comfortable in a sales position, then it is a great option. Compensation may change at any time (sometimes drastically and sometimes minorly) due to the always-changing-nature of AT&T. You have to be flexible and you HAVE to be positive so that you do not get burned out. If you can keep a healthy attitude and communicate well with others in a competitive sales environment then this is a could be a good fit for you."
good,I would encourage my friends and family to work at AT&T. They have great pay and benefits. My fellow employees were knowledgeable and great to work with.

good,"This is one of the most friendliest places for a corporation of this size. They offered tuition reimbursement, to job assisted placement after you leave. By far one of the best places to work for is AT & T.   No wonder they are the largest, they really do care for the employee."
good,Very good company to work for! Took excellent care of their employees! Provided excellent benefits including education reimbursement and high matching 401K.

good,Great company to work for.  Good work life balance.  Convenient location by the freeway.  Good further education and opportunities.  Great people to work with
good,AT&T as a whole is great company to work for. I did not enjoy y experience because the short term disability policy is very strict. I was told by a rep fro that department that if I was not facing cancer or a broken bone then it would be difficult to prove that the neurological disorder I had was causing enough pain for me t miss work.

If you are willing to dedicate yourself to your job and actively seek new areas to improve in, you can flourish. There are downsides like continuous force reductions that are intended to cull the weaker producers. Sometimes high producers get caught in the reductions but there are many jobs available to apply for in the company. If you work for AT&T, the best advice I can give is always look for new opportunities. Don't remain idle as the company is everchanging. The benefits available are outstanding in today's world. Time off is plentiful those sometimes hard to use."

good,Great pay and benefits; work is starting to thin for central office techs; it's all about the numbers; efficiency can be hit easily when the right type of work is available.
good,"Very good employer but given the Corporate Leadership views on Health Care costs, current salaries and the need to drive down any business costs, it remains to be seen what the corporate culture evolves into.  I personally believe most work will eventually be contracted out, thereby removing associated benefit costs in an effort to squeeze out all avoidable costs to the business."

good,"In my professional opinion, at&t was a very fun and productive place to work, minus a couple bad apples in management, however overall I would recommend working here to anyone."
good,Productivity is key priority for management team. Benefits are exceptional for the entire family. Short-term disability and retirement are very good. Discounts are excellent.
good,Great learning opportunity and vast scope of internal moves since the company has started focusing on acquisition in the recent times. I have seen a good transition in the upper level management since the time I have joined.

good,"Enjoyed working for company, training was easy in class, but when you get on the floor, training and on hand was total4ly different. You had a lot to adjust to in a short period of time on the floor."
good,During my time with AT&T I was responsible for payroll and commissions calculations for the sales reps and clerical staff. It was enjoyable for me as I loved working with numbers and also helping solve payroll issues for the reps. It was a great place to work and I had great co-workers that made the day enjoyable.
good,One of the better companies to work. Management is great and they treat their employees like family. The shifts rotate every couple months but the flexibilty in shifts balances it out

good,Contacting my module customer in order to provide them with a full service portfolio. I learned how to be very flexible regarding how changes happen. The environment can be very fun but challenging at the same time.
good,If you love a job where your not repetivly doing the samething. AT&T might just be the job for you. This job is protected by a union. CWA to be exact.
good,Great place to work. No room to grow in the company. Wanting time off or vacation you had to bid. There was no flexibility when you were late or an emergency.
good,At&t has great career opportunities. Great educational skills are provided. Opportunities to further your education are provided from within the compoany.
good,"I enjoyed myself working for AT&T it is a very prestigious company with an amazing work environment, the emplotees are also very enthusiastic about their job as well which makes you participate more"

good,Great company to retire from.  Job is extremly complexed and can be very challenging. Many targets to meet and constant monitoring can ne syressful day to day. Low tolorence for being below expwctations.
good,"I have enjoyed my 10 plus years at AT&T. We have been on the cutting edge of technology and that kept the job fun and interesting. I work with a lot of smart people and we are able to collaborate on lots of projects. I would love to be there until I retire. The drawback of such a changing environment is the job you do today, may be gone really soon so you have to continue to retool yourself. That is also good to continue to learn but it is not always in your hands."

good,"I've been here about 7 years. Mostly great bosses with occasional ""could be better"" as well. Excellent future focus, but that also makes for uneasiness about job stability. I'm looking for external promotion opportunities, but I'm not bitter about them showing up too slowly here. I'm treated well."
good,"I oversaw a group of 22 inbound representatives. My duties included but not limited to, hiring of staff, training of staff, coaching of job duties with staff, delivering discipline to staff and writing review every six months for each staff member."
good,"Great place to work. Very relaxed and easy going. I learned a lot about customer service, and i learned a lot about salesmanship. Management was great, Great sales and team leaders.

Depending on department it can be based on senority which also determines your schedule and if you have children it can impact your schedule A LOT when shift bids are every 6 months depending on your department."
good,You meet new people every day and get to learn about all the new cellphones that will be released prior to their release date. Very competitive and enjoyable.
good,Great company to learn and develop not only management skills but quick problem solving skills as well. Perfect job to start out with in sales and learn all of the different tools you have available to you as a salesman

good,"This company is now Comcast Spotlight, so may not apply.  During my time there, we were a very powerful organization locally offering local TV advertising commercials."
good,"AT&T workplace was very quiet and professional.  At AT&T you were given independent authority to work and make decisions or submit new method and procedures that will benefit the organization.  The hardest part of the job was the best part of the job, that is making the tough decisions to get your work done in the best interest of our customers."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities that were presented to me in my 28 years spent with AT&T.  The last 10 years of my career I was able to work from home and balance both work and family.

Pays pretty well, but projects can sometimes become stagnant by older and less motivated workers that are ready to retire."

good,"Amazing benefits and culture. Fun Atmosphere."
good,It was a good place to work if you did a good job and got noticed for your hard work. The hours were a bit much at times. With the purchase of Directv it seemed that all the sales suddenly dropped off and on the Directv side of things they were still swamped.
good,it was a great place to work for if the managers were not harassing us all the time. Team mates were great in assisting on helping us with certain jobs to be able to finish a job in a certain time frame. My pay was great and benefits were awesome.  If they had a better management there l would still be working for them.
good,"Es una excelente empresa con areas de oportunidad como en todos lados, pero en general mi experiencia fue buena."

good,"Loved working at AT&T had a great team, but the fear of being laid off happened every year causing stress, until I was finally effected. AT&T provides an abundance of training in all areas as well as classes via AT&T University online.  Management in general is very understanding of the work life balance and helps the employee to keep this in mind, offering help to relieve any additional stress in the job.  The hardest part of the job was juggling all of the urgent customer impacting issues that would happen and finding the right person in each department to assist with the fix in a timely manner.  The best part of working at AT&T was the team, it became more of a family, everyone pitched in to help each other out."

good,"It started out with a wonderful work/life balance, but had gradually become more production based environment. Implementing more automation in the everyday work force"
good,This was my first corporate job out of high school.  It was a great launching pad for my attributed skills in customer service.  It was a great company that had flexible schedules and a collaborative working environment.
good,Frequently the day would involve trying to resolve issues for business-critical operations. I would often be on conference calls in order to periodically update executive-level personnel on the progress on repairs. The hardest part of the job came when multiple issues and multiple customers were competing for attention.
good,I love the perks of working for AT&T. The best part of the job is pushing yourself to advance to the next stage - the company is evolving and changing which requires us to pivot our skill set to advance with the company. It is scary and exciting all in one. The hardest part of the job: the cuts to the company in different departments.
good,"I worked from home and was responsible for the WiFi for the hospitality industry.  My territories were Washington, Oregon, Hawaii and part of Canada.  It was a very rewarding job and recommend employment with the company.  Great place to work and for advancement."

good,"Used to be a great place to work.  Recently as the news have reported AT&T has decided to close a lot of offices and positions in the DFW area.  All have been provided the option to follow work, but long term doesn't seem AT&T can sustain those who do decide to follow."
good,"very technical, fun place , great people to work with, they give all the training that you will need, managers not personal they rate you on job efficiency scale which makes no sense to employee, but its their rules"
good,"Working at AT&T is a great place to work. They have thing for everyone there. they have an in house band for the musician at heart, they have a clean up crew that goes around and cleans the streams around the area. they have a smoking and non smoking section out side. they have a kitchen that has a cook for when your hungry. the calls can get tough at times. the sometimes there is back to back calls. but when it gets hard you have amazing supervisors that are there to ;make you laugh and take some of the pressure off. everyone that works there is there to help you out. no matter what."

good,As part of the Finance Organization at AT&T my days are filled with analytics that involve explaining results compared to our latest projections and interacting with senior leadership. New challenges constantly come up.
good,Awesome opportunities withing at&t as they are Nationwide and always expanding. They have locations in every state and offer college reimbursement along with amazing benefits.
good,"This is a great place to work.  You will have guidelines, safety practices etc. you will have to follow and will be graded on.  The money is good and your job security is great as long as you follow the rules and regulations."
good,ATT is a large company with potential to move up if you have the right degree/qualifications. Since the company is so large a good review over all is difficult to write since the experience can vary from one department to the next
good,"Most of my career was in the Marketing Group, sales & collections.  Managed 10-15 service reps at a time.  Had numerous positions that were a support/administrative role supporting Call Center operations."
good,It's a fun environment to work in. Have to have a good attitude. Very fast paced job and it's all based on time and attitude. All in all it's a good job just not good pay.
good,Great company to work for and with great benefits. Worked there for 19 years but unfortunately the Network is better and thus they need less people. Stay out of Network or risk losing your job after nearly two decades...
good,Working at AT&T is competitive but in a fun way. Most of the time the people you work with will help you rather than tear you down. Because you work in close contact with the other employees you build a friendship with them. The current manager is always eager to have fun and tries to make sure that everyone has a good time while getting done what needs to be done. The support that you have in and out of the work place is like no other.

They offer a variety of opportunities to pivot your skills at the company's expense, so take advantage of it."

She was not able to get me a consistent schedule so I could manage my time to get my homework done each week. The job itself was great other than that small hiccup. I learned how to multitask, think outside the box and perfect my customer service skills. I left on good terms and have entertained the idea of going back to them once I have my degree."

good,"I started by career in property management here and learned from skilled HVAC and other engineers about the industry. AT&T provided training and paid for most of my education. It was enjoyable that each day I was assigned to a different engineer and learned something different as a result. The work was hard, but the experience was very exciting.

Explained and corrected errors surrounding billing and account management. Work would be monitored by team leaders who coached and trained ways to improve technique and call quality. Not a lot of co-worker interaction since most people had calls, but sitting with work friends was enjoyable. Job was only difficult when customers were extremely unhappy which was my job to prevent.

good,"Working at AT&T for 17 years was the best job that I had. I enjoyed all my coworkers, managers, supervisor, and upper management that worked at AT&T. The Call Center was home away from home. The job and workplace had its ups and downs, but I will always remember the ups. It was a very sad day when we were told that the call center was closing. We all lost one of the highest paying jobs in Merced county and it has been difficult to bounce back."

I never had a problem with management because I went in and did my job everyday.  My co-workers were a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was the cruel customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers.  The second position I held with the company was a dispatcher. I would dispatch telephone installers out to different places to install phones.  I was also responsible for their safety.  They called in if they had any problems and I dispatched supervisors or other pertinent personnel to their aid. I learned how to operate a switchboard and accounts receivable and accounts payable.  I had no manager. I was on my own. A district manager would come through every month. My co-workers were exceptional. The hardest part of the job was making sure the installers were safe.

good,"- Review Business SLAs."
good,"Treated like a professional trusted to perform work that had an impact on the AT&T brand."
good,I love everything about the job. The politics within management and the uncertainty of job security was hard to take. Management mainly cared about their numbers and not the customer.
good,As time goes went by in the job the corporation started looking to phase people out.  This was a great job that was destroyed because of corporate decisions from people who didn't work in the field.  I loved this job but couldn't take the corporate bs and left.
good,"Working for AT&T requires the ability to adapt constantly and will always keep you days interesting. It can be very challenging at times, but is very interesting."
good,"DIRECTV has a positive and encouraging environment. I have been able to grow my skill set while here, Career pathing and career development are a focus and well as personal development. There are many avenues for advancement and this is encouraged at all levels of management."
good,Certain managers destroy moral within the team and perhaps themselves need more training. However it seems anyone can get promoted since it is politics and despite them not following COBC regulations certain bad apples get promoted anyways.

The job culture is very open and encourages innovation.  Employees are not micro managed and are allowed freedom to use their uniquely different styles, perspectives and talents toward collaborative company goals achievement.  I truly enjoyed my 11.5 years thus far with the company and hope to continue with many more.  AT&T provides ongoing emerging products and services training as well as management training.  Our team works very well together although the vast majority of the time we work independently to each oversee approximately 15 stores, district management, store management and associates.  This career is constantly challenging as each corporation we partner with is constantly changing priorities and tactics.  We gain all of our sales by gaining by in through relationship selling, side-by-side selling, coaching and mentoring.  The most enjoyable part of this career has been the stability of being a team member of the AT&T family."

good,"a great company to work for "
good,Working for this large corporation is a wonderful experience. The typical day of work consists of sales of communication equipment and plans as well as Direct TV and home security and overcoming objections on how these different products can enrich someones lifestyle.

good,I worked for an indirect agent for DirecTV. It was a great company to work for and they loved their customers just as much as they loved the product. I was always able to troubleshoot for a customer thanks to the customer service from DirecTV with no issues. It was an awesome company to learn from to further my experience.
good,"A normal day consists of having a morning staff meeting with management, usually not exceeding 15-30 minutes. We would be constatntly updated with new information, technology, or procedures, including training. Co-workers are highly supportive and one of the job highlights is comradery between fellow employees. Countless learning opportunities in addvancing skills in all areas in and outside of job description. Jobs could easily exceed time depending on area of work and turf location. Spending hours wiring through homes and businesses can become a difficult task, even at that one needs to troubleshoot and resolve all access points. Warehouses, attics, basements, crawl spaces, large building structures(living quarters and corporate buildings, there was never a ""normal"" situation. Which oddly to some, the more difficult the task, the more enjoyable it became completing the task."
good,"A typical day at work is anywhere between two and six jobs per day where I visit people in their homes and places of business. Not a day goes by that I do not have at least one interesting conversation with a customer and almost without exception people are warm, welcoming and generous. I get genuine pleasure out of connecting with people and this job offers a special and unique opportunity to do so as I meet people from all walks of life who are not only happy to see me (I'm either fixing their problem or connecting them to the world) but relaxed and free to be their true selves as I am a guest in their home. I continue to be surprised and humbled at how often people open themselves to me and I choose to believe that on occasion my words brighten the day of some who are facing life's challenges.  "

good,Every day you are presented with a unique opportunity to impact customer satisfaction by completing the job in an efficient and timely manor. No two jobs are the same and every customer has his or her own priorities and perspectives. Love the challenge with each job.

good,"Call Center Environment - typical day, log into all of the databases to prepare for the influx of calls.  Investigate, analyze and test high speed data circuits for maintenance.  Co-workers were great, management was limited in the last few years that I was there.

good,"Worked for forty years when southwestern bell became at&t and bought bellsouth the work climate changed for the worse,  the use of numbers to rate an employees effectiveness is not a good way.  It tells th employee that doing a good job is secondary to doing the job fast without regard to safety or doing the job right the first time, this ends up being blamed on the craft for taking excess time on a job that if it were done right the first time would have taken less time to complete"
good,A great work environment. Excellent pay and benefits with a push toward advancement. The vision of the company is future forward.
good,loved it great people great tech always moving forward. if you are hard working and smart working it is a great place to grow a career and the networking that can be achieved at AT&T is unlimited.

good,"I received incoming and outgoing calls throughout the day. I learned troubleshooting, payment negotiations, and retail.  Management was prompt and influential as well as patient.  Co-workers were helpful and understanding.  The hardest part of the job is multitasking. The easiest part of the job was communication and helping others."

good,"Great place to work in, great co workers and management. It a very joyful place with lots of motivating activities. great place for technology and advancement."
good,"AT&T was a very hard place to work for because of the amount of pressure that was put on each worker to perform.   But that pressure wasn't  a bad thing to experience.   Every day was a challenge to get through, and that's what motivated each employee to excel at their jobs.  If employees had issues with their performance or work, management would assign other staff to work with you until your performance was up to par. I would still be there if DSL was a viable technology.  It has been down graded and newer technologies has taken its place.  My group was eventually subject to layoffs.  I tried to gain other positions in AT&T but at the time their were none available."
good,Worked with a great team of people.  Worked to troubleshoot and resolved complex issues. Worked outage bridges and multiple tier teams to get issues resolved.  The work was good but the technology is eventually going away.

good,"I loved the people I worked with at AT&T but burn out and turn around was high with this position.  Also after working for the company for 7  years, I did not feel any more valuable than I did when I started.  I also felt like I had no room for change or advancement."

The most enjoyable part of my job meeting new people and talking to people from all over the world.
good,AT&T provides an opportunity for an individual to develop their interpersonal and professional skills at your own pace.  Upper management seeks to establish communications as a two way path within the company culture.

good,come to work with my game face on. Set up Store with other sales team members. When the door opens it is non stop with all the organized chaos that this environment demand. I learned to breathe. Sometimes our clients can say or do things that demand you think before you speak and avoid fanning the flames.Managers and co workers are usually so swamped that is is better to research our tools at hand on the computer as opposed to reach out.
good,"An environment where mail was open, addresses were changed and exceptional payments were processed.  There was also the opportunity to operate an high speed transport machines and the individual mail opening machines."
good,Great company to work for and was My first entry-Level Management position for any communications company.  There's a high demand for sales which was proven by my team of 5.  Great staff and great references for training others.

What I enjoyed about this job the most was it allowed me the opportunity to fully understand how the wireless telephone business operated. It allowed me to interact with a variety of business and people all over the country. The managers I worked for always encourage me to learn other things outside of my assignment and were very supportive of recommending me for other contract positions.

Everyone was always very friendly and willing to lend a helping hand. The only issue I encountered was when personal engagements would arise or emergency situations, AT&T seemed reluctant to give the time off necessary without some sort of stipulations or form of punishment. I did enjoy working with the customers and my co-workers! We all had a blast! I would recommend this company to anyone who is on the lookout for a stable company which provides excellent health benefits, great pay, paid vacation, opportunities for job advancement, and values the opinions of the customers they serve!"

To do the very best job. The management staff is personable, up to date on the latest trends, and the open door policy is a great asset to the company. The hardest part is everyone can't be helped no matter how hard you try, the most enjoyable is knowing the customer has a working product that you can put your name behind."

There are many employees that have applied for transfers that were granted then retracted. also I was forced to go on short term disability because of pregnancy and my department not willing to accommodate my restroom breaks."
good,"A typical work day at AT&T was very productive and rewarding attending to the customers needs.I learned to utilize multiple systems at once in order to properly assist customers.Management worked very hard on keeping us updated with the many changes that occur in the telecommunications field.My co-workers were also a great source of information as well as the tools provided by the company.The hardest part of the job was not being able to provide a product or service to a customer that we no longer offer,but finding something comparable to fit the customers needs thus resolving there issue was the most enjoyable part of the job."

good,"as a services technician for over 15years, I came in contact with  about 5 to 7 customers a day. what I've learned in this job is that you must call the customer ahead of my time. communication is always the key for a successful dispatch and repair or installation. the hardest part of the job is when the trouble isolation takes longer than it has to be. but that is the challenge I undertake, which makes it more fun, in my own opinion."
good,"What can I say about Technical Support that isn't figuratively ""beating a horse to death."" Either the customer needs help with a product, service, or depending on your luck probably both.  Your customer will either be someone who knows the product intimately, or someone that uses their manual as a paperweight they shoved in the back of a random item drawer. In any case... you will learn how to describe one thing, ten different ways, and always in a polite tone. Management consists of pragmatists with quizzical looks and rhetorical questions. You may or may not be approached by one depending on whether you did something very right or very wrong. What can I say about co-workers that hasn't already been said...Best advice is to use discretion when confiding in that person and try to find one that knows how to take notes (in case your absent from training). The hardest part of the job for me was finding a parking space. The most enjoyable part of the job was when my manager told me I did a good job...or was it pay day? I digress..."

I enjoyed meeting new people and being able to talk about the new technologies and advancements."
good,"I liked coming into work everyday to solve customer issues. I made sure I was the best resolution specialist that I could be. I helped with configuring modems, routers, camera systems, firewalls, and whatever else the customer would put in front of me. I learned more about the job as I went along and learned what it took in order to make sure each customer was satisfied. "

A typical day would start with logging into the 7 systems we used to assist our customers daily then open for calls. I would take around 50 Inboiund calls a day with issues ranging from billing to repair while also upselling At&t & affiliate products. I would carefully track every call and leave a detail note in all eligible systems I used while assisting the customer. I participated in a number of special projects and held a number of positions at At&t duriing mt tenure including my final position of Sr. Consultant. I enjoyed being able to solve a customers problem to make their day better no matter how hard or easy because its a great feeling knowing you can have a effect on someones bad day just by providing them with great service and going above and beyond their expectations. The only difficult aspect of the job was when limitations prevented me from being able to solve a customer's problem and not being able to fully satisfy them. I got along with all my co-workers and management we were all together for a number of years so it began to grow into a family atmosphere and people got along for the most part. At&t is a great company to work for and I will always appreciate my time there.

good,"With DIRECTV, you learn a lot about what they do for their customers to make them happy on a daily basis. I learned a lot about myself and things I did not know about DIRECTV. Management was a little stingy and was always pushing for 100%. Well you have to realize not every customer is going to be happy and willing to give out 100% and they did not realize that. Overall it was a good company to work for and they had a lot of great incentives."
good,"A typical day at work starts with morning greetings then its off to work. Our calls immediately start coming in with various requests and concerns. We handle the requests then request a product that will be beneficial to the customer. I learn patience, team work and how to enjoy the ups and downs. My co-workers and the management staff are down to earth and willing to assist every way they can. The hardest part of my job is passing my customer to another department. Our attempt is being a one stop shop. The most enjoyable part is when my customer is pleased and satisfied with the service they've received from me."

good,"The communication business is very busy and ever changing. "
good,"I liked this job, I hated management and the union.  When I got in trouble the union person ""who was there to help"" was like there was nothing they can do. I believe it was because I didn't meet 2 of my goals 2 months in a row and they were making me ineligible for the bonus that I was going to receive.  I thought that was pretty messed up. Especially since the stats that I missed didn't count towards the bonus I believe. Other than that I enjoyed helping the members with their technical problems."
good,Was a fat paced work place everyday something was changing and it made me fell like i was an apart of a great team that were able to get the customer taken care of.

Management is really good, most of the managers have been previous installers so they know the best ways to complete the job.

Most enjoyable part is meeting new people everyday and not doing the same thing all the time."

I learned how to create installatiion and repair tickets to asist the customers or employees. Management was helpful 80 percent of the time if not busy asisting another employee. The co-workers and I volunteerily helped one another to get a job done and to keep the call center at a great performance level.

good,"Companhia excelente para se trabalhar."
good,I really enjoyed my work and would really like to be still working with AT&T. I made a career of working there and had hoped to retire with the company. I hope some day to be able to be re-employed with such a great company.
good,I was hired as a term and promised one/three year of work and was only given five months of work.
good,"The day consists of logging into all applications and taking incoming calls.  I learned that each caller has a unique need and the most important task is listening!  I discovered that doing your job to the best of your ability shows managers that you are able to perform your job with little or no assistance.  Doing so management will learn that you are a good employee who requires little or no micro managing.  My experience with coworkers is that you need to come in and do your job and not get caught up with office politics. Be friendly but not to the point where you can get caught up in socializing and not doing your job!  The hardest part is knowing a customer has a legitimate complaint at times and the hardest thing is not agreeing.  Instead, let them vent to a point and then turn it around quickly to what can or needs to be done.  The most enjoyable part of the day is talking with the callers.  Most of the time a caller has a need and wants to hear a friendly voice.  Listen and respond, and most importantly put a smile in your voice."

Luckily, coworkers functions as a second family to help the trials of hitting sales targets or angry customers less painful. It is a competitive atmosphere, but the perks of the job outweigh any stress. This company has a great benefits package and pay structure and really rewards those who work hard."
good,I learned quite a bit of skills at my time with AT&T that is able to translate to other fields and to personal life as well. As for my co-workers they tend to become like my family when you spend more time with them than you're actual family. I enjoyed them all to the point I will have lifelong friendships. My interacting with them was the enjoying part of the job as well as interacting with customers. The hardest part was those very difficult issues that came about that may take days and weeks to resolve. Trying to develop and evolve techniques until a resolution was achieved.

I have learned more in the last 2 years than I have in my entire previous private sector career (outside the Army).  This is both the hardest and the most enjoyable part of working for AT&T.  I have had the great opportunity to work with hands-down the highest standard of professional I believe operating in the Government support industry."

I learned during that job how to draft the communication drawing diagram power, equipment schematics. Management there was easy to get along with as long as you and everyone did their job to the best of their ability. My coworkers were good and friendly. There wasn't really a hardest part. The most enjoyable part would have been overtime because after forty eight hours it would turn into the double time."
good,AT&T has taught me alot and has sharpened my customer service skills. I enjoy the amount of people that i got to interact with as well as working with the customers. I wish the management would be more engaged with the employees and take the time to work with the employees i think that it would build employee relations and make the business run smoother. The hardest thing i had to deal with was not knowing where i stood performance wise and what i needed to work on to improve from an outside stand point.
good,"Typical day began with coffee with my associates and discussing any concerns with assignments; I was given the latitude to make my own decisions while knowing my manager was there should I need advice and support; I in return allowed my associates to use their judgement and make their own decisions also there for support and advice should they need it."

I would print my jobs out for the day and dispatch myself on job I would drive to company garage twice a week for meetings and to pick up supplies.

good,I enjoyed my job. My coworkers and management were all cool. Good pay and benefits. A lot may have changed since i worked there last in 2012 but i would think for the better. The only thing i think would've made my job better would've been day care services.
good,Great company to work for great benefits many incentives that you're eligible for. Employee discount is good. Culturally developing into what it should be
good,AT&T is filled with growth opportunity and a very stable work environment! The hours were accommodating and you always had your two days of rest plus payed vacation.

good,"Una gran empresa, donde se aprende y fomenta un gran clima laboral"
good,"The facilities at E 40th were clean and functional.  The building used to be a production facility before it was converted, so it was not a as modern as some offices, but it was nice.  The different groups in the organization were located in separate blocks of cubicle farms on the interior of the building.  There was an ATM, a cafeteria, fitness room, outside basketball court, and the exterior corridors allowed for a nice quarter mile walk."

good,"There are many departments/organizations to choose from, project are challenging and rewarding.  The company has great benefits and so many opportunities to learn and grow."
good,"It’s fun working for AT&T. Everyone is really nice and they are always trying make it feel like it’s not a sales center. We take nights out, go bowling, went to FunSpot at one point. Little competitions go between the team and if your team wins then the manager just might take your team out for lunch"
good,"Great company, great workplace culture, great resources, strong training environment provided in order to do your job effectively, etc. Just an overall solid company"
good,"great part time job and I enjoyed working here as a college student. discounts available for phone service, hours are flexible. managers are chill and relaxed"
good,"Retail Sales Consultant. Working in a very diverse competitive work setting. My job was to earn your business with AT&T and provide the best solution to make your entertainment needs a better part of your life. The management staff that I have encountered with is great. The hardest part of my job is when customers are mad with me for something I have no control over ( if AT&T has changed a policy or anything of that nature). What I enjoy the most about my job is the competitiveness. Me and my co workers typically each month have a competition each month to see who can be the top sales rep. The excitement itself, is something I look forward to each day at work."
good,"Contractor for AT&T , a great company to work with, great management team. Enjoyed my co-workers and support from managers. Simple to work with and relaxing."
good,Great place to work for good discounts for employees. Attractive incentives and bonuses. Earning potential is determined by you the more you sell the more you make
good,"Work day was good, managment was awesome. the hardest part of this job was cohercing a customer to buy more cell phones or add TV services from which they would be elible for and to make sure the part of your job is to offer products which in a sense you would have to make the offer of the products tailored to their words instead of being more natural with the conversation."
good,Worked there while before it went hourly. Made great money in the Las Vegas market. Work was tedious. Lots of unpaid meetings. Typically a 50-60 hr work week.
good,Management was ok depending on the person. Some were great to work with and some were cut throat. But I usually get along with all and do my fair share of work
good,"When I started, I was working under a split team that was essentially covering for a hole or two in the territory. They did their best to train me and prepare me to do my best and I became fairly successful there. Compensation was great. Hours aren’t the best but not terrible. Good job for sure."
good,Excellent place to work if you are a competitive individual. Opportunities for advancement are limitless. If you enjoy meeting and exceeding goals this is the job for you.
good,"AT&T was a great company work work for."
good,It was the perfect call center job. It had amazing benefits and a great culture in the work building. The pay was wonderful and the hours were good for me but upsetting for most. It was an all day kind of job.

good,"job kept me busy making the day go by very fast  "
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"learned repair of phone service, driving around the city, meeting customers, making friends, work there 42 years, that should mean something. I am a guilty learner and believe I would be a good employee for Lowe’s.....I was for AT&T"
good,This was by far the most enlightened group of people I have ever worked for and with. They greeted every challenge with energy and a great amount of intuitive and original thinking.
good,This is a good place to work. Good atmosphere. Tools are always available to be productive. Teammates are willing to collaborate and work together to achieve project results.
good,"I loved working at AT&T. The people were friendly, and working as a responsible team with the group I trained with was excellent. Getting to know everybody during the work load was fun. It was all worth while as we teamed up to refrain from using the supervisors to helping out techs and customers."
good,"Fast paced and overall good company, a lot of perks and benefits, good opportunities to further yourself in the company. The staff is wonderful to work with"
good,"Mon - Fri work week. * am - sometimes 8PM"

I had the exposure to Business Intelligence tools and opportunity to train and work on those tools. Great work environment and friendly people really makes working at AT&T a fun place.
good,"Wonderful job, Grate benefit, Fast past environment, Continuous training "
good,"I worked for AT&T Government Solutions. It was a great experience and the culture was good. It was familiar because I had just worked on another government contract and was previously in the military. My coworkers had similar experience so it made everything that much more comfortable for me. Management did what they could to keep us informed of everything that was going, and they helped to provide a comfortable environment to work in."
good,"I think AT&T is a very great company with a lot of benefits. If retail hours don't bother you, and you enjoy working with the general public this is hands down the best place to seek employment."

good,"Wonderful company to work for, but only if you are willing to put in the work. "
good,Great place to work if you are driven to achieve high sales. The pay is good! The benefits are a definite perk. Only downside is that as a part timer I was made to work 13 hour a day shifts at many times. I did not return after my maternity leave for this reason.
good,"Very sales driven, but if you have the will to succeed you will do well and make very good money! Selling DIRECTV is the only downside as it is difficult, but not impossible! If you ask every customer every time you will at least meet your required number of DTV sales to earn your commissions."
good,"I installed and shot trouble on telephone lines and equipment. Worked outside on the lines and cable. Also, worked with customers in and on their premise. Every job assignment was a unique experience and a challenge. It was the job that I was born for, it was my calling. I loved it and was good at it. I liked working on my own and with the customers. My truck was my office and the world was my job site."
good,It’s exciting yet stressful at times but always different changes are always happening sometimes good sometimes bad in the end work is work you’ll have good days and bad
good,Dealing the customer and human connection was the best. Monthly bonus was awesome! The company became more about selling dtv then actual helping longtime customers.
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T.  There really are no cons to add to this job. They are flexable and treat there employees fair. Management was part of the team. They cared about you as a person. Would stop and get to know you.
good,"great experience  love the benefits, and the overtime hours"
good,"They lost so many good employees because of their shift to co-location,  I understand the background of wanting to move to being more Agile, but the affects it had on employees who were there for 20 more years."
good,I wish I could have moved to Dallas when the HQ moved there.  There was no mobility in San Antonio after the move. I had great respect for the Leadership and felt great respect from them.
good,This is a great company with great benefits. Absolutely the highlight of my career. If I were offered a job I would take it in a heartbeat. So please let them know that I'm looking to come back.
good,Always something different. Meet many people pro and con of the job. Crawl spaces and attics are not a pro of the job. Great job to have with many benefits.
good,AT&T is a good company to work for and they have good savings plan. Training program is great.  The union is CWA for the premises technicians and the benefits are really good
good,AT&T is a great company. They are doing changes and some departments are no longer needed. Work life balance could be improved with first line managers
good,Excelente empresa para cuando eres soltero y sin muchas responsabilidades o gastos

good,Solo las restructuras o cambios de Jefes en ocasiones puedes perder tu trabajo
good,"Working for a communication and Entertainment company is very competitive and sometimes stressful."
good,"Great benefits, family friendly, flexible work schedule, management was fair, lots of vacation time, hitting my own personal goals was the hardest part of the job because I am an over achiever, most enjoyable was the atmosphere."
good,"As the mobility business matures AT&T has moved into the entertainment space, purchasing DirecTV, Time Warner and other smaller players.  This flip in the business requires a different mind set and skill set to be successful.  I believe management is setting the company up for a successful future."
good,Job perks and management were excellent. The Healthcare options could be better. There were many opportunities to learn and advance career. Employees are left alone to do work unless they require assistance.
good,"It was a great company to work for, work life balance with wrought, a lot of opportunities within the company from retail to outside sales and business."
good,Self-motivated work environment with normal management styles for this day and time.

I really enjoyed all of the people that I worked with and/or came in contact with
good,"Typical day - team daily stand up, cross team daily stand up, ticket updates,  work on projects"
good,Cerritos location is clean andhas security guard. Management is fair and there are training and advancement opportunities. Overall a great place to work
good,"As with every company, it depends on which group you are on. I was lucky to be part of a team with great leadership and management who listens to the employees. Great team! Policies and procedures are a bit over the top hindering delivery schedules sometimes. And management can do better with promotions and progressions. Overall its a great company to work."
good,"Great group of talent at AT&T and the ability to work remotely is a great benefit.  Management seems to care about their employees, however; there are surplus notices sent out several time a year.  The company is losing good talent."
good,"The company did away with AdWorks 181 laid off, so there really was not enough time nor a reason to write a review on this division as they closed the doors."
good,muy buena empresa con buenos sueldos pero muchos cambios
good,"AT&T Management, the people and the opportunities to to successful was always there."
good,Overall a great job. You’ll definitely get out what you put in. A hard worker and someone with a true sense of hustle will always succeed in that type of environment.

good,I had a great time and learned a lot of extensive troubleshooting skills while I was employed here and would recommend anyone that wants to learn technology to be a part of this company.

I have over 7 years of experience supporting vendor partners in both onshore and offshore locations. I have supported majority of different SP companies that we are in contract with and have built great relationship with their leadership team. I have extensive experience working with different leaders in Mobility Sales & Service organization and have worked closely with chiefs of staff on organizing trips and operational sessions supporting officers. I am also a 2019 graduate of Jamie Barton's RISE program for Leadership Development which has given me additional layers of knowledge in other parts of the business."
good,"AT&T pays very well and has a great work atmosphere. The hours are reasonable, but family time is often missed or overlooked due to strictly attendance policies."
good,"Enjoyed working for AT&T, would still be there but didn't want to relocate and the facility I worked at was closed.  They are currently going through some changes but I believe it will work out.  Didn't care for the on call."
good,"AT&T is one of the pioneers in Telecom since the Bell Labs days. It is a leading innovator in telecom, wireless, TV and digital contents.It offers employees great freedom to work, innovate and after work independence. Good place for work-life balance."
good,Working at AT&T could be challenging. While assisting customers and setting customer training web conference calls I processed off line account changes and purchase orders for large businesses and government contracts. Work pace was timed and quality recorded. The work place was a call center where team members were available to answer questions. AT&T provided all training for the systems you worked with in processing request.
good,"Great company to have been a part of. Good working atmosphere. Mostly unsupervised, customer relations and quality work is a must. Willing to work overtime and weekends, missing family or other obligations."
good,A typical day at work as a Customer Service Representative in the call center began by logging into the phone to began your day. Management was direct.

Once you complete an assignment you get another until the day is complete. The hardest part of the job is enduring cold weather.

good,Great place to work.  Competitive salary and benefits for there employees. Always a fast paced work environment  with new challenges everyday. My skills were significantly expanded working for AT&T.
good,"Great learning environment. "
good,The typical day at work for me was to log into the ACD have my tools up and be ready for the first call. The office was very much a collaborative environment with knowledge sharing being a key part of our success. The hardest part of the position was making connections and losing them in the contractor sense. The most satisfying aspect was seeing our team under heavy pressure succeed.

good,"great place to work, management was great, everyone tired to help one another, climbing the poles and having to run 1000 foot wire was the hardest part"

good,ATT was a good place to work. Excellent benefits and raises. Fast paced. enjoyed working to help others with any issues they had with their phone. Collected payments over the phone
good,Worked second shift and did call outs after hours. Drove company van and covered 2 counties. Worked mostly solo on assignments. Very physical outside work including working in the rain. Sometimes hard to satisfy customers over outage issues.
good,"A typical day at work could be challenging, but the company was creative and consistent in coming up with new ways to help us better help the customer.  The most difficult part of the work day was irate customers and the high call volume. The management was very reasonable and willing to listen while providing a consistent structure follow. I learned more patience and a friendly tone goes a long way while working here.  The most enjoyable part were the celebrations of our accomplishments and holiday office parties."

good,AT&T and excellent company with innovative leadership with great products/vision. I enjoyed working at AT&T as I enjoyed the innovative approach and market leadership with a culture that likes to give back and reward diversity and inclusion.
good,"This was a very physical and cerebral job. High levels of problem solving and a strong knowledge of digital systems and networking will provide a solid foundation for anyone interested in this line of work. In CT I was part of a union shop which certainly provided a lot of job security as well as strong benefits and pay. A typical day at work started either at 8 or 10am and went on until all work had been completed for an area. If we completed our area's work early we would drive to other areas to support those techs. Servicing anywhere from 3 to 7+ customers was a regular day. Jobs are timed, but timed fairly. A good work ethic and a willingness to go above the basic would bring success on a daily basis. Management was great, they were there to support us. As long as we did our work they had our backs. The hardest part of the job was working in the dark or the rain. We had to be out there doing our thing no matter what. The best part of the job was the customers. Meeting new people every day and forging connnections with them."
good,Great initial training and follow up training.  All promotions are done from within.  Great employees to work with.  A fun environment with incentives to motivate
good,"I worked at AT&T for 35 years.  The company provided all of the career and life support tools, including salary and benefits, for me to feel personally successful and to care for all of my family responsibilities."
good,I believe at&t wants to see their employees to take ownership and succeed. If you are a self motivator then this company is for you. They have adequate training and its up to you to best utilize it.
good,"In the office we would greed each other in a very friendly, personal manner ,as if we were just all a big family. The environment is fun to be in and gives you the sensation of always wanting to be back the next day. It really help you to grow into a greater, better person. Being very strong minded ,encounter and learn many different skills. In the morning we would always manage our morning meetings, practice pitching for sales and provide a positive atmosphere to maintain a positive attitude in the field. I would say the hardest part is when you do not meet the standards and have to hold yourself accountable for it but that also one of my most enjoyable moments cause when you do actually get the job done on your own after figuring out what you did wrong it becomes a learning tool and you feel good about yourself at the end for proving that anything is possible."
good,At&t has taught me communication skills and has also helped me multitask when it came to taking care of customers and speaking with customer care if i had to.
good,AT&T provided me with opportunities that increased my knowledge of new technologies within the communication industry.  AT&T's competitive salary and benefits package provided a good life for me and my family.

good,It was a great place to work and everyone was very nice from the over head to the regular staff. they were willing to help where ever needed. if the call center were to come back to this area  would apply again for a job it was a learning process for me. I learned a lot working for AT&T Blue.
good,"Interacting with contractors, making quick decisions on methods and procedures. Managing people, negotiating contracts, reading blueprints. Working together to get jobs completed. Collaborative environment. Enjoy working with people inside the company, as well as outside the company."
good,One of the few places for a lifelong career. A fair and forward looking employer. There are many friends and family who were my coworkers and lifelong friends and associates.
good,It was a very comfortable environment. Friendly people. Great training department who were always available and willing to help. The mentality of management was quite progressive for its time.
good,Excellent company to work for. Great benefits good hours pleasant work atmosphere. Would recommend to others.  Opportunities to advance were excellent and enjoyed my jobs.
good,"AT&T was my first job. Actually I was hired through an intern-ship with my high school. It was a great learning experience. I learned data entry, how to put information in the computer. I learned customer service and how to dispute altercations. Problem solving techniques and rebuttals."
good,Open the store with a couple of representatives and go over the numbers of each salesman. We would start with a little meeting going over new product and possible ways to push and excite the customer with the sale. As a manager it was really important to listen to the sales representative to help advance them in the sale. Our workplace culture was always positive with the team. Hiring positive individuals that wanted to be better than anyone else. The hardest part of the job would be writing up the representative if he or she would not follow work protocol.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out the customer who thought the world was ending when he or she would lose information off of a device. Helping customers with the unexpected problems and showing them that a team of work hard individuals could show them more than just a product to sale. At At&T we would learn the product all the ends and outs to make sure that the customer could count on us and keep walking through our doors.
good,"great benefits, hard to advance career.  good team environment.  willing to train on new procedures.  safe environment with continuous training. difficullt communication between management and hourly employees.  no set schedule or time off"
good,A typical day at work is having meetings with project teams to get status or running down the right SME to get status.  Management is pretty much hands-off as long as a project is going well.  Most times funding would slow or stop a project just when it started getting momentum.  The hardest part of the job is to get stakeholders to make a decision on funding or project direction.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the team to deliver a project on time and within budget.
good,Was at a call center. I gained lots of customer service experience. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell Direct TV service. I was in the wireless department at a call center. The most enjoyable part was working with so many fun people
good,Customers are sometimes put to the side so that the rep can meet their numbers to have success for the month. Management wants to see you succeed but focus more on those that lag behind
good,"AT&T is a great place to work. The environment is fun, but can be stressful at times.  It is what you make of it.  It's great interacting with the customers and the pay is worth the effort!"
good,I worked 6-3pm and the job was repetitious. You are on the phone all day besides an hour lunch break and 2 fifteen minutes break. I would deal with customer complaints and make sure the customer was calling the appropriate department. It was enjoyable as long as I could help the customer. Training for the job should have been longer. I enjoyed the job and the culture was nice.
good,"In helping grow the business,  you meet and work with so many wonderful people.  Whether its within the company, in the retail stores you support and the customers."
good,"My time there was an amazing experience. My team leaders were friendly and very professional. I can say that they walked the talk of their operating philosophy."
good,"It's a very nice Place to work and makes you a very Productive employee and Fun too, I enjoyed working for them. workplace culture is very good, and the most enjoyable part is they make sure you are well trained for the job."
good,They were always very helpful with any issues I had concerning work. It was a great learning and coaching environment with everyone always willing to help.
good,I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a career in the telecommunications market .  I would caution them to be prepared to work. Look for opportunities to show your skills.
good,Received training for all aspects of what was expected for the position.  A lot of benefits and opportunities for lateral movement within the company.
good,Relating to customer issues in a supervisor capacity working with others to encourage them to excel.  The hardest part is not being discouraged when coworker attitudes don't encompass values of company.
good,AT&T was a wonderful company to work for. The managers were always supportive. The company hires from within. The compensation was a per with market for Project Manager position
good,"1. Start meetings at 08:00 AM PT.  Usually, spend time reviewing design changes suggested by the Operations teams.  "
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is having different theme days so we can enjoy our coworkers and have something to work hard at be able to be included in it helped challenge us to be better and want to help make att the best company possible
good,"Fast-paced job keeping up with new technology. Learned a lot about team management, project management."
good,"Even with the merger by ATT the location was a good place to work.  It went from a customer centric mindset to something that made a 50/50 relationship with the customer and company.  I loved the ability to tell the customer that we were there just for them.  When moving to the new format, there were times you weren't able to assist the consumer even when you knew that it wasn't the customer's fault.  "
good,"Gives you the opportunity to grow in a professional environment and to gain many skill knowledge and to learn how to interact with different personalities and gain a good experience for both salesmen and consumer, "
good,Great company to work for good training fun work place good management team  nice uniforms fun staff very good pay and benefits at times goals are a little out of reach
good,AT&T is a great place to work.  Great manager and work life balance Managers are flexible and willing to help employees grow and thrive. I would recommend AT&T as a place to work.
good,"AT&T offers a great work life balance. Opportunities not as great in AZ vs TX, GA, or other footprint states.  If landed an opportunity the sky is the limit if you are willing to relocate"
good,I love my company and everyone I work for and with. The company has grown exponentially within the last two years so there are plenty of job opportunities available.
good,"One of the best company’s I have ever worked at.  I was able to transfer to different positions from being a supervisor statewide and travel every week to a location plus supervised 21 employees to transferring to a Chief of Staff job for department that had 192 employees.  Working on payroll, safety, personnel folders to quarterly meeting and the most fun of all the yearly business meetings.  To ending up working within CEO, Senior Management Benefits and reporting the Proxy reports on the annual basis."
good,"Un trato muy adecuado a todos sus empleados, buenas opciones de horarios y excelente puntualidad con los pagos"
good,A typical day at work would be very busy with customers in and out. You must use critical thinking while working at AT&T to help customers. I learned time management and retail management. The most enjoyable part of this job was that I would always help the customer to leave happy!
good,"There are a lot of opportunities and resources to take extensive training classes, and I took advantage of them."
good,"endless learning"
good,Training was extensive but done at a good enough pace to be able to retain the information. Great benefits which were offered to employees by the company. Very friendly environment.
good,"As a member of AT&T I learned early on that they were about the business of doing things in the most professional way possible.  Training was essential and was provided to anyone going into a technical field even if they were sufficiently educated in their area of work.  It's work culture was welcoming, but at the same time all work functions were structured behind a set of methods and procedures.  The hardest part of my job was having to downsize and convey to someone that their position was being eliminated.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some of the smartest people I've ever met."
good,"my typical day at work started with me waking up at 6am and getting to the job by 7 am."
good,"Enjoyed my time with this company learning about different technical software ect. It was also my pleasure to see the company unveil new features year after year rather that was Tv, phones, internet and home security..."
good,"I really enjoyed my decade+ working there.  I made lots of friends, lots of training, and lots of mandatory overtime.  Strict with the attendance and meeting your quota's."
good,"It was a fun job to work,  there was great work/life balance. They are union which probably added to that! Standard raises every year. At the time their were way to many politics for me to deal with!"
good,"The work was not challenging, it is all about finding your in with the customers. Sales always has its challenges, but as long as you hit all the talking points, it is very doable and enjoyable."
good,"Primary role of extensive; Analysis, Capacity Planning and Resource Management; Partner closely with Operations and Finance departments to create and drive strategic goals and manage global network planning; Work lock step with multiple business teams"
good,I found the job satisfying and enjoyable. I left because I had a family medical emergency in Ohio. Unfortunately I was outside of the area so I was unable to transfer without re-applying.
good,AT&T was a good which afford me the opportunity to learn different aspects of the company.   The most challenging part of the job was adapting to the diffident personalities encountered during a work day.
good,"AT&T helped me grow as an individual as well as a leader. I was often challenged and  I learned something new everyday because of it. I formed great relationships with employees, co-workers and customers."
good,"You'll basically live at your job, but they make it worth it. The hardest part of the job is that they will not allow you to sit for any portion of the whole shift. Wear comfy shoes because they watch like a hawk on sitting."
good,Great Company with a lot of earnng potential.  This company is fun and competitive.  At&t recognizes it's employees accomplishments and rewards them accordingly.
good,Professionally run company with great benefits and career opportunities. Dynamic environment requires flexibility and the ability to learn and perform multiple functions.
good,"Pros:  It's structured and metric driven.  It's not for everyone; however, the corporate culture is fantastic.  They really model their company philosophy. "
good,"Although, I am sadden about my departure from the company. All in all it was a wonderful environment. AT&T offered an experience that I can carry with me where ever I may go. The management was excellent and understanding offering assistance when needed and giving training that helped to expand the culture of the company"
good,It was a great experience engineering AT&T Light speed jobs in preparation for field work. I enjoyed the challenge of analyzing outside plant blue prints in order to push cable counts from one location to the next for final cable count determination and destination....
good,My teammates and manager was really the best part about working there. The free cell phone service didn't hurt either. It was a win-win in my opinion.
good,"loved working with the people and company, very relaxed work place with lots of fun and incentives for motivation from the company along with bonus offers,"
good,Company helped me to develop my sales skills and communications skills. While in this position I have had the opportunity to coach and be coached by those that have become successful within the company. Seeing this success I understand what it takes to be successful and how to continue to overcome daily obstacles.
good,Working here at AT&T was phenomenal. It wasn't a stressful job and you meet outstanding people including co-workers. There really wasn't any hard part about the job. The most enjoyable part was being able to work hard every day your there then being able to have a few days off during the week.
good,"The environment was competitive and stressful at times but the reward of accomplishment and helping the customer was fulfilling."
good,"Great place to work, technologically high end implementations."
good,"Excellent benefits, learned a lot from the different positions I had throughout my 21 years working there. Unfortunately the company is heading a different direction and there in longer a need for my position."
good,"buena empresa para trabajar, oportunidad de mejora en procesos operativos."
good,My experiences with AT&T in Herndon Virginia were awesome. I had a great team that I was able to share my knowledge with as well as learn new pieces of knowledge from. My manager was always open to suggestions and able to have a dialogue about what we can do to improve our operations.
good,Working for At&T gave me the opportunity to grow and obtain a management pin in order to advance into management. At&T is a unionized environment that worked to protect your job status
good,"Taking calls in a very stressful atmosphere, I was fairly new and I only had 2 weeks of training in care calls (only 1 month on the call center floor) then the whole call center immediately changed over to technical support and then we got trained again for another 2 weeks on technical support. It was a very hard place to find out help and when you looked up the answers yourself it was very hard to find. I was getting used to it when I got let go for not meeting my hold times."
good,My favorite job by far! Always something new to learn and great co workers. Getting to communicate with people and get an understanding of what they want or may be interested in really makes time fly
good,Great management and very understandable. Had lots of freedom with the company vehicle. Get to experience going all around town meeting new people and customers.
good,"Excellent work place, and Management is very transparent about the changes which incorporated at company  and AT&T provide  good opportunities to re-tool our skills."
good,the company was good fast paced good money. the money offered was good they did offer benefits as well and commission you have to sell though as well it is a great company to work for!
good,"es una e,presa con facilidad de aprender nuevas cosas"
good,"Get in assigned company vehicle and use company iPad to pull your first job.  Write down account info needed to perform job.  Head to gas station to fill gas tank or call and let customer know you are on the way to repair their service issue.  Upon arrival, place cones and greet customer to verify issue to be repaired.  Perform safety checks and proceed to side of home and check cable with meter.  Once trouble is determined, then either use iPad to trace cable or if you know then go to location and repair cable.  Once finished with the repair, then allow customer to verify that service is fixed and educate customer and give them a service promise.  Finally, close job and pull next job."
good,"Bellsouth and AT&T afforded an education, vast amount of experiences, great livelihood and so much more.  Great life-work balance in my 22 years of service."
good,I loved working for AT&T due to the empowerment I was granted. The hardest part of the job was finding time to attend company required seminars due to the work.
good,"Work Day: 7/24/365"
good,"I've worked for the company over 10 years, and am happy with the opportunities and compensation I've had throughout my career.  In the current landscape, job security is less than certain and advancement opportunities have become few and far between."
good,"Had a great time, if you're halfway decent its a good place to go. if you can't take constructive criticism don't go. you'll be eaten alive. There the pack survives not the lone wolf."
good,"Love working at AT&T,. We all work very hard and have good managers and leadership. Great opportunities for incredible training and constant learning Innovatiive ideas can be shared and then adapted to products and services. Great communication systems."
good,"It was a good place to review, the only thing was a lot of work was going to contractors and the premises technicians were being laid off.  Other than that, the paid time off, benefits, and pay were all really good."
good,"Excellent people, good projects."
good,Me gusto trabajar para At&t aunque el salario es muy bajo y las comisiones tambien
good,"The company in its self is a great company. As well as the building a great building. It is a great building for networking, as you get to meet many people in diff positions. They have a game room located near the café. Also they have a couple resource stations to help with your everyday job."
good,Many teams working together to accomplish one goal.  Everyone willing to help to get the job done.  Management actively involved to help get projects completed.
good,"Work would start at 7 in the morning and end at 3;35, we had 2 15 minute breaks and one hour lunch. I learned that when people ae going through a rough time it is always someone or some companies that are willing to help and not put more stress on you. Management was very nice, they understood everything as long as you called them and told them what was going on. The workplace culture  was very different and everybody accepted you."
good,I loved working with my co workers and management always made job interesting and fun. I also liked the fact when work volume was slow they allow employees to leave and not get paid for time not worked or you could use PTO.
good,"I love this company. It has great benefits including company match at 6% for 401k. Great compensation, but always changing. Because the company has grown into so many different directions, you have options when it comes to job opportunities. Between DTV techs, IT, service tech, frontline of the stores, marketing, and now Time Warner, there are a ton of opportunities available to you. Relationships and connections are important in this compnay. Maintain good relationships always and you will do just fine!"
good,buen trabajo sinceramente es buena empresa y se le ve futuro
good,"The competition just about always speaks of themselves in relation to AT&T because AT&T is their standard.  That is why their equipment, vehicles, apps, & initiatives have mimicked AT&T's.  However, AT&T seldom mentions its competitors.  Instead, it emphasizes its customers, its staff, & its quality of service.  AT&T is about training, certifying, & stable growth through thorough application of its established process, practices, & teamwork.  It is an excellent company with room for growth & value for customers."
good,"Challenging, ever changing to remain competitive, fast paced environment where you are pushed to be your best ever day. This is a good company to work for."
good,Working for AT&T is something that many people would jump at the chance to work there. AT&T is a Fortune 500 company so I was proud to say that I was an employee of theirs. It was enjoyable up until the end.
good,"Obviously no job is perfect, & corporations(which are not people) seem to grow more soulless as time goes by. However that job put me into the middle class & changed my life. During the great recession , I was doing great. It’s been 4 years, but if I get a chance to go back, I will!"
good,"I loved working for AT&T, they were flexible, changes were good for the overall company. The pay was compatible to what I was doing. I had flexibility to attend school. I would still be there if not for the downsizing. I looked forward to retiring with AT&T."
good,"I left AT&T because it is a union company which lead to lots of battles and strikes with loss of hours. Also since its union, they move up the people or give the better schedule to people who have been there linger not the people who do the best work."
good,"Typical day consisted of answering calls to our customers. Ahich was very fulfilling to halp those who needed your help with a simple task of setting up their voicemal,"
good,Work was about customer service and helping others. I've learned patience. The environment was enjoyable. Hardest part was sometimes having to let some customer down.
good,Great place to work and grow professionally. Vast opportunities to develop and enjoy work load. Best in class in industry with great benefits. Great people.
good,Great solid company to work for.  Atlanta was the place to work for AT&T!  The training is good and they believe in that!  From stand up presentation to one on one phone training.  A company that you and move to any position you choose!
good,"Att covers all the bases of a company that provides great wages, benefits, safety, and training to its employees. I would highly recommend them as an employer."
good,Loved the daily contests and monthly drawings to help boost moral. I really enjoyed this job.  It probably was my most favorite job.  Started as as customer service then moved into technical support and on to quality
good,"A lot to learn in a very short time, managers and trainers were very nice and helped quite a bit. Would've been better with hands on from the beginning."
good,"A typical day was productive, It was a pleasant place to work. The hardest part of the job was sometimes stopping for the day. I have learned a lot about latest technologies."
good,Great place to work management work with you love working with the people in the company has a good union that works for the people to get better job security
good,it was a great place to work but like any other place had its up and down moments people was nice an environment was good but need more pay and better incentives
good,I enjoyed working in this field (cash registers and computer). Management was great to notice the work of all employees and move each person up in money and functions.
good,Overall a good company to work for. Metrics for the call center isn't too hard to meet and most managers are there to support you. Using paid time off in my opinion is the best you simply scout the month/week/day and see if there is any time off available and if so you can choose to take it.
good,"Great place, strict attendance policy but great pay and benefits.  there's room for advancement.  Unfortunately, most of the jobs are going out of state except for technicians and cellular stores"
good,At&t  was a decent job good pay and hours  most the management was easy to work with most the time its a very easy to meet your metrix the environment is relaxed mostly with a air of compatition
good,Customer facing and fast paced job. Product knowledge of equipment and services a must. Great team environment. The best part of the job was meeting and working with both residential and business customers. Great pay
good,Loved the work but can become stressful if you let it.   Management and atmosphere was casual and relaxed.   It is a great place to work and has great benefits.
good,"The crew, you and your crew mates along with your manager meet in the morning andgo about the day. Some times managers visit you on jobs, lots of politics in upper management. Best part in not being micro managed for sure but still metrics to keep up with."
good,"AT&T was generally a great place to work. I was able to telecommute 80% of the time. My major complaint was that my team was spread a little too far (I was on call every third week) & that I was the only employee on my team, which meant I carried extra responsibilities."
good,The company certainly encourages education in order to progress within the company. The fast-paced environment enables any individual to cease any potential opportunity that may show up.
good,"LOVED this job & the people I worked with. Across the United States the HR managers collaborate and work as a team. Phenomenal dedication to providing world class, above average performance. "
good,it was good to work at AT&T. I enjoyed my time working for this organization i just wish the hours fit my schedule i hope i can work for a different department that fits my life schedule.
good,people and surrounding was really ambient and it was great working there.  and a lot of personal space so we would not get distracted working around office.
good,"Great place to work, but our life needs have changed.  My wife still works there...we've decided I need to finish school. That will provide better opportunities for our lives."
good,Fun and Fast Pace. The job is quite different from other companies. The workers and the managers work alongside each other to make a difference with one another including the customers.
good,Great place to work. Loved our management. Provided lot of training and cross training within our department. Loved the team I was a part of. Lots of brainstorming and pulling together to get the job done. Overtime offered.
good,"Family style environment, you write your own check, the harder you work the more you make there is no cap. 3 checks a month 2 hourly and 1 commission check."
good,"Great co-workers, Great place for being in doors, working with devices, dealing with people. A little stressful on goals. Our of the 3 and a half years I worked there, Goals raised as compensation got lower. The point system on tardies maxes at 8 points. And they don't fall off after a whole year.  This  kind of point system is very aggravating & hard to manage."
good,Great place to work. Must be able to work with change. Must be able to handle great responsibilities and work closely with customers and management and have outstanding communication skills.
good,Helpful management as they supplied on the job training where needed. I enjoyed the variety of work and learning new skills. The camaraderie among fellow workers made the job fun.
good,Es una empresa que cada crece mas y confía en las aptitudes de sus empleados dando confianza en los procesos
good,"The job is stressful, there’s a madatory shift change every 4 months that you have to bid on, you are given shifts based on senority. It takes years of working there to ever get a shift with weekends off. However the pay is great, I got 3 raises a year and your discount is 50% off all att services no activation fees or deposits no matter your credit! Great benefits!"
good,"While at ATT, I worked as a premise technician.  A typical day would begin at 8am and scheduled to end at about 5pm however sometimes I would get off as late as 10pm.  I learned how to run fiber and cat V wiring.  I loved my manager because he was very hands on. The upper management was basically non existent unless you were doing something wrong.  The workplace culture was very individualistic unless you were unlucky enough to receive a job ticket that was impossible to finish in the time given, where you were able to ask for assistance.  The hardest part of the job is working in the summer of Dallas outside.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the great feeling I had after finishing an installation started from nothing or putting a smile on a family's face by fixing their services."
good,Good benefits and discounts. Paid time off. 6% 401k match. Good people in my call center. Easy to learn job with various training classes. Will miss the people I worked with
good,"Start up business entity in 1995 which was expanded into a global outsourcing business  within 5 years.  Extreemly nice environment with excellent leadership in those years.  Outsourcing business included the management of a great many Global 2000 companies, many on multi-year year contracts."
good,"I started as Inside Sales for Small Business.  I was promoted with my time there including: Trainer, Coach.  This was a great opportunity to learn about small businesses and to help customers.   I loved the job and enjoyed the people."
good,"Excellent place to work, but many unknowns ahead. With the AT&T purchase of Spectrum (or failure to do it) thousands of jobs are at stakes. This creates great level of uncertainty. Great managers are quickly disappearing - hard to figure out what is currently going on."
good,This Company respect Work/Life balance. Telecommuting depending on the position . I've enjoyed working with my peers around the Nation in a collaborative /virtual environment.
good,"AT&T has been very good to me. Thru out my career some of the decisions the higher ups have made have impacted negatively their employees. "
good,I liked working for them and It was a competitive environment. Ability to grow was good as well but currently I will be looking for something else. Give it a try if interested.
good,The work place was well organized and structured. Management was more than professional and the tools and resources for assistance were always available. Departments could easily contact each other when in need and look for the best ways to assist customers.
good,The pay was good. There was competition between agents but it was friendly. The morale was low due to stress of the job and the metrics but nothing too hard to handle. Parking was terrible if you wanted to park in the garage across the street it was 40 per month. Discounts we're great.
good,It’s a competitive job that pushes you to be your best. The summers are hot and long. The pay is rewarding and the training is second to none. My experience there was great I had some very knowledgeable mangers who taught me alot.
good,"help customers with billing issues, receive in bound calls from potential customers that were inquiring about the services and assisted them with making the best choice"
good,"Very stressful, not family oriented, you have to be able to roll with the punches to stay employed at AT&T. The salary is great, the training is outstanding you have to be disciplined to work here!"
good,"This is the company that provided me the opportunity to advance in my career; where I learned about telecommunications, that has excellent benefits for employees and that is committed to diversity.  If it wouldn't be for a ""re-structuring of management"" I still would be working with them."
good,"Every day was different and interesting."
good,Muy estresante y no pagaban cuando era tu pago y se trabaja bajo presion pero con salario minimo y era todos los dias
good,If your a people person and like to help people a good place to work.  On a headset all day usually phones are very busy and this helps the day  pass quickly..  Options for day or night shifts  4-10 shift also available
good,"AT&T was an excellent company to work for.  The company has undergone various restructures therefore tough decisions were made about the workforce.  However, AT&T was very ethical in a number crunching environment.."
good,"strong focus on customers and services"
good,good to work in att it is a good company     it was nice experience with all employees    and management and all are created joyful environment at work station
good,"Cash handling, customer service, billing, inventory, technical issues, driven sales, leadership roles, training, maintenance, team work, etc. I enjoyed working at AT&T the first year and 3 months up until they changed management. The hardest part about the job there weren't many besides fixing other peoples problems they created. Overall I enjoyed working there wish I didn't have to l go my separate ways."
good,"This job requires a lot of attention to detail, because I am constantly talking to customer on the phone, I am constantly being closely monitored by managements, so its a lot of stress, but its business as usual."
good,Excellent place to work.  The benefits offered were 100% and was definitely considered to be a company respected around the world. Servicing and helping customers via the phone was very enjoyable.  The management style was hands and a team effort.  The office environment was wonderful and we considered each other as family in that most of the employees had worked together for years.  The hardest part was working on Sundays and holidays because the office I worked in was a 24/7 office.
good,not a lot of interaction with other employees or managers.....you are given a schedule and rated for your adherence to that schedule.  So pretty much need to be a self motivator and know your tools.  Calls come in back to back so have to be prepared for any situation and every type of personality and knowledge level when it came to computers and internet connection issues.
good,"this was a fairly fun place to work. "
good,"On my third 3 year contract  I worked with a great team, I was encouraged to learn as much as I could and my contributions were definitely valued. Unfortunately my spot was filled from overseas."
good,"The job itself is not that bad. The only real problem I had was the hours got cut way back for to long and could not afford to pay my bills. They went to more ""family Friendly job"" but that job couldn't afford to pay the bills for my family. That was the only reason I left or I would still be there."
good,"Yellow Pages were a multi-billion dollar division of the Bell System. I sold yellow pages ads most of my adult life it seems like. I beat quotas to death! But..., alas with the coming of the internet, yellow pages went the way of buggy whips. You just don't need 'em anymore! The books linger but the average quotas anymore are minus 15%. They will eventually  stop printing the book entirely but there was a time when I could make a thousand dollars in commission ""before lunch!"". "
good,"Layoffs in the near future and the lack of Job security, is why Im being proactive in search for a new opportunity. Manager layoffs last year halted all opportunities for advancement."
good,I learned a lot of new things while working with cabling. I know that its really good to drink a lot of water a day before work during the summer. The hardest part of the job is trench digging. The most enjoyable part was talking to the customers and making sure they are satisfied.
good,"Average day you take calls, 200 a day. you explain bills break down explanations of bills restore/disconnect services, make payment arrangements. My position was to take lead calls as acting manager."
good,I love that the company's business model is constantly evolving and that the company invests in the continuing advancement of its employees. I have found many opportunities to try something new. There is current employment uncertainty as lines of business and geographies change.
good,"Very good place to work"
good,"Fast paced environment with lots of emphasis on educating yourself for the future. Lots of followup with managers required in my day to day job, which both allowed me to work more as a team with them but could also be a bit frustrating as well. Overall a good environment to work in."
good,I very much enjoyed the experience of working for AT&T and would happily go back if given the opportunity. The hours can be a bit strange depending on which shift you bid for but they are amazing about doing everything they can to give the shift that is best for you.
good,"I considered it one of the better companies to work for being that is a major corporation. It is a Forever Changing industry and because of that, they expect the employees to keep up with that change."
good,"Made more money hear than anywhere else so far in my career. Environment is good."
good,"As a technician, with AT&T, you handle Customer Care, Billing, Needs, Personal Information, On-going training and development, and Scheduling. We are the bottom-line and the front office for the customer. If an order is wrong, we fix it- If the customer does not understand we explain- If a customer needs something, we utilize every tool made possible. You as a technician must learn and keep up with not only what the company is doing, but what other companies are doing also. You have to learn your craft and be a professional at all times. Be knowledgeable, adaptable and adept, intelligence and understanding, and able to explain and simply, but also you must be trustworthy. The company gives you a truck, a phone, an Ipad, and a uniform, you not only have to be a great technician for the customer, but you also have to be a great employee for the company."
good,"Overall I have worked at at&t for 18 years. Most of my experience has been in Sales & Development "
good,"I retired from AT&T, and am attempting to rehire. I am trying to hire back on to the Mobility side of the business. I do recommend working here. Great pay."
good,"Get into work, check email and prepare for conf calls.  Learned time management and how to effectively communicate with leadership. The culture was all about the customer, customer always came first. The hardest part of the job was driving change in an organization.  The most enjoyable part was networking with people in different organization and collaborating to complete tasks and projects."
good,Siempre te invitan invitan a superarte economicamente y laboralmente
good,"My review of AT&T, "
good,Training was very organized and the trainees were very knowledgeable. If there was something you didn't understand floor support was always available. The call volume was at a steady pace. It wasn't a hostile environment everyone was pretty nice and I never had any issues with anyone.  Whenever there was an update they always made sure we were up to date with the information and the made all available resource easy to find.
good,"I started working for first Southern Bell, Bellsouth and lastly AT&T.  I retired after 32 years of service.  It had it's ups and downs but what in life doesn't.  I was fortunate enough to retire with great pay and benefits."
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for, I really learned how developed my people skills and really develop a problem solver mentality. management team was excellent I feel they really had our backs. I really enjoyed the competitive atmosphere it made me better at my job and really pushed me and made me think of the times I played sports."
good,Area managers need to take a close look at their store managers not only at their store production but at their behavior towards employees.   How they really spend their time while getting paid with a high salary.  The Union doesn't really protect the regular employees.  Employees sometimes don't get the credit  or recognition for their excellent work but the manager will always get the benefits regardless of their real lack of commitment and dedication to their jobs.
good,Great environment but constant fear of layoffs. They want you to be loyal to them but are quick to have sweeping layoffs. Great benefits and a fun place to work.
good,"Great job if you can keep it. Being union, the only thing that counts is seniority. So even if your the most productive employee in the company, your gone if the lazy guy next to you has 1 or more days with the company more than you do."
good,"Todo muy bien en cuanto a ambiente laboral, aveces tocan supervisores excelentes y aveces no como en mi caso no le caía bien al supervisor, comisiones súper buenas"

good,Great ccompany to work for . Benefits and Salary is outstanding. Kinda hard to advance cause of the competitive market. Management needs more training
good,AT&T is a great first job for anyone looking to develop great skills that can take you anywhere. It will open up alot of doors for you early in your career. But they do require alot because they understand  what they are giving you.
good,I enjoyed working with AT&T. It was a great company and my job was temporary so I did not receive any benefits. I test mobile applications on Android and iOS devices.

good,"Excellent company to work for, excellent benefits, friendly work environment. It is a union based company which allow a better feel of job security.  Can be relocated at any time due to needs of the business."
good,"Great place to work. chances at winning prizes for different things. Managers were always there to help. The hardest part was getting back a bad survey from a customer that u went above n beyond for but gave me a bad score due to something that happened with the company from 1 year ago, but stated that  they were happy with me. The most enjoyable was the people i worked with. We always had fun and picked each other up."
good,"A typical day was answering calls and helping customers with there accounts and for new service and disconnect service . I learned a lot from working there and attend some schooling on how to treat a customer when irate and get information when needed. As far as management there were good but could get better. The hardest part of the job was when you had to sell for upsell customers and yet they would say no to up grading. But most of all , I truly enjoyed working there at that time. I mostly enjoyed my customers ,talking to them and helping them with some problems they had."
good,"Una gran empresa con objetivos retadores , creen en su equipo y gozan de un gran respaldo. Centrada en el logro y se reinventa continuamente"
good,"Great place to work, good management, job was not hard, but they only gave us a limited amount of time for service calls and in some cases it could be a full reinstall. Overall, it was a great place to work, I just was not getting enough hours to pay my bills,."
good,"Starting the day by checking the workload handed by the AT&T Executive Office, completing the left over works left behind the day before.  As we have to call each customers who handed their concerns to AT&T Executive Office, I have learned to be patient enough to hear the customers problems before I start to work on the case.  I have to look at both the business and the consumer sides to get the validity of their complaints.   My managers were very professional, approachable, supportive even to a personal level, inlcuding AT&T vice presidents who motivates all AT&T employees to contribute success in building AT&T.  Being around a multi culture workplace of different backgrounds, genders, ethnicity, I have learned that we are all the same who are able to work together and understand each other.  In the end we all have the same common goal, to be of service to people.  The hardest part was dealing with irate customers who starts to greet you with curse words, naming names, making bad comments on my accents.  The good side is we make the irate customer experience as a laughing item the end of the day.  The best part is that we are still being connected with your fellow workers after so many years have gone by."
good,Learned to utilize my skills with dealing with people in all type customer care issues and create programs in management to celebrate employees.  Room to create programs to help groups of employees as well as to create a resolve with all callers.

The company also does tuition reimbursement. Sales compensation is fair and lucrative. Great place to work!"
good,"I loved working in this fast paced atmosphere, it just wasn't right for my lifestyle at the time. I had just had my son, and you get shifts according to your time with the company. I'm sure you can put two and two together, I got stuck working every single closing shift. I could not do that being a single parent of two."
good,"Oportunidad de crecimiento, buen ambiente dd trabajo"
good,Excellent compensation and benefits.  Management lived by the culture and mission statement.  This boosted employee morale and made for a better work environment.
good,"great management style"
good,"AT&T was an incredible company to work for. The best thing about working for this company were the benefits. As a representative they gave you 50% your monthly bill. More importantly, the health benefits were out of this world."
good,"Its a great employer, great benefits, pay and job atmosphere. Only thing is the work schedule, if you are new, you're more than likely to get the least wanted schedule, since they use seniority to give out schedules."

good,I've worked for the company for almost 3 years and I must say it really shared me as a hard worker and Ive learned a lot by working in this field.

good,"AT&T has been a great company to work for as a technician. They have excellent benefits and good friendly management. The only negative is the work schedule.

good,"El volúmen de trabajo dependía del día de la semana y la hora del día. El día comenzaba con el registro en el ordenador y transcurría respondiendo llamadas de 3 proyectos diferentes de clientes de la AT&T. Había que registrar incidencias, tomar datos, dar asistencia técnica para la solución de problemas comunes, emitir cupones de descuentos para compras futuras, emitir reembolsos acreditados a las tarjetas de crédito de los clientes entre otros...Aprendí la excelencia en la atención al cliente donde bajo los estándares de la empresa ""el cliente siempre tiene la razón"". También aprendí a manejar situaciones de conflicto como por ejemplo el procedimiento a seguir para manejar una llamada de un cliente molesto. Mi jefe inmediato fué muy colaborador pero exigente a la vez. éramos monitoreados constantemente. Los colegas eran excelentes y formábamos un buen equipo. La parte más difícil del trabajo era lidiar con personas racistas que no querían que los atendiera una extranjera. Lo que más me gustó del trabajo fué la experiencia como tal que me hizo apreciar el trabajo de atención al cliente."

good,"Garage Management were knowledgeable and understanding. Showtime was 0800 and work continued until the workload among the teams was complete. Overtime was plentiful. Many incentives for exemplary work. Upper management seem a bit relentless and a little less understanding. Definitely mind company regulations. Responsible for vehicle upkeep and restock. Individual work environment, no micro-management."
good,"I loved working as a splicing teach, I learned so much and made me push myself to do more. I had to prove I could hang with the men in my field. I was sad when i was laid off, but they gave us a choice to become a prem teach. It was more interaction with customers going to peoples house."
good,Lo que más me gustó de mi trabajo  era que atender agente y  darles la mejor atención  y solucionar  sus inconvenientes
good,AT&T is great for people who want to advance and they pay really well. It is not that great for those who are 40 and above unless you quickly move to management. Otherwise they have good benefits and are rather picky as to who they hire.

good,"A typical work day I will take 25-30 helping with DSL internet support. Helping navigate through various troubleshooting steps such as checking cables, computer programs and setting up a dispatch for field technicians to go out to make repairs that can not be resolved over the phone. It is a challenging but rewarding position. Being ab;e to resolve the customer issue is the best part of my job. I have learned to assist customers remotely which can be difficult,because I am not able to physically go to the customers home.This helps to improve patience.Management is very helpful and very involved with each of their team members providing guidance and support to help you perform you job to the best of your ability but also helping you prepare to advance. Work culture is amazing here. We participate in many different activities from donating to well know charities as well as local companies. This allows each employee to participate in something larger than themselves which is a great feeling."
good,"AT&T offers competitive wage, excellent environment to work, good benefits package. Paid training and a safe anf freindly work environment. I enjoyed working for this company for 17 years!"
good,Most definitely one of the most fast paced environments I've ever worked for. Amongst all it is a place to learn and grow and to create a future in. I have literally learned life lessons while working at that job that I could not have learned anywhere else. My boss at  advanced enterprise became my friend as well as my mentor
good,AT&T/DIRECTV is a great place to work. Most of the management staff are very friendly and easy to work with. The customer interaction can make it very stressful.

good,"AT&T is a great place to work. I was able to learn so much being there, working side by side with management every day. It is fun learning about new technology every day, having to keep up with what is new with other companies to keep up with the competition."
good,The best managers I have ever had. Learned alot here was like a sponge because everyone I worked with had there on flow. I did not like the hours I worked. I sometimes would be there 12 hours.
good,"This company was very organized even when they were having system outages, employee coverage issues or productivity or daily goals were net being achieved the management team always stayed positive."

good,Hoped for better Job Advancement Opportunities.  As a Field Manager I had the opportunity to meet and network with multiple different employees and customers.
good,"My career at AT&T was never boring.  It included an eclectic group of jobs that I held and responsibilities which came with them.  I always enjoyed creating things - solutions to problems - even more than fixing things which I also was involved with - always.   From hooking up mainframe computers to facilities mapping with AutoCAD to writing complex programs to identifying issues, running production jobs in a UCC-7, JCL IBM mainframe environment, to making sure that resources were available to spending time in a myriad of classes - I really enjoyed my time at AT&T."

I had a team of 20 to 30 service representatives to manage, which included training, motivating and evaluating their progress to ensure goals are met.

good,High energy job with great benefits. Daily interactions with all levels of management and great opportunities for interaction with co-workers. Multiple schedules.
good,"un día típico los fines de semana, aprendí a tener buena comunicación con los clientes, a desarrollar habilidades como vendedor, desconozco la gerencia y los colegas ya que estamos divididos por puntos de ventas, la parte mas difícil pues ninguna, todo se aprende por medio de capacitación y tengo la información y la herramienta necesaria para realizar mis actividades al día. Lo que mas me gusta de esto es el valor que te dan como empleado y las prestaciones por supuesto."
good,Great company with amazing benefits vast amount of products and solutions to offer AT&T offers training and coaching to help their employees succeed
good,"Typical day at woe for me is dealing with customer help solve problems, up selling and cross selling items in the store, cash handling, and counting all the drawers at the end of the night and doing the deposit."

good,AT&T corporate spent time and money in trainings which I liked. I was responsible for building their wireless locations. Hiring ppl and management was fun

good,"you received plenty of training.  But don't get to use to your current team, because it will change after 4 months.  It really gives you a chance to get to know everyone in the company. You will also learn your strengths and weaknesses."
good,"Great place to work, I greeted customer and offered a complete solution based on their needs. I sold phones, accessories, Direct TV, internet services  and provided excellent customer service. I learned how to deal with customers based on their needs. The management would help with any issues that would come up if we could not handle them ourselves. It was a fast passed work environment with great rewards. The best part of the job was working with the public."
good,"Very good company to work for, most employees are overloaded with work.  Co Workers are great, they offer some telecommute positions. The most enjoyable part was learning cloud and new technologies"
good,"I haven't had many jobs, but this is the first and only experience where the promise of advancement opportunities was actually fulfilled. I was able to perform a total of five different roles in four years. The pay is outstanding, especially since I have no education past high school. You get a discount from literally every company out there through Perks At Work, you get a great base salary, commission, and random incentives that pay you even more. Of course, there are some sacrifices. For some, the environment is extremely stressful. I find that if you stick to doing what you're supposed to do, that stress is minimal. Your work/life balance does exist, but only to an extent. This is retail, so unless you are quite tenured, you will work nights and weekends which more than likely conflicts with your partner's schedule. However, if you are career-driven or money-driven, this is the place for you. If you are family-oriented and value that time over absolutely everything, you might be disappointed. Unfortunate personal circumstances made it impossible for me to continue my journey, but as soon as I can I will return. I love the company and the lifestyle it afforded me. As a place to work I definitely would give corporate AT&T a 10/10. I can not speak for authorized dealers as all of my experience was with corporate stores. They are also extremely understanding and transferring is incredibly easy. Applying for positions internally is also easy. If you take a job with AT&T though, my #1 recommendation is NETWORK. Just like anywhere else, if you know someone, you'll get somewhere."
good,"Processing equipment orders on-line, processing address changes, printing yearly bill reprints for customers needing for taxes, etc.  collecting outgoing customer bills, sorting, boxing up and processing UPS or US mail labels for bills to be shipped.

I learned the customer service experience is reliant upon how well the customer service representative treats his and her customers, and how quickly the representative is able to solve issues, and answer any questions about those services.  Management did a tremendous job of training every employee on the best ways to do your job better.  They were able implement 1 on 1 training sessions weekly for any questions you may have, issues that may come up with the software and programs as well.

I process cabling jobs once the engineer and our cabling companies asset the work to be done. I process the orders in their system and a service order number was generated. I created an excel spreadsheet of all jobs in details of all our expenses so we could pay our cable contractors. Once a month I would receive a summary of each cable company to reconcile and contact them if the paper work wasn't received. The month end for our sales people was different from our month end, I would work late to process their jobs. The hardest part of the job was meeting your monthly forecast but we always did. The most enjoyable part of the job was succeeding."
good,Great place to work. Never boring always nice to work for customers who seem to always be excited once we arrive. In the Cleveland area winter seems to be the toughest part of the job. Management is is very fair and understanding for the most part.

AT&T taught me the importance of being a good corporate citizen, as well as the joy of working at a culturally diverse company. Management at AT&T is professional yet colloquial, with firm relationships established. My co-workers were hard working, enjoyable individuals who allowed me to perform the functions I could to free them up to do the functions only they could. The most difficult part of my job was in the restriction of which departments I could and could not support administratively; strict boundaries were kept. The most enjoyable part of my job was taking a document with raw data, and making it look professional and visually appealing, both in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint.  Many of the documents were intended to support the salespeople and it was critical that the documents were easy to read."

I work with professionals that keep me on my toes so that I can feel I am a valuable member of the team. Everyone has a certain drive to make it right; ""because my name is on that!"" And we all will work to make sure that the customer has what they need. My manager tries very hard to see you progress in learning things that will sustain you and help you grow. When you do well her manger knows about it. (I love that about her, she is not afraid to let you shine) I have known most of my co-workers for 10 years or more.

good,"The PMC WAS (emphasis added as it is closing down effective 05/01/2015) a GREAT place to work.  As level 1 managers (yes, the whole center was management) we served as escalation points for incubated projects.  We also incubated projects prior to their release, supporting beta testers and collecting data in order to improve the service that was being incubated.  I also served as a point of escalation for Tier 1 and Tier 2 tech support, where I would troubleshoot accounts, network issues and device issues ranging from poor data connectivity to dropped calls.  My Co-Workers were probably the best co-workers I've had the pleasure of working with as they were able to balance professionalism with friendship."
good,Great in house training for Telecommunication. Demanding yet rewarding work environment. Fast pace ever changing environment that keeps you on your toes.
good,It was a pretty good job. I spoke with customers all day handling their wireless accounts. My co workers and have a fun environment. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the many different personalities from all customers.
good,"During this period of time, I hired on with LA Cellular, which was later taken over by AT&T, but from 95-2000 the job culture was that of a smaller company. The job itself was managable and the workload was consistant but doable. The job allowed me to be self-managed, so there was no micro managing involved. Technology was slowly evolving and many of the functions that are now automated were taken care by our reporting group. Everyday and each day was enjoyable during these times."
good,"Enjoyed most of the experience with this company, co-workers were friendly and easy going. Work was at times demanding and required complete focus. Excellent compensation for the job, included great benefits. The hardest part of the job was dealing with equipment problems, there was no way to effectively explain to the customer why I could not complete their calls."
good,"Served as liaison between global business customer's and all other AT&T departments. Processed customer orders, resolved billing issues, placed and resolved trouble tickets, managed customer contracts, etc. Worked with great management team and coworkers."
good,"Working here I would say that it was really interesting. Basically I had to utilize operational systems to process purchases of AT&T products and services; i.e. collections, payments for Wireless bills and accessories . I would say the most enjoyable part of the job I would say is the fact of communicating with individuals and being able to help them with their minor or major problems."

good,"I really enjoyed working at Direct T.V. they have excellent benefits starting with Health Insurance right when you start your employment. I learned so much there they really trained you for your job and give you the confidence and ability to do your job well. Management is always there for you and I had the best Supervisor's they would take the time to really address your issue's to better serve the Customer. I would have to say that there was no hard tasks to do but all rewarding to help the Customer with there issue's was a reward all by itself. Direct T.V had great incentive  programs as well which ranged from earning an extra pay check to getting free Direct T.V.  in 4 rooms of your home fully loaded, NFL Sunday Ticket etc..."

good,AT&T listed as top 50 fortunate company in the United States. AT&T overall is a great place to work at. Benefit plus 401k and pension. Nothing that immediately pops in my mind that I could complain about.
good,Flexible schedule - was great. Learned to work with a group people - we were all expected to meet a quota individually & also prioritize jobs to meet print dates. Our managers were the best - always willing to help us and listen when we had obstacles that were affecting completing a job. Co-workers were easy to work with & willing to help each other out when needed. Hardest part of this job would be quota demands - since not all jobs were the same. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely working with great people that were willing to work with you to help you if you needed help & fun to work with. Relaxed environment - no micro managing necessary - we knew our jobs and knew what we had to do. If we didn't feel we could get it done - someone else could step in. After all - getting the job done was the ultimate goal - keeping our customers happy.

good,"toda una escuela de servicio "
good,"Worked at AT&T for over 18 years. Loved my co-workers. Upper management for the most part always seemed to be in over their heads and were basically reactive instead of proactive. Always looked to promote from outside the Market in order to bring in fresh ideas, but it never panned out that way. It always ended up with the new hire conforming to the current ways."
good,Flexible days but required to be reachable 24/7. Big business to big business processes. Management mixed but mostly approachable and supportive. Co-workers also mixed with a variety of skills and capabilities most complimentary. The hardest part of the job was the long sales cycle. The most enjoyable part of the job - the ability to chart your own course within tough parameters.
good,A typical day at directv will be basically you're on the phone 8 ours you get two breaks and one lunch you basically engaging with the customer as much as you can to get to the real root of the problem and it gives you this rewarding feeling when you can help each customer solve the problem
good,"Working at at&t taught me so many valuable lessons I have carried to practically every one of my other jobs. It was my first call center experience and my first to throw me out there in a more independent work environment .. With most jobs of this nature you only tend to hear the bad things; well, sad to report some of those rumors are true. It is up to you to make the best of those situations and ask yourself, ""How badly do I want my position; how much do I love my job; do I want this to be a career?"" It is not easy work and not made for a passing by job. This is a career opportunity that you have to be willing to work for. If given a chance, I would work at at&t again in a heart beat. I loved my manager and my co-workers (well, the ones I knew! hah!)."

good,"the most enjoyable part of my job was the team that I worked with, we were family, a true team and everyone helped each other. The most difficult part of my job, I really can't say the hardest, was at times trying to reason with a very dissatisfied customer. But as we all have learned, the customer is always right, well most of the time! learning to reason with, and help them to understand the issue, was more appreciated by them than to have a confrontation with them. My typical day, was receiving inventory, balancing cash drawers and the vault, counting inventory, restocking, audit the daily paperwork of 15 sales reps, and whatever else the day brought to me. I truly enjoyed my time at at&t,, and was very disappointed when my position was eliminated after 7 years!"

We were a team with one goal and that included management .."
good,"With high structure in arrival and departure time, a person can select what task they wanted to do each day and not feel a lot of stress.  I learned mechanical and schematic drafting and became acquainted with the items that were being drawn and the engineers involved.  Management was very visible but not very approachable.  Co-workers were like family since we were together for so many years.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the workload due to the lack of oversight.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility in what each person chose to do each day and the interfacing with people each day."

And we assisted customers with their mobility needs along with the building value process in seeing if the customer has other needs than just a cell phone. Co workers were great and wanted to get the Job done and provide that little extra that gives the customers that sense of value that brings in customer loyalty. The hardest part was keeping up with the pace of customer coming in the door, we were very busy. The most enjoyable part of work was connecting with the customers and finding out what would be the best solution for them"

I work with employees that have been there for 15 plus years. The hardest part of my job is when we get really busy. Which leads our customers having to wait over an hour to be helped.

The most enjoyable part ware the picnic and game events we had at the park.
good,i enjoyed my job at this company my group of coworkers opened the first store in ct it was very successful
good,Days in AT&T call centers were very fasted pace with back to back phone calls.  So your day went quickly.  The National Back office was steady with orders dropping in to correct and reissue.  People dont usually leave AT&T so you work with the same group of people becoming family.  The Atlanta office was family before we were laid off.  Always helping and encouraging each other.  My favorite part of the job was talking to the customer and hearing them thank me for taking care of there needs.  Turing that irrate customer around and hearing them say I'm sorry for being ugly at beginning of call. I learned a long time back not to take the anger personally and found customer usually have a right to be upset.  I treated my customers as if they were family calling about problem. Dealing with customer from all over the United States was like traveling without leaving home. The most stressful part of AT&T to me was zero tolerance on time.  One minute late signing in (even if you were sitting at your desk) was a tardy which counts against you as if you did not come to work for the day. Get to many of these and you will be terminated.
good,Top echelon company but many restructurings occurred in 1990s.  Compensation and benefits excellent.

good,"Each day we would manage tickets that would assist customer with resolving any networking issues with their businesses.  I gained knowledge in leadership, team work skills, coaching and training others, and customer service on a business and technical level. The management team was very supportive in providing effective leadership to help me gain the knowledge in each of these areas.  They provided feedback and training that helped me grow as an employee.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that it allowed me to complete my degree as well as gain neccessary knowledge to assist me in obtaining a career."
good,This was one regret I wish I never made. I left this position to pursue full time employment with another provider. I loved AT&T and the work environment. The employees were great and so was management. The would help you to be successful at your job and direct you to career advancements. I learned valuable experience with this position. I worked with multiple National Accounts and met some great people. The job did require a lot of travel and patience. You have to work with accounts were the employees are not commissioned to sell phones. You have to get there buy in and they must like you for you to be successful at this job.

good,Great job w/overtime and benefits! They previously didn't have the best management but currently have a new director so changes have been made!!!!
good,"I really don't have anything negative to say about att. They have met my every need as I do there's.  My co workers are a well-rounded group who I get along with very well. My management team does everything in there power to meet expectations from there employees as well as myself. A typical day at work consist of clocking in, making sure all the devices are out and working properly. Before the doors open the management teams makes sure we discuss the moths goals and where we sit as a team regarding ranking through the region and market. The hardest part of work has to be the system we use for processing daily transactions. Ipads are a wonderful tool, but when the software crashes every other customer its hard to stay focused. The best part of my job is the customers. Every day I get to meet all kinds of people who make my day enjoyable. I learn new things from each and every customer. Not only do i educate them on equipment, they educate me on everyday life lessons."

good,"Everyday of work started with a review of emails and processing Tech's orders. In this process I learned about the daily consumption of the inventory used by the Tech's. I would use this information to write consumption reports for the Tech's supervisor to review for their reports. That was the best part of the day. It gave me time to meet with and learn new task from the Tech's. After the Tech's orders was picked up and processed the most challenging part of the day began. I would then return back to my email and print all orders from contractors. After all orders are printed I then give them to my crew to be pulled and packed. Once all orders are done for the day inventory counts our preformed. After inventory counts are turned in, I use them to come up with a daily and weekly consumption report. This process helps me with inventory ordering at the end of the week. "

good,"There were various jobs to fill each day and working in the Marketing department meant working with all the managers, supervisors, sales team and anyone else on the floor that needed something printed or drawn up. We performed all clerical duties, reports, attendance, different projects and special task for the sales team whom we worked closely with. It was not a stressful job with a lot of pressure but one that gave clear understanding, clear directions, clear deadlines and praise and appreciation for a sale accomplished. (management covered that) Co-workers unselfishly worked as a team, helping to blend in and help when needed to finish a project. I learned a lot working at SWB and the job taught me a lot about responsibilty and ownership. Because the company is family oriented we had a lot of fun and a lot of family outtings. The hardest part of the job was when an employee waited too late on a presentation and didnt want to follow protecol and knew the allowances we had for each project. I really enjoyed working at SWB, I loved the people, the benefits and I would still be there except for the split-up between SWB & AT&T. SWB believes and stands for seniority within the company and because I had less than 10 years of service that allowed any employee with more years of service the privilege to bump me out of my position to prevent losing their position. That in turn is the reason that I left my job."
good,"Each day deadlines were met for multiple directories across the US. Strict detail to customer requests were mandatory. Contract agreements between AT&T and customers (internal/external) were verified and individual customer accounts were created to house all the applicant's information impacting their product advertising outcomes. Management was encouraged to direct their employees to be self-starters and instrumental in handling any adverse situations. The most difficult part of the job was making certain all daily deadlines were met, because if the pages to be printed were not complete---fines were imposed for holding the printer's scheduled jobs in limbo. The most enjoyable part was seeing the directories come together from start to finish, identifying the portions that were created by individual departments."

I also learned to get it right the first time. .One thing I can say about my coworkers were that they were willing to help each other. We shared new infomation that we would find out through our research and trial and error. My supervisor was very helpful and helping us to solve problem that was beyond our scope.

good,"My tenure at DIRECTV was an extremely rewarding and successful experience. Much of my daily responsibilities were of an administrative nature supporting Sr. General Counsel/Vice President as well as three Asst. General Counsel attorneys of IP Legal Department. While my previous experience had primarily been in legal litigation, it did not include intellectual property law. Despite the absence of IP experience, I was given the opportunity to work closely with not only the legal department staff but with engineers, international vendors and outside counsel. Over the years I was able to gain insight and understanding of how valuable intellectual property is to any successful company. It was noticed that I had the ability to problem solve and complete assignments with little or no supervision. I used these abilities to maintain heavy travel schedules, organize and submit all expense reports, summarize my communications with outside business associates and interact with multi-level management on a daily basis. DIRECTV has a great interest in their employees and made great strides to connect staff with management. Particularly the CEO's team has developed an open communication so that every DIRECTV employee can share in the internal company dialogue. In doing so, we were well informed and confident that communication with upper and lower management was available at all times. I have benefited from working at DIRECTV and am confident that the experience will be to my advantage in any future position."

good,"As a Human Resource Staffing Manager, a typical day included selecting employment candidates to participate in the employment process. I learned that it was very important to let each candidate stand on his/her own merits. As a manager, working with management we all worked well together.

good,AT&T wasn't a kid friendly environment. It wasnt a job that allowed you to spend time with your family.
good,Call center environment. Come and do your job then go home. The location where I worked had great management.
good,"It was the most challenging but most satisfying job I ever held. One never knew what kind of equipment failure or customer service problem you would face. I enjoyed the problem solving aspect.

The most enjoyable part is completing an excellent job and satisfying the customer"

They do have guidelines in which you are expected to meet i.e amount you can refund and time on the phone. But those are easy to meet if you want to meet them. The hardest part of the job is the people on the other end... They can be very very rude and because they don't see you in person, they tend to get nastier than if it were in person. But other than that it was great. GREAT BENEFITS and GOOD PAY. Which is hard to come by!"

The hardest part got to me when I was in school balancing my hardest class with a new born I had to choose what would be the correct choice I miss the company and would go back in a heart but I have to wait out the time period to be rehired which is 6 months. I learned sales how to connect with my customer and sale them stuff they would benefit from and tie it back to something I learned about them. I learned the role of managing diverse teams with multiple personalities every day was different same task but different out comes.
good,Working rotating schedule. Great pay and benefits. not a bad place to work. enjoyed working there for over 20 years.  Held various positions. overall not a bad place to work.
good,"If you are willing to sell, there is a lot of money to be made."

I wanted to quit so bad but I had the privilege of being part of a work family. I toughed it out and after about a year of pushing myself to the max. I was abled to achieve my personal goal of mastering retention specialist. I LOVED MY JOB!! I loved helping the customers and going the extra mile to make the customers happy."

good,"Very demanding but very rewarding.  Not a great union background , so don't mess up!"
good,"I would go back and work for AT&T honestly. I left by choice. They care about their employees. Yes you'll run into the managers and supervisors who are jerks, like any other company but overall because they make it a great environment, no one is really unhappy. You have to be a people person and be willing to be told the word no. There are sales goals to be made and you need to be consistent. I left on my own to move out of state, but they were the best employer I've worked for"
good,Excelente company to work. The work culture  makes you feel you are a big famil.I recommend this company to anyone that wants to work in a safe  environment.The only problem is the sales tiers and compensations sometimes are not the best.

good,"I am an employee of AT&T from 2011. The Company is great. As part of the sector I’m part of the which is AT&T Mobility its is comprised of 75,000 employees, with 5,000 store nation wide. The company has location all over the world. There is a lot of opportunity you can have with AT&T. Many employees work for AT&T they could retire and the benefits are amazing."
good,AT&T was a very great work experience and would love to work there again. The aggressive nature is a little intimidating but able to overcome. The leaders give as much advice as possible and help you throughout the work experience.
good,"Like any job I have some bad days (usually weather related) , but aside from that it is a great place to work if you like a consistent change of scenery. You meet new people every day since your working in their home, and always learning since technology is always evolving."
good,Great place to work. Fast paced and always changing. A lot of different positions. Great benefits. Commission could be a lot better. Sales incentives could be more frequent.
good,Very great job to work at. I loved working here. Been there 4 years. Great place to be. Some locations are better than others. You can make great Comission.

good,Customer service is the main focus of each individual. The company provides ongoing training for all levels of employees and follows up to make sure employees have the tools needed to implement said training and to assist customers. Their are also employee incentives for a job well done and there is a committee to make the work day fun.
good,For no formal education the phone company is a good place to work. Working as a tech outside your work environment changes with almost every job. most employees and willing to help one another.
good,"I started June 27th and am now the manager, great upper management, great coworkers, competitive commission, good benefits. I love my job!! This job allows me to travel meet with the public."
good,"I really enjoyed working with AT&T the only reason I quit was to spend more time with my son. He was 6 months at the time and the store I was working at was just me and a manager, this is not normal with the company so don’t be worried, the manager would leave early sometimes and I’d be stuck working an 8-9 hour shift alone and also working a lot of overtime. I worked 60 hours a week which gave no time to see my young son. Other than that experience I loved working there I worked there for 2 years and have nothing but good things to say aside from that experience."
good,"At&t is a great company and definitely worth every day year or hour you put into it . I began March 25 , 2019 left the company 6 months after joining and it was real disappointment to be separated from a job that is amazing and very helpful and outgoing the company give anyone the chance and right to move up in the company ."
good,"AT&T is a large company with various organizations and disciplines, each with its own subculture. The business marketing and technology ops organizations where I've spent the better part of the last 8-10 years are tightly-knit groups. They are extremely diverse and inclusive, goal oriented, highly collaborative, and very customer-focused. "
good,my coworkers were awesome we worked as a team helped customers out through out the day i learned alot on a daily it was always changes and something new added the hardest part of my job was the rude customers which i understand we have bad days but i always found away for mu customers to be satisfied

good,I love working for At&T.. It’s a great company to work for. Great benefits and I love the environment... Prime Communications is the best.. One of the best companies i have ever worked for.
good,Was great.  the only issue i had was at time the management didn't listen to impruvements and there was no suggestion box.  they started using a check list for calls rather than a individuals experiance ( which is what got you hired ).
good,"Great work environment, amazing experience on how to wire and set up a house and/or business, great people and always have help when needed, company pays for all the equipment needed."
good,AT&T Labs provides a great platform to enhance your skills and learn as you are working. The work culture keeps you engaged and truly helps in integrating well with both internal team members and external clients. Playing a part in the brainstorming sessions for upcoming business VOIP solutions (Cloud based) were the highlight of the duration of my work here.
good,Great company to work laid off due to department cuts. Job security maybe an issue but no issue the 5 years that I work there great employees and even better management
good,"the work is good, good benefits, the work environment is good, all very good, the only thing I really did not like is that for a job that can be done by 4 people placed 10 of which 6 did absolutely nothing and even those people earned more than those who did work"
good,"Es una empresa muy grande que da oportunidad de crecimiento,el salario es un poco bajo"
good,Working at AT&T was a great time. I would sill be working here if my position hadn't been deleted.  They empower you to be a part of a great team and they valued your input.
good,"productive and fun, a typical day is productive ,learnt aws and azure. Management  is good. Work culture is good .Enjoyable part is meeting and standup calls"

good,"Company has latest technologies. They have many events to keep the employees excited & happy. People are very supportive and hardworking."
good,"Able to work from home. Manage your own time, Lots of benefits including employee discounts. Great teaming and intra-company relationships. Lots of support during emergency situations such as hurricane."
good,Excellent company for employment with great benefits. Advancement opportunities available but job security not guaranteed. Company will constantly push for more no matter what the issues are.
good,"Formally Springmobile now taken over by a new company AT&T retailer.  One of the best companies I have ever worked for.  Great culture, employees are empowered, you are given the tools to succeed.  Company cares about you as a person.  Company is goal orientated.  Unfortunately Springmobile no longer exists.  I would strongly recommend working in any Sales retirement where honesty and integrity is the core of what they do.  Building lasting relationships with both coworkers and customers."
good,"This was a call center based job. In the beginning, there weren't any metrics that needed to be met. The focus was daily attendance. As time went by, different metrics were added. As long as you can maintain a great customer interaction and follow rules this will be an ideal job."
good,"- we all get together as a team & say positive things"
good,"A great company to work for.  They took care of me start to finish, and after I left the company.  Worked with many great people during my career, and a few not so good.  There was no bad part to my job, They trained me to handle all issues.  Working outside was the most enjoyable part of the job.  (Except below 0 weather)"

good,AT&T has opportunity for advancement  in a variety of fields across the nation.  AT&T dedicated to employee development and diversity and work life balance.
good,Please see resume. I loved working at the AT&T client when I was at Convergys. I did a lot of business analysis while at AT&T. I really enjoyed the people there. Let me at em.
good,"At&t is a great company to work for, I worked for at&t 3 years as a part time while working on my bachelors degree. Management was very flexible with my hours and always helped me to work around my schedule. Towards the end of my school year I was working 20hrs per week and when I needed it more hours I just had to let them know. I love everything about the job. Fun environment but DIRECTV is getting hard to sell as people is switching to streaming and it was stressful at times to not be able to close sells and explain what to do to hit your monthly targer"
good,It was a great experience. Great hours . Management cared about the employees. Although the traffics was horrible . And the commute from Covington was rough
good,Amazing work environment and amazing people. Training was fun and easy. Management took the time to understand reps and ensure we understood. Call center director was present and very involved.
good,"Great manager and task assignment/expectations.  Good teamwork.  Completed two major projects expected to last 18-24 months in 11 months.  Interviewed with other groups but was not a good fit.  (They were looking for developers, not system and devops engineers)"
good,Love working at AT&T and the pay was great.  Also love interacting with customers across the United States helping to resolve their issues.  I always enjoyed satisfying my customers at the end of the day.
good,Es una buena emprwsa para trabajar
good,"Best company I have worked for. Fair wages, paid vacation days and health coverage. I've had a wonderful time at AT&T, for Nineteen years. I would recommend AT&T to anyone."
good,My 40 year career exposed me to the leading edge developments for telecom and afforded my the opportunity to work with literally some of the best people on the planet.
good,"Good workplace. Management always focuses on employees growth. Different trainings provided by the company, so employee can enhance his/her personal knowledge."
good,AT&T has excellent employees that are dedicated hard workers and devote their career to the company for many years.  I enjoyed my career with AT&T for almost four decades and made many friends and was my second home.
good,Me encanto trabajar para esta empresa me entrego momentos muy bonitos y ademas aprendí mucho del negocio.
good,"Daily routine, includes working in a team based environment, fast paced, and challenging. In the construction department, your responsibility is to upgrade the infrastructure from aerial telephone phones to underground manholes."
good,The corporate culture at AT&T is the best you can ask for. Diversity and Inclusion is among the pros but job security at this point in time is definitely one of the cons.
good,One of the best call centers on the city. It offers great vales.
good,"Good company, good benefits and good pay. Diversified work force.  Some really great supervisors and some not so good.  Flexible shifts for some positions"
good,Siempre debes de salir con una mentalidad en blanco y positiva y dejar a un lado esos comentarios negativos y la mayor prioridad de todo es divertirse en campo
good,Review email and voice message. Ran a report to pull orders for the day. There was something new to learn everyday. EIS process. Appreciate the coworkers in the group. We all got along well.
good,"It was a great place to work. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. The least favorite part was the vacation selection after the people who had seniority had their pick and the strict attendance policy.
good,Optical is my first love it stepped away for a little while to do other things but I just want to do what I love and what I’m good at. Optical along with customer satisfaction is just what makes me happy
good,"I enjoyed working for the company and would encourage anyone that can handle a fast pace, competitive environment. It was my first time in that type of industry and went to take my experiences to another career alike."
good,AT&T is a great place to work!!!!. The environment itself is a wonderful place to be. Every job has its cons but the good outweighs the bad. The pay is even better and they’re not stingy with the money! And the discounts are amazing!

good,es una empresa muy buena con prestasiones y salarios adecuados
good,They provide the tools for you to succeed .With the  incougement from management.The sucess of your career path is totally up to you.. Great place to work.!
good,Store was always busy and fun. Management was by far the best management I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  Learned how to better interact with customers and up sell them when they already knew what they wanted.
good,This was a great place to work. I would still be working here if the office wasn't closing. I've worked here almost my entire sdult working career. I will miss it.
good,"It was a great company but I moved to Mexico to open a family business. I could not moved back to Minnesota so we moved to Oregon, that is why I am looking for a job here."
good,"Not a bad place to get your foot in the door within the telecom industry. Excellent training upon hire, even more training at your firgertips if you have the desire. AT&T is quickly moving away from the traditional phone/internet company and transitioning into a “media” company which is why I will be moving onto bigger and things. Pay is good at $25 hr but that is capped until the next union contract. Even then the pay increase might not be that much. But I have no complaints whatsoever other than its tough to move up into more complex roles, but that comes with time and time I dont have. Go for it I say!"
good,"I miss this job, I left as my newborn had asthma, didnt apply for FMLA like i should have. Came back, and credit history kept me from getting back on. This is the most diverse company ive ever been in. They really care about their employees. They offer incentives. They have rewards for hard work. I got the We respect our customers award and was granted up front parking for a month. A lot to look forward to in company. Yes, customers may yell at you. If you dont take it to heart, this job is perfect. If you aporeciate it for what it does for you as well as give you. Its amazing. Just the first month on the phones are miserable. You are so scared you may do something wrong. Your almost shaking at the end of a call scared for customer to hang up as ""what if next call is bad"". Short time in, you realize you have a great support system built to help you. The calls get easier and easier. Besides every call has a walk through way to do it through their online platform. Cakewalk!"
good,Really like working there as the people were very helpful from when I first started to when I left. The company I felt was run very well and was open about what their objectives were.
good,"If I wasn't getting laid off, I'd give the company highest marks. "
good,"It was an amazing company to work for! I am in the process of trying to get back into working within the company. If you are looking for a great job with great benefits, then at&t is your place!"
good,"ATT was and is a great place to work, would suggest getting degree before getting job there, sometimes hard to change departments even after getting a degree in a different job title"
good,Exceptional work/life balance. Management was all about helping supervisors be successful. The call center was team work focused and set up for reps to help reps. Monthly reporting was a little overwhelming with the number of call monitoring per rep.
good,AT&T is a top telecommunication company setting expectations for competitors. Constant growth will happen everyday within the company. Great benefits and competitive pay!
good,"pretty much 50 calls a day have to be made ...and managing current customers problems and concerns ,lunch and dinner is provided the days we work late 12-16 hrs a day"
good,Excelente ambiente laboral y buenos beneficios a empleados.
good,"Good hours, a good team and worked well together. A lot of challenges but there was always someone with an answer or can help you find the right answer."
good,"Working with ATT provided me with the best experience with learning to work in a fast paced environment, working in a team environment, working under pressure all while providing customers with a personable experience."
good,I love this job. I love the management I love my coworkers we all have fun. It just gets stressful trying to meet sales goals that are at times a little unrealistic.
good,"Going to multiple homes and businesses daily. Fair pay for the job type. Always plenty of overtime. Overall best job I ever had, just wish there was a bit more job security."
good,Displayed leadership and selling skills by increasing Year over Year growth for each ranked metric. Ranked in the top 15 percent amongst all sales managers in the New England Territory. Recruited and developed Retail Sales Consultants to help drive monthly quotas.
good,"Es una empresa que actualmente se esta convirtiendo en una de las mas fuertes en México, Desafortunadamente en el momento que labore en ella no era lo que yo requería."
good,I feel AT&T provided me a wonderful life for the for the first 28 years but company officers are making decisions that are forcing reductions. It's hard to make life plans when another surplus is around the corner.
good,"From the managers to the trainers the family mind set truly shows. If there is any questions or if you need help with anything everyone there is very helpful and friendly. However, they do expect you to use the tools you were taught in training and your own judgement."
good,If you can work at AT&T do it ! Everyone is friendly and management usually works with you. Great overall experiences. AT&T can sometimes be stressful but if you have a go get it attitude you will be just fine.
good,It was Southwesten Bell Telephone Company but changed to AT&T now. Past time I learned on keypunch then work on paper. It was a different time for today.
good,I was at the new call center in Houston. They had an amazing leadership team. They played by the book but I learn so many different leadership skills and it’s a lot of opportunity for growth if you apply yourself
good,"AT&T offers positions with training for career building in sales. Management attempts to help employees achieve their goals and company goals. It is difficult to write year-long sales plans, but it is nice that you are involved in the goal-setting process."
good,"Cómo en todo call center el estrés es a todo lo que da, las llamadas son back to back pero por algo es un TRABAJO, si sabes manejar el estrés y no dejas que este gobierne tu vida, será pan comido para ti, los beneficios son excepcionales, la cultura y el ambiente buenísimos, ayuda de transporte, recibes pago cada semana (vales o efectivo) tienen espacios para que te relajes y distraigas (sala de tv, mesa de billar, futbolito, comedor con hornos, refri y tv...etc) y lo único malo (en ese entonces) es que solo había horarios de 10 hrs y media ahora ya no, ya son las 8 hrs laborales por el mismo sueldo"
good,"80 hours"
good,"i worked in northern Arizona for Directv when At&T took over,was a hard adjustment. i left due to family issues. only complaint is how hard it is to get back on with now that family issues are resolved. Would go back in a heartbeat if there is a opportunity. EIII"
good,"At AT&T you have the opportunity to work with partners from around the globe.  Meetings are held using the most current technology for teleconferencing and video conferencing.  Through training benefits, employees are given the opportunity to continuously update their skills in order stay current in the fast changes within AT&T and"
good,I would recommend to anyone looking for employment. They are an excellent company who has been in the business of communications for many years and they treat their employees right.
good,AT&T is a great place to work and all the staff is great to work with. The store is busy and allows employees to work great with customers coming into the store.

good,"AT&T is in incredible company to work for, as they are a leader in change.  As well as valuing their customers as much as their talented work force..."
good,Teleperformance provides good training and benefits for newbies. The training they provided is very helpful and useful to newbies who wanted to grow in the kind of business. The management also provided good benefits like an additional bonus if the employee doesn't have any late or absences for the whole month.
good,"Very good work culture"
good,"AT&T Offers outstanding benefits,  Work life balance great play to work, however union based call center schedule changes due to needs of business every six months"

good,"Extensive training offerings"
good,"My role is speaking with customers and assisting them with the overall maintenance of their account. "
good,I was happy at AT&T and enjoyed my career there.  I worked 25 years and learned many aspects of the telecommunication business.  I loved the travel I experienced while working in the Call Center as a Call Center  Representative and as Coach Manager.  The workplace and culture made me happy.
good,"During my 19 years of employment I have worked technical, administrative, and managerial titles. I have held board positions with resource groups, obtained my BSBM degree, and advanced to a management position!!"
good,"Great teamwork with understanding manager, work in bad weather but well paying. Variable routes with mostly understanding customers and reliable transportation."
good,"I worked in operator services for 40 years, it is the only job I have held. I took pride in helping my customers in a professional and expedient manner. AT&T is a company that is concerned about its customer's needs and is always looking for feedback on how to better serve our customers. My department was very relaxed in nature we got along well with management. I learned the importance of pleasing the customer to best of my ability and to take ownership of the call."
good,"As an independent consultant to AT&T, I've performed a significant number of different contracts for AT&T over a period of decades. Most of my work was performed at client sites, either AT&T business units or external clients (for example, 2 years loaned to Chase Bank). Some places, I did everything from  Requirements Elicitation and Architecture through Development and testing. In other assignments, I was tasked with teaching C++ & O-O methodologies to development teams. I loved the variation in tasks. I  greatly improved my C, C++, Object-Oriented methodologies, and numerous other development skills  from some of the most skilled people in the world, particularly at Bell Labs. I do not know the workplace culture well since I spent periods of time on a variety of AT&T/Bell Labs sites. My experiences were primarily that the AT&T culture was formal and, on occasion, ended up hampering its best developers, while the Bell Labs culture was very informal and always strove to bring out the best in its technical staff. Their business units varied considerably as they were run semi-autonomously. Some were excellent, while others not so excellent, depending on who ultimately managed each unit. The most enjoyable part of my job(s) was that I was able to learn many different top-level skills & methodologies from teammates, some of the best software developers in the world, and was constantly being stretched to increase my skills. The hardest part of the job was periodic domestic and international relocations and a bureaucracy which often had different departments competing against each"
good,AT&T has given me the opportunity to grow my skill sets. I started with BellSouth in 1999 through the AT&T merger and acquisition of Direct TV and now Time Warner. Our 2020 broadband initiative is closing in on our goal.
good,The typical day at AT&T was handling inbound calls for Internet Communications. I learned the stress of a call center. The managment was there to help assist you in anyway they can with your calls. Workplace was safe. The hardest part of the job was learning the computer programs. The most enjoyable part of the job is to sit in nd listen to calls of others to help improve your skills.
good,Your commission relects of your work ethic. Without hard work and dedication you will not succeed in the sales consultant field at AT&T. A salary would be best recommended for this position.
good,"This job included writing Cobol programs along with JCL and MFS. I was also a Project Manager, Tester, Requirements author, and Release Manager. Programmer/Analyst/Tester"
good,"I The most rewarding time with AT&T was when I was promoted to management. My boss was very supportive and he lead by example."
good,Job was very good for what it was. it was very high demand and a bit stress but you did find time to have some fun. We helped customers who were planning to remove DirecTV from their homes and we had to try and keep them from leaving. We were trained in most departments including cell phones.
good,"I enjoyed working at AT&T, Inc.  My day was always busy because of the level of management and employees I supported.  I learned that the more I learned the more opportunites there were for me and management wanted us to succeed.  There were diversity among us and we worked well together.  The hardest part of the job for me was coordinating with other assistants to schedule meetings for our managers,(VP,AVP, Executive Directors or Directors).

I enjoyed working with all types of people within 50 states and the time management was fair to complete the task meeting tight deadlines. The work environment was very clean, comfortable and restrooms exits was accessible at ease. The hardest part of the job was finding a parking space due to building sharing but I created a plan to arrive 45 min early to avoid for being tardy.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of meetings every day of the week around 10 in the morning. Coffee, open discussions, and ways to stay safe and meet goals were a must. After the meetings, everyone would go to their assigned turf/neighborhood in hopes of meeting their daily quota. It was commission based.

good,at&t is a great company to work for if you can get passed the company politics that are played.  i never had any problems with the company as a whole but started looking for different options when the politics became too much for me to have to deal with daily.
good,AT&T started me on my journey as a manager. As such I always find myself going back to some of the principles they instilled in me. I also sharpened my closing skills while working at AT&T.
good,Great dependable job with all it's amenities.  Learned many aspects of the job & trained on the job time as well. Management is always helpful & go out of their way to insure your success.  Hardest part of job is showing up 100 percent of the time.  Most enjoyable part is a feeling of accomplishment at the end of each day's work.

Always a lot of changes and keeping up with the regulations of the communication business.  There is always chance for advancement and the pay is great once you put in your time.  There is overtime sometimes and some times it is mandatory.  I loved working there."
good,Good company to stay with.  People helped each other when there was a tight deadline and you could also go to managers and co-workers with any questions or problems.
good,I enjoyed the fact AT&T allowed us to work remotely. I''m more productive at working from home.  I'm not distracted by other employees stopping at my desk to chit chat or hearing employee conversations in nearby cubicles. I also enjoyed not dealing with the Atlanta traffic everyday.
good,"This is a great company  in terms of pay and benefits. However, the schedule is horrible and the company keeps hiring part timers and not enough full timers which makes the schedule even worse."
good,Provisioning orders. I learned how to work on a computer. Our manager was nice but firm. The culture was all about the team and supporting each other to get the job done. We enjoyed the job but we worked under a cloud of layoffs so it was stressful. I made some really great friends.
good,AT&T is a great place to work.  It has a culture driven on learning new technologies and keeping you up to date with trends.  Unfortunately it is currently driven on cost savings through automation and the department that I was working with has strongly pursued and implemented automation technologies and has agreed to company surplus needs.
good,"I loved working here, they put a lot into your training as well as the environment and benefits for their employees! I learned  a lot not only about the field that I work in but about myself as well. I would encourage any one who doesn't get to stressed out and has a strong work ethic to apply for this job."

I had the opportunity to learn so much and experienced so many different things.  I have no regrets, and I am looking forward to the next chapter in my journey."
good,AT&T really gave you the support you needed to reach your goals. Management was always willing to help out and drive you towards your goals. The benefits are amazing.
good,"i loved my job at AT&T, not only the amazing people but also the great learning environment and constant want to do better. They had great pay and education reimbursement"
good,Great career choice! Perfect job to start out in sales and to advance your career! Pay is very good so is the commission. Very competitive job and pay.
good,"Great Brand , prepping for leaving the land line world, oh what a difference  fiber ops, it was a grate  period . when ever you heard reach out and touch someone , yes i was apart of that era."
good,"Many Years spent at AT&T.  I saw the GNOC and many other extraordinary people, places, and offices.  What a great environment to learn from some of the best and smartest people.  A high degree of ethics and performance was demanded and delivered on a regular basis there.  Once you get above Director Level it is a totally different game.  You need to be attached to the person who will ultimately succeed at that company.  If you follow the unscrupulous or shady leader you will ultimately face your doom.  AT&T will only keep the best and I was one of the 30,000 people still working there immediately before SBC purchased them.  I wish I had not had a physical/mental issue that I abruptly quit the company I loved.  I would still be there if it were not for a young woman who said, just quit you will find another job.  I still have not found a place as challenging, that had ethical people working for them.  AT&T kept me busy with a career not a job. I never though I could enjoy working that hard.  I highly recommend working there and at least getting a foundation of what it is like to be with the best."
good,I enjoyed working at AT&T! Their compensation package is great! If you have ambition and creative skills AT&T is a good job fit. They offer training to ensure all employees are knowledgeable.
good,AT&T is one of the best companies to work for. They rarely hire but the wait is well worth it in pay. Very strict with attendance policies but still a great company overall.
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for with career advancement and educational opportunities. If you work in IT, this is a great company to work for and many different levels and jobs to work at, able to move within the ranks to different teams for more opportunities."
good,A lot of stress.  Leadership needs to re-evaluate how they run this company.  They need on focus on coverage and speed everywhere in the country.  With the recent tax cuts they have stated they would be doing more hiring but I a seeing the opposite.
good,"It was an honor to serve the public while worked there. I enjoyed the environment and the people that I worked with. The company offered so much opportunity and training for advancement that was hard to ignore. The company always did the best possible to satisfy the public,"
good,"I was with Southwestern Bell before it was AT&T.  I worked there 36 years and was happy with the company.  Benefits were the best, pay was great, and the people there were awesome.  Proud to have been able to work there 36 years."
good,"The division I was in was great.  We had a nice flexible schedule, a good mix of team work vs. independent work and a great mix of people.  The worst part was when our work was sent overseas and our office was shutdown...caused many hundreds to lose jobs."
good,"Great company to work for, you have ongoing continuing education to enhance your skills. I would reccomend as a place to work. While you are there get your degree."
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed working with AT&T. They have taught me a lot over the years of employment to which I am very great full for. Very well structured and plenty of room for advancement.
good,"Company is a solid company to work for.  I'd definitely go back to a corporate store, the right corporate store or work on the business development side."
good,"Loved most of the managers, area managers and even directors. Met many from different departments and locations. About the time you are bored or frustrated in your current position then you can move around."
good,AT&T provide great rates for medical dental and vision insurance. 401k is a great match with your investments. Vacation days are provided based on tenure. Flexible schedules
good,"Fun work environment with positive feedback from management for the most part. Gained knowledge of computer software and networking. Hard to satisfy customer needs without sacrificing your own metrics and goals. Great co-workers made the job much more bearable. Increasing heath care premiums, hard to advance, and now they are moving jobs overseas."
good,"Soy una persona muy responsable, proactiva, dedicada a la actividad que este ejerciendo, siempre buscando la excelencia en lo que hago. Detallista y colaboradora. Me adapto a cualquier ambiente de trabajo."
good,"I enjoyed every department I worked in at AT&T, including my coworkers and managers.  We were always busy but the training was  excellent and prepared us for what needed to be done.  I learned a lot about the company and about myself.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my coworkers."
good,"I was the  Administrative Assistant to the Director of the call center.  The duties of the position required me to support the director and three area managers.  I also had to coordinate company meetings and events, make travel arrangements, complete expense reports etc."
good,These were some of the best years employed that I've experienced. I would have attempted to find something within the company Full-Time except I needed to move on to another challenge.
good,A very nice place to work for with great benefits they take very good care of a workers free lunches always incentive programs AT&T has a rotating schedule so there's not a set schedule with them
good,"AT&T was good to me. Although it is a fast pace environment to work in, when I had to leave, they supported my decision and did everything they could to make my going away as smooth as possible."
good,"The duties would change frequently giving you a chance to learn all parts of the job.  It also helped to make the job less tedious and was fast paced.  You also have the opportunity to meet more customers.  When you do your best to help, the customer would ask for you, the next time they call in. There was also the chance to interact with co-workers, such as, luncheon, ball games, etc. where you would get to meet your co-workers family."
good,"I have enjoyed my experience with AT&T, and would work for this company until I am not working any more.  Great educational resources, Inclusive culture, and high standards of ethics."
good,Love the facked I meet different people every day. Working as a tech I think is one of the best jobs at the company. I’m the kind of person that wants a challenge of what I do.
good,Working on a national account (Signature Client) exposed you to numerous product development to meet Client business initiatives every year.  Engagement with Bell Labs to design solutions and provide cutting edge Telephony solutions keeping ahead of competition.
good,"Best Job I ever had. great mentors, and management.  Very creative environment. most research and development. regretted having to leave. big mistake."
good,"Provide information regarding customer bills. Retain information "
good,"Some of the upper management was not able to listen to the real day to day issues.  As long as you met the numbers given on a month to month basis, they were happy."
good,the typical work days were long but fast paced and interesting. It is a great job that keeps you engaged with whatever task is at hand. I enjoyed my employment all in all and the pay was great.
good,I loved my job and my boss. They do care about the people their team and help you if you are having a bad day. They are upbeat and I miss my job and my friends their. I relocated due to marriage and i miss them greatly.
good,Did not enjoy commission only worked with on other person so I has a lot of responsibility right from the start opened and closed the store most days .
good,"Was a very exciting company to work for. The only twist was, I could not board directly with the business because I was working for a contractor and was limited to advance internally"
good,Very fast paced environment and the direct management was nothing but top notch. I worked in the construction department and that I was a wonderful opportunity.
good,"I worked as a technical support agent for AT&T in a call center.  A typical day at work included loading up all my tools within 5 minutes of clocking into work and answering incoming calls with irate customers wanting their internet to be fixed right then (especially if it was a business).  The job gets extremely repetitive and sometimes you don't feel like you truly resolved the customer's issue at hand.  The team you are on and the type of manager you have has a huge impact on your success.  There are metrics you have to meet on a monthly basis.  There are specific metrics you must meet at the end of the quarter in order to receive CAPP - which is a quarterly bonus.  I learned a lot about technology and networking through 3 months of on the job training in addition to all that I learned on the spot when dealing with a specific issue a customer was having that day.  The management at the call center was very well organized and most everyone was on the same page about things that are center-wide.  AT&T has a great workplace culture and those you meet from different areas will stay life-long friends and contacts you could reach out to in the future.  The hardest part of the call center job is not allowing the customer to get to you.  However, the most enjoyable part of the job is turning a furious customer at the beginning of the call to a delighted one at the end of a call.  Overall, the call center is a good place to work for a short period of time. and the people you meet there all become lifelong friends."
good,One of the best place I got a chance to work in. Wonderful coworkers and great area. Super professional management and a great team to work with. I’m going to miss it all.
good,I have had all the support from the management teams to develop my professional and personnel skills . Every manager was a great trainer for employees to make sure no error has occurred by a new employee. As we all know the importance of  mentoring and initial  training for the new employee. I had no fair of asking any question from my team mates.
good,I was a huge fan of all my coworkers.  We are all out there for the customer and everybody was always friendly.  Management was always understanding that sometimes life happens.  If I did not have to relocate I would have never left.
good,"Great environments. Everyone is very friendly. Not a hard job. Love every bit of it...................."
good,It’s a good place to work. It’s definitely a fast paced enironment with a lot to do everyday. It keeps you busy which is great and you get to meet a lot of different people.
good,"I would not like to respond to this at this time.  I enjoyed working with the children and .being part of a team..  At the time, my salary was suffice so I had a way to take good care of my chidren."
good,muy buena empresa dedicada a la comercializacion de productos de tv satelital tienen buen manejo del personal
good,Help is provided after extensive training. A pay raise every 6 months and support by the local IBEW is helpful. Environment is fast paced and there is plenty of perks with the job
good,We would start out by getting to know every customer and what they needed from their phone service. If it was the needs of a family we would talk to them about their interest and what they liked about their current phone and disliked.
good,Great company to work for when I worked for the company anyway.  My department moved out-of-state years ago.  I had to either transfer with the job or quit.  I had to quit.

good,enjoyable work environment with great team members   -  sales focused workforce with additional support from staff  -  coaching focused on sales staff members
good,I love working at AT&T. In the last few months I have been top 10 seller in my district. If you know your information well then you should succeed.  Being bilingual helps me a lot.
good,I clicked right away with hiring manager. The interview process was detailed and to the point. I took position knowing the team would work well as well as management.
good,"The years I was there everyone I worked with (very few exceptions) were very warm and friendly to me. We focused in my group to develop a TEAM environment by using and sharing responsibilities working with each others strengths and weaknesses. In other words assigning tasks and responsibility to the individuals strengths and having others help out when a person in the team gets bogged down or behind. An OPEN dialogue both with management and employee  was key in  making this work. We worked with and supplied our GC's and vendors with whatever they needed ( applications, training, help, programming, manpower, on site meetings ect::) to complete the assigned tasks on time and within budget."
good,"un dia tipico es con atencion al cliente recibiendo pagos y brindando informacion a clientes sobre planes y servicios aprendi a manejar su su sistema a trabajar en equipo y siempre dar la mejor atencion al cliente o almenos tratar de hacerlo siempre teniendo siempre en mente el lema  yo le puedo ayudar, la gerente muy buena persona tratable y siempre escuchando brindandote apoyo etc, la parte mas dificil del trabajo fue atender a clientes enojados que a veces llegaban gritando  por suerte tengo mucha paciencia y no hubo problema alguno, lo que me gusto del trabajo es que conoces muchas personas."
good,All in all it was a wonderful environment. AT&T offered an experience that I can carry with me where ever I may go. The management was excellent and understanding offering assistance when needed and giving training that helped to expand the culture of the company
good,"Excellent work environment, a company with a strong sense of diversity and home/work life balance for it's employees. Great benefits and overall excellent company to work for."
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T. I found my job challenging and also rewarding. I went through many manager training courses and have passed them all. I also was at 100 percent on most of my personal goals and rolls training for AT&T.
good,"Great place to gain experience and knowledge. Work is also great, you are under pressure if you aren't hitting your goals, but if you are then you can't go wrong."
good,"A typical day for me includes: "
good,I learned a lot working at AT&T. They taught me how to to improve my communication skills. I learned how to be precise and accurate with my questions and reasoning with customers.
good,It was the best company I ever worked for in my lifetime.  They invested in their employees.  They paid well and their benefits were exceptional.   In retrospect I am sorry I left the company.
good,I feel that this job really prepared me for future positions. It was an awesome place to gain knowledge and training to supervise multiple teams. I also learned howo be competitive in sales
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company, I really like learning new technology, working to resolve all customer issues dealing with network and cellular devices"
good,This position consisted of cold calling and setting up appointment to Business Accounts. The Sales Team would present and resolve clients concerns and offer better Business solutions.
good,"It was the best job ever, unfortunately I had a bad team lead that pushed me to quit, looking back I should have went to someone above and I would still be there, considering it wasn't long after I left she got fired."
good,"La parte más difícil de mi trabajo como responsable del rollo out de la red LTE para internet fue luchar contra el desconocimiento y falta de experiencia específica en la tecnología y el sector que estabamos incursionando. Aunque el servicio de TV satelital hace parte del sector de Telecomunicaciones , DIRECTV se denominaba así misma como una empresa de entretenimiento y lo más técnico que conocían era la operación en las premisas del cliente ( Instalacion de la antena)  y la división de TI."
good,"aprendes a tratar diferentes situaciones y como tratar a los clientes, te dan la oportunidad de crecer, y dan muy buen  incentivos, pero es muy estresante por el area de trabajo."
good,"It is an awesome company that I would love to go back to work for them! Overall a wonderful place to work. My management and coworker were very easy to work with and I looked forward to going to work. Family oriented and understood that our lives consisted to more that just making a living, which is great for a single mom with young children."
good,Great culture within the staff. Everyone looks after each other. The pay is your motivation. Great pay with great benefits. Just very long hours can be too demanding with children.
good,AT&T is a good place to work. But there is an unhealthy relationship between union and management. Both have been around a long time and both are entrenched. They have been battling so long the battle is just about the union vs the company and the non-management employees are caught in the cross fire. Its like having two opposing bosses fighting all the time. But other than that a great place to work.
good,From the first day on the job. To the last it was always something new to learn. And i honestly enjoyed the job. If given another chance i would truly enjoy the oppertunity.
good,"I loved the challenge and diversity of the different programs I worked on for AT&T."
good,"took call after call nonstop all day long"
good,great place to work everyone is supportive of each other to make money. It can be stressful adjusting to constant changes and adjustments but once you get used to the pace the sky is the limit
good,"I enjoy working at AT&T - they help you get the training you need and have good managers, at least in the engineering group that I'm in. My wish to leave here is only due to wanting to move back closer to my home town -"
good,I was not full time but the ones who were complained how they don't make near as much as before. Management locally is usually pretty good but per usual the higher ups were ruthless.
good,its nice to work in this company and I learned a lot with all the new technolgies which is going to help me to proceed furthur in my career. The work environment is so friendly.
good,"Was able to work from home. Good management.  Good environment. We had a great team, very collaborative. I would return ina second. AT&T offered a good training environment."
good,I would recommend AT&T as an excellent employer. I really enjoyed my time as an employee there. I would have worked there longer but had to relocate and wasn't with them long enough to be able to transfer within the company.
good,"The workers are nice and respectful. The hours are reasonable. Managers are willing to work with you on your time of work. Nice place to work, enjoyable time."
good,"Great intern experience - learned a lot and was treated wonderfully. I have nothing but great things to say about AT&T in terms of leadership, management, and day-to-day operations."

If you are an executive, you have more chance of getting the flick as they save more money getting rid of execs and someone at the next level down inherits more work.

It was a sweet and sad parting.  I have not found a company that come near AT&T.  You learned to be a hard working employee which paid off.  I never wanted to leave work in the evening.  You were equipped to do the jobs you were working and then sent to one on one training with the programmers to make you job easier.  Pay was off the chain.

Use of a large number of tools is frequent, but they are laid out in a way that makes them simple to understand. AT&T's management is the best I have come across.

Management provided good atmosphere and work environment and they recognized the hard work I did and it paid off !  I was promoted twice and this same work was carried over to Lucent and Alcatel-Lucent after AT&T split.  The people were great and supportive of each other and made me feel welcome!

I work with an incredible team who are all extremely hardworking but also enjoy having a reasonable amount of fun,"
good,"When I started at AT&T, I started by selling phone service and internet.  Then AT&T went into our own long distance, and we added cell phones, and U-verse TV. Now we sell all these products and Direct TV as well.  This is a fast paced job, with a lot of multitasking with your customers on the phone with you.  You must not only retain the customer, but upgrade them and sell them other products. the co-workers are nice, but we all pretty much do not have time to chat as we have no offline time, except breaks and lunch.  the best part of the job is being able to help my customers, and save them money as well as upgrade and give them more for their buck.  when they feel good, I feel good.  The hardest part, is losing a customer after many years, not only are you disappointed, but your boss is also and you hear about it, when you don't sell."

good,"My kiosk was 6ft wide by 3ft, it was the smallest in the USA, but I trained my staff well, we outsold all inline stores for 3 months, before they closed the kiosk because Walmart wanted to get into the phone business."
good,"This was an excellent place to work. Managers worked together to assure we all was on the same page/consistency. If you were out on vacation, they believed in being on vacation, other managers would ensure your reps know the changing of policy or procedures to ensure they are top performers. Before we moved on to another project we ensure all the reps were trained and if they had any questions we (manager) would answer with the same answer-again consistency and all on the same page. We had fun at all times as well as was the top center in the the organization every year."

good,My time with AT&T was wonderful I enjoyed the pressure and the learning to make the day go by quickly.  It seemed that when I sat down the next time I saw the clock it was lunch time.
good,By far one of the best jobs. A day at the office was fun filled and very smooth. I've learned so much from this job from customer relations to inventory management. the management of the store was great.

good,"The work environment in Irving is incredible and the people there are great. The Irving office actually has no offices for management. Everyone has a kiosk. If people need to have meetings there are ""quiet rooms"" for privacy. Their walls are glass which you can write on. Very slick. There are small chat areas where you can break with fellow employees (just off of your kiosk area), and a cafeteria with 2 executive chefs. Time literally flies by after you do a hard day's work."

good,I have no ill will towards AT&T.  The company was good to me for many years.  It was time for me to move on. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and management.
good,"Everyday was different from the last. Being a Information Service Assistan/Service Assistant was something I enjoyed & did well. Somedays would be fast paced & the customers would know what they wanted, tell you & you could give it to them. That's a typical day. On a challenging day, some customers didn't know what they wanted or where it was. That's where your calmness & patience would have to kick in & go with whatever information they could provide to try to help them & move on to your next customer."
good,"Working for AT&T has allowed many opportunities to launch services that are now used every day like online chat for assistance.  AT&T allows me to learn about the new advancements in technology I wouldn't normally be privileged to.  The Leadership Team with AT&T continues to encourage job knowledge.

good,"Having the ability to come to work each day and enjoy doing what you do has been one of the main reasons I enjoy working for AT&T.

good,"A typical day is a hustle trying to out perform your peers. The management was very accessible and flexible especially if the idea brought in sales. my co-workers were my competition and my motivation.

good,Its a great company that you can grow with. They have perfect benifits and they work great with the staff. I loved this company.
good,"The call center was a great place to learn how to communicate with people from a business perspective. My typical work day was to make it to my desk on time no real room for tardiness because there was a strict attendance policy. The monthly metric, goal, and quota to meet each much would change over time. There was also the ability to work overtime to make extra cash with sells as well on top of the hourly pay which was a good thing. My co-workers would change every six months with my schedule. We would work together to make our team successful. The hardest part of the job was the flexing my personality for each call I answered and understanding the reason that everything changed so much. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk to many different people across the United States and being able to resolve all of the customer's needs in a professional way. I've learned how to work through the billing system and to teach others how to view their info in a different way."

good,"Great place to start and finish a career, good benfits great salary, but management and corp policies are not in the best interest of there customers and employees."
good,"Environment that nurtures creative flow of ideas. The people were very supportive and encouraged you to speak up. Even as interns, we got full-time health benefits. Interns work together so you get to bond and learn to work with people studying in other disciplines."

good,My initial career was at Southwestern Bell before the A&T merger.  At that time it was very common for relatives to all work there.  All of my promotions were with Southwestern Bell and compensation was great as well.  After the merger the larger size of the new AT&T meant that promotions and compensation were not as strong.
good,Had a very good time working over there all because of the colleagues and work environment . Learned so many technical skills and enjoyed a log working there. But due to continuous night shifts felt a bit trouble.
good,"AT&T is a wonderful company to work for.  My time was on contract so I was limited to a specific timeframe maximum which I was able to reach. If I were to be called back I would easily return.  I would say the hardest part about working there was knowing my time was limited, and working with leadership to get converted to a full time badged employee while being a contractor is not a usual occurrence.  Therefore knowing I would need to get another job when the contract was complete was a looming thought as time went on. I was able to work freely and accomplish the goals of the program in my own way which is a very open management style used by the technical directors."
good,Work place was inviting yet very demanding. The owner taught me everything I know and I feel very thankful for my time there.
good,Love the new product offerings and the continuous improvement to outpace the competition.  The balance of work and personal time is highlighted in the culture.

good,"Working at AT&T was a great experience and learning was a daily part of the job.  We were trained that the most important part of our job was our customers.  My contact with my customers was all by telephone.  I handled their claims if they were not happy with our products. I collected past due accounts.  I also worked at St. Elizabeth Hospital  in Granite City Il. (now Gateway Medical Center) for 11 years in the business office which consisted of admitting patients, discharging patients, collecting past due accounts, making arrangements for patients with no insurance or low paying insurance.  I really enjoyes working there also.  My coworkers were actually like family and I really liked one on one contact with the patients and their families if necessary.  I"
good,"Me capacité y aprendí en el manejo de recursos y de las relaciones con terceros, tanto en el ambiente interno como externo. Aprendí sobre el Brand Certification driver principal de la Compañía para las áreas de Operaciones y Customer Care. Potencié mi capacidad para la definición de Procesos y su implantación. La Dirección tanto a nivel local (Chile) como Regional (desde USA) potenciaba y aprovechaba las capacidades de sus colaboradores. Los colegas con alto nivel de motivación dado el alto reconocimiento de la Compañía a sus trabajos y el continuo proceso de aprendizaje para trabajar en equipo. La parte más difícil fue dejar esta Compañía dado que terminó sus operaciones en la región. Lo que más me gustó fue el respaldo que tuve para implantar los procesos en Chile y en la Región (Ar-Br-Co-Cl-Pe) con direccionamiento desde USA y hoy constatar que esos procesos y sistemas (CRM) se siguen utilizando en Chile.  Por otra parte también me gustó mucho toda la capacitación a mis colaboradores en el Servicio y relacionamiento con Clientes internos y externos. Hasta ahora tenemos un alto grado de relación y reconocimiento."

good,"I worked for AT&T for more than 20 years, starting as a 411 operator.  I was paid quite well, had great benefits, and always enjoyed working with my peers.  The company has changed quite a bit since I have left.  I would love to work for them again, but they do not have any customer service jobs in Los Angeles, other than with their mobility division which is all sales now."

good,growth and opportunity is high.  I have had the opportunity to work in multiple channels in the company which allows me to see how the problems occur and what steps to take to fix them.
good,I was fortunate to work along side great customer service agents. We had a positive work environment and worked extremely well together. Hardest part of the job would've been having to conduct calls to corporate operations therefore making the experience take more time but still a positive resolution to problem at hand.
good,The calls were mainly back to back. The calls would come in for customer service but we were trained to convert the call to a sale.
good,Fortune 500 mobile company. Long days and long hours but money is great if you hit your goals. Very friendly and family like atmosphere
good,The job opportunities that AT&T offers are fantastic.  They're training is the best!  Working for AT&T I held several different positions that allowed me to gain so many skills. They're an awesome company!

good,Great company to work for.  A lot of opportunity to grow in the company.  Does take a lot of time away from your personal life.  At times can be stressful.  If you push hard and do good you can make a lot of money!
good,"Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere of AT&T. As with any company there are some high points.(Customer to employee relationship ,benefits, and manager development) The low points included ( untimely layoffs, and specific sales quotas."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of reporting to my station, checking the daily stats and assisting customers with technical support. I learned the importance of great phone etiquette and listening, One of the most important things I learned was empathy, to listen and apologize to better solve a situation. Management was amazing, they would help whenever needed! The coworkers were amazing as well. I thoroughly enjoyed this job and considered nothing about it hard."
good,"On average a person would take 40 calls a day, troubleshooting any kind of technical issues, answering billing inquiries as well as offer promotional offers and upgrade offers to eligible customers. I learned what it was like to work for one of the largest telecommunications company there is, and how they've managed to keep the upper hand in the satellite TV services. Along with how the systems operate and how to resolve near any issue that would arise. Management is good, despite taking large amount of time to have weekly meetings leaving the floor teams without a team leader, they really do care about their employees, their concerns and any kind of issues treating everybody as if they were family. Co-workers are very very supportive of who you are, what you want to accomplish, and will help by any means necessary regardless of situation. The hardest part about the job was not being able to go above and beyond for customers in certain situation, you get left feeling like you could have done so much more if there was a little room to get the customer exactly what they want without a transfer. Best part was the satisfaction of one happy customer after another."
good,"When I think of AT&T I think of family. This compnay is keen on helping its employees gain knowledge, provide great benefits, and promotes within. My co-workers were team players and the hardest part about this job was the customers not allowing you to help them effectively. The most enjoyable part of this job was the incentives provided to employees who exceeded their requirements."
good,"A really good solid company to work for that offers great benefits - medical, vision, dental and short and long term disabilities. 401k plan with a very good match. Management is very good at letting you do your job, they do not micro-manage. If you need help with something the management team has always been eager to assist or guide you in the direction to find the help you need."
good,I have worked for AT&T for 17 years.  I am right now a manager woking as a Client Support Specialist and have the ability to work from home.  In this position I am the point of contact to large business customers.  I handoff the request to the correct department to get the orders worked to supply and meet the needs of our customers.  I have learned if you stay organized and work your request as they come it you will always stay a head of the game.  I enjoy making customers happy.  Responding to their emails quickly is just the beginning of reaching that goal.
good,"I had excellent days with AT&T, I was involved with many different key and high visible projects, I was available 24/7, dedicated, loyal, committed, delivered quality jobs, satisfied the clients and exceeded their expectations."
good,"At AT&T about 8 years, learned a ton and worked with the best in the industry. Benefits and perks are great. To fit the culture you need to be a go getter, a problem solver, an innovator and love constant change. Great training and continued development of people. Dealing with constant levels of change while you perform and find a way is key to knowing many roles here would be a good fit!"
good,I loved everything about this company the pay the supervisors and the work hours. Hoping i can find something half as good
good,AT&T is a great place to work if you want to be responsible for maximizing your earning potential.  They give you the tools to make the money YOU need.  It has taught me how to push myself to the limits and then sit back and enjoy the perks
good,"Great company to work for!! Paid training, benefits and an awesome compensation plan on top of your base pay. This company has lots of room for advancement and the people you meet within the company are all very inspiring. The hardest part about this job for me was the inflexible schedule for new comers, it is a union job so all schedules are done by seniority witch makes it hard for school and other activities outside of work. "
good,"The earning potential is great!  The training program is a great learning tool, that you will carry with you throughout your working career."
good,Excellent pay and benefits.  Most managers try to advance your skills to encourage and support promotions.  Worked with a dedicated and fun group.
good,It was a positive work space with positive people. I always felt motivated for work every day. I learned how to deal with complete strangers even more than i had before. Management was really there for us the whole time. My co-workers were warm people. The hardest part of the job would probably be dealing with rude customers but that wasnt a big issue once you get use to interacting with them. I enjoyed helping people save money on their cable bill and doing what the job consist of correctly.
good,"Every day is different; different issues to resolve, and going beyond the extra mile to ensure customers satisfaction. In customer service, employees should never take complaints personal. the hardest part of the job, is when a customer walks away with a negative view. Working and helping people, is the most enjoyable moments."
good,"I've never been employed for a company with flexible work hours and great benefits.  I've worked in sales for 4+ years; however, working for AT&T is another caliber.  Every day as an employee, I would have to make sure to maximize each sale with each customer due to the fact it was a commission based job.  Though that was challenging, I maintained to be one of the top sellers at my location.  I loved my coworkers and loved my returning customers as well as the new.  It was always a good time.  The unfortunate part was that we had a few members of management that was unable to follow through on their job duties, and were unfit for such a position.  Overall, I would recommend this company in a heartbeat, just not my location in new iberia, la."
good,"great place to work, the only complaint I would have is the lack of advancement opportunities. The business is ever changing and you will never be bored. The pay is great for what you do but selling phones can start to be lack luster after a while."
good,Learned customer service and valuable sales techniques. Exceeded expectations of managers. Excellent starting point into corporate and retail world
good,"I worked in a call center environment, selling landline telephone service, internet service,cellular service, and satellite TV service, dealt with billing issues and troubleshooting  service problems. I learned so much information about the services, interaction with the other departments. Management was very approachable and always interested in the individuals. Co workers were the same, I felt like we were in a small family owned company. The hardest part of the job was the ever changing laws and services.The whole job was enjoyable."
good,Amazing work environment. Great Benefits and Great Compensation. Amazing company to work for and management team is excellent very goal oriented and motivating.
good,"The management needs work.  If the company had a better management selection the employees would be different.  Other than that, it is a great environment to work in."
good,I worked here for almost a year. I loved the job itselft but dealt with a lot of fraudulant calls. Taking away from the enjoyment of getting actual customers with real needs.
good,I have over 15 years experience with AT&T.  The only reason I am leaving is due to a surplus.  I would love to join a company that values its employees as much as AT&T does.
good,"At&t is a great place to work, there are lots of benefits and perks, the schedule is always changing so you should remain flexible."

good,"Es una empresa muy organizada y consiente al colaborador, los salarios son muy buenos y la labor es muy buena."
good,I started working with AT&T at a young age and at first I was a bit nervous of how well will I do in this field. I was trained and gained the knowledge of the job.
good,"AT&T is a fun and challenging workplace, everyday you have a set goal to achieve and you learn about new products. On a typical day you'll get an email showing you MTD on your progress, and see what you can do to maximize your productivity of your sales time. You'll have a quick meeting with your management team to keep you up to date about our offers and promo. Management is always there to help, to close a sale or help with customer escalations. The hardest part of my job is when I'm unable to help solve a customers problem on my own and require assistance over the phone with customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job is making my customer happy that they left with products that can help them stay connected with their family or manage their business. Its more rewarding to know that I'd made someone's day by just simply troubleshooting their phone or help with their bills."
good,"duties consist of helping customers with technical issues with technology, answering any questions or inquires and sales of smartphones and digital services."
good,"Majority of colleagues have great interpersonal skills and are smart individuals which are quite impressive."
good,AT&T was a great place to work.  Regrettably was downsized back in 2013.  I always had wonderful bosses who treated me with respect and made for a wonderful working environment.
good,AT & T is the company I spent my entire professional career in.  I started in 1976 and retired in 2006.  The excellent training and management guidance I received through the years is something that I have carried and applied in every facet of my life.
good,Manged high volume sales of wireless products and services within Wal*Mart. I learned how to work well with customers and build customer relations. My coworkers overall were great. The hardest part of the job was running out of product do the high demand. The most enjoyable part was exceeding customer expectations.
good,"meeting and talking to different people everyday, the hardest part was getting a lot of no's... the most enjoyable part was making sales and seeing the faces of the customer when u know u saved them money..."
good,"start at 8 am and never really knew when your getting off was out sometimes till 2 am fixing something."
good,I learned that you have to be at work on time every day. I had lots of co workers and the hardest part of the job was the bad weather. I hope I have typed enough words now for this review.
good,"Balancing family and career can sometimes be difficult, I recommend this position or company for Men and Women who want to further their career and work 50-55 hrs per week. I found it challenging, rewarding, loved the management but sometimes difficult with balancing your family life, once you can master that task its awesome."
good,Fun Challenging educational... everyday was something new to learn in a dynamic atmosphere.  I would go back if it wasnt such a tough communte
good,"Loved working with the people here, the flexibility was awesome, great pay.  Since, google is still one of the fastest ways for clients to obtain telephones the yellow pages are getting harder and harder to have merchants to advertise in."
good,A typical day was very busy call after call. I learned a lot about cell phones while working there. Overall learning the job was easy they had a very detailed system.
good,"- Hubo diferentes planes de incentivos que tuvieron impacto directo en desempeño de empleados."
good,AT&T has multiple departments which makes opportunity for growth and advancement very obtainable.  I love that management team really cares about what is going on with it's employees and often request feedback to make our jobs more efficient.
good,"A typical day here was as good as it gets,just show up with a positive attitude and be ready to handle a heavy rush of customers. With excellent training and knowledge of the products the company make it as simple as can be to get the sales you need. Management may vary from store to store, but with a comission-based salary on top of hourly wages the sky is truly the limit."
good,"a typical day at work would consist of learning something new every single day, talking with others on an information basis, plenty of knowledge on a day to day basis to learn something new each day."
good,"Great company to work for, offering great benefits and opportunities for career advancement by providing tools and resources for training and development.  Allowed the flexibility to be able to telecommute when necessary."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job cannot be narrowed down to simply one thing. These are just a few examples: working with pleasant co-workers (known as my second family), receiving those satisfactory customer letters in the mail as well as recognition from the area manager because of them, that rewarding commission check at the end of each month, a peaceful one-hour lunch break, being motivated by management because they see your potential, as well as financial security and opportunity for growth."
good,"My work experience with AT&T provided me with leadership skills. I was placed in management positions temporarily to learn how to train employees, monitor calls, schedule meetings, conduct meetings and handle escalated customer matters. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning something everyday. There was never a dull moment. The hardest part of the job was being apart of the downsizing and becoming a dislocated worker."
good,"Great job, new experiences every day, no day is the same. Great if you don't mind working alone or with little help but friendly coworkers always willing to help in any way possible."
good,"In this position you learned something new everyday.  Everyday was exciting to meet and speak with new people every day, and closing sales was a rush.  My co-workers were always pleasant and a joy to be around.  I looked forward to seeing them everyday.  The most difficult aspect of this position was Directing 50+ sales reps in 4 different markets.  I was responsible for training the managers in all markets, selling and meeting sales goals myself, handling all pre-interviewing and interviewing, admin work; there were alot of responsibilities in this position."
good,"Built and maintained copper and fiber networks."
good,A typical work day starts around 8:00 am with customers anxiously waiting.  I've learned how to deal with the most complex of issues with ease and customer satisfaction. I learned how to delegate responsibility while being a team player.
good,I loved working for AT&T. It is the best communications company in the world.  The company has excellent benefits and offers competitive salaries.
good,It is impossible to go an entire work day without learning something new. Customers keep you on your toes and up to date on technology that AT&T has not exposed employees to just yet. The retail atmosphere is very exciting and a fun place to be.
good,A great place to work with great benefits.  A typical day began at 7:00am and ended at 6:00pm.  The Company allowed me to work my way up from an entry level position all the way to middle management.  They recognized my accomplishments all along the way through verbal and monetary feedback.  My co-workers were all excellent at teaming toward common goals.
good,A very good place to work with great benefits.  A typical day at work started at 7:00am and ended at 6:00pm.  Management allowed me to manage as I saw fit and allowed me to make mistakes so long as I learned from them and did not repeat them.  My co-workers teamed well toward common goals.
good,"The call center was a educational in several different ways."
good,"This profile is very interesting as i get daily new Challenges to prove my self, as a result i get new things to learn."

good,The Greatest company i have work for to date. AWESOME  management and staff. everyday mural of the people is great. want to go back
good,"Excellent company to work for... IBM finished contract with AT&T and I was layoff."
good,"In the morning the installers would want to ask any questions they had about service orders. Once they left the office I would check voice and email for messages, return calls and answer emails. When this was completed I would call the accounts I needed to visit and set up appointments. Before leaving the office packets containing brochures, contracts and my business card were prepared for the days premise visits. As far as customer preference would allow, I routed my visits for the day beginning with the farthest location to the one closest to my office to make the best use of time. The hardest part of the job was staying on schedule. There were always unexpected delays or something that needed attention now. The most enjoyable part of the job were the visits with the customers. They taught me everything from how to stay in control of the contact to how kidney stones were treated. Dear Abby has nothing on me.After finishing the last visit I would return to the office to write orders, process contracts and plan the next days work. Often the installers would come back in with referrals or something they saw in the field that needed my attention. Buying them lunch once in a while was the best way to keep the referrals coming. The management let us know what was expected and turned us loose to get it done. They treated us like professionals."
good,"AT&T was easy and very lucrative job, With all the training I had made the job easy, and all the hours i worked the money was very good as well.  The day was usually a 10 to 12 hour day depending on how many jobs and the job types, The managment could have been more helpful when you needed it. We all had to rely on our coworkers for help if we needed it and 90% of them where helpful."
good,"One of the Big 3- Telecommunications companies, (AT & T, Verizon & Sprint) which provided a daily insight to the ever growing changing and fast-paced nature of  Telecommunications in the U. S. Many talented people with a great mission but Management is often not on the same page with one another, thereby, slowing down the productivity.

good,A typical day of work would be very goal oriented. Everyone was very competitive and we all focused on making revenue for the company and providing excellence customer service. The hardest part of my job was trying to please each and every customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to handle the call to completion and knowing the customer has been right sized with products and services that fit them and their family's needs.
good,"Loved working with my co-workers, learned to deal with all kinds of customers. Gained alot of technical knowlege and was able to pass that on to customers and new associates"

My co-workers were team players and I was always working with new and leading edge technology."
good,"Flexible scheduling and work place, fun environment, great people to work with, outstanding benefits. Sad to see the lay offs that take place every year."
good,AT&T provides wireless services to a large number of customers. I was part of Sales FMO-a global sales platform or a one stop shop for the sales team in AT&T to market their products. The aim of this program was to effect a transformation from the current method of sales operations to a world leading customer and selling experience that provides a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace.
good,they try to take all the stress you go thru with the 100s of call you take and some are not the most pleasant customers ever they buy the entire call center meals to show appreciation that's a plus
good,"Great job that I enjoy doing, however I am relocating so commuting is something I want to avoid. I enjoy working in this type of enviroment but would also like to work for a little bit bigger company where I can be noticed for my hard work. On a typical day at work I sell roughly 6 phones and a tablet or two while also helping customers with technical issues and other customer service related issues. Management was good and co workers were easy to work with."
good,"Most days presented itself with a challenge which always added 'excitement' to a typical work day.  Although I enjoyed the work itself, having the ability to help employees, regardless of their concern/issue, was very rewarding."
good,"Love the management, developers, co-workers, and leniency with a stress free environment. No room to grow, as the project is starting to wind down. Learned a lot with very knowledgeable staff and wonderful in-office assistance."

All the folks that I had the opportunity to work with were all very exceptional and professional.  I greatly respect the management team.  I consider myself fortunate to have worked with, and learned from, such a high caliber group of people."
good,AT&T is a stand up great company to work for and i receive great conpensation and Benefits. It has a continued daily challenges that promote me to set goal and achive them. Excellent work environment and i pleasure to work for
good,They keep a lot of the poor performing full time employees and never hire the good contractors.
good,"Start at 8:00 Log on to several system since our office handled 4 diff Regions Nationwide.  Wonderful Company to work for since it has all the newest technology.  The Area Manger has always made sure we have work to do even thou its slow.  Most important part of the day, is when I can help someone w their phone service and they  have been trying for weeks.  We were trained back in 1996 its customer service  first.  I accepted a VSP December 18, 2014."
good,The job is demanding but you get paid for it.  Customers are mostly lovely they just want what they pay for.  Management is a little less than to be desired. Their boss puts expectations that can be ruthless. Management tries their best to accomodate all their staff. The hardest part of the job is hearing no and not letting it get to you.
good,A truly amazing work place. A company that gives back to the community. I had a rewarding experience.
good,"I would love to work for this company again if given the chance, great incentives, benefits, and overall place to work, the co-workers and supervisors were and are absolutely awesome"
good,"At the beginning of my Cingular Wireless Career, I received inbound calls from customers who were calling to make payments and/or payment arrangements.  If their wireless service was interrupted or suspended due to non-payment, I would take payment and restore service.  At times, I was able to take a partial payment and restore service with a payment arrangement on the remaining balance.  During the last two years of my Career at Cingular, I was on a special team called the “Charge Off Team.”  While on this team I would call customers whose bill was considerably past due, attempting to collect the balance and restore service; and most importantly to keep or save a valuable customer."
good,I loved my co-workers and gained a great deal of knowledge working under them while closing accounts and keeping great relationships with my clients
good,"I worked here nearly 20 years. Most of that time was very enjoyable. Once it became Lucent Technologies, it became inherently uncomfortable being part of a company that wanted very much to be competitive, but did not yet know how to do this. So, in my last two years, I was caught in the cross-fire of a company that seemed dysfunctional and my own attitude toward that dysfunction."
good,"We had good benefits and good managers.  I became a manager over a group of 17.  I monitored calls, how many orders they were able to do when they were not taking calls."
good,"The project is chellenging , manager is kind, team members are hard working and with good technology skills. They are just begin using Agile development life cycle, and always make new ideas and changed the team work mode to find out the best way to do."
good,This was a family owned welding and manufacturing business that was forced out of business during a market lull
good,"AT&T is an employee friendly company with very good work culture and excellent compensation benefits."
good,"I was offered certain things when I decided to move from one permanent job to this one, and although I enjoyed everything else, the compensation benefits didn't meet my demands nor expectations. Had to go... but left with a great job experienced and a rich knowledge."
good,I absolutely loved working for Sunglass Hut. This company fosters a great sense of family and there is a large team for you to communicate with at any time. Job duties are not very hard as long as you follow the rules. Teaches you how to communicate with customers better and to provide great customer service. Overall a very great company to work for.
good,"We had a quota of waiting on each customer as fast as we could but friendly and correctly.Each operator usually took 1000 to 1500 calls a day. I always got along good with my co workers . I am still friends with alot of them. The hardest part of our job was we tried so hard to help our cutomers and our managers would get upset with us for spending too much time with them. I learned how to use the computer , the office machines, good customer service how to get along with everyone. We had severall offices on the same floor and were eventually consolidated to one office. We had football parties and holiday parties in our break room. I really loved working there."
good,At&t is a phenomenal company that inspires employees to further drive and excel in their abilities on a daily basis.
good,"learned innovative new technology, great environment  to work, great people and opportunities"

good,Love working with new tech. Management was great. Co-workers were happy. Hardest part was long work days at times. Most enjoyable was the customers
good,"AT&T through three name changes maintained the core desire to provide customers, whether internal or external, the best service available. The employee training was thorough and continual. My experiences with people at other companies has enhanced my appreciation for the training that AT&T provided regarding customer relations. Because the work is customer driven, there are no typical days. You may plan a day to work on a project, but one phone call could send you into another direction, so you had to be flexible enough to handle that situation and remember your deadlines. Priorities of jobs may change daily, sometimes several times in a day, but the focus was always quality service as soon as possible."
good,"Great environment, high paced, energetic and full of fun activities. Enjoyed working B2B and learning different business interacting with their personnel."
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Directv. I had the privilege to learn and grow a lot with the company. A typical day on the job consisted of, answering telephones, solving customer complaints, typing a max of 70 wpm, listening, and giving quality customer service. The team leaders were amazing. They gave awesome advice and were always available to answer questions on sight. The hardest part of the job would have to be the call demand. While i was employed with Directv, they were also branching the location into the connecting building, and the call volume was not as heavy as n the bee hive. The bee hive is where the call agents received high volumes of calls, and because the phones and computers were pretty new to the business, we were still crashing and facing technical difficulties. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to resolve customers complaints, reaching our day goal, being a team player, and building awesome report with our clients."
good,I have enjoyed working for the company. The co-workers are like family. Managers are awesome and the environment was like home. Home away from home!
good,Typical day at work was assigned task with clear directions. Management taught me that the culture of the company is well-defined. The hardest part of my job was training people in India on my job before being laid-off. The most enjoyable part of the job was  that it allowed me to get my children through college and I was able to retire.
good,"Everyday each team was assigned certain regions and areas to work in."
good,"AT&T was a wonderful company to grow and develop with. I worked in Headquarters on integration projects that combined the Legacy AT&T and SWBT platforms into a seamless and unified platform. I learned project management, budget basics, testing complex systems, technical test case writing, union contract negotiating, and management skills. My co-workers were very supportive which made the job even more fun. I gave presentations to customers, Leadership and technical teams on the technology we were developing."
good,worked on ethernet services provisioning and testing and troubleshooting
good,I was rewarded for meeting team goals and making my customers happy!
good,"A typical day is about 40 to 60 inbound calls. Everything is monitored from average handle time to adherence. All calls are recorded and subject to reviewing at anytime. I enjoy talking to my customers. I take ownership of every call, and try to make it the best experience for my customers. The hardest part is when the customer is irate about the company as a whole. When products are not functioning properly. And the only thing I can do is issue inconvenience credits and adjustments. This means the main issue is coming from our technical side, and has to be worked out on much higher levels."
good,"Excellent benefits, and pay. Good, caring, and capable co-workers."
good,A great company to work for but restructuring is a predominant factor when working there. My position was eliminated but received a very generous settlement package.
good,"A regular day at Best Buy was to clock in and research and learn about new products, technology and appliances. We were to stay up to date on the latest technology pertaining to our department. My co-workers always assisted each other in areas we lacked. Management always made sure everyone had adequate training. The hardest part of the job was constantly learning new products weekly. The most enjoyable part of the job was testing new gadgets, appliances and technology."
good,"A typical day would be 7:30 report time with daily AM Communication Huddle. Earning potential is unlimited as overtime is usually unlimited due to no set hours with this position.Technicians continually dispatch on new jobs until job pool is clear and employees are notified they are released and schedules are bid for and rotate monthly due to Seniority.Great opportunity to learn Residential, Home, Business Network Installation, wiring, troubleshooting/diagnostics. Hardest part of job is lack of Work Life/Family Life balance. Most enjoyable part of job is interracting with your coworkers and customers."
good,"Handled incoming calls each day and ensured that each customer had all of their questions and concerns answered. I always made sure the customer could hear me smile and they knew I was happy to help.  I utilized my customer service skills and followed a script that management wanted followed to ensure that customer's went away happy,confident and satisfied that they received excellent customer service.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy, irate customers but in the end I was glad that most of the time  I was able to turn the customer's attitude around by giving them wonderful customer service. I would always acknowledge the customer and let them know I heard their concerns.  I worked well with my co-workers and we all helped each other when we needed to pitch in if there was a back log."
good,"A great place work, develop your knowledge, and stay on the cutting edge of technology"
good,"Um dia tipico para mim, como um gerente de projeto foi rapido passeado.  Eu reve-los muitos projetos que estavam em diferentes estados de construcao.  Eu -los por prioridade e importancia para a empresa.  Eu faco chamadas para os meus gerentes de construcao diferentes para atualizacoes de status e preocupacoes.  Torna-se dificil as vezes para gerenciar os projetos devido ao mau tempo, problemas com material e proprietarios dificeis de alguns sitios.  Eu sou um gestor experiente e respeitado e eu trabalho bem com todos os meus colegas e clientes.  Eu amo o fato de que estou mantido ocupado e quando vejo meus projetos concluidos."
good,"I would open the store and get ready for the day. I would make the deposit from the night before and get the needed change for each till. I would educate myself with new phone functions and accessories. I was the head CSR and would often help other associates with billing and customer service issues that they had trouble with when trying to identify problems with bills. I was meticulous at my job as I am with any job. I adapt well with a variety of setting and able to preform whatever is needed with no guidance. I loved working with all my co-workers it was like working with family. We all had a strong bond and work ethic.  The hardest thing about my job was when the computer would glitch and a feature wasn't added to the customers account that was suppose to be added and the following month when they came in wondering why their bill was so high. I had to figure it out. It wasn't hard figuring it out, I felt bad that it happened in the first place. I loved working with such great people who I am still in contact with even over the years and miles."
good,A 25 year career made many life time friends ad learned many new technologies.
good,"A typical day is answer phone, sales, answer question, set up account, which is extremely fast past.  I love the people I work with,, including management.  The hard part is selling in such a recess, and knowing it can impact your job.  They big when it comes to rewarding you or the office as a whole make the day go by.  Great company overall!"
good,"AT&T will always hold a special place in my heart & raised the bar for how a company should treat & reward its employees. I loved going into work & never doing the same thing. In this day in age, we are consumed by being able to communicate with one another. I loved solving my customer's problems & showing them something that suited them even better. My managers were the absolute BEST. Knowing that your manager is genuinely interested in what you're doing & making sure that your customer gets the best experience was always great. I loved my coworkers & although we worked towards a quota, or a different goal, we always were friendly competitors. I loved everything about the company. They were never shy when it came to recognizing one's hard work. The hardest part about the job would have to be actually rather easy, & that would be learning the new products & plans. Everything was always taught ahead of time, we always attended classes for new technologies, plans, & rates. They always made sure we were educated & knowledgeable in what we provided."
good,Got a Chance to try my skills at sales. was fast paced forcing me to be on my feet. got a chance to meet a wide variety of people.
good,"Fun and productive place to work. Management and coworkers were very friendly and helpful. "
good,"Great job, enjoyable work area, and very friendly staff. Hardest part of job was dealing with customers that came in very upset."
good,"I have always worked in restaurants so working for AT&T was different for me. I really enjoyed learning all that i have at AT&T, I now know how to communicate with people better because at at&t I only spoke with customers over the phone so i could not depend on body language to understand there emotion with an issue they had about their service, I am able to relate to customers because I am one as well.I now have strong computer skills,typing and knowledge of computers all together. I appreciate the time I was given at AT&T for the training and knowledge i was provided with."
good,AT&T is a great and fun place to work.  They have amazing benefits and different programs to help you succeed.  I enjoyed going to work everyday.
good,"A typical day at AT&T was very intricate and detail oriented.  The fast pace environment offered many opportunities to learn and keep current with the Linux environment I was in.  My coworkers were great and at all times supported each other and shared information that could be helpful in accomplishing our jobs.  My responsibilities were multi-facet and the hardest part of the job was juggling several projects all with different requirements and expectations.  I also think I liked the challenge this presented.  The most enjoyable part was the many People I met during my tenure there on all platforms., i.e., database, applications, hardware and network, to name a few."
good,"My typical day usually begins at 11 am and ends at 8 pm. In that period of time I was responsible for selling, helping, and teaching customers about all of AT&T’s products and services. The days are fast because of the large volume of customers that frequented the store. After 18 years in retail as a salesman and later a manager, I learned that you must be genuine, honest, and not afraid to ask for the sale or fix a customer’s issue. I have always gotten along with my mangers and coworkers because I am very personable and empathetic person and I am always smiling or laughing. The job was fairly easy for me probably because I have been doing it for so long. One difficulty was when we switched from computers to IPAD’s to do anything with a customer, because the IPAD’s were slow and small. This in turn slowed down sales and the overall ability to help a customer. By far the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers, I am defiantly a people person."
good,"Loved the opportunity, the position was challenging but rewarding."
good,Worked on a software support team unrelated to the telecom part of the business. Was a great place to work. Great teams. Great management. Great communication from the top down. Lots of room for advancement and growth. Benefits are fantastic.
good,"I was a project manager for large account installs of products and services. For over 20 years I worked out of my home. Over my 35 years of service with AT&T I held many positions including installation of central offices, training (course writing and technical course delivery), sales, and project management."
good,My manager was excellent and made coming into work a joy everyday.  Very laid back for advertising sales persons.

good,The typical day included interviewing Subject-Matter Experts and designing blended learning events for the participants. The teams I worked with were very knowledgeable and excellent communicators. I enjoyed every day working at AT&T.
good,The only problem I had with AT&T was that I was a good hard worker and they counted me tardy to a meeting I never should have been counted tardy to.  Water under the bridge though.

Co-works are from all walks of life, and some how with in AT&T we all melt together and create an amazing work environment. The Best part of my job was talking with customers from all over the united states everyday, plus the impact you make in your daily work."
good,"I worked for this company for 7 years.  I had to move to another state, where they didn't have the call center.  I did make good friends, which was co-workers.  I started out when there wasn't concrete on the floor in some places.  I worked up to where I was the SPOC (single point of contact) for the IRS.  I was also the SPOC for Bell South.  The corporate people of these company's would contact me about their needs for Blackberries at the time. I would get in contact with the warehouse and have them to send these out to them."
good,"My task was very easy I did alot of independent work, they train you will. I was paid a competative pay rate, base on a metrics. I learn many various ways to defuse irate customers. management was challenging  because of the many agents they had to assist, sometime the wait time would be a while. Co-workers; I didn't really have that experience while I was servicing calls, other than training groups due to me working at home. Sometimes there would be updates to the computer programs, during which time I would be out of work, that was pretty tough to go through. Making my own hours was the best part of the job."
good,"I enjoyed working with people and felt good when I left my job at the end of the day.  Learned how to deal with the public and most of my customers were friendly and easy to talk to.  Several of my customers said that they didn't know how the company could run with out me when I retired,  but I learned they did just fine.  I enjoyed my job so much as I felt I made a difference."
good,"I had good hours and great benefits. Great training. Sad that I'm not working there anymore with a lot of great co-workers. Loved knowing that a business or residential customer's service was repaired quickly and correctly. Teaches you patience in learning to deal with the public. A lot of self discipline is also learned which helps in knowing how to react with all kinds of customers. Hardest part of any job is being forced out after more than 20 years of service. Again, I really enjoyed working with several people over the years at AT&T."
good,"Great place to work overall! Excellent benefits, managers & co-workers are like family.  The hardest part of the job is change, within the company everyday.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the incentives and the pay is wonderful."

good,"Start the day by checking everybody systems and formulas, work with the accounting department with Microsoft excel program. my duty was to ensure that everything square to hundred percent and the only way that I could keep track of everybody was by adding formulas to the files.

I hate that ii couldn't stay as long as I wanted because I was pregnant and they didn't have a pregnancy leave policy because it was seasonal.

Management was lenient and did not care which time you came in as long as you came in at the same time everyday and you took your lunch around the same time every day. I learned how to determine the validity of reimbursement requests from customers. My co-workers were easy to get along with. Some were chatty cathy's, but most people were quiet and kept to themselves. The hardest part of the job was coming into work, and the most enjoyable part of the job was lunch."

While i was there I learned to talk to people better, i not only learned to become a better worker but also a better person. We got a lot of hand on experience with all the new devices. I loved the people I worked with. We considered ourselves family. The hardest part of the job was getting elderly people to understand that AT&T wasn't responsible for their Facebook, Email, and other passwords. That if they logged out we had no way of knowing what it was but we can show them how to reset them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with.

Also learned how to talk to people and to clearly communicate with customers as well as other employees and management.

I enjoyed getting up and going to work everyday and dealing with the variety of customers we dealt with from athletes to the everyday people.

good,"A typical day at work, was like any other day. You would come in and answer calls. Customers will call in about their accounts and you had to retain them as a customer and make sure that their accounts were up to date. I learned a lot from working at AT&T. Management was great. My co-workers were the best.

I gained many computer & people skills working at AT&T and had the priviledge to encounter many personalities with the many co-workers. I count this as making our work place a little more versatile. I was blessed to have wonderful management for the most part with an occassional moody one, although, this was never a problem. Scanning the printer pages was probably the worst part, it was not hard just tedious. Your eyes wanted a break sometimes. Everytime you missed work due to illness you had to have FMLA papers filled out & submitted to benefits. This was the only area where problem issues sometimes arose. I believe this was due to working with an outside party...the Dr's office, which didn't always understand the importance of getting this handled and completed in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part, aside from the people in my unit, had to be the sense of accomplishment when you got the job done and the book out on time, especially when it was error free."

Since the work place was a fast paced inbound call center we were all competing for the incentives and there were many. I used to be skeptical about the ideas from my peers however as I used there ideas and tested them out I found that some of those ideas did work.It was the most challenging part of the job.

Dealing with people my work was never done!  What I have learned is that people are people and in some cases you may have to change your technique or style in order to get the same job or task accomplished. As far as the management team, once again all people are not the same and if  we were this would be a very boring world to live in..........."

Let the customer know that its a department call asurion for insurance an provided the number if any claims would need to be filed. Then told the customer that I was sorry about the last rep.actions that I would be more happy to help with the issue and resolve it and ask them how there day was, the hardest part of my job would be to tell the customer no they cant get a credit due to policy, and the enjoyable part of the job was making them happy an getting to know the coworkers an learning through the process."

good,"overall a very fun place to work, sales support was fun since I had done inventory before. It takes a lot to have accurate and organized inventory, the second part of the job was greeting customers and signing them up for assistance. I learned to be extremely careful when receiving product for inventory accuracy since a lot of the items were high cost items. Management was great, worked with you and from the beginning arranged a schedule to get tasks completed. The people I worked with were overall friendly and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was that it seemed as the whole day was spent in there since we worked 9 hour shifts and most of us lived about an hour away. The most enjoyable part was working as a team and getting things done."
good,"Co-workers were fun to work with, job was very stressful as it dealt mainly with irate customers who wanted to cancel their services.  Management was constantly pushing selling on top of retaining customers and adding additional services."

good,AT&T provided the cutting edge of telecommunication careers. Education was provided to keep us abreast of the latest changes. My career was challenging and rewarding.
good,The most enjoyable part of my last position with AT&T was helping customers resolve their issues. We would get calls from customers complaining about their service and any other issue they thought our department could solve. I would listen and help resolve or forward to the correct department for them to handle. In this department you needed a lot of patience and customer service skills to handle some of the customers that would call. I also enjoyed working with my co-workers and training new people in our group.
good,A typical day at work can be from listening to a customer needs to fulfilling there needs. We learned how to over come objectives and be personal with customers. As a manager what my goal is to make sure i am there leader and setting high exceptions for everyone else so they can exceed there goals. My co-workers love working for me because i am to them a phenomenal leader with great exceptions from each and everyone associates. Hardest part of my job is really not finishing most of my task i like to be well organized and make sure all  of duties are completed when they are assigned.

good,"AT&T call center is always changing. What I mean by that is the products and services are always changing as well as the floor you are on. You will always have different managers, get to know all of your peers at one point in the history of working there. The team of workers you will be with are always going to be your go to point. Your going to have managers too but with this job you will have fun getting to know what it is like to be on a team that cheers for success. I would have to say that in this specific call center we actually have huge, and tiny hand clappers to celebrate our achievements on what we do, say, and even how we feel on each and every one of our calls. Even our managers do it. Though the toughest part about the job are the work hours. I work late every night, getting only 2 days off during the week. Now I know that is not bad, but trust me, it does get annoying to have to get a shift that you do not desire."

There are always incentives, coffee, hot chocolate in the winter, they have a company picnic in the spring. Alot of room for advancement and will even pay for college if it is for DIRECTV. The hardest part of the job was dealing with frustrated customers when something would malfunction. Other than that it was great."

We were taught, via yearly, on-going training, to provide excellent customer service, to deal with difficult customers,  to use Excel, Word, how to write business letters, to speak in front of large groups of people with confidence, and many other skills.  AT&T was very interested n keeping it's employees continually educated.  They provided employee tuition reimbursement for college related courses.  We were empowered to make decisions. Because of all of this, we were confident, very skilled, employees who provided excellent customer service.  As co-workers we were always on the same plane with eachother.  We all got along and worked well together.  Our management team always supported us when we needed assistance.  The hardest part was leaving such a wonderful company.  Wish the office still existed.  I'd go back in a heartbeat."

Working for this company I learned how to really multitask in a fast paced environment and think quickly with customers. The training I received not only helped me at work but also in my daily life outside of the workplace. I really looked forward to coming to work and my co-workers were awesome, it was like a big family. The hardest part I would have to say the beginning getting use to a flex schedule because every few days the schedule would change and could really change at any time, but it didn't take too long to adjust and adapt to the way the schedule worked. I enjoyed the overall experience of the job altogether. The support was phenomenal, pay was great, and the fact that they cared enough to make sure when we came to work we could  have fun while working was great."

After confirming appointments with clients I went into the field for the remainder of the day making phone calls and appointments from my car in between sales calls. At the end of the day, usually aroung 4, I would head back to the office to finish paperwork and set up the next days activity. The coworkers were friendly and helpful with each other to achieve the overall goal of revenue success for the campaign. Managers were very competitive however and always strived to create an atmosphere of friendly competition. The hardest part of the job was rejection or sometimes unhappy customers.

good,"Getting in to work grabbing your headset and plugging in at your position, began the work day experience. Handling hundreds of calls daily, Retrieving information i.e. area codes, phone numbers, addresses, movie information, driving directions, etc. from all over the U.S. and Canada. Hearing different accents from one area to the next, down south, up north, and in between, proved to be interesting, sometimes challenging. Certainly a positive experience, interacting with different persons and being a helper for each one of them. Having a great relationship with your manager and your co-workers helped the day go by. The hardest part of the job...one, was not being able fulfill the customers request because the information was not n  the database. Another, was whenever there was equipment failure.  The most enjoyable was when everything ran smoothly.  The fact that you had a job with a good company, a paycheck, insurance and stability, and a work family, was a good feeling."
good,"This position required an individual to be adaptable to change.  I enjoyed working outside and using my hands for most of my work. I learned the variations of cables used to bridge signals together, how to properly and safely use hazardous equipment, and how to execute pole climbs with hooks worn on your legs.  Management constantly encouraged the team to meet our monthly quotas in a positive way while giving constructive criticism on how to do so more effectively, along with other co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was the long days.  Your day began at 8am and could last until midnight at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.  They were genuinely pleased with your presence in their home, it made the day go by a lot easier. Overall, I am very happy working as a wire technician for At&t."

good,First job out of college.  Experience was like a dream come true.  Loved everyday of the company.
good,"My typical day started off as me going in early to start up my computer and the tools for my job. I like to ease into work so I would catch up with a few of my co-workers then clock in about 5 minutes early. I learned various essentials at this job the first one is team work. We were broken into teams then job functions and were able to communicated with each other easily over the computer. Even though I did not often ask for help it was nice to be able to help new employees with questions. The hardest part of my job is that I was involved in the highest level of support with At&t and some customer would be upset before speaking with you. I learned that after you let them vent and explain how you are going to help them really made them feel at ease. The most enjoyable is my co-workers and the environment, people there seemed to be generally nice and wanting to help each other each their goals from management down to employees."

good,"On a typical day at work It was always about the necessities of a customer. Helping them find a solution to their problems they were having with their product, in search of a new device or just wanting to know what was going on with the bill. I gained much knowledge working in this company since, us as Sales Consultant we had to be confident enough to know our products and strategies on how it would enhance the customer. I learned that customers should be given extraordinary customer service and be provided with the close attention. Management was very supporting. Daily giving me incentives on enhancing my knowledge of AT&T products and services. The co-workers were all friendly, extremely helpful and enjoyed working all day with them. I never had an argument or a reason to be unhappy with them. It was the complete opposite. My co-workers helped me out when i was caught in a hard situation. The hardest part of the job was returning defective products. It took a great amount of time and we had to be sure that the product was no longer functional. It was a little frustrating especially because, we had to fill out a detailed form of every product and give a summary of the usage. The most enjoyable part of the job was, interacting with the customer. When i got to know them more find out what they do, what they enjoy really made the whole experience extremely pleasing."
good,I worked at the call center for a short time but the work was very fast paced and very customer oriented. Co workers were all very nice and helpful. The work environment was very upbeat and even played music.

If you can keep up with the pace it's a great place.
good,"excellent service and team. a great vibes with no pressure."
good,"A typical day at work would be a day that starts off with a daily motivation, reviewing metrics from the previous day, coming up with a focus for the day and executing on it to make the day a better day than the day before. Listen to a call to see what took place on the call and find ways to make that call a call to learn from and make sure if any error was made to ensure that it is not made again. If it was a great call to make sure to tailor calls around that call to make it an extraordinary experience on calls going forward. Having meetings with co-workers and finding out what struggles we have in common and coming up with a game plan to ensure that it's a win-win all around (the customer, ourselves and the company). Delivering discipline is one of the hardest things to do. Being able to go in and finding out that things that you have been going over with a rep has paid off and they are making process on whatever the struggle was."

There were multiple tasks that needed to be completed on a daily basis: troubleshooting on-air applications,  running CAT5 cables, writing/modifying scripting programs using Perl.

After twelve years working for the company I thought I would retire with them in the future, unfortunately circumstances  of my wife's federal employment transfer to an out of state location required me to resign my position. AT&T was unable to offer a transfer to the region my wife was employed in as the company is down sizing the position I was fulfilling."

Typical day starts off with assessing the prior days list of items that didn't get addressed & making sure they get completed along with preparing for the daily scheduled conference calls, kickoff meetings, and project management status calls. I also assess the priorities of the day & work them until finalized. By learning how to become a better leader/manager and effective team player, I've learned how to manage small to multi-million dollar projects across diverse functional business units, team members & vendors. The management that I've had the privilege of being a part of, was nothing short of being exceptional, especially with their open door policies & letting the employee know that they are there to help if needed & that there's never a stupid question that you cannot ask them should you have a problem or need advice on something. They have always been caring, understanding & willing to help whenever possible. The same can be said for all of the co-workers that I had on my teams when managing projects and/or working in the same office. They were eager to help if asked and always willing to lend a helping hand. I can honestly say that we all got along well together even if there were differences among us, we all adhered to the codes of business conduct that the company set forth. The hardest part of the job was sometimes having to deal with confrontations with fellow teammates, when working on a project, when deadlines were approaching and they were falling behind.

Generally I may learn of a particular issue w/ a certain provider, or resolution for a new software bug. Co-workers communicate effectively to balance the workload ( i.e. e-mails, dispatch approval queue, delegate work to employees, and escalations from management ). The hardest part if the job generally is multitasking, we are constantly doing more than three or four things at once, it really keeps you attentive. The most enjoyable part of the job is resolving an issue for the customer and personally delivering results to them."

I learned to always go above and beyond the call to make the customers comfortable, knowledgable about their products and very satisfied.  Managers were teamplayers and go getters.  My co-workers were fun to work with and I made alot of friends through the years of my employment with AT&T.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to place a customer in a new promotion if they didnt qualify, because you always want your cuctomer to be happy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment, games and incentives and best of all good customer accomodations."
good,"Friendly company; loved the personnel and my job as an administrative assistant to the Director of my department.

Management was great from Supervisors to Managers!! Co-workers are the best to work with because we could depend on each other for help, I was looked at as a leader in billing questions because of my tenure. Hard part of the job I'd say is deal with customer who were were rude with out reason, but Kill them with Kindness.

I learned a great deal of how our Land Line Phone system works among many other things such as wiring and signal flow. I worked with some of the best people who knew their jobs very well. If I had to say what was the hardest part of my job, I would honestly say carrying my ladder. It was 34ft ladder and very heavy. But thanks to the company training and several employees, I was able to learn effectively and safely how to carry my ladder. I enjoyed every aspect of my job duties. From driving to communication with the customers."
good,"Working at AT&T was truly a blessing. It opened my horizons to Customer Service and increased my knowledge on hospitality, kindness and overall professionalism. The work was hectic as it involves taking 60-80 per call (on a regular day). I was a full-time representative and so I was entitled to all the benefits and holiday-paid days off. While the work environment was rich, management sometimes varied as it is on a per individual basis."

good,A typical day at At&t is lines busy and assisting customers in a timely matter. I have learned that when it's busy times flies by when you are enjoying what you are doing. Management is usually there to assist if needed. Co-workers are nice to interact with as we sometimes help one another as well. The hardest part of my job was to tell a customer they couldn't have something or we didn't offer something that they wanted. The most enoyable part of the job is to assist that customer and knowing they were completely satisfied.

This job was very fast paced and rewarding."
good,"typical at work consistent of responding/handling incoming calls from customers from either clients and/or account managers requesting support on telephone and/or circuit issues, some pleasant some not so. Either way customers were given personable service, meeting their needs and expectation as efficiently and effectively as possible. Certain issues that could easily be fixed during a call, customers appreciated the expediency and the option to either wait for the resolution while on hold or receive a callback. Committed to provide good service, follow through was very important to provide updates to customers. Co workers all worked as a team supporting one another with knowledge(those with seniority)as well as giving any pertinent ideas in better resolving specific issues whenever necessary. My reward was in resolving the issues and knowing customers were happy to have resolutions. I learned to not take things personal during calls where customers may be frustrated, by using the best way possible to give assurance to customer in providing them efficient/effective and satisfactory service. I enjoyed the freedom to use analytical skills for best or optimal resolution as well as having good support system from both coworkers and management to complete task. good culture.

Everybody in the company, since it is so vast and deversed, helps to bring a different way at looking to achieve a desired goal."
good,"The benefits and training are top notch. Team management in my area at that time was given to people based on education, not expirience, so we had several below average team managers.

Again this was an extended family to me. Management also was great. They recognized talent and hard work and did anything they could to help you improve and grow with in the company. The hardest part of my job at times was the demanding overtime and on call work requests due to bankruptcy filings.

good,"I worked at AT&T (earlier it was known as SBC) for a total of 42 years.  I was exposed to an expectation of good service early on.  During my tenure there I witnessed the greatest changes ever made in telecommunicatons technology, every thing fro four party lines to cellular and fiber optic technologies.  The pace varied, but we were expected to rise to the occasion whether is was a cut cable or a hurricane.  The greatest effort I had to make was restoring service to Joplin, Missouri following the horrific 2011 tornado.  I feel fortunate to have been a part of a great team.  Since I am no longer a young man I retired from a job of climbing poles and working in the elements but I will always take pride of my association with people of AT&T."

good,pues de la empresa es muy buen ambiente de trabajo lo unico malo es que no hay apoyo de la empresa
good,"Think its core values are important but in our case because our product is people, we really felt that it was important to try and codify and evangelize what an EF person is like. This is a company that tries not to take itself too seriously, so I think the whole idea of a corporate manual about values is a little un-EF, to be honest."

good,"My current workplace 2020 environment provides an opportunity to work independently and remotely at least 90% of the time.  I really enjoy working through rush hour traffic at home, which allows me to dedicate extended work hours.  I 've learned that flexibility is very important and sometimes processes have to be created as work is being performed. I am normally up between 3:45am and 4:am preparing to start my day between 6:30am - 7am.  My day involves extensive coordination, meeting scheduling and facilitation, conducting project schedule audits and creating audit reports.  I love interacting and communicating with internal and external groups.  However, I have found that some members of the organization are not as open and willing to share.  That is one of the toughest things to grasp.  I have worked in many organizations and have developed the ability to access personalities.  I would like to see recognition go beyond normal work responsibilities. A more diverse environment would also be a plus."

good,I learned a lot at this job and would recommend anyone that wants communications experience to go here and work. Had a lot of good experiences with customers.
good,once arriving to work we'll mostly start the day with coffee that was offered at our office. returning to our desks and answering calling in an organized call line. answering any questions or concerns any customers have. one of the most difficult parts of this job when a customer is antagonizing you or insulting you as you try to go about in a professional manner. that's where this job taught me to keep a calm steady mind and choice my options of wording correctly to handle the situation correctly. our location always stayed cleaned and spotless giving us a warming work environment. I don't know about other office locations but our management always kept things straight forward and was very lenient and kind to us. trying to work with us with any struggles we had with our attendance at work connected with our outside life. I love just our cooperation with one another to make working less stressful.

The best part was the team work and the friends that I met and still have."
good,The job is stressful and you are required to do multiple jobs.  You are definitely required to provide correct information to each and every customer.  Management is there to help but you must research your information before asking for help.  The culture is diverse and for the most part everyone is nice..  The most enjoyable part of the job is my paycheck.  I feel that employees are not paid fairly for all what is required on them.  The benefits are ok but I noticed that each year they are changing and not so great.

Keep in mind that a happy crew will be more willing to do more for the company the love and respect than a company they fear and have to cower down to. Sure rules are rules and they must be enforced and that should be done behind closed door in a one on one in all honesty. If the subordinate is brow beaten to submission. There is no respect nor admiration thus, no respect. Thus, tempers fly and mutual disrespect forms. In the US.

I learned to deal with different personalities and deal with them by listening to the employees first, ask open questions and ask how we can work together to get to the same results and goals we need.  As a Manager it was a challenge when the more seasoned employees did not want to change when changes were imminent.  It was hard for them to do something out of their norm.  The hardest part of the job was when there was conflict with employee versus employee (mostly during strikes).

good,"AT&T was a very good company to work for.  My day began at 7:00AM taking calls from customers who were late with their payments or had their services suspended due to non-payment.  The calls were a combination of pleasant customers wanting to make their past due payment before they were suspended and irate customers who were upset that their service was suspended.  The hardest part of the job was the irate customers, they were the most challenging but I learned to rise above the challenge by being apologetic, empathizing with the customer, offering solutions and maintaining a pleasant voice.  The most enjoyable or hardest part of the job was when I would win-over a customer that was upset by calming them down by the end of our conversation.  Our workplace culture was somewhat stressful due to incoming back to back calls but for the most part was very pleasant.  Management was very good at assisting us and coaching us to help us improve our performance but at the end of the day it was all about keeping our customers."
good,"Productive environment for high functioning analysts in a team environment with emphasis on life to work, quality, personal development and growth and contributions second to none"

I would absolutely consider working at AT&T again, if the right opportunity presented itself."
good,I liked my job and enjoyed the customers. A neighbor came to the door and let us know that the neighborhood was flooding and within an hour our house did too! That company gave us money to buy beds and things to put our house back together. It a great company. The day started with a meeting sometimes and training maybe. The customer calls were consistence and my management was quick to solve problems and make the flow easy. I enjoyed management and customers. The hardest part was finding my job was going into the office and not available to me at home any longer.
good,A typical day is productive. I learned how to operate as a customer service representative. Management is making sure everything runs in order. Nothing is hard about the job. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer have their needs met.
good,A very competitive environment with plenty opportunity.  There a lot of great people at the job that really appreciate your efforts.  Overall they take good care of their employees.
good,"Loved the staff, I wa lucky to have a great team. The customers in the area were amazing. I was heartbroken to leave. I took a lot of time rebuilding the customer base in plainwell. The previous staff left a lot of angry customers. Once I repaired those relationships the door swings doubled, the business community came back, and the stores profits doubled."

good,My day would start around 630am. Once I got to my desk I would  check email and set up the area I worked. Assign jobs and set techs in specific areas to begin their day. Check with field supervisors to see if there were any techs that would be absent and /or took a personal day and adjusted assignments. The most enjoyable part would be when everyone (techs) came to work that would make the assignments so much easier and the day so much smoother. The hardest part for me was when there is a scheduled appointment and the customer is not there when the tech arrives but wants him/her to come back. Or when it rains and the customer is calling in asking where the tech is and you are explaining the weather situation. That took some communication and skill when that happened thank God it was not often.

The good news is, they are open to it and in the process of this shift with aggressive & accelerated plans to achieve this notion. In the meantime, there will be casualties (loss of talent) while they consciously, and gently sunset older leaders unwilling to evolve.

My co-workers are great to work with, they are always there if i never need assistance and always know how to keep the workplace as stress free as possible. The hardest part of my job is telling the customers i cant get a technician to go out there same day. Because knowing their business runs off their internet, and not being able to get them the assistance they need right away can be frustrating. The most enjoyable part of my job is defiantly knowing I'm going to walk out of there at the end of the day with knowledge i didn't have before. Everyday i learn something, it rarely gets repetitive."
