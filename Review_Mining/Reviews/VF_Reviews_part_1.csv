rating,review
bad,I would work everyday for a week to only working 2 or only working 4 days in 2 week. The managers are mean and not flexible at all. I was let go because I could only work 3 days a week and it wasnt good enough for them.
bad,Slave drivers. Treat people like dog doo. Mngnt has no clue how it works. Wistle blowers are treated even worse. Would never go back and wouldn't recommend it to my worse enemy. Would leave negative review but this won't let me...
bad,"Store is a sinking ship"
bad,Supervisors change all the time . Poor pay and too demanding. A lot of favoritism as well. They expect people to work like machines even when you let them know that you are hurt.
bad,"Nachdem mein Arbeitsvertrag verlängert wurde nach 2 Jahren wo ich ein Unbefristeten Vertrag bekommen sollte , was bekam ich ? Ein Arschtritt . Mehr ist über so ein Unternehmen nicht mehr zu sagen .Immer wieder wechsel der Geschäftsführung und Unfähige Bereichsleiterinen ."
bad,Please do not waste your time Here.  The management is just pure rude and seems like they hate being married and obviously they’re going to take it out on you.
bad,The manager at the store I worked said that they would try to work with my schedule little did I know that meant I would work two days in two weeks then would get told if I didn’t work anymore than that I would be terminated. Another coworker would also say that “ I don’t do my job” and “everyone wants you to get fired.” Apparently always working the cash register isn’t working
bad,"The work is good and steady, but there no room to grow within the company. They dont give any over time. Management and the atmosphere is good, just need more hours or a better pay rate."
bad,"Management is crazy! Retaliation happens daily, no hours if you don't agree with them. Employees targeted by management to be fired because manager doesn't like them. Work on task above your job description and get no credit for it. Management would rather sit in the office than interact with employees or customers."
bad,Surprised the doors are still open on this place the management has their head so far up their a** they can actually figure out how to run anything wouldn't recommend to anyone
bad,"I had ovarian cancer and was dismissed a year after returning. Not even a month after being out, they hired in not one but two people and upon my return we were ""heavy"". While they saved work for me, I was never given my original duties back, as they had been dispersed to the two new individuals. Once my fmla ran out, I was let go."
bad,"On the surface VF Corporation is an ethical employer, promoting equal opportunities and boasting an environmentally friendly site and policies. Benefits on offer are in line with other employers of this scale, and workers can generally be proud to work there..."
bad,"No growth opportunity at all, even when you put so much effort and dedication. "
bad,"- ‘Training’ during first month was just a farce and did not help in any real day to day jobs and tasks later on"
bad,"I don't even know where to begin. First off the managers are the worst I've ever encountered. They're rude, unprofessional, arrogant, selfish, lazy people. The store is run like a circus! The store is constantly a mess with clothes everywhere and the employees show in their face that they don't even want to be there like they are in prison. The overall work atmosphere is just so negative and as soon as you walk in you can feel a gloom in your personality because it's so boring in there. Plus all the construction that happens WHILE THE STORE IS OPEN. Just a poor experience I wouldn't recommend anyone employ themselves or even shop here."
bad,This place forces you to work on days you ask off. no management around and refuses to take escalated calls. have schedules to where no one would cover phones. just not a good place to work.
bad,"Unrealistic workloads in store that was always understaffed. Fixtures were broken and in bad disrepair. Corporate notified of issues but never addressed the problem. Then corporation ""restructuredo and fired most full time merchandise specialist that had years with company with no notice or severance. Management continually had dissatisfied customers due to new strict return policies."
bad,"Worst place to work. They work you like a dog, don't appreciate you, give you as little pay as possible and overall treat you very badly."
bad,"Great place to work, you were on your own, doing your productivity at your pace, as long as you had your job done by the end of the day no one would bother you, it they would reopen I would go back to work for them."
bad,"managers and supervisors dont care about their employees, they literally use profanity, ive seen them throw boxes that werent labeled correctly and the person responsible. 35 cents per year raise are you kidding me they are on the makers of the major league baseball uniforms and other attire."
bad,"It was an ok place to work at at first, until they took away the yearly raises and replaced then with an incentive system. The incentive system is outrageous! They don't care what the quality of the prints look like, just get out as many as you can. That's the only way you can make incentive. They have the screen printing area spit in half. One side runs the company products the other side running specialty product. The company side gets jacked all the time unless you are one of their favorite printers, if not, you get treated poorly and really unfair. The specialty side actually makes the incentive and they do half the work the other side does. They can produce less shirts and make more compared to the other. The best part if they don't like you there, they put you in all the places that they think you will fail at or feel really uncomfortable and pretty much force you to quit or stay and be miserable."
bad,"I personally worked for Kipling, and the vf corporation is disgusting. The management team when dealing with issues off the sales floor is horrible. The equipment like ladders, brooms, cleaning supplies that they provided was dangerous. The ladders were on the verge of breaking, and after making countless complaints, nothing was fixed. I worked so hard to earn a promotion I really wanted, and it was given to someone to who did nothing within store. Needless to say, I left Kipling to go to another job & the person they hired instead of me was fired for doing a poor job. This corporation does not recognize hard work, and does not care about their employees. If ana associate worked for 8 and a half hours, you only received a half hour break. That is illegal.  DO NOT WORK HERE. They will work you to the bone. One of the girls I worked with, was working 40 hours a week, and when she applied to be ""Full time"", which was numerous times, the company faulted her of hours so they wouldn't have to give her benefits. That is ILLEGAL. DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,Been here for a year. Poor management. Only care about themselves and what makes them look good for the DM. Very low pay for what you have do and have  to put up with. They will build you up and tell you there are promotion opportunities but they will hire someone from the outside before they promote you.
bad,Management is unprofessional. They treat women awful and will pay men more. There is little to no staff so stores get ripped off and that affects your pay. Harassment and lots of drug use/talk. They will not appreciate you but will use you.
bad,was offered the job a maintenance technician t position signed the offer letter was given a date that I was going to start gave my current employer my two week notice was replaced by current employer and then VF called me and said that I wasn't going to start they were waiting on my background and then I received a letter saying that I did not get the job thank you VF I was then left without a job !
bad,"Really, was hired as an inside sales representative but ended up doing a lot of material sorting ....finally got into office.....not my forte....anyway that  was not a fit at all for me"
bad,Horrible management. The work and pay don't match. The enviornment is horrible and the core values are non existent.
bad,"Low pay. No air conditioning. No benefits. Rude management. Favoritism. Schedules that randomly change while you're off and no one bothers to tell you, so you end up being a no call no show. Drama was horrible. I could go on and on..."
bad,I worked very hard and did my absolute best but  I dreaded every day. I didn't get along with my managers and they made my job miserable.
bad,"This was the worst company I've ever worked for! The customers weren't first. There was more drama than work related issue going on in the store! If your looking for a company to grow in and learn with, this company won't give you any of that!!!!"
bad,"The best thing I got out of this job was dealing with the customers; which I love to do! Management had poor management skills down to their paperwork; which was often displayed for everyone's eyes - very little privacy. Co-workers were okay. This VF pushed selling their products, but gave you nothing in return (similiar to blood sucking leeches). The only thing to learn was how not to be as disorganized and unprofessional as this management team. Managers often talked one against another. Morale was horrible. All procedures were spoken; never written. If management is a hot mess; below normally follows. Best thing about this VF, It was nice to see the store come back - they do have great merchandise and prices."
bad,"I work at wrangler which is owned by VF. It used to be a decent place to work but since the new plant manager has taken over it is going down hill fast. They pay one shift OT to do work that another shift could do for straight time, raising cost. There is an abundance of favoritism. Different rules for different people. People with the same job make different pay. Lesser paid employees do more work. Good attendance and hard work goes unrewarded, especially when trying to get a new position."
bad,"Was fired for answering phone when on the floor due to check being messed up. Only they were looking to dump me because I was a good worker but did not like that they passed me up for another position that I was the best suited for. Should have known when the manager told me he wanted to keep me as the back up and train the new guy that i stood no chance. Yea thats right when i said i did not want to be the backup anymore they were looking for a reason to fire. Lame very lame. Should look at the individuals that are in the restrooms for hours a day, or the ones on their phones playing games in the S racks."
bad,This company is all about numbers your were never given 40hr a week more like 32.5hrs the management is so out  of touch with the day to day operations the language barrier is so bad being the the workforce is 98.9% Hispanic plus the start time was never the same from day to day
bad,"Scheduled to work 9.5 hours with a half hour lunch. Not any training, dirty environment. Company allowed a manager to give 6 months notice, and she then sat on her chair and played on her phone. No one above her noticed. "
bad,"I was very excited and positive about joining the team at VF in Branson,Mo. Unfortunately my excitement quickly faded when almost everything I was told when hired was completely untrue. Started with what they call orientation which consisted of going through a huge stack of paperwork and signing each paper as fast as possible with absolutely no explanations. The training process lasted about five minutes and then was expected to run cash register, register customers for VIP, dressing rooms, restock, etc... I absolutely love working with people but felt frustrated and embarrassed when a customer came to me with questions I could not answer due to the lack of training and could never find another assosiate or manager that weren't to busy to assist the customer or at least point me in the right direction. The veteran employees were very rude and unfriendly to new associates. This behavior upset me and made me feel uncomfortable and bad for my fellow new associates. The managers loved to spend time eating, gossiping, and complaining rather than being out on the floor making sure the customers walked out satisfied. They loved to use their position / title to make others feel inferior. My hours were never consistant with what I was told when hired, breaks weren't given at accurate times, for example if you worked a 6 or 8 hour shift the new people wouldn't receive a break until an hour before our shift was over. The current associates were constantly complaining about how unhappy they were. That kind of an attitude is like a virus in the workplace so as a result several people quit"
bad,If you smoke cigarettes it’s not the job for you . All employees must walk to the parking lot to smoke a cigarette unless you are a manager . If your a manager you get a key to the back door and can smoke a cigarette when ever you feel like it . The women’s bathroom is public with one toilet every time you use the bathroom it’s smells awful and you will run into feces and urine on the toilet the changing rooms are Close to the bathrooms so the unpleasant smell will seep into the changing room area. I said something to management but the issue was never resolved. Not enough diversity working at the vf outlet not one male works there .
bad,"I worked in large companies,but this is the worst managed company that i ever worked for.management does not listen to workers,big concern about safety issues not addressed,lot of favouritism and supervisors bully workers.management lies to workers.would not recommend this company to work for,"
bad,I am still a Lead and they not only cut hours of associates but mine as well. they are randomly taking peoples jobs and literally tripled my work load. As a Lead I already get paid a garbage salary but they don't care about any of the actual employees. they keep cutting corners to put money in the supervisors and managers pockets. while the hourly workers suffer. even this week there are more people being cut from their SECURE positions.
bad,"The company I interviewed with is not the company I went to work for. "
bad,"Temps get treated like they are nothing, when it comes to doing a survey. Each department put theirs in their supervisors folder when it came to the temps. Ours was put in a temp folder"
bad,"no support which was promised at interview "
bad,"Always getting switched off of your job to go to picking area, which drops your production all take way down. Also, a lot of favoritism. Pay would be good but instead of averaging production rate, they have a computer timing you, including breaks and bathroom. I left because my pay dropped $200 or more when they brought production machines in. You work like a dog for little pay."
bad,"Wasted 5 years of my life with this company, then they hire a manager right off the street who had no respect for anyone, and treated everyone like badly. I was a supervisor and she would have all of us do her job while she would sit in her office and eat or walk around and shop with her teenage daughter. If ur looking for a good job this is not it I would never recommend anyone to work here, it's honestly a drama filled place where upper management play favoritism and the pay is terrible. WORST MANAGERS EVER!! Avoid this place."
bad,"The company is great! store manager is terrible .... They violate state policies here(OSHA) and don't treat employees fairly ....prioritizing, scheduling and heartshare are definitely problems at this store.. I will never work at this store as long as the current store manager is here and I would advise anyone who is looking for employment the same"
bad,"It was a good place for an 8 hour workout, this place makes the high volume of employee turn around work for them, with really no intention to make a temporary employee permanent. I would meet their quotes and more, I was rewarded with being fired, claiming I was only temporary,"
bad,"Manager is very stereotypical, they claim to uphold equal rights and equality in the workplace but yet every other person speaks a different language, even though the rules state ""only english within the workplace"" very intimidating atmosphere."
bad,Horrible place to work. No option to advance within company. Everyone makes the same pay regardless of job. Some employees stick labels all day and make the same pay as employees unloading 40lb boxes all day.
bad,Fun place to work but management doesnt care that you have a life outside of work it's all about them. Also you pay is low for a company this size. Not worth the job especially since I have to drive 20 minutes to work there.
bad,"If you applying for maintenance dont waste your time. Compensation is minimal, production workers make more than you would. Management does not help. Company is unorganized, we always run out of common parts we need on the floor, so we have to fabricate or make something work. No communication between shifts. We do come together to talk about issues that could be fixed called SOSD meetings. When we bring up things like pay differential, new start times to management they get shrugged off, it's been over a year and still no word about it."
bad,"A typical day at VF outlet consists of a multitude of tasks in so little time. You must be motivated and ready to work. I've learned that if you contribute together as a team, more work can get done. Management taught me most of the things I know. My co-workers are the ones who get me through the day. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with so many requests at once. The most enjoyable part of working at VF is that a family is constantly being made."
bad,"New comers aren’t accepted easily. You will feel shut out and alone. "
bad,"A typical day at vf is going in and dreading the whole time your there. You will like it for the first month or so, but after that its a drag. The management is very poor & the head manager is the worst! She is not only rude & inconsiderate to the employees but as well as the customers! Once I remember a younger couple coming to me complaining how an employee had rudely not price checked an item but told them it was the same as the others and then acted too good to help them any further. It wasn't a normal employee it was the manager! When first starting working there they didn't explain things as effective as they should. which caused ciaos all the time. The scheduling is very unorganized some days you will work mornings, next an evening, and next you'll work in the middle of the day. Not to mention the job is part time & some weeks you'll be scheduled for 25 hours and the next it'll be 10! The best part of it all was my coworkers and the discount (20%) which isn't a lot either. Not to mention if your looking for a decent paying job VF is NOT the way to go! Minimum wage is ridiculous for all the stuff you have to put up with there. Biggest waist of my time!"
bad,not good manager staff not enough hours but overall a job well paying job
bad,"PRO:"
bad,"Great company but I was unlucky.I had a frustrated manager who treats the staff as slaves changing their schedule every day without announcing,because he couldn’t manage to do it properly.In times of high trade it was shaky and was not a support for the team. Never assume mistakes , blaming others,and he was not open to new opinions believing that he was doing everything perfectly.I didn’t had support from manager and supervisor, both was really fake people .Really a bad experience"
bad,"This is probably the worst place I've ever worked for. The management is the worst, they act like children and talk to you as if your trash. They treat you terribly and they always play favorites. They have alot of rules that only apply to certain people it seems like. If ur a minute late you get a tardy like your in high school and if u get nine of those a year you get fired. Most the employees are very rude and disrespectful as the management. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"Training was so laid back and not organized, by the time you get to do your job, you still are left clueless, and don't have the answers or the skills to do your job. Training for a week was not training, it was a lot of breaks, and games that had nothing to do with the job you were hired for. Most of the employees and management are  not friendly, and if you asked for help well you'll be waiting about 15-20 minutes before they'll answer you, while the customer is on hold, which in turn makes for bad customer service. Co-worker's were no better, they never offered to help when asked. Also, CSR are basically made to lie to customers simply because management can't follow thru with their end. SAD."
bad,"I absolutely loved working here but then i randomly was fired due to “claims that i was taking snapchats of customer chats” and they had no proof of this matter, i was fired the next day with no warning. If i would have had the money for a lawyer i would have sued for wrongful termination. I did enjoy this company but they really need to quit playing favorites and realize it is work not highschool"
bad,Management tends to promote those who are in the exclusive social circle and not those who have the qualities that would best serve the position being filled.
bad,"I work at the outlet mall on I drive in Orlando as a sales associate, and this job SUCKS!!! It is crazy all day nothing you do is ever good enough.  Low pay over worked, and unappreciated not a great place to work.  You get little breaks.  The only advantage to working here is the discount otherwise stay away."
bad,"at the beginning it was a great places to work values were high culture was what we lived by company grew to fast lost the valves... thats why we has at 400 stores worldwide now there is less 100 open resturants . but i would love to wo9rk for a company like again...trainers worked "
bad,this was the worst job i've ever had. dont work here. the management was so completely horrible. i would finish my work and the supervisors were supposed to get me more stuff to do and they wouldnt because they were too lazy to do their job. they would work me MINUTES under full time just so that they wouldn't have to pay me for it. do. not. work. here.
bad,Heard it was going down hill fast so I wouldn’t recommend getting a job there. It has been 6 years since I retired and the last report that I got from friends that still work there says it is bad. When I worked there it was a decent place to work.
bad,"We are constantly having to deal with freight enough for 4 stores and not enough sales for 1. The results is a warehouse with more merchandise than the sales floor. Replenishment isn't based on sales, it is based on the need to force merchandise out of warehouse before inventory. Upper level management doesn't care about employees either. It's all about making money and attracting low income customers with wow deals that have the quality of rummage sales. Benefits are non existent and the insurance has such high deductibles that the average employee payes 80-99% out of pocket."
bad,Management was unnecessarily rude and unhelpful. the job requirements sucked. pay sucked. threatened by our job at all times.
bad,"Good place to gain lots of experience, but tough for people expecting performance based growth/reward. I worked at least 50 hours per week and got top reviews but my bonus and raises were same as everyone else."
bad,A lot of women talk about each other all day long and people fight. You have to be in a click. They said they opened a new place for more people but I don’t see a lot of
bad,"Managers are promoted because of who they know, discounts were cool, hours were fine, and pay was meh. HR is garbage and shady, if you're into that sort of thing you'll love this job!"
bad,"This job, I thought, would be great at first but was by far the most boring job I've ever had in my working career. Retail was not my area of working."
bad,"  Pay sucks. Management doesn't appreciate anybody that works on the production floor. They put on a pretty good act though, they try so hard to act out there caring about our associates bit....lol. There's an open door policy yet whenever you ask a question you get an excuse or the run around.  There's no room for growth. You come in as a temp and if you do end up getting hired you still get treated like one. Jobs are handed out to brown nosers, or they out source and bring people in who end up having to be trained by some one already working there.  As far as supervisors, most of them can just on the band wagon that management came on......some of the good ones that actually cared about their workers eventually look for work else where.  And the leads are a bunch of worthless human beings who act like their bigshots running the place.(Your just warehouse workers....lol)  Many miserable work days. Had I known, I'd never would of left my previous employer to work there.  "
bad,"production work, rules not enforced, too much faviortism."
bad,"There is no life/work balance as a manager at VF. 50+hour work weeks all year long leaves no time for family and you are expected to work even if you are ill. The manager in Lancaster likes to terminate people and does not believe in coaching and development. The staff is told if they call in sick, they will be replaced."
bad,"Management lacked consistency in hours, effectiveness of work rules, and did not care about employees lives outside of work. Would not go back to work there. Pay was not fair for the amount of work that I would do."
bad,"- If you don't click with the right people you are just a number"
bad,"VF Corporation is a great company, however the Division I worked in was not managed well and most employees were unhappy. When I accepted the job offer, I was promised tools to do my job, but never received them"
bad,"Very hot and uncomfortable working conditions. Very poor management, unwilling to compromise and work with employees needs. Favoritism is very big with this company."
bad,This job taught me a good leason. Sometimes it's not you as the employee that is bad but the management can also be wrong. Sometimes it's just the wrong fit. Bit when the boss repeatedly tells you that you suck at your job and that's he's going to fire you as an example (at least 3 times a day) you just leave. Change of management was a bad decision for the company. However for some reason they don't care. But when the boss gives you the worst review you've ever had from any person in the company (before this person was there everybody always said i did great and was improving steadily). This manager said a blind monkey could do my job better than i. Pay increases came in the form of a few cents. Benifits sucked and insurance covered nothing. The best thing was that they matched your 401k contributions. Very little room for growth within the company very little support. They make life very stressful in and outside of work. So maybe this was just porr management or I wasn't the right fit but it definitely ruined my opinion of the whole company when my concerns and complaints went ignored.
bad,"Overall atmosphere isn't pleasant, there is an undercurrent of toxicity and poor management. Senior members of management have shown distasteful displays of leadership and judgement."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. Excellent location. Fun work place but no supportive management.
bad,"It'a an okay place to work if you're just starting out.  If you can get in the right department with a good boss you'll learn a lot. Sadly, the good bosses are few and far between in recent years. Recommend avoiding half of Accounting, almost all of Customer Service, and definitely avoid Credit.  "
bad,"About one of the most distasteful jobs that demands the most yet pays you the least. As Cashier, you do warehouse, construct fixtures, clean warehouse, Move heavy equipment that are NOT included in the job description. Only fun part was selling products."
bad,"Working on 2nd shift, the company does not give you time to support local non-profits. We have to use vacation to attend functions for kids, and sport activities."
bad,The main problem was management. It depends on what mood they were in how you were treated that day. Raises wer hard to come by because they were yearly usually seemed no matter how hard you worked it wasn't enough not enough thanks. I always felt like I was being graded and treated like a child
bad,"The Saint-Laurent office space is beautiful and a great work environment. Although it can be noisy and difficult to remain focused in. However, expectations and workload are extremely (unrealistically) high. Work/Life balance is a real challenge for most associates at this organization. Think more work, no life..."
bad,"Good place to learn and start career, don't expect to make a career there."
bad,"VF is everything you would/should expect from a large company.  On certain levels it is a very successful company.  However, on other levels it can be very frustrating & political."
bad,"I worked for VF for 3 years. Starting out there with no work experience was great because they do openly accept high schoolers looking for their first job. The only good thing I can say about this job is that I made life long friends with my coworkers. As for the managers, that's a whole other story. You could work all night long making sure the store was perfect and you would never hear a thank you. They would make sure they found something wrong with what you've done. I learned a lot while working for VF but the most important thing I learned was how to stand up for myself and realize I deserved better than to work for a company who shows no appreciation, only gives hours to the favorites, and has more drama than your average middle school. You do not get paid near enough to put up with what you are faced with on a day to day basis. I got one raise the whole 3 years I was there not to mention there is absolutely no opportunity to move up in the company. No one should ever have to sit out in their car and dread walking inside because you know nothing good is going to happen that day. My advice is to find another company to work for because VF has a lot of growing up to do."
bad,"A typical day at VF is where you do pretty much the same thing day by day. Its rare when you do something new there when your set in your department. I learned that at VF its a good job until hours come in. Sometimes of the month we get a lot of work in and work 10 hr days and sometimes in the month we can get called off for 2 whole weeks/weekends. It depends what your labeled as in VF to get more hours. Like for me im a packer where i pack items in there cases and send them off on a conveyer belt to where they get sent to different departments so they can check them to see if there correct."
bad,I enjoyed the other workers. We all worked together! We all did our job and that helped everyone. The hours were doable for a parttime position.
bad,Management diminished in the last couple of years. However the general employees are great to be around and made it worth it. Benefits are decent and the pay reasonable.
bad,"warehouse job Forklift Operator job summary. Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities."
bad,people and management were great. the job itself was robotic and extremely taxing and boring. bit of a commute out to  VF if you dont live near there.
bad,"good pay, great benefits but, poor management and advancement opportunities. No clear direction from management. Life work balance  is not considered."
bad,I worked there for one year and a half. I liked it at first but slowly started hating it. The management only cared about themselves. The management always talked about other employees. The pay was not worth all the work you had to do. The only good thing was my co workers and benefits. Would definitely NOT recommend anyone to work there!
bad,"I drove a forklift,pulled orders, loaded and unloaded trucks."
bad,"I learned how to attend a fitting room and how to be patient with people. My co-workers were fun and also worked very hard as well, and we all got along. The management was okay, it was hard to speak with them if you needed help. The hardest part of the job was pushing the large vacuum at the end of the day seeing as though i was 8 months pregnant."
bad,"Great pay and some perks, but it is retail, no holidays or weekends off ever. You do what is best for the business not your life. I feel I had poor leadership. from someone spread too thin and with other priorities than me."
bad,Just too much stress. Different rules for different people depending on your managers mood. Too much backstabbing and discrimination and malicious gossiping to make for a positive work environment
bad,The company's retail stores are an afterthought. Management above store level is political and often vindictive or incompetent. The retail division is poorly run. There is little to no job security.
bad,They changed the policy where we would need to use either our sick time or vacation for our overtime day. That really made me mad.....................
bad,"Work here is easy and occupying so you have something to do and aren’t bored. The management is great all supervisors are well educated on their job and very easy to talk to and very professional. They are never mean or disrespectful to you if you’re doing your tasks that are assigned to you. You can expect to be sent home before or at lunch because apparently they sometimes “don’t have work”. You can also expect to be called off work from anywhere between 1-5 days at a time. I’ve went to work at 9:30 p.m. and got sent home at 11:30 p.m. but most commonly I go to work expecting it to be 9:30 p.m. to 6 a.m. but most of the time it’s 9:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. and mostly 3 days a week. They call off work a lot and pay you every Friday. But I get paid minimum wage which turns to usually $100-$170 a week. It was $300 a week the first 2 weeks there cause I was working full-time every day, but after those 2 weeks I haven’t got a week with 5 days of work, 8 hours a day all in the same week."
bad,The part of business I worked in is closing. I can't rate the part that is staying open. I don't have the information needed to rate it. Was a different division
bad,"My current supervisor is terrible, wants everyone to work hard to accomplish the goals set forth for the day but yet he him self sits at his desk all day playing on his phone. He won't lift a finger to help out with any kind of production and is not and will not get certified and any piece of equipment to help us out."
bad,Training is 10 weeks and you only have 8 hrs to use for 10 weeks no matter what happens the training manager is not flexible Or understanding. They don’t give you options to not use your time they use it no matter what situation your in. They don’t care about their own customers and the management is TERRIBLE!!
bad,There's a lot of heavy lifting required and you must meet a daily quota. Starting out at minimum wage isn't worth slaving away at heavy and monotonous work.
bad,"Thoroughly enjoyed the first couple of months working for VF Northern Europe. As the time went on however it was obvious there was a bias within management and team leaders were free to make credit controllers' lives nightmarish if they so pleased. Petty arguments, fruitless phone calls and constant reminders of actions that could be taken if progress did not improve (regardless of being proven that progress was made numerous times)  by management resulted in a very unenjoyable experience. In the end dismissal came out of nowhere with multiple colleagues disappointed in the decision made by the team leader but too apprehensive to voice their opinion in case they were the next to stand out from the crowd. Overall, it was s great experience until the last  month where it was obvious dismissal was eminent based on managements bias towards bland employees."
bad,"I enjoyed working at VF Outlet, a subsidiary of VF Corporation for most of the past 27 years.  As retail changed, especially over the past five years or so, changes needed to be made with VFO's retail stores.  However, the changes seemed to change week to week, and it was difficult to know in which direction the company was headed.  Unfortunately, earlier this year, the corporation decided to downsize across all its companies and retail stores, and many people lost their jobs.  I would not recommend seeking employment at VF to friends right now, because there is no job security there at the current time."
bad,"I have been working at this store for 4 years. I learned a lot about proper customer service and understanding the wants and needs of customers. Great first job for high school students and very flexible schedule for college students. "
bad,this job is not providing hours very minimum wage hires many price doesn't provide hours it's more like a seasonal job not a full time job......... ....
bad,low pay for the amount of work that was expected.  It is a dying location only 2 store remain in mall need to go to a different location.
bad,We had a great management team.  We were able to bonus on each goal.  Freight and training.  Paperwork.  Hardest part of the job was letting go of the job.
bad,"Went into the job with a low ball wage. People were cool, corporate expects a lot but doesn't give you tools or training to succeed. Just okay good discount"
good,"Unless you’re part of the good ole boys club, management doesn’t care about you at all. The politics is terrible and the attitude of management is you don’t matter."
good,Very big store to keep clean. management was a little bit poor.
good,The company could be better if they were more informative about working long hours.  The mandatory overtime is out of the norm.  You have to work mandatory sundays too.  They really don't care about your family/worklife balance.
good,the co-workers where nice. Management was OK and demanding at times. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers
good,"kontinuierliches lernen mit ständig neuen Tools."
good,"Not ideal if you have small children. "
good,"Not too many positive things to say about working for Vans VF. Unprofessional work environment, Store manager would fraternize with associates, saw my DM one within a 8 month period. Didnt learn much except how to be a full-time sales associate. Benefits could be better, advancement based on who brown nosed best. Hardest part, learning how to stop delegating from how many hours we didnt get. Enjoyable part, quitting."
good,"The job pays less than the minimum wage, so you get paid only about £7.(x) phr. You will need to enslave yourself to earn only a low amount in monthly paid wages. The working hours can be long and you are expected to oversell your energy to every customer for 8 hours. Management pressure you to meet a certain amount of money for the store every single hour you have to sell a certain amount of shoes even with no customers. You will find managers are overbearing and ‘pushy’ for you to sell shoe protectors and socks to customers who are not even interested in the first place. You will have to force every single customer to complete survey about your service before they leave the store. This is difficult as 90% of their customers are foreign tourists who do not understand what you are asking of them in English. Mangers are generally patronising and domineering. Not much ‘fun’ to work with apart from the store manager who had good people skills. He’s the only English... You have to endure using communal in ear radios that do not get cleaned and are just so loud and annoying to deal with for 8 hours on shift. "
good,"•I learned many skills which I can use in other job opportunities."
good,I've been at the job for awhile now and I have the skills but was not advancing. I don't get enough hours or pay and the company doesn't give part time employees any benefits anymore.
good,"40 hrs terrible job too many systems to learnt no advancement, company only cares about money, management terrible, you get 50% off all products too be honest it not worth it unless you already like the brands"
good,"La delusione nel dover lasciare un azienda, una famiglia ed una casa a causa di persone poco competenti che non hanno rispetto per i loro collaboratori,"
good,"Ever changing company and culture - would recommend working for the organization.  I liked the following:"
good,Dont have a secure feeling about the future. Enjoy the work and the my immediate team members. My area is fast pace and we are finding ways to collaborate to make better processes.
good,"I would have enjoyed working here if there were more staff, if they offered more hours, and they made the pay worth it. There were even times when only 1 manager and 1 employee were working."
good,not a bad place to work.  Coalition management is very weak.  No strategic plans for the future.  Struggle to get the management team on the same page.  Pays well for outside people.
good,"A typical day of work depends on what dept you're in, in shipping mostly you will be on the lines all day, but if they need you somewhere else they will move you around. Mostly gonna be walking all day picking up boxes and taking them to their locations and pulling out pallets and what not. I learned plenty of things as this was my first warehouse job. Management doesn't seem to be that good, the leads and supervisors don't really do much but sit around or stare at u while u work, occasionally they walk around and find ways to get people in trouble. Their really isn't a hard part of the job, once they train you its a pretty easy job, sometimes it can actually be chill if its slow, but expect to be sore when you first start out as your feet and body isnt used to walking all day and carrying boxes. As for the most enjoyable part of the job well that's when your on lunch when you can finally just chill and eat, and when you're finally off work."
good,Ok to work for even though it was hot in warehouse some of the management are nice and your able to talk to they need more air in the warehouse and better  Opportunity  to move up in the company
good,"Ideas, new concepts, and subjections are not welcome even though the subjections could save time and money to the process. The blood, sweat and tears employees give are not sincerely appreciated."
good,Manager was turned in several times for her abuse of assistant managers and nothing was done. Called corporate several times along with several co workers and were promised action none ever taken we all quit.
good,"The company is focused on their bottom line and don't consider their people as a large, public company should. Their PR is good, but what they practice is no so good."
good,"loved my job , management wasn't good, enjoyed my coworkers, the hours were not bad, did not care for the short notice on call ins, did learn alot as far as retail sales"
good,"Long days and not much time off. policies would change and no notification of that change would be given . management was reckless and rude, and had their favorites. if you were not liked by the management that employee would be picked apart and a reason found to terminate them."
good,"VF pays very well and is a great, large Fortune 250 company.  However the work / life balance is very poor."
good,"Buen eneficio,seguro medico,pero el ambiente no es acogedor,no aire acondicionado,hay mucho favoritismo y el salario es pesimo vinculado a la produccion que te obliga a reventarte para ver algo de dinero."
good,"typical day at work consists of normal retail tasks, customer service, cashiering, making sure clothing is stocked. you only afre able to learn what they want you too. there isnt any room for advancement. i tried going after an assistant manager position and management was too scared to approach the district manager about advancement and would let me contact her to express my intrest myself. there isnt a hard part of the job. most enjoyable part was working with customers."
good,"Not a happy environment and one of the best benefits when I started work (cafeteria) was eliminated. Some of the co-workers were great, but others were snobbish."
good,"Great work experience. Not a place you get hired at right away. A lot of temp jobs open up but that's all you are. A lot of upper management puts the blame on the lower employees, Not a lot of communication between everyone."
good,"come in receive trucks put boxes up so many a hour. How to receive trucks, pull orders and ship orders out. Management is very concern about employees. Able to get along with all my co-workers and they respect me. Nothing hard about job. Taking break and talking to friends then."
good,"customer service in a call center must have knowledge of all brands. Every day I learned something new, and the company is great for training and being able to advance in training. Great benefits. In the fourteen years I worked there had 5 managers and many different supervisors. So it was not always fairness and people get promoted because of friendship over qualification."
good,Not much opportunity for advancement and low pay .  Poor treatment of workers from my experience . Although I had a better experience at vf outlet than vans
good,The company itself has tons of rules and regulations... But when the manager can hire friends and family... And they get to do whatever they want it causes low moral. There are no checks and balances for proper training or how issues are handled. Lots of kids work there with no work ethic whatsoever. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
good,Management could have been better. It was a faced paced work environment that barely offered room for advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job was working under supervisors who cared about employees.
good,"VF is a multi brand company deals with apparels, which got strong financials, They have very strong brands like Timberland Lee Wrangler TNF VANS etc..."
good,"Empresa da mais valor ao pessoal de cada um que o profissional, e isso acaba misturando as coisas na hora de trabalhar"
good,"it was alright working there we all had our good and bad days. "
good,"A fun place to work for a first job with great management and coworkers, but with few benefits and little drive to overachieve in the work place. With limited rewards for good performance."
good,"As still an active employee memeber of VF, environment there is very uncomfortable, most assistant manager are very rude, favoritism is definitely a high factor here, hours suck, employees are rude to other employees. And no benefits what’s so ever for part timers, we don’t leave on time when scheduled to leave."
good,"Terrible workplace. Does not take pride in workers. Felt like high school, with all the drama. The picking supervisor has her favorites. They hire felons. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
good,"It was a great time for me to learn and develop, but salary wise and culture wise there were some gaps and things missing. I hope things have changed meantime."
good,"I really enjoyed my time there, however management wasn't the best nor the friendliest. the drama was pretty overwhelming at times. I really enjoyed the printing aspect of the company"
good,"It was okay except changing rules when it didn't suit certain people. To much turn over, to many layoffs, business slowed way down because of a lost contract."
good,"Your whole life is about VF. Typical corporate culture,one hand does not know what the other is doing. Great place to learn the basics and move on.The store culture is fun and people get along good."
good,I merchandised clothing in departments.  I balanced the vault. Set up the registers.  Opened and Closed the stored. Resolved customer issues.  I was Manager On Duty for several periods of times while short of management.  I learned additional Management skills.  Management was good about working with employees schedules. There were many excellent co-works.  Some would come in on their days off to help out.  The hardest part of my job was Freight Days.  The most enjoyable part was helping customers and up selling / cross selling.
good,"Good environment with a nice campus but there's no personal growth and little employee recognition, salaries are far below bay area standards."
good,"Great company to start your career out with.You will learn a lot in a short amount of time, however, no room for growth from within."
good,The hardest part of this job was working the nights and weekends.  The schedule was a 12 hour rotating shift and made a personal life difficult.  The supervisor did know your name and would acknowledge birthdays and had a certain amount of personal involvement rather than a simple employee versus employer relationship.
good,"PROS"
good,It's a great place to work if you like to work on task alone.  Most of the task I was given was for prior shifts but I was expected to do the work all in all it wasn't the best company.
good,"Great place to work"
good,The overall atmosphere has become very stressful with expectations to meet and exceed monthly goals that can be impossible to meet.  Need more realistic goals that won't affect workplace atmosphere.
good,"J'ai pu travailler pour VF en Angleterre, plus précisemment à Nottingham au service client."
good,"I went into Vans thinking it was going to be a good place for a young adult to work at. I ended up having to deal with minimal hours due to low payroll, an inept manager, and lots of drama between management and associates alike."
good,"Stressful"
good,"Learned basic on Logistics and Supply Chain structure. "
good,"Management needs a great deal of work. Overall the company is very top heavy with many VPs, and only a few people doing the work. High turn over, and many unhappy employees looking to leave."
good,"A typical day consisted of answering phone calls pertaining to customer orders, complaints, and  warranty issues.  I've learned to maintain a bubbly attitude no matter the situation, and make the customers happy.  Management is pretty decent but there wasn't a lot of advancement opportunities."
good,Love doing this type of work. Great pay. Almost no communication with management.
good,Management changes were constant and not always related to ability.
good,"I love working here, only wish the company had full time hours for employees to work."
good,"If you need a job quickly, don't mind mindlessly folding and sorting through clothes for hours and days at a time, and re-arranging the same thing you just organized yesterday all over again, and listening to your management butt heads and step on eachothers toes killing potential productivity, and organazation, and leading to you doing more labor at the end of the day, this is the place for you. It is a middle of the road decent part time job, they will NOT give you full time hours. They will also probably cut you at the end of the season if you are a seasonal associate, regardless of performance and telling you that they will keep you around, and that the hours are just going to drop back."
good,"I enjoyed my time with VF Outlet.  My position was only part time, so no benefits were offered.  I was given the opportunity for advancement, and learned many usefull skills that I can use in the future."
good,I felt I could contribute more to the VF Outlet.  They didn't have a lot of areas to advance.  Parking lot was dark on the winter  Customer Service is always top priority.  There are certain managers that always made sure we got breaks in a timely manner
good,Disfunctional Company ! Incompetent woman running it. Other than that it is easy work. Just stand there and get paid $30 hr. DM never comes to your store so you can basically do whatever you want.
good,The energy in coming in fluctuates depending on the time of day. A lot of pressure is targeted depending on the employee and communication isn't consistant. Flexibility is usually an issue that comes with lack of understanding fellow peers.
good,"Responsibilities"
good,VF Corporation is a great place to work. The company has great Co-workers and is a fun environment to be apart of. They have many company wide events.
good,Fantastic down to earth associates that are a pleasure to work with.   Great work environment.  Corporate office modernization is in on the roadmap.
good,"Its kind of boring on weekdays because if there isn't any shipment in then you just have to help the few customers that come through and continually straighten the store (even if everything is perfect, you still have to continue to do something). The coworkers I had were all very nice and helpful. it was great working with them. however, management was absolutely terrible.  If you did one thing wrong, you could not make anymore mistakes or else you'd get a strike against you. There was one assistant manager that was very much liked and she treated everyone like a person, she was definitely a leader that most looked up to. However the manager and other assistant manager were passive aggressive and liked to gossip about coworkers to other coworkers."
good,"VF is a good company to work for, unfortunately the brand where I work for is not big enough to give you chances for future career."
good,"Daily busy work environment, good customers and plenty of work to do. Product is for everyone and I Love the store. Worked their before part-time and the quality of merchandise is better now."
good,Piece rate pay. Very competitive free-for-all. Easy and fast paced.
good,"Hard work but rewarding, not in compensation but if you have a passion for merchandising you will love this job. Pay stinks for management, based on the scale of inventory managed. But if you manage to get a good location i can imagine you enjoying this job, stay away from Waterloo, NY!"
good,"It was very fun to work there, but it was very stressful. The people are entertaining but working there was not for me. I think it's just the retail aspect, but that is just me!"
good,Fun working for vf you have to work hard to get hired. The most horrible thing at vf is when it's summer time the heat in that warehouse is bad you need to be able to work in extremely high heat. Other then that it a good place to work.
good,I liked it alot  would recomend it. it wasnt bad at all. I had to leave. Because i got a higher paying job. The hardest part was getting there i didnt have a car at the time.
good,"It is a mission-driven company.  Led by outdoor enthusiast CEO, the company is committed to making changes locally and globally.  VFC is in the middle of corporate culture adjustment.  The recent move in Denver will allow the company to concentrate on all outdoor brands."
good,The best part of VF Corp is the discounts you are entitled to their brands.  The company is a good place to learn and has a green initiative.  Company is currently undergoing a lot of changes.
good,loading by hand  and pallet jack boxes of jeans  from distrubution center  work ed 12 hr days  4 to 6 days week  was on pm shift from 7 to 7 very good supervisors
good,"The VF is an ok job to go to if it's your very first job in high school or you're a college student living at home. The store manager is very nice and they actually work on the floor along with the other workers. Last holiday season was very busy, but it made time go by fast. You're bound to make a good friend or two here because everyone works together."
good,Good employer and good management teams.  VF always had events for employees every month for the employees to touch base with what was going on in their area.  It was always fun & relaxing.
good,my time at vf was good and learned a lot . I worked qa auditor 2nd shift everything was well maintained when I first started. when they promoted a new lead everything started to get sloppy work was not getting done she had favorites and would allow them to talk when others had to work people were getting fired for no reason because they weren't liked from a certain someone I liked vf just needs to be looked into as far as leads ect.
good,"Great job for the first time working but anything other then that nothing great. Everyday it was very slow and not much to do. So it gets quite boring but when things pick up, it's alot!"
good,It was a decent place to work and pay was good but there is a lot of drama with other workers and the bosses. You stand on your feet the whole time and have to go up and down stairs a lot which is hard for some people. You only get so many hours a year to call in sick and if you run out you don't call in or you get fired. a lot of pettiness and such within the management team.
good,Everyday was something different. I learned to fold clothing properly and pack clothing in boxes to be shipped to distribution. Overall the job was enjoyable. The environment safety was maintained and staff was respectful.
good,"It is definitely not a difficult job, but the company itself is very wealthy, and the sales associates are paid minimum wage, which I believe is unfair."
good,Good Benefits. Old way of thinking. No free time. Working 6 days a week and working 55= hours was normal. hard to get much vacation because you are so tired. This job IS your life. and favoritism runs the warehouse
good,"Company provides decent pay. Wholesale customer service side of business is best place to work at. Ecommerce is draining and has high turnover. You are expected to be a ""yes-man"" and not question decisions."
good,"VF Internationatinal è una multinazionale leader  a livello mondiale nel settore Apparel/Footwear. é un ambiente molto internazionale dove culture e diversi modi di pensare si incontrano; è un ambiente in continua evoluzione dove si impara a fare fronte a diverse sfide e cambiamenti,  ma dove si ha anche l'opportunità di svillupare nuovi skills o migliorare quelli esistenti grazie a un programma di training interno."
good,Worked 38 years in various roles - ending with Insurance Benefits specialist - learned many skills - enjoyed working with employees and being a service to them
good,"I thought Vf corporation would be a place I could have a career at but unfortunately it was not because of the stressful environment, long hours that were not expected because management told me otherwise, and lack of fair management. The benefits are great and almost worth the trouble if you need benefits for your family."
good,It's a good place to work. But they don't offer full time that much and they have some good workers that leave cause they don't get offered full time. Some temps worker harder then the full time
good,"enjoyed doing payroll and learning new programs"
good,Tons to do to keep busy along with tedious work. Giving and getting satisfaction to and from customers is nice. I learned that nothing is a problem when you know what needs to get done.
good,"Everyday was different there was days that you wouldn't have to much work and others that had a lot of work. You learn to be a team player. Management was helpful. The hardest part of the job is when you are short staffed, and the most enjoyable was the people you work with."
good,"I fell into this position when the store manager went out on maternity leave for several months. Aside from the district manager ignoring every concern I had, because I wasn't ""a real store manager"",  this was the most fun I have had at VANS."
good,"Each morning you would flip bundles, cut tickets, and write numbers, then proceed to sew on pockets as fast as you could. Sometimes work didn't fit, or material so stiff it would not go through the folder. "
good,"Se aprende mucho en el día a día como tratar con las personas, Y a trabajar en equipo, Se hace difícil lidiar con la presión que ejercen los objetivos laborales.(atención al cliente, control de mercadería, presencia, puntualidad, números , ganancias etc.) Pero no es imposible. Es un trabajo muy bueno."
good,I enjoyed my stay at VF outlets and I had even been complimented on my work on multiple occasions. Which is nice to be recognized when I'm doing something well.
good,"worked my way up part time to store manager, restructure of company, cut backs made for difficult choices.  Worked harder, worked more hours but nothing was good enough.  All four management had over 15 years of experience but meant nothing when a new sheriff came to town."
good,"You get great experience in certain roles, but there are limited advancement opportunities.  There is lots of travel usually expected with this role."
good,"I learned the intricate functions of the BMC Remedy system. I had some conflicts with the Asset Manager but through meetings and regular dialog, we were able to effectively implement the Remedy system on time."
good,"VF Northern Europe are a clothing company which own a variety of different major brands including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Eastpak."
good,"I used to help the team leaders stock the floor with merchandise and work the customer service desk, answering phone calls, ringing customers up, and processing return transactions."
good,"I learned that its important to keep up with production and quality is very important for customers. the management is well organized and helpful with advise, and safety is an important key to the company and workers. My co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part is having to work fast to keep up with the conveyor and the most enjoyable part is meeting new people and learning new experiences."
good,"I was responsible for all company shipments and was always very busy. Being busy was my favorite part. The hardest part of the job was management, they always expected you to know about changes without them telling you."
good,Everyone was young and very friendly.  I learned a lot being in allocations in turn got me into the planning world.
good,A typical day at work consist of processing freight on truck days. Replenishing the floor from the freight we received from the truck. Constant interaction with customers face to face as well as talking on the phone with customers. I learned that your attitude really effect your customer service ability. The management team was very laid back and understanding. The co workers were ok. I did not find any hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with different people from other countries. 
good,"•	Established and identified the VF Outlet and VF Outlet Center social media strategy to maximize and extend the Brands’ reach across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other retail sites and emerging media."
good,A typical day of work was productive and busy. Selling merchandise and explain the means of it. Greeting customers and helping them to find their needs. I learned how to have great communication and customer service skills. Management was great and very helpful. My co-workers were very friendly and worked as a team. I didn't have no experience with any hard part at this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and working with my co-workers as a team and going there to work with appositive attitude.
good,Growing company with poor diversity and no confidentiality. Although I was part of a great customer service team we were led by poor management.
good,I got certfied through them with my forklift license. I had worked with manpower with this company. But big laidoffs there.
good,Go to work 10-12 hours a day... 5-7 days a week with every other weekend off.
good,VF has a quite laid back working atmosphere where leaders are reluctant to new adaptation such as data science driven culture or KPI driven culture. There is a huge say-do gap. Projects are funded insufficiently which causes hindrance to modernization and results in crippled implementation.
good,A typical work day consisted of getting your assignment for the day and working that same position most of the day. I did learn how to operate a fork lift as well as how to make sure a quality product went out the door.
good,My typical day was that I was the manager on duty for several hours and had to give direction to several associates as well as get my own work done in the men's shop.
good,"Leuke bedrijfscultuur  "
good,The company itself is a great company to work for.  My management did not communicate what was going on and often felt left in the dark and having to work backwards to get the job done.  Not all tools were given to do a job.  VF as a company was a great company but needed more communication so that everyone was on the same page.
good,I work with some really great people and the benefits are great. Management style needs much improvement and HR policies need work. There is a lack of positive culture and things are constantly changing.
good,"When I worked here the management was awful, but the company itself was good. Lots of flexible with time off, and very consistent. Good, safe team environment."
good,"Good and comparable place to work in clothing store department sales environment"
good,pues el trabajo es bueno pero los compañeros de trabajo es mala y los supervisores no hacen nada. te dejan mal las áreas echándote la culpa.
good,There's no hard part about the job. Co-workers mostly expects things perfect which becomes stressful sometimes. Management is very fair. Back pain for those who have to lean forward for all their shift. There's a lot to learn everyday when walking into work.
good,"this is a very fun company to work for. they care deeply for how their employees feel at work. however, the work is very unstable, you will work 60 hours on week and only 8 the next, and you only know how many hours you will work that day."
good,"Accurately processed invoices for payment in a timely manner"
good,Too many changes one day your told to do one thing next day you have to change your schedule  because not enough work for eight hours We had two fifteen minute breaks. Never knew what your schedule was going to be a lot of the time some times 6 hrs a day sometimes 8 hrs sometimes 10 hrs.
good,"planing production, cary about full warehouse stock,"
good,"Reviewing and processing of information, the culture within the company is the importance  of all staff no matter there position and how best to support them. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people and social life staff sales. The worst part of the job was the lack of task during quieter periods of the business."
good,"A good place to receive customer service experience.  Decent fringe benefits.  High turnover rate.  Can be stressful dealing with customers at times.  Overall, a good starting point."
good,Nice environment to work in all mangers and employees are kind and treated with respect. Job can be stressful but nothing to bad. Loved the employees everyone care about each other feels more like a family
good,"Good to learn new things"
good,"For such a big company, focused on capital and expansion, I really enjoyed working there. To me I was quite lucky thanks to the fact I had a great team, good team leader. As customer service representative they give you the freedom to be proactive and play around procedure to accommodate the customer (to a certain extent). The workplace was great, very clean, recent building nothing to moan about except the canteen, which to be fair was not that bad when you think about their budget and the price they make us pay to get a decent meal."
good,"Really multinational environment, willing to help, great benefits, "
good,"i learned to work registers accurately, the managers were very nice. The hardest part of the job was rearranging the store. the people working there were good at what they did and very sweet"
good,"New to retail and looking to grow."
good,Dedicated Customer Service Representative motivated to maintain customer satisfaction and contribute to company success. I am also looking to expand my knowledge to better myself within the company & move up to the next level.
good,"Pretty simple "
good,The management is strong and people centered.  Great company culture
good,"The corporation as a whole pays well and handles the business effectively.  The corporation values the advancement of its employees and is more than willing to work with them in getting the proper education and/or training."
good,This is a self motivated job. My supervisors are some of the best that I've had the privilege to work with. They and my coworkers have taught me about running the embroidery machine. For the most part the people that I work with make the shift go by quickly. The hardest part of this job is that I always work third shift.
good,"working with fellow employees as well as customers to get the task at hand done. I have learn that in retail, things change on a daily basis. Customer Service Is key in the retail industry. Coworkers and management get along well making it a friendly & fun environment to work & shop at."
good,"It was pretty hot in the factory. learned how to sort specific items and have em scanned properly. management was very good and easy to understand. very friendly co wokers. they was a hard part of the day. being around everyone, and seeing new faces."
good,Great Place to work.  The people are friendly and management is great.
good,"Usually there is a positive attitude within the teams and there is always time for a laugh. On the other hand customer service often has to sort out messes of other departments what gives you as employee the feeling you and your department are less important than e.g. Sales or Credit."
good,Its a good place to work but they hardly give overtime or hours. Great benefits though. The supervisors and managers need improvement on how to do they're job.Other than that the pay is good too.
good,"The distance from home was a tough commute for the amount of pay I was receiving and not enough hours to give out."
good,"A typical day at work was organize stock room and work on delivered shipments. Clean show floor, organize and fix racks, load product on shelves, walls, etc.. I learned to understand retail customers more. Likes, dislikes. Attitudes, proper service, service with a smile. Management was very flexible and understanding. As well as supportive in every aspect. Always had an open door policy. My co-workers were friendly and made the day go by as fast and easy as possible. Always encouraging to help one way or another. The hardest part of the job was sorting the stock room at times. A lot of times I was by myself, but it was fun and time consuming. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and interacting with the customers. Helping them find and understand what they are looking for with their purchase."
good,a lot of motivated people that seem to me loved there job . I personally liked it my self . handling boxes all day was fine. never had an issue with anyone . just a fast pace job
good,the job was easy but it wasn't my type of job. the people made the day go by faster and taught me a lot. they worked with my school schedule and gave me time off when i needed it. the management was great they actually cared enough to know my first name. my job was to ensure that all the jeans where folded and completely replenished to ensure that the customer never had to ask for a size.
good,"It a great place to work, the energy is good. Your always greeted when you walk in and the co-workers are great to get-along with. I feel there isn't a hard part of the job because I love engaging with all types of people."

good,Primarily footwear distribution. Worked on process improvements using warehouse management systems along with warehouse redesigning and layout. Reduced processing time for RMA.

good,"Working at VF Outlet is very calm. It is an easy job if you have been a cashier before, the job duties are simple and not difficult at all. The environment was nice, but your mostly alone in your section."
good,"The manger that I got hired with back in 2015 was very spontaneous she was the best , she was very understanding and did a great job on training me to become the leader. I quit in 2017 because of the poor management they have now."
good,the people were awesome to work with but the management was a joke.
good,"Nothin drasticly amazing about the job, just a regular cashier job"
good,It was a great starting job. I really enjoyed learning about the company and the brand. I constantly wear this company brand now and even recommended people to work here.

good,Es una buena empresa dedicada principalmente a la venta de calzado juvenil
good,"I had so much fun working here, it was fast paced without making me feel like I couldn't do my job well enough. The managers were really great and had high expectations but also provided the support new employees needed to learn and grow in their positions."
good,Management is relaxed and hands off. You are aware of your job description and they expect the work to be done without much monitoring. It makes work a lot less stressful.
good,"Day work : is always with surprise and Priority "
good,"Very busy place and can be fun to work, have to be able to work with different cultures.  Should be flexible with your schedule and stay productive to advance.  Like any work place, it has lots of drama between employees which makes it hard to always be positive."
good,The job was fun and easy my co workers were all awesome women.  The only complaint I have is I was only getting like 12 hours a week and then when I got a second job they cut me down to one 4hr shift a week.
good,"A typical day at work consists of me providing customer service, completing my daily tasks as given .As well as helping employees with tasks that also need to be completed. I learned how to determine what customers need and want."
good,"This company was good with its workers.  I made production weekly and felt very appreciated by the managers.  I enjoyed going to work everyday as long as there were no problems with quality control staff.  I packaged children's clothes in boxes, preparing them for shipping.  The boxes then went on a belt to QC area.  Often the orders were incorrect due to the boxes falling off the belt.  The packager was held responsible."

good,"It's a good place to work, Customer understands the system very well. It's good company to understand the consumer goods business."
good,"It is not the type of work I am looking for, but do it because I need to support my spouse and I. There is not enough time provided by VF for me to do a perfect job."
good,"Honestly, VF Outlet has been the best work environment I have ever been in. The staff members are so caring, and always kept everyone up to date on how well they were doing."
good,"Great Starter Job, Constantly changing and growing with the times. Pay is good, learn to interact with people. Cashier, Fitting Room, Customer Service."
good,There are a wide variety of tasks to complete each day and this is a good place for young people to develop their retail skills. The schedule is pretty flexible.
good,It is really enjoyable to work at VF. This place has taught me a lot of things and I really like working with the teams here. I get to take initiatives here which is helping to grow as a good worker. Although sometimes job could be seemed a little tedious.

good,"This was a good job for my first one and was actually the only place that would hire me with no experience. However, I did work will all high school students so it did get dramatic. They were good on making sure you got the days you requested off as well."
good,Worked with a great group of co-workers.  Worked hard everyday to get as many invoice broke down for Sportswear to each division for cost accounting and accounts payable.
good,Typical day was packing and sorting. I learned how to pack really fast. Management was good. Co-workers were friendly. Hardest part of the job was working in the heat. Most enjoyable part of the job was going to different departments and learning how to do different things.
good,"Although I just worked as a server, I loved the atmosphere, my management, my co workers and the customers.  I only worked this job part time in addition to full time retail.  Liked the total company."
good,"VF Corporation is a great company to work for.  They have supportive management, that is willing to help out in any way possible to make your job easier.  They care a lot about your overall growth and development."
good,a typical day is discussing the products we have and how prices compare to other brands. I learned a lot about people and selling. management didn't do what they said they would do but overall a good starting step in the sales industry. got along very well with all my co-workers. hardest part was being cussed at by shoplifters. most enjoyable was getting great customer service ratings.
good,I enjoyed every bit of the time I was their.  This was a down to earth company that worked hard and valued their employees
good,"Under de 9 kollektionerna som jag varit delaktig i för Lee har jag tagit fram koncept, ritat plaggskisser, utvecklat DNA:n, passformer, tyger, tvättar och trims, haft daglig kontakt med leverantörer och fabriker, gjort trend och produktresor, ansvarat för möten, och mycket annat som förväntas av en designer och produktutvecklare."
good,"a typical day involves putting clothes away and helping customers on the sales floor."
good,Vf Corporation is a very fast paced fun job environment.The only downfall of the job is due to personal things.
good,VF is a great company to work for.  We can wear casual attire as we represent the brands we own.
good,"Would unload any new merchandise and put them out on the sales floor.  Rest of the daily activities consisted in organization of the store and cleanliness, and would cashier when needed.  I learned how to merchandise clothing and improved my attention to detail.  Management was good and cared about the presentation of the store.  Co-workers were diverse but sometimes lacking motivation.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was always something to do, so time never seemed to move too slow."
good,When I worked for this company things were good. It was a very relaxed setting.
good,"*Hard physical labor"
good,"Start with a full productive day. My co-workers were friendly and with that I enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the work I performed. I would answer phone line and assist customer with their orders. Would have to track packages and returns. I had to know at least 15 accounts in which could or could not be done, as well as know what clothing the customer shall receive. Worked with cash pay, credit or allotments for companies. Data entry of faxed or web sent orders as well as establish new accounts. Received a promotion as well as 2 raises within the first 6 months."
good,Help ring out customers and do returns and exchanges. Also straighten up the store and set up clothing displays.
good,Nautica was a place that I proudly called home for 15 years
good,"Every morning we had a 10 min meeting and stretch. Our supervisor would go over our quotas from the previous day and he would let us know about how many packages to be expecting to have for the day, as well as letting us know when we'd be off work. The co-workers were great; any questions or any kinda help they were more than willing to be there. The job wasnt really that hard or complex but it was straining as far as being on your feet 8 hrs out of the day. Being around great people made our day go by faster."
good,"From being up to my wrists in ink to getting a shipment out the door on time when it looked like it couldn't happen, the whole experience was good. I started working there as a screen cleaner and ended my career with them as a shipping specialist. Management was always quick to acknowledge a job well done and made sure all of the employees knew it. My co-workers were friendly for the most part and willing to help out whenever it was needed."
good,selling clothes and dressing displays
good,"I worked as a sales associate. Good company to work for! I was temporary employee, I enjoyed my time there and the best benefit in my opinion was the employee discount."
good,It was an amazing experience I learned alot now I know how to run a convaer line on my own learned how to use a hand wearable machine to locate product.
good,"Was very fast pace, you worked on your own so you only really had to worrie about your pace of skills and your percentage, very fast going good environment.great place to work"
good,"Management has favorites, and although I was well-liked it felt like i was overworked compared to others. I did more work than others and we still had the same pay rate."
good,"Great Culture and fun place to work!  They have lunches and games and raffles on occassion."
good,"I worked for VF Corpation for 2 years as a contractor. I was told I would get hired on permenantly, but that never did happen. They just kept me there and never attended on hiring me. I just kept getting the run around , being used by helping other departments. I was told to interview for a position, and the manager told me I was the main candidate, but come to find out someone else applied for the position in the same department almost doing the same thing got the position. I really felt used, but I did enjoy working with my peers. They fed us good and had great private sales on their clothes for their employees. Overall I really enjoyed working there and was very upset I didn't get hired on. None of the managers would help me. The managers there are very shady and disrespectful. Especially, the head guy. He would barely say two words to me, but everyone else was very friendly."
good,"During busy periods it would definitely light up, but for the most part, this job was easy going. You did your work and moved on. Everyone who worked there was very nice and would help as needed."
good,"Good place to work, I would go back for the right position. Depending on what part of the organization you worked in it did at times feel like a good ol boys club. There was not really a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,"Management can vary, I had good and bad. Day to day can be stressful like any job, but my coworkers made each day for me. They do work to advance your skills and there are chances to move around (not necessarily up) and it usually comes with a raise. If you pay attention, do your work, and show up on time, you will be noticed by management. VF is a growing company and they bring new brands to Appleton every so often. You won't make a ton of money but with OT I was not hurting by any means."
good,"Started as a temp in shipping back in August 3rd shift shipping, pretty much on the lines pulling boxes off and locating to the locations. Easy job and fast to learn new things once you look proficient. My training was easy and simple. My main trainer looks real young but he made everything feel easy. There was 3 trainers on the floor, but it seemed more like the youngest trainer made the most sense and payed attention to his trainees. I like the job and hours its easy as well. Everyone gets along in this shift."
good,I really enjoy working for the company. There is growth within the company if you are willing to relocate. Pay rate for  asm is minimal base upon location and store sales.
good,All the work is layed out for you. Communication skills are great at a corporate level. Too much fraternizing at store level and Store managers have favorites. They also tend to hired friends and family which makes for an uncomfortable work place and unfair promotions.
good,"A VF le estoy agradecido por lo que me dio.  Me permitió desenvolverme más en el mundo laboral, además de enseñarme a pulir habilidades blandas y duras."
good,"Great people, challenging work environment. Great place to learn and grow if you are a self starter. Great benefits.Summer Fridays all year long."
good,fun place to work at i enjoyed the environment lots of benefits managers and supervisors are good people learned lots of duties and how to work with devices for orders to be pulled and picked. good job overall i give this place a 8 or nine from a 10 scale.
good,VF Corporation is a good place to work. There are a lot of nice people there who are willing to help one another out within the company. The company offers tuition reimbursement and career development courses.
good,i loved my job and what i did but there was alot of favortism which made the job stressfull
good,I would run a 15 headed embroidery machine for 10 hours a day on production rate.pay. How to care for machine and process merchandise. Management worked well with employees. My co-workers where very helpful. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with machine. Most enjoyable part of the job was the faster I worked the more I got payed.
good,VF outlet is a great place to work at if you don't mind slow days. It has great products and great people who come in but it's not for everyone.
good,"VF Corporation was a great company to work for, the tax department was a challenge, alot of turn over, morale was low and stress was high,"
good,VF is a great family orientated company. The company is very productive and a fun place to work.
good,Going into work will always be easy knowing that everyone was in a good mood and everyone would be so inspired to work as a team and get the job done.
good,I enjoyed working for VF Corporation. The hours and your schedule are very flexible. Management is also very friendly and works to meet your needs as best as they can.
good,"Depending on your leader, you may have a very different experience at VF. VF was behind in compensation and true flexibility like working from home and work life balance."
good,"- no such thing as typical day, feast or famine mentality, but I did a lot of different things"
good,"Enjoyed working for company. Very busy and intense days, but fulfilling. The hardest part of job is working with and satisfying many different people and priorities."
good,"Worked from a remote location."
good,The managers are great they can push you to be the best you can but if you're trying to move up in management they expect you to be there for at least a year or two.
good,"Good place to work, but no place for me to continue? Close location, with emphasis on Action Sports! Great Brand and reputation. Somewhat ""political"" atmosphere."
good,Great company to work for with quality people that truly cared about Providing an addictive customer service experience and innovative products that met industry needs.
good,"Great management, the only thing was no good benefits. No paid time off, and the pay is awful there. I barely got any hours, other than that great managers."
good,"A store with a fast paste business which Intailed opening shipments doing floor displaces , scheduling , data input , yearly reviews , shipping overseas and last but not least the stores main goal was customer service . Unfortunately the devison of barbizon closed and relocated in Pennsylvania in 1999"
good,I am not to sure what it is like because i was a seasonal employee but they hired to many that they let me go after Christmas. Overall the management is awesome.
good,This was my first job and it was really enjoyable. The company works well with school schedules and at one point I had a full time job on top of working 15-20 hours here and they were still flexible. Good customer service experience and overall fun place to work!
good,VF provides an energetic and thriving atmosphere.  it's various coalitions provide a lot of opportunities.  A large majority of the employees have been with the company for 20+ years which is a testament to company.
good,"during the week things are rather dead, and we work on projects and freight. the weekends are fast paced and a little hectic at times, a lot of employees leave after their first weekend. but this is mostly because the fact that this store is located in a popular tourist attraction near DFW Airport. so there's lots of travelers and language barriers to get through"
good,Good company overall depending on division and job.  Some areas tend to be top heavy making decision making extremely slow.
good,Learn many styles of jeans exist stocking and straightening the salesfloor is a must. Managers won't ask you to do what they won't do. I love to work with the different customers and get to know the regulars.
good,"I have grown both personally and professionally thanks to my time at VF.  Every day was a challenge and learning experience.  I was able to get a behind the scenes look into the complex world of manufacturing apparel.  After years working in design/development/buying it has been a complementary experience to work in this side of the business.  Improving my strategic planning experience and understanding cost negotiation as well as the ebb and flow of the development process. "
good,A typical day at work was getting boxes loading up with merchandise and putting them on conveyer.
good,"Great company, not as much opportunities to grow if you are not willing to relocate."
good,"Shipping and Receiving, answer phones,Fork Lift, drexel operator,inventory,loading trucks, RF scanning guns"
good,"The profit sharing and paid days off can not be beat. No other company profit shares with its part-time employees. Paid holidays every holiday! Even your birthday! I learned Great values in customer service, leadership, and team work. The only thing I can say is a con is low wages and advancement."
good,Flexible schedule and great benefits. Compensation fair for the related industry.
good,A typical day would be doing freight and getting to the floor in a timely matter. I have learned how the department is suppose to flow and the ROYGBIV. The management was great while I was there. My co-workers were helpful in some areas. The hardest part was everyone not on the same page. The most enjoyable was the customers and employees.
good,"Enjoying the workplace and associates in other teams who made working there more enjoyable when we meet together to support one another. Place I would work at and recommend to other people,"
good,"VF is a great place to work. Very casual and laid back. A typical work day at VF was working long hours. Most of the time, you would work longer than eight hours a day. Workplace culture was great. Diverse company. Great employee incentives."
good,"I had a great time at VF but as many company nowadays there were constant changes and reorganization which resulted in change fatigue, frustration and demotivation."
good,Easy to get along with fellow employees and management but the pay is not great and it takes a long time to get a raise that isn't ever really substantial.  Good work ethic is often expected but hardly rewarded.  Management is eager to work around employees' schedules.
good,"VF Outlet gives you opportunity to learn and grow in the company, the associates are like family, and most of the management is amazing and understanding. However, like most corporations, there can be an issue with the store manager."
good,"Enjoyed the job and most of the people.  Went through a manager training program and was offered a promotion with relocation.  Turned down the offer and things seemed to sour, went on to the next thing.  Would return for the right opportunity."
good,Fun place to work with friendly coworkers who are easy to get along with. You are trained to be the best you can be and apply yours skills on the job. Opportunities to advance and develop skills with the help of those around you. Pay is low compared to the amount of work they make you do and with few benefits coming from a big company.
good,"Good place to work. Paid vacation, bonuses, incentives. I learned new skills with data retrieval and entry. Improved quality skills through team work and learning from others. Overall great experience."
good,"The most enjoyable part about the job is the relaxed environment and the high quality products which the company stands behind. "
good,"I was inspection daily production at my worked area i  have learned new things everyday , upper management is good  all the employee were get along well"
good,"Management is great because you can have a good relationship with them. Managers give small projects to do with them so you would stay productive and busy. No slacking off, but overall, it is a fun,calm environment to work in."
good,"I wish I could get on permanently. It's fast paced, but I like it. The supervisor it good and helpful. I like getting off early in the day, but start time at 5am is hard."
good,"Maintained employees personnel files which included new hires, transfers and termination.  Updated daily sales reports.  Assisted vault clerk with balancing cash registers.  Updated monthly accounting of invoices from all vendors and shipping departments."
good,"The environment at Vf outlet is positive and fun. We are encouraged to work hard and while enjoying what we do. While there is not a lot of room for advancement, the people and the work makes you want to stay."
good,Overall a good company but very stressful. Old systems make work challenging with quite a bit of manual processes. Middle management could communicate better and do a better job with employee development.
good,For the past several months  there is not enough  hours and they keep getting more people. They've mentioned that work will continue to be slow for the next month also.
good,"Very enjoyable job.  Tends to get very hot during summer months due to large dryers.  Must be able to work well with others as all jobs are a team based.  Unfortunately, the factory is now closed."
good,Great place to work. Had to pick orders 10 at a time. Then when all the orders were complete learned how to put away the products as well. When I stayed worked overtime was able to learn shipping and receiving. So I could work in all areas of the warehouse.
good,"In almost 9 years in VF I can say that my time in the company has been overall great."
good,"Learned a lot about Customer Service and working with people.  Learned how to work the register, merchendising, and shippment.  Nothing was really difficult, mostly just needed patience and time."
good,"this company is very best easy comunicate with director,I work as senior sales assistant at vans tebrau"
good,Enjoyed my time there.  Good place to work and wished I could have stayed on with the company.  Limited opportunities for additional training and/or advancement.
good,Worked for the company for over 18 years in Merchandising Management. Handled many different product lines and worked with so many amazing people. I am still connected with them even after so many years.
good,I learnt so many things about corporate life and it was great learning AS400. Working environment here in Wipro is a stress free one.
good,"I work at the VF Outdoor DC in Visalia, CA and I have been wokring for the company for 10 years.  VF is definitely a great place to start out if you have no dc experience but you do have to prove yourself because the turnover rate is pretty high.  I have worked in multiple departments and there is a substantial amount of ways to move up the ladder.  There are a lot of internal job postings to move around and apply for leadership with the required years of experience.  Every job is going to have its ups and downs, drama, gossip, hostile people but VF has taken appropriate actions to resolve any time of conflict.  The benefits are not great but I'm glad to have it offered along with the flexible spending account that I always sign up for in open enrollment.  We do have a yearly raise and a yearly bonus as well, along with numerous paid for luncheons, annual picnic and holiday parties where tons of prizes are given.  We also have an employee sale every so often where full time employees get to purchase 2nd quality and donations quality items for dirt cheap which is always exciting to look forward to.  Overall, I enjoy working for this dc.  They have been good to me and I see more years to come in my timeline at VF."
good,Good leadership. Company overall has sense of knowing who they are and the purpose they serve. Good company to work for.
good,"A typical day at Vanity Fair depended on what hours one worked. If we worked the morning shift, we were required to dust off all the racks and counters and such, open the dressing rooms, do inventory, count money and open registers, and straighten up the overall store - staying busy all the way up until opening time. When we unlocked the doors, we were required to always have a smile on our faces, be welcoming and courteous to customers, and to assist the customers with any and all needs and concerns they would have. We had to keep ourselves busy straightening the racks or returning unwanted items to their places or asking the customers if they needed assistance or restocking - we were never allowed to just stand around and do nothing. This is the same for every shift, however the evening shift was required to vacuum and clean the store, as well as do the inventory on certain items as a sort of loss prevention method."
good,"I am familiar with Purchase order(850) , Invoice(810) and Advance Shipment Notice(856) EDI documents, EDI standards like ANSI X12 Version (4010, 5010) and EDI transmission protocols like AS2, Inovis and VAN. I have also performed the following "
good,"I cleaned the store, put together fixtures, moved merchandise between store and sister store, and helped receiving merchandise."
good,"My activities that I was to carry out on a daily basis varied day to day. I was responsible for auditing and confirming contents of packages, document inconsistences with regards to package content, reported incorrect content to supervisor, labeled boxes, located lost packages, and insured packages were scanned into the companies tracking software system."

good,"On peut s'y rendre facilement en train , en bus et en voiture."
good,"Every day is a productive day."
good,very serious and organized company with excellent benefits and good structure. Very demanding work load but well compensated. Going through many cultural changes so things shifting fast. Little loyalty to employees.
good,Great family culture but also very fast paced being that I worked for one of the more high volume retail stores in the country. I enjoyed every minute of it.
good,"One of the most enjoyable companies that I have work for.  Upper Management and Corporate were always upbeat and helpful.  Had to relocate to Austin, TX and there were no positions with the company available in that area."
good,"I enjoyed working for  VF, their advancement was great especially if you performed a good job.  I have only one problem with VF corporation, they moved all their operations overseas."
good,"Currently employee at Lee Jeans.  All positions are being relocated out of state, 1000 miles away from the roots of the brand for over 100 years.  I have loved working here and never intended to leave, but the board of directors said that it is in the best interest of the shareholders to separate the brand from VF, with what seems to be little regard for what will happen to the 100+ employees and their families in a city where there are basically no other jobs in the industry.  So sad what corporations have done to this country."
good,The office is very casual and most people under 30 so it can sometimes feel like a school more than an office. The building is full of people with different nationalities which is amazing and you get to know so many new people and learn so much about other cultures.
good,"Very relaxed atmosphere."
good,VF a warehouse i would definently go back to work at. The department I was placed on was the returns department. Learn many new things and in the mean time got better at my job.
good,Great company culture. Fun place to work and surrounded by a very talented group of people. Compensation at the multi-store level could have been more generous based on the scope and volume of responsibility.
good,The work is very fast paced and pay is based on piece work. Not a lot of heavy lifting. Lots of fun people work there. There are a variety of different areas to work in
good,Working for VF was not normally stressful except for our busy season. I like that it was a casual setting and could basically set your own hours. The best part of working there was the people!!
good,It was a wonderful environment and a lot of various tasks to perform. I learned about being a customer service representative. The management was good. The workplace was wonderful. The hardest part of the job was being fast. The most enjoyable was getting to know the customers.
good,Professional but laid back workplace with opportunities for growth and advancement. Good company benefits provided too. Overall a good place to work in the Fox Valley.
good,"Job consists of getting orders ready for printer. Having to read orders set up screens,get inks, and do paperwork. Sometimes am the printer depending on the day. Great supervisors. Stress full at times to get products out in time."

On the job I learned how to provide great customer service and how to deal with different personalities, the managers did everything possible to provide a great work environment and they care about their employees. My Coworkers were helpful and a pleasure to deal with; the hardest part of the job I would say, is keeping the store clean because there are always people coming in and out but the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to interact with different people all day."
good,"I loved working at VF, i was a great and relaxed environment. My colleagues were absolutely amazing especially in the french team. Team leader was very helpful and always there to answer questions. i learnt a lot in dealing with customer on the phone and via emails...etc"
good,"At first this place was not my cup of tea, but as I got into the swing of things I adjusted to working in a production-based environment.  My workday would begin by booting up my machines, oiling them and checking the bobbins.  I would also look at what orders I had to start the day and get the threads I would need to complete them.  I would then mark and hoop the garments and place them on a machine before programming the design into the computer.  I loved the people I worked with and we managed to have a lot of fun even though we were working extremely hard to fulfill customer demand."
good,This is a great place to work with great bonuses and great pay to a motivated individual.  You MUST be willing to go the extra mile and kill your body/mind if you want to make some real money here.  Management sees worthy employees and rewards their efforts fast.

good,I love working at the VF Outlet. So far it is the best job I've ever had. Here they treat you as adults and trust that you will complete the tasks at hand. Have not had a complaint yet.
good,"Every day was a great new adventure. I got to work one-on-one with customers in order to find whatever best fit their needs. I learned how to better get things done as a team and how to give the best possible customer service I could provide. Any time I needed any help or advice on how to complete a task, someone was always by my side to make sure I learned about exactly what I was doing. Every once in awhile rude or messy customers would come through, but everyone worked as a team to make sure everything was done in the possible way. My favorite part about working at VF Outlet was the leadership role I took on when we were left to manage the store."

good,"VF is a great company to work for they have GREAT benefits for there part time associates, I don't have anything to say bad about this company except that its extremely hard to advance because people who are in positions in this company tend to stay."
good,"Well there are 3 different shifts you can apply for, Nights, Days, Weekends. I worked the night shift 8:00 pm to 7:00 am. They will train you on they're machines and equipment. Management was fine and good. I made plenty of friends with my co-workers and peers. The hardest part of the job were the hours. the most enjoyable part was how close the large company was."
good,"Good people. They worked around my school schedule. It was cool that we got holliday pay, and a yearly bonus."
good,"A typical day at work would be running the sales floor, fitting rooms, and registers. Wherever you are needed, you go. It's all a team effort here in order to get things down. The managers are awesome and I loved working for every single one of them. I had a few hard working co-workers whom I enjoyed working with because they wouldn't just sit around and watch everyone else work. The hardest part of the job was tolerating with the co-workers who just did nothing, but I picked up the slack if needed. The most enjoyable part was bonding with co-workers and having conversations at the registers with customers while checking them out. "
good,"I really enjoy working there, the hours and work are easy and has been a great place for me to get back in the swing of working since being out of work for so long!!"
good,"I enjoyed the late afternoon shift from 3:30 p.m. to midnight. I was a quality auditor and my time when by quickly, I was always busy. My co-workers and I got along and we worked effectively to get all work orders complete. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing when we left at the end of the shift, all pending work was completed. The hardest part is getting an extra burst of energy at the end of your shift when its time to go home."
good,I really enjoy the customers we get in. My coworker and I work well together. We help each other with problems. The managers work the stock an we the employees clean and cover the store.

good,great place to work. okay pay but no overtime is offered. not enough pay for area that i live in (nashville). management show favoritism when it come to promotions.
good,"un dia tipico en vf es llegar y ponerte de imediato a trabajar, llegue sin conocimientos de costura y aprendi varias funciones e incluso a hacer mas de las operaciones necesarias..la parte mas dificil es que te desesperas cuando no sabes hacer algo pero con paciencia lo aprendes y lo que mas me gusto es que los viernes es medio dia"
good,Awesome Organisation having Awesome people. Most ethical company as recognised by fortune.This is the most inspiring aspect of VF for me which I have truly experienced during the job role.
good,"Productive and fun loving environment with co-workers, supervisors and managers who unite to produce the best quality of jeans"
good,"Was disappointed store closed. I very much enjoyed working as team leader in sports department, especially during Nascar. And merchandising was fun during seasonal sports events."
good,In the warehouse I enjoyed the constant work coming down the conveyors never leaving a dull moment while working. Using the opportunity to switch up the repetitive wave of product coming down the line by palletizing cases and taking them to their correct location.
good,"Es la empresa textil mas grande del mundo."
good,"Answering calls and emails from consumers."
good,"I liked working at vf they offered plenty of overtime,good benefits,room to grow I regret ever leaving there"
good,a typical day includes facilitating projects for associates and maintaining quality customer service skills. Also completing daily paper work.
good,"For a warehouse job, this was a great job. Staff is all extremely friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was clean and all employees are to act respectively and is a no smoking property. As far as the work, it is very fast paced and can get very busy and stressful. Requires lots of constant standing and consistent work throughout your shift."
good,Hard working enviroment that gives incentive pay to hard workers.  A somewhat independent job where you hold yourself accountable. your mistakes are noticed through the computers so you have to be vigilant and aware or you can be let go.
good,"Great company and people.  I absolutely loved working there and wish I had been able to stay.  Unfortunately, the pay was not line with the level of experience and knowledge, skills, and abilities expected.  They did offer decent benefits and a great atmosphere."
good,"Working at VF was great, although I was only hired as a temp sales associate, my time there was great. The other staff were great, awesome managers, and the benefits and pay were great. My schedule was accommodated to and  hours were flexible."
good,"Well the most likely a day at work would be having an customer come in and bring back some clothes that did not fit. We would help assist the customer as much as we can. While working at VF Outlet I learned it was most importantly a groups effort job. I enjoyed that, we as a business could come together as a team and work completely and effectively. Management could tend to run late some times causing the employees to be late, but other than  that they were very active on the floor helping along with the associates assisting the customers. Overall I love all my managers. The culture of the work place is slow and outdated. The mangers try to hire a younger generation but Cooperation clothing guidelines does not allow that generation to express themselves in a type of clothing store. The options for work is jeans and a dark color shirt,very drab. The hardest part of my job would be not being able to completely understand the problem of the customer, because if I'm free and I  do not  clearly get what the customer is trying to relay I have to grab another associate and stop them from their daily task to understand. The most exciting part is knowing that you did  great at work and you were able to do more than what your expected, that makes me very happy!"
good,"A typical day at work would be from clocking in, walking to the workplace assigned and completed start shift duties such as bags in trash cans, exchange/receipts/tag folder documents on hand, hanger bins in each register and lastly before opening an employee meeting for such events on about the day and week. Sometimes worked evening shifts that were to clock in, go to designated area and  relieve the previous associate but as an evening shift had to clean (sweep and mop) and maintain/restock the area, then cleaned restrooms, afterwards took the hanger bins to the back and put them in their designated areas and clocked out."
good,this is a very easy and fun place to work but the hours weren't as good. 18 hours at the most. The girls and management were awesome!
good,I love working at VF. I enjoy the environment and I enjoy the people i work with. The only way the job would be hard is if you do not do your work or it piles up on you. I have been there for a year and a half now. I know some people that tolerate the job so I can't speak for everyone by saying its an awesome job. Overall I enjoy it.
good,"I was a CSR. I worked with customers, answered phone calls, and also worked on the register."
good,I like the values and the backing behind the company.  They are very diverse and that makes me happy as an individual.  The company supports and works alot within the realm of core values and the world afairs.

good,I absolutely loved working for this company. My co-workers and managers were great.

Awesome company to work for."

good,They like to promote within. Offer training. Do reward programs. They like to hear new ideas from their employees. And also do a yearly company evaluation that the employees fill out. They want to know what the employees like about working there and what employees think could be better.
good,"Great place to work overall.  Company is run as an investment with a huge focus on gross margin and thus minimal investments in automation for DCs.  Culture as a company is great, however local leadership varies widely between locations."
good,If you have no kids or bills this is a good job to work. I wish they had more full time positions. But overall good second or if your looking for a part time job.
good,Good place to work and shop at. Decent prices and huge selection of products. Great customer service. I love the new facility. Managed and merchandised very well.

good,"This job was amazing and loved every single part or it , the work, the breaks, the manages,as well as the environment to. this job was great"
good,Nice and inviting environment to work in. I really enjoyed working here and coming encounter with the customers
good,fun and easy job easy to get along with co workers no complaints
good,"You have bundles of work that must go out. You sew whatever job you have. In a day you usually do hundreds of pants or shirts.  I learned that if it wasn't for our accuracy, the teams wouldn't have uniforms.  When you see the major league baseball teams on T.V. you have a sense of pride. Our supervisors and floor persons were the most helpful.  Always a kind word and told you when you did a job well.  We were like a family, shared in tales of our own families and they listened and gave some advice.  A shoulder if you needed it.  Hardest part of the job is a rush order that needs to go out same day on the truck.  Most enjoyable, our two  vacations.  They were two weeks in summer and two weeks at Christmas."
good,I would still be at this job if the economy had not dipped down. would love to return.
good,It's a good company with good benefits. I enjoy working with my co-workers. We are one big happy family.
good,A good overall good place to work.get your birthday off with pay.we are a union based company.
good,"Supervisors allocate people to the various tasks for the day. Once allocated, staff are usually left to get on with their work, as they know what the time and quality expectations are. Anyone who runs out of work seeks their supervisor for a new task, if one hasn't already been provided. Each 8.00 to 5.00 day includes two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch, equating to 8.5 hours, so we only need to work 5 hours on Fridays to make 39 hours. If overtime is needed, we stay Friday afternoon, so we still finish at 5pm. Most of the workers have been there for years, so relationships are long standing and generally very good. They can rely on each other, so there is a generally cheerful atmosphere even when the pressure is on."
good,i really like how they have jobs that i actually like. they were fun and i really enjoyed being there. it was close to home and very convient. met some really great people.
good,"Discounts were great.  compensation could be much better.  They are well below the market for a call center /inside sales facility.  "
good,"Una excelente empresa, cuida todos los aspectos menos el mas importante, el factor humano, con las personas que te rodean, tu equipo de trabajo."
good,Everyone that I worked with at VF were amazing. I loved my supervisor and co workers. I learned how fun it can be working with others. The management was very good and easy to understand what needed to be done. I got to be friends with people of all different backgrounds and cultures. The hardest part of the job was learning how to do everything. Once you know what to do I was very comfortable doing my job. The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing all the people I work with and making forever connections with amazing people.
good,"Hard work but among many great team players that contribute to company and departmental goals.  There are alot of great brands under VF and although in different cities, the understanding and performance of each work well together."
good,"A typical day at work consist of analyzing and sourcing data on customer information and optimizing business opportunities to maximize ROI.

good,"hard working, but a fast paced environment. people are nice and helpful. also the boss was also helpful and  understanding. i would work for them again. even tho i liked the night shift i would like to work morning."
good,"Great place to work but job security has been challenged with recent corporate restructuring.  There are changes that will affect some but overall, a great place to work."
good,VF Outlet is a wonderful company to work for. Retail stores are very well maintained and employees as well as managers all work together to achieve customer satisfaction.
good,"Vf Outlet is an outstanding place to work. The managers are not just good at their job, but they are also people who you will never forget. They help you with work, of course but they also teach you many life lessons and help mold you into a better person. If there were more advancement opportunity in the company I would still be there. That is the only flaw. If you are looking for a flexible part time job, Vf without a doubt would be your best option."
good,Great opportunity.  Great company.  I represented 6 apparel lines.  A great career company.  I left for another opportunity.  That was a mistake on my part.
good,"Vf Outlet was a nice job to have while I was in high school and first year of college. I was there for almost 2 years, and it taught me how to talk to and treat customers. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and now we are all friends out of that work experience. I was really a laid back job. Help Customers find there clothes, work cash register, and clean the store."
good,"I enjoyed working at vf but, they didnt have enough hours for me and i really wanted full time."
good,Really like the company.  Work load is not balanced in our department.  Some work a 35-40 hour week.  Others are working 60 plus hours.  Management has been promising workload rebalancing for almost three years.

From there I would grab another cart with empty boxes to go around and pick clothes from the shelves I just stocked so I could fill the customers order. Once the completed orders were in shipping I would tape the boxes, palletize them by order number and load them on the trucks. Sometimes I would also audit some of the orders when asked."

The vas dept isn't so bad. Then they have a rework dept.,but with all those deptartments we still don't have enough work all the time anymore with all the stores closing."
good,"I had a 7 year stint at VF, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The pay was good, and it could be competitive as it depended on how much work you would do in a single day. There was a lot of overtime to be had, if you were willing to take it. Management was generally very good, and my work/life balance was perfect. Recommended."
good,"A typical day begins with being in uniform conduct and clocking in then waiting for customers to show up. While waiting, we check if the clothes are sized correctly, if there are any ""go-backs"" to put away, and touch up anything that needs to be touched up on. Management was good, they kept watch on how we were doing and helped along the way. It's not very interesting but we were expected to get customers to buy extra items and sign up for the VIP program where for every 1200 points the costumer gets, they would get $10 back to spend. We also were to expected to work up to the motto, ""Speed, Spirit. Smile"" and it helped me become a more efficient person and made costumers feel better when they walked in and shopped. The hardest part would be standing because I didn't have the most comfortable shoes to wear and we could only where black closed toed shoes plus I didn't have the money nor could I spend the money I earned. The most enjoyable would be to work with the costumers. I find it fun to work with costumers plus it gives me something to do or actually it is what I am supposed to do as a retail associate."
