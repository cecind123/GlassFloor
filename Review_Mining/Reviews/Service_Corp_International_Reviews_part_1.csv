bad,"Total misrepresentation of what the job actual is. Your job is to sell cremation services to people who have replied with a card stating they would like to know more about the service. You are REQUIRED to be on the phone calling these people at times REQUIRED by the company. If you don't, then your contract is canceled and you are no longer a rep. The office where I worked had a manager that did her best to run you like you were an EMPLOYEE and expected you to report to her multiple times per day. She would call first thing in the morning wanting to know if you were on the phone calling your list. I was successful while I was there, but I couldn't take being micromanaged by this woman. Her boss hired her and would NEVER listen to anything the reps complained about. She was his darling. As long as I'm setting appointments, selling the services and covering my quota, why would you care when I'm on the phone??? Also, I'M NOT AN EMPLOYEE!!! I'M A 1099 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR!!!! You can't REQUIRE me to do anything!  The main issue also was they want you to call and call and call and call the same people over and over. Then, after calling and calling, the manager wanted us to get google numbers so they people we are harassing won't recognize the number and MAYBE will pick up the phone. REALLY???? This is how you have to do things to sell your services????"
bad,"I started as a provisional emb/fd.  I was told if I take a lower salary my manager would take care of getting me the raise I deserved by the work I did, which was a complete lie. Then I was told that everyone had to start off at night and move up to a day shift which was also a lie. I am being forced to go back to nights or find other work while the favorite of the Supervisor gets to keep their day shift.  There is way too much favoritism to have a comfortable working environment.  There is way to much"
bad,Would not work there again nor would I recommend to anyone.  I do not want to take time to explain any more than I have already.  Low pay and lots of hard work
bad,You will work long hard hours. You will be on the phone making phone calls stalking people over and over again.  People will try and steal your sales.  You will get fired over another person's mistake.  Watch your back with this company.
bad,"Make sure you ask in an interview what expenses you are responsible for.  For example, business cards, computer,gas, stationary etc..  You are required to work every Saturday.  You may be required to travel at your own expense.  You may receive no vacation time.  Ask questions.  Ask, what is your annual turn over?"
bad,"Unorganized, full of drama and always unsatisfied management. Priorities are not in order. Missing common sense. Disregards any type of hard work. No gratitude."
bad,The lack of consistency at the regional management level produced a very transit and unstable culture within the local operations . That instability was recognized by the families that were interested in developing any kind of long term future business relationships . This was evident in the surveys conducted by JD Power and Associates.
bad,Highly stressfully work environment. Executive leadership makes false promises to employees and unrealistic goals are forced upon its workers. I do not suggest working for this employer.
bad,"Toxic workplace with bullying/racism from management & all staff from your co-worker to the very top "
bad,Lord have mercy on the poor soul who ends up working for this greedy self absorbed outfit!  If you don't mind being taken advantage of as well as being used and abused!  By all means your ship has arrived!  Otherwise... look elsewhere!
bad,"No comment........I don't have much to say about my time at service corporation international.  ................................................................ Poor management, unprofessional atmosphere, low salary, long hours worked,"
bad,"underpaid, understaffed, hard-working individuals with the worst equipment. the worst union support and terrible cold-hearted management.  The company doesn't want to keep employees they want them to come and go. most of the retired workers left without replacements. the only guys left behind are stuck with new guys that won't last a year. The only employees that get paid well are the ones the were hired before SCI took over. Since then SCI doesn't care about the hard workers. They only care about sales."
bad,"Hired in on sales resume. Interviewed with sales manager. Was sent to sales school. Have a note from my second day of work where I was told they waned to see a 14:1 Pre-need to At-need ratio. Do the math, that's 93%...but was then chained to a desk doing non-sales paperwork. Sales school was 2 weeks of training suitable for the OUTSIDE sales staff, didn't even cover PN insurance sales! Lasted 4 months of this nonsense."
bad,It could be a good company but politics is very strong and thick. You better working at a family owned funeral establishment than working for this corporation. Do not work sales at the cemetery because you will not like the Director and you have no life. I worked 30 days straight once without a day off..
bad,The on-site manager was not a person of character.  He would do as little as possible and get paid by everyone else doing thier jobs.  The pay was structured so that you have to hit unrealistic numbers to even get paid a little commission. They have you do a bunch of work that you don't get paid for
bad,They care NOTHING about the employees nor the customers. Employee morale is ZERO. The managers work you to death and then all the employees all back stab and gossip and steal your customers. Google the managers names with any adjective you think applies and a state where they are from. OMG
bad,At times like this I don't understand what is the purpose of lying. Why do we mistreat people as if they don't exist and don't have needs to create a better environment not for you but for your clients. These people lie & take advantage of people. They raise the prices on the people and they don't care. They are all crooks. They will ruin your career. By all means don't risk it.
bad,Terrible work environment!  No job security!  GM’s are terrible and treat families and employees like garbage!!  They only care about the money!   The cemeteries are neglected and they only jump when a family complains about a loved ones grave!!!  Terrible place to work!!
bad,"Dead end job,literally, no safety equipment, you will be worked to death. The management will force you to do their job like moving caskets etc.in front of unhappy customers."
bad,Company management is old school. They need to see you working late at night to feel good about themselves. Management distrusting of technology so many things are highly manual and prone to errors. Internal Audit management is clueless.
bad,U walking on eggshells everyday and if u do get promoted some one will try to get u fired every day not a good place to work workload is to much for two man's
bad,"After leaving my job of a few years, I thought I was coming into a professional environment boy was I so wrong.  First week there during orientation I should have known there was an issue when I smiled at someone and they said what the ""heck are you looking at?""  That was a preface for what the company stands for.  The welcome I received quickly wore off within 2 weeks. One of my coworkers was always annoyed with simple questions.  I made it a point to stop asking but then it got to where she started causing dissension amongst others to the point of bullying.  When brought up to management and hr on several occasions there advice was deal with it yourself.  Management also did not like being asked questions about much of anything.  She loved hearing herself talk without allowing for others to speak.  She too talked about others too which is so tacky. Workwise they preferred you do the minimum and with mediocre results.  If you gave too much you were told you're trying too hard which in all my life have never have I heard that doing a good and detailed job was wrong.  The coworkers that were kind and professional were few unfortunately.  I'd have to agree with what others say there is alot cliquishness and favoritism in the environment and as long as someone like upper management and the hr executive team doesn't correct behavior then this will keep happening over and over. They lose good workers to keep people with behavioral issues with an attitude.  They prefer people that do the least amount of work and socialize all day.  That is why I left because I'm a person that is there"
bad,Over all I love the industry however whenever management ask you to lie to families and holds an employee back from advancement. And is a hostile environment lies to employees and retaliation for moving forward within the company. And terminates an employee for no reason
bad,Worked a lot of hours 95+ for a $200 paycheck. its commission job very difficult. rotating family needs thru service counselors... I felt as if our cemetery is lacking anyways
bad,"Pressure to take adv. of people at worst time in their lives, (death of loved one.)  Sloppy mgt. Cannot trust anyone in mgt.  A co. w/ many law suits."
bad,Do yourself and your family a huge favor...  WALK AWAY!!!  Don't give these losers the benefit of throwing you under the bus like yesterday's trash.  Just say NO!!!
bad,I was fine and doing well  in this industry...up until I experienced a death in my own circle of loved ones.  They were so uncaring and unfeeling about my experience...it literally made me leave the company withing a month of that happening.  Never Again !!!
bad,I was a sales manager for over 2 years. This company has no other focus but sales. Families that have just experienced a loss are the lead source and it is company standard to meet the family and pressure them to purchase grossly over priced funeral services and plans 3 days after they have buried their loved one.
bad,"The week on training was valuable. Other than that the management only made money when you sold the most expensive funerals. And used upsell techniques for pricier caskets, services. All agents and funeral directors were on a quota."
bad,They make it sound like you can earn big money but its slow pace-boring-they make you pressure sell to familys that are grieving and management is horrible. There is no advancement and they run through employees left and right. Do not even think about going here..I swear. You get called at all times of the day nights and weekends to meet with people and there is no leads-you are on your own.
bad,"Horrible!"
bad,"Constant change to the comp plan, and never in the salespeople's favor, many changes in management, too many meetings, have to get a license. I don't recommend."
bad,"I have worked several years for this company."
bad,"There is extremely high turnover. You dont know if today is your last day. Always rumors floating that management is looking to fire someone. Very very very high stress job to produce.  It takes almost 6 weeks to get paid."
bad,Do not work here. This is a company that has been so far out of the loop for so long that they have no way of competing in todays internet driven world. its like going back in time really.
bad,"I worked the job for a year without a boss and loved it was very successful, until the local manager hired a personal friend to be my boss, this person then hired their mother in law, and put me in a position to do their unpaid work for them. when i confronted them with the issue i was physically threatened and then fired two weeks later, They also have an ALL or Nothing commission schedule probably the most complicated ive ever seen. involving a 3 week rolling bonus that i achieved quite often except when i had national guard obligations some of them like the inauguration appeared without any kinda warning. this affected my pay for 3 months every time it happened and i was out 2300$ that i EARNED "
bad,The company is now owned by Service Corp International and they could care less about their employee's. They have a high turnover rate mainly due to poor management and really bad marketing. The telemarketing department will lie about setting up appointments so that they get their bonus but the reality is that there is not a really lead most of the time. This company has become a really badly run operation that over prices the whole pre-need cremation service and screws the customer. I saw enough to write a book on how unethical these people can be and are.
bad,You begin and end your day working like a dog. No one really cares how hard you work. And there is so much work to be completed ASAP. You're bound to make mistakes and fail at what you do. In the end you're either kicked out on the curb or just flee for your life. Not a great environment to grow in. Not a great place. Stay away from there. It's scarey.
bad,"I was hired into what I thought was a great opportunity until i was discriminated against and profiled .Just because you are white and wear red lipstick does not mean you are a pagan and goth."
bad,"I loved my job and the families I got to work with. Unfortunately the management and employees were awful to work with. The job required me to schedule burials, meet with families who just experienced a loss, be outside for long periods of time in all weather conditions and sell graves/headstones. The hardest part was learning how to do all of this at once. There was no formal training and you were expected to learn as you go and to meet a required quota for the month. The co workers were very gossip oriented and cut throat about sales. The most enjoyable part about my job was being thanked by the families I helped."
bad,General Sales Manager micro-manages employees with passive-aggressive tendencies. Commission structure is very confusing. Additional non-sales work is expected of sales staff that results in no compensation. Best way to think of this job is a typical retail sales job where working weekends and holidays are expected.
bad,"This company is horible. 70% attrition rate...low wages...difficult jobs (i.e. Funeral Directors) are treated like minimum wage, disposable pieces of cr*p!"
bad,"Customer Prospect database is useless and out of date."
bad,"My typical day was stressful, the knowledge and skills that we were trained for didn't always relate to the specific job roles, however it was appreciated to have common knowledge of certain policies & procedures for cross training purposes. The work environment was very stressful, and I developed bad anxiety attacks from being under these conditions. The job was beginning to effect my health negatively and I discussed this with management in hopes that things would change for the better, but instead it became worse. The most enjoyable part of my job was leaving....VERY TOXIC ENVIRONMENT."
bad,If you are a person that likes to take advantage of people at the worse time (predator) than this is the place for you. While your add it they will also take advantage of you while providing cheap trips to the best Voltures. They lie to you that’s why there are always open positions in this very intimate of all careers....
bad,"Stay away, there is no career advancement despite what you are told in interviews. You will be disturbed at home no matter your role, the pay is shockingly low compared with other funeral homes in the area."
bad,would not even want to talk aboit it low pay bad commissions seven day work week if you want to make enougt to eat at mcdonalds must go to food pantry for family
bad,"If you older this is definitely not the place for you."
bad,"I was loyal and worked hard for this company for five years and was stabbed in the back by my manager who I use to praise.  He changed after he was promoted to Director, I was the second person he hired when he was the supervisor of this department, and we had a very good relationship.  He became partial to new hires and not his employees that had leverage."
bad,"I can only think of one good thing about this place. I met some amazing family and rekindled old friendships while serving their family at the worst time in their lives. There is poor management, long hours, expect you to be there every weekend and do not compensate you for your time. They promise one pay, then change their mind and pay you differently. If you have a family to feed, do NOT go here to work. The cemetery is beautiful. I'd rest my family there."
bad,"Yuma, Az locations are horrible!!"
bad,You learn a lot in training the first month. Then it becomes the same training weekly and takes up a majority of your time. Little time left for actual work. Time to prospect becomes limited and the pay plan is confusing to say the least. There are some great individuals that work here. They are tied up with tasks to the point that their help is minimal when needed.
bad,Worked for SCI for seven years doing removals and working services. Management is all about themselves and bonuses and company trips. They screw totally some families whike high profile deaths get freebies thrown at them making manager a hero with corporate cash. Let's not start on the cremation prac tices.
bad,Terminated on the spot eith no warning for complying with management requests. Wont return emails or give check stubs.
bad,"Promises about earnings are unrealistic.  Promises about ""warm leads"" are inaccurate, actually 3+ years old and may not have been called, or may be hammered.  Lots of disconnected numbers.  Commissions are low, training spotty and unstructured. Management authoritarian, top down, unprepared."
bad,"Very high turn-over environment. Except for management and a few people here and there, the rest of the staff is contract. Interesting choice for a payroll department"
bad,"Long, long hours with poor compensation.  Very disorganized and little training provided.  Management changed often-except for an office manager who seemed to ""rule the roost"", and should have been the first one to be booted out.  Compensation was fine if you were willing to starve and go months without paying your bills.  Constant push to sell the most expensive products.  Said customer service was most important, but internal service for staff was always lacking.  Partial to a select few who did not abide by rules everyone else had to follow.  Ridiculous place to work.  Go wait tables-you will be much better off."
bad,"These people are vipers.  Was told that as long as families are crying, apply pressure to make sales.  Manager was a liar.  Could not get sales support material and in order to make sales, manager suggested discounts that came from my commission."
bad,"I worked for Dignity for 6 months. Everything that has already been stated is true."
bad,It has been too many years since I left SCI.  Personnel and operations have changed.  I do not believe it would be appropriate to give a review about this company.
bad,"Loved the idea of helping families in their time of need, but this ended up being a money driven, greedy industry with no management direction and ridiculous turn over."
bad,"worked here some years back in the Tampa area,,alot of favoritism and nonsense,low pay,after being on call for 2 nights your expected at work @ 8am,sorry management,alot of buck passing...etc."
bad,Selling Pre- Planning funeral burial arrangements. Training was good. Insurance exam was provided. Great cross training.
bad,"Promised great earnings potential. I was the 15th person hired to fill this position in 3 years. I was hired in August, by the end of September here is the turn-over: Branch manager- fired and replaced; Location manager-transferred and replaced; Office manager- transferred and replaced; Funeral director - fired - job open; Office Cemetery clerk - fired - job open; Family Service Counselor - quit - not making any money; and myself - Family Service Counselor - quit - not making any money. "
bad,"This job was the worst job ever.  I loved the work, don't get me wrong.  But the atmosphere was absolutely ridiculous.  You get run nonstop.  Day and night, and it doesn't matter if you got one call, or 15, you still had to work the next day.  There was never any sympathy or concern with anyone's well being.  Special accommodations were made for one of the director's daughters, they even made a job for her.  If you worked hard and pulled your weight, you would always be called lazy, no matter what.  Forget trying to have a life, you will never have the energy to do anything after working 72-96 hours a week.  Say good bye to your friends, family, and significant others too."
bad,"All lies, from the first interview on. I don't have the payment plan with me, but, one part is something like this:"
bad,"as many others have stated, job is terrible !! Call it sales but all service Job. Avoid Cemetary job !!! Surprised there haven't been class action law suits it is so bad"
bad,"This company makes big money off the dead with not a care for how it financially destroys the families that have to foot the bill for a funeral. Even the ""inexpensive"" options can run $2600 or more.  "
bad,"This place is a horror to work for. It is ALL about making a buck for corporate management bonuses. Employees are as disposale as a used tissue.I work in sales and every day I hear telephone conversations of corporate management screaming and yelling at local managers. Local managers, in effort to please corporate management, threaten and belittle sales people. They are not honest about compensation - even encouraged not to bring it up while recruiting. Honestly, you will never make any serious money. You might get lucky every now and then and get a decent sale, but this is never going to be consistent. Nothing is realistic about this place. Nothing. Training is pathetic. They will lie, cheat, steal and throw an employee under a bus simply to avoid accountablity or misconduct as a company. Employee turnover, especially in sales, is crazy. Horribly understaffed. Sales people are overworked and exhausted. There is no such thing as a 40 hr week. Over 50 hrs is the norm, and the majority of that time is in non-income producing tasks.  THIS IS THE TRUTH. I wish I had listened to the reviews I read and not wasted my time. Now I feel stuck. This place is not worthy of talented, professional, honest employees. Please think seriously before working here. This place will kill you."
bad,"1. You are expected to work 7 days a week, to include conference calls after 8:00 pm."
bad,"Ask the funeral home if they are privately owned or owned by SCI. shop around there are huge differences in pricing, quality and detail."
bad,"I was there 3 months.  Every Family Service Counselor was rude, they stated every family was there's making it difficult to generate sales.  The manager is an angry hostile individual.  Very little pay, training, and leadership."
bad,"DO NOT work for this company, they are only interested on the bottom line. Long hours, minimum pay with ZERO guranatee of a sale. Wait on families in their time of need and expected to sell them funeral services and cemetery property (pre-need) within days of their loss....no support to the family"
bad,This is by far the worst company to work for! Their pay structure and goals are too hard to achieve month after month and all you end up making is minimum wage!
bad,They have no morals nor ethics.... all they are concerned about is there bottom line.. You will work and work and work some more. RUN .. RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!
bad,This company profits from free labor (100% commissioned sales counselors) or extremely under paid counselors who make $8.00 per hour. However they have problems collecting their over time pay. Be extremely cautious with the company. Their retension rate is 6% for sales nationally.
bad,Seemed decent at first but soon got tired of the same issues daily at my location. Mainly being no organization due to foreman and getting paperwork for graves same day; sometimes so late that we had to dig in front of family's. This affected the set ups and quality of service and added alot of stress. I spent half my days reorganizing van's and trucks trying to track down tools we used almost daily but he couldn't seem to just put things in there place.
bad,"Don't even think about it!  Management is as crooked as the day is long. If you are successful, they will eventually cut your commission.  Absolutely incompetent imbeciles are running the show.  They will try to get you to lie to the elderly.  Despicable!"
bad,"Hires sales people promising huge commissions. In reality, it takes a long time to start building business and it takes several months to get insurance license and other certifications."
bad,"I was hired under false pretenses: told I had a base pay (which you only have if you don't make any sales, and then it has to be paid back later), told I would only work every 4th weekend (they require work every weekend if you are not 'pacing'), told that walk in sales would meet my quota (I will just insert ha ha here). Management cares about you for the first month or so, then they virtually disappear. As a service counselor you are just cheap labor."
bad,Work life balance is challenging. Management could be tough due to favoritism. A lot of gossiping goes on so it's hard to trust management and upper management.  Upper management could be very disrespectful. More training is needed for upper management on how to properly lead and coach others inspite of his or her differences.
bad,"After joining the team, I was placed into management in OKC during training. I was given the title of Assistant Sales Manager. The only issue is that there was no sales manager above me. I led my own team, ran meetings, set goals, and did everything as a manager. During my time, there multiple sales managers hired at other locationns. My GM’s were overwhelmed with multiple locations, however when they were available they were great to work with. I personally oversaw three locations during my time. But again was just the assistant and was not compensated for the work. Any ideas were looked down upon. Training was to catch people during their hardest time and have them purchase their own plans. The sales process began as soon as they walked in the door whether they were there to plan their own future or get things handled for a recently passed loved one. There are some great people who work within Dignity, but the company as whole is a snake pit."
bad,"SCI sells what is called a lawn crypt. It is a pre installed concrete vault , with drainage. The sells team , leads the family to believe these lawn crypts will not hold water , and that any water that does get in will drain out the preinstalled drain system. By theory , this is true. But they dont bother to tell the purchasers that SCI installed an inferior drain system that does repeatedly fail. I personally expirienced the drain failure on 3 different occasions when I was employeed there. Two of the times I was able to fix the drains and get them draining again. The last time was after a 5 year drought in our area. When the drought finally ended , it rained for 2 weeks straight. Set record rain fall in wichita falls. The lawn crypts were flooded and We couldnt get them to drain like we had before. The GM at the time , instructed me to not report this to corporate. He said we dont need cprporate sending in engineers and corporate people snooping in our business. After months of dealing with totally flooded vaults in the Garden of Cross , I went to the GM one more time and told himwe had to report this and get it fixed. He told me to not call corporate until I was ready to lose my job. At this time I had been the superinitindent at this SCI location for 37 years. I could no longer sit by and see families being buried in these vaults  , not to mention the hundreds that were already interred there , and completley under water. So I called someone I knew in human resources and told hin what was going on, and the GM would not report it or let me. He flew into town under false pretense"
bad,"Very stressful due to lack of structured training."
bad,"The only thing these people care about or understand is money.  They will charge a grieving family as much as they can during their time of need without the slightest bit of remorse.  Don't be fooled into thinking someone here cares about you.  They try to generate as much money as they can without appealing to morality, ethics or conscience.  With so many other options in the Lincoln area for funeral services why would you want to come here and be charged much more than other places?"
bad,Senior management only cares about their Stock Options and what benefits them.  They do not care about work life balance only taking care of individuals in senior management.
bad,"You would be better off avoiding working for SCI. Austin is not a good market to work for. The whole corporation is completely corrupt. Employees are extremely underpaid unless you have dirt on management, which there is plenty of."
bad,"Truly enjoyed working there (Rosehill Cemetery), but it lacked the push for growth within the company at this particular location. Poor pay for what the job entailed."
bad,This company says it is about compassion. Not true it is about money. Staff is poorly trained. Company overly concerned about ten appts. per week rather than delivering comprehensive service. Workplace culture was decent colleagues helped one another for most part. Some were deceitful and would stab you. Hardest part of job was trying to overcome obstacles that management put in the way. It was stressed to account for your lunch time yet taking it was highly discouraged. Compensation cannot be proved for accuracy due to a convoluted structure. Management is able to go in and make splits to their choosing. I would not recommend this company/place to anyone.
bad,"Revenue is more important to the company than the employees welfare. Employees are just a number, not important and replaceable at any time. Each location manager makes their own rules to serve their purposes and whims. I would not recommend it at all."
bad,"Paid is below market.  Have to do a lot of other activities not related to sales, being sales the main objective.  I have learned how to help people to make decision for their future funeral arrangements. Got a lot of experience about funerals an cemeteries. The management put too much pressure and does not give motivation to any employee. The co-workers are all good persons and hard workers.  It is hard to sell a product that is 35% more expensive than the competition.  I really enjoyed helping the families and guide them to make the best decision for their future funeral and cemetery arrangements."
bad,Not a good place.  Management expects too much as far as sales go and make you extra hours with no pay. They have call night twice a week where you are on the clock but not paid since everything is all commission.  Not good.
bad,"It is a overprice company that has a monopoly on the funeral business. Many of the employees are good people with the wrong company. It operations are ran and coordinated well, but everything is driven by profit comes back to increasing profits by inflating the cost of a funeral service. The price of a funeral at this company is three to five times higher than most funeral homes."
bad,"I have been appalled how management at our location has treated the grounds techs."
bad,"Recent example - last month SCI location Rose Hills in Whittier, California sent a message to all of their Park Services employees which said, in essence - ""Mandatory meeting, now!"" When they showed up they were informed that they were all fired and were being replaced by a contracted company (no need to provide benefits; fewer personnel on site to help families). They each received about 3 weeks severance pay and that was that. Some of these people had worked there for many years. One of them, a friend of mine, is devastated. No warning, no notice. But no one familiar with the company is surprised; standard operating procedure. The biggest number in this review if ZERO, as in job security."
bad,"Still trying to figure out how Management personnel sleep at night. I have never witnessed a more deceptive and narcissistic representation of management. "
bad,"No work life balance. You work 27 days out of the month."
bad,Very poor management.  Turnover is often.  Everyone feels they are on the chopping block from time to time.  Unreasonable demands and expectations are made of all employees.
bad,I worked for Sci at Hampton Vaughn the superintendent is racist he talks to like your stupid then gets a attitude if u put him in his place they do not pay 13 dollars a hr thats a lie they do not let u advance they slave u and refuse to help you do not work here they rarely give you breaks sometimes you don't even get lunch and the rules don't apply to minorities worst job i had in my life.
bad,"Not what I expected. Very poor management to begin with. There is no real leadership (even though the managers think they’re leaders). Very poor communication and complete process inconsistency. High pressure sales which makes it difficult  to help families which is what I thought I was doing. The culture lacks any real moral ethics - there is gossip, backstabbing, etc"
bad,"I was job offered, we agreed upon wages, benefits, bonuses & paid time off. It was all just a smoke screen! "
bad,I applied for the job as a family service counselor and they advertised pay 50- 70 thousand a year .I worked there for 8 months and didn't make much more than minimum wage although I did have a couple good months the pay was not what they advertised I felt like they were dishonest during the interview process.
bad,"Dysfunctional management without a marketing strategy or business plan. You will not get the tools you need to succeed, paid minimum wage and expected to pay your own gas for client appointments or meetings and use your own cell phone without being reimbursed. Impossible to meet the ever changing quota and paid any commission. Very stressful work environment. The expectations of the employer did not meet my ethics."
bad,"Typical work day consist of being both a hunter sales person as well as an administrative multi-tasker.  The company seems to reward bad behavior as long as the numbers are reached. "
bad,"All the things we despise in a work environment. Bullying, harassment, relentless pressure to perform. Managers are past funeral directors with no management skills whatsoever."
bad,"Yes, this is just another sweatshop company where your labor will benefit someone other than you.  Management will pay you as little as they can get away with because they have virtually no respect for anyone other than themselves.  Do yourself a favor and get a real job where you'll be appreciated and paid what you're worth.  They tell you you'll get 401K with a company match, but you have to work there three years first.  Anyone giving this dump five stars is just a company shill"
bad,Absolutely horrible place to work. Stealing deals right out from under you - giving them to other favored people - don't do it! They treat you like an employee but you're nothing more than an indentured servant. Leads are garbage.
bad,"Not a place for work/life balance.Management made it very difficult to take vacation time or sick days.  Always threatened at work by management."
bad,"I chose not to review this company. Great location with deli in the basement.  Garage parking so your car is not setting in the sum all day. Don't have enough staff in benefits to deal with 28,000 employees."
bad,Free leads but you need to call 10-15 to get 1 appointment. Spent more in gas than I made in commissions. Working with low income seniors that could not afford product.  Very difficult to make a living with such low commission no residuals and many expenses.  I do not recommend this job to anyone that has a family.
bad,"All I can say is the management is terrible. Most people work in the funeral industry to help people, but SCI as a whole does not exemplify that mission; pure corporate greed!"
bad,"Cutthroat sales approach. Disregarded people's personal emergencies, etc. For example, Senior Execs once forced me to retract and approved vacation from a top sales manager the day before his family vacation because the Market Directed wanted to hit her bonus so she wanted all managers selling and working around the clock till month end. The bonus did not extend down to lower level managers. This sort of thing would happen all the time. It was hard to stomach."
bad,"Run do not walk from this company. They promise to be able to keep you busy with fresh leads but nothing could be further from the truth. They do no research into the areas they mail to so you end up working inner city leads, most of which are old. They encourage you to call your leads morning, afternoon and night, which is borderline stalking. If the management had any clue as to what they are doing, this would be a great 1099 job. When seasoned sales pros only can average a sale or two a week, you know the leads are not good. Too bad they could do so much better."
bad,"Would never recommend the Mt. View location in San Bernardino, California.  The employees are mean and cliquish.  One of the new girls who worked in the Admin office told me she would go home and cry every night.  I had the same experience.  I could not wait to get out of that place."
bad,Management lies to employees. They tell you one thing and do the exact opposite. Upper management doesn't value their employees opinions. Tons of dishonesty from management.
bad,"SCI in San Antonio, Sunset Memorial Park and Funeral Home was a great place to work. Great people in administration, funeral directors and counselors."
bad,"I was hired from outside the industry. Started selling cars in 1998 and worked my way up to being a general sales manager and then general manager in the retail automotive industry."
bad,Overworked and underpaid. No chance for real advancement. No good management team and no formal training or SOP given upon beginning work there
bad,"They hire lots of contract workers. They are cheap and do not want to pay benefits. Very few permanent positions. The turnover is very high. It is a very profitable business but the money stays with the big wigs. It does not trickle down. "
bad,Management and some co-workers were terrible to work with. Expectation for amount of training given were way tooooo much.
bad,"Two managers offered me a position as a sales representative. I waited 6 weeks so I could start training. The second manager said I would start training in 5 days. 2 days prior to training and waiting 6 weeks, she calls me and tells me that they aren't going to bring me on board after all. I had already spent money on marketing because I had heard from several others that the leads were few and stale, often earning the reps $250 per week. Turns out that the manager brought on a friend instead. The manager that hired me and kept me waiting for 6 weeks, was promoted to regional manager. After I wrote him an email stating that I trusted him and his word, telling him during those 6 weeks that I needed the money, he never even had the professionalism or courtesy to respond. This from someone who is now a Regional Manager. Wow!"
bad,Company not employee friendly. No structure. Some of the managers need management training and how to treat employees.
bad,"Be ready to work 70+ hours a week in sales! The culture around the funeral home is extremely negative and the admin staff has their own view on how things should work. If they like you, then your good. If you fall on their bad grace, they will do everything that they can do to force you out the door. Some of the people are very nice. Though for the most part each is out for their themselves. Be cautious since there is no training, no support, and no mentor to assist you. It's learn on your own, and if you don't do it within 90 days your out the door."
bad,I was a former sales manager brought on because of my management and sales experience. No training - over promised and under delivered. Very high turnover with sales counselors. Aggressive sales tactics for a vulnerable time in people's lives. No support!!!!! Health insurance most expensive I have ever seen for a company sponsored health plan employing people at minimum wage. Revolving door.
bad,"The product I sell is great. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to make a living. You get company provided leads. You are expected to continue to call, even if you’ve called 100 times. The pay structure is very poor. The regional manager can not be trusted. There’s flexibility in your schedule. It’s a great job, if you don’t need to make a living and just want something to do."
bad,"A typical day started at 7a and emails would be the first priority. Then move on to missed calls, new requisitions, source, phone screen, send offers, etc. Management was the only thing that was making the office culture degrade."
bad,"Big company that only care about money. If you don’t kiss butt you won’t advance. They market that they care about the family, but in reality train and have quotas for employees to SALE SALE SALE. Not much caring to me."
bad,"I worked in one location for a month and a half. At first my manager was great, but then became unsupportive, combative and unreliable. There was little on site training. They send you away for 2 weeks to go to sales school, but you don’t really learn anything about what you are doing on a daily basis. They pay minimum wage or commission only. If you don’t make commission you only get minimum wage. Very hard to get sales unless they walk in."
bad,I worked there for several years and the pace is fast and the stress levels are very high for the amount of pay you receive. Benefits are good. Prices that they charge customers is out of site as well.
bad,"Working for SCI largely depends on who your manager is and the people you work with. The job can be deeply rewarding; after all, you're meeting with clientele during their time of need. That being said, upper management looks out for no one but themselves. I loved my job with SCI, but in reality, the corporation largely doesn't care about the associates it employs."
bad,"You go into peoples homes as a sales rep and try to sell them on cremation packages.  The leads are mainly old, but either way it is a hard sell on a product they can get much cheaper other places locally. You are preying on the elderly.  The management is hard core.  Numbers every day. Need sales every day.  In cleveland, the reps are independent contractors, we had to tell them they would make more money than was humanly possible.  Unethical at best."
bad,Poor management onsite. Only cared about sales/quotas. NO work-life balance. Next to no administrative support. Family service counselors are over-worked & under appreciated.
bad,"They require you to do many things that aren't paid except for minimum wage. You call off of old lists that other salespeople are calling from and getting any good leads is very political. The environment is good but you can't make a living. They take out 10% of your income for the first $50,000 you earn in case there are reversals in the future and when you leave they keep your money for a year which is probably not legal. You are not told this when you are first hired. There are many reasons why there employee turnover is so high so don't do it unless you are completely desperate."
bad,"sales training consisted of door to door solicitation. little to no training on what the actual role was intended to be, which was to offer options to families after having lost a loved one."
bad,Management is always wanting the sales team to go against each other over and over. Makes things very uncomfortable. Im always trying to ignore it but you only get in trouble from there
bad,"Biggest mistake I have ever made in my career!  I had a GM that had no business being in management.  I had no training from her, all the training I received came from the funeral director that had been with the company for several years.  If an idea was not her idea, then it was a bad idea.  I felt as if I were back in high school, if you were in the click; all was alright. Lots of back-stabbing by a very insecure, ineffective manager."
bad,"Run from SCI!! Especially the Corporate Office in Houston. The top executives get all the bonuses when the employees are the ones making them the money. All the while put freezes on raises. Unreal place to work for. Work Work Work just to get laid off so that they could purchase another Corp. airplane. For some reason, the executives are not even able to fly FIRST CLASS commercial airlines. Must have private jets. "
bad,"Leads were hard to find and once found, you would lose them to other team members  a lot of back stabbing!  No training !  Poor sales management.  No room fo grow.  Play favorites"
bad,"Tough environment for an administrator"
bad,Misled by management from the first day. Basically cold calling people to try and sell them a funeral costing anywhere from $3500 to $1500. The entire management team misleads all employees then pressures them to make ridiculous sales.
bad,"Management harps about how important families are while taking advantage of these same families by charging them as much as they can for their services.  Make no mistake about it: the only thing that matters to this particular funeral home and the company that owns it is money.  They pay their employees as little as possible so that some guy in a suit gets his year end bonus.  The superintendent, who paints his toenails red, is wholly consumed with moving up the ladder and getting his nice, cushy office job as he calls it.  If there is a death in the family, do yourself a favor and save a lot of money by having your loved ones buried somewhere else."
bad,While working behind the scenes at Service Corporation International I was able to realize the incredible amount of profit that this organization revenues. Witnessed upper-level sales executives receiving extremely large salaries while their compensation only sales-reps struggle to survive. It was sad. How can a salesperson wholeheartedly service a family when their monthly sales quota hangs over their head?
bad,I believe the company is headed into a downward trajectory . I lack confidence in the leadership and strategy of this company after working for them for 4 1/2 years.
bad,"I worked in the Knoxville Market and believe me when I say, it has the worst management team I have experienced! They are extremely short handed and I am surprised that I even came across a job posting for them. This is a ""Good-Ol-Boys"" Club and If you are not willing to work in that kind of environment then you will  not succeed here. I was the only person at my location and was expected to do the job of at least 2 people. I was there for 2 years and went through 4 management changes. I was expected to meet a quota, help walk in guest and handle problems that a manager should have handled.On my days off I would still get calls from outside funeral directors because there was no one else who could help them. I loved helping people but I did not love the stress that came with the job due to poor management. I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy."
bad,"Management was horrible, the team environment was not good and the pay was not great at all.  I did not learn much being here, it consider it a very bad company overall"
bad,"Loved working with the families, hated working for this company.  Very cut-throat.  Management does not really care for their employees and are only interested in the bottom dollar.  There is absolutely no sense of job security what so ever."
bad,"Employees come in early for over time at their own discretion without supervision"
bad,Unfair unstable environment    No job security. I would not recommend to someone looking for long term professionals. Typical corporate games. Be smart. Be safe. And watch out for yourself
bad,Dealing with families that have lost loved ones. Helping them prepare their final wishes on the funeral side and cemetery.
bad,Undeserving of a review
bad,"- Poor training"
bad,Management was only in communication with few employees regularly. Attempting to get your insurance license is the most stressful part of the job. Expects you to use your own phone and vehicle to complete your job but doesn’t reimburse you.
bad,"I was hired as the location manager and funeral director for Neptune society. I was the first funeral director/manager in this location. They fired me after 13 months as they said I wasn’t “growing the business”. The problem is they won’t spend the money to advertise on television and other media. How can one person “grow the business” to make the money they want after 14 months at a brand new location? They threaten the directors with termination if they don’t meet their ideals for a location to have. I was a member of chamber of commerce, rotary, Kiwanis, VFW, spent THOUSANDS of dollars on PR, hosted an open house, had a hospice nurses appreciation day, spent thousands of dollars with hospice in the Cincinnati area, and after this location being open 13 months they fire me, I had 44 cremations in one year but that  wasn’t enough."
bad,"This place SUCKED and had no real interest in their customers. All they wanted was their money. This is a funeral business and they would say or do anything to upsell grieving families anything they could all the while pretending to care. Not to mention, the place and people were just plain creepy."
bad,"Nothing good to say.  Management was awful, at-need families were disproportionately assigned by management, lack of cooperation between at-need and pre-need departments."
bad,"Worked in maintenance for 9 years. Earlier management was fair and open for the most part. Sales is treated with dinner twice a week while maintenance gets a ""good boy,get biscuit "" reward for dealing with elements and poorly trained sales. I have worked for 5 gm in my time there, all with different perspective on how things are to be  done. 3rd party maintenance is ok but if they don't get something done it's up to cemetery personnel to correct. Sold off most of equipment and not replaced. All ways got something in shop being repaired. Trying to get proper equipment is like pulling teeth. Went from 5 maintenance at each park to 3 at each park even though some cemeteries have 4 per park."
bad,Very money oriented company treated people like cattle. Very disrespectful and uncaring. Most recently I have seen them put a funeral home in next to a Jersey Mike Sub shop how undignified is that.They will do anything to get your money. I had horrible things go on under their supervision and nothing was ever done when I reported things. Terrible company.
bad,Zero training other than memorizing scripts. Unreal expectations. Management not held accountable. Everything falls back on the counselors while the managers sit back and watch.
bad,"The person highest in the local chain is a total pompous racist with no qualms at all about saying inappropriate things to his employees. The pay is a joke and the hours are horrendous. I was exhausted by the time I left. The accounting department is now being managed by a total idiot, too."
bad,"I had to wait 6 months to be paid. "
bad,Management does not treat employees equally. Taking on more responsibility does not pay off. Expectations from management are very exaggerated and create an oppressive work environment. Management is not held accountable. Employee concerns are addressed with excuses instead of solutions. If a manager does offer a solution they do not follow through with it.  This creates a sense that employees are not valued here.
bad,Dignity Memorial provides pre planned funeral arrangements for families and also does funerals and cemetery arrangements for people in need. The upper management seems to be focused too much on maximizing profits and too little focused on the families being serviced.
bad,I've been with the company over 5 years now and there is absolutely no room for growth. They will keep you in the same low paying position until you basically quite. The market manager is as cheap as they can come and won't expand employee's where they are needed. Most employees are extremely negative and no longer show any form of sympathy or respect for the emotional distress loved ones are going through.
bad,The people at the individual locations we often very good to work with and many of them cared about their job but the over all company mentality was not about caring for the families of the deceased it was about making a much money as possible. I found the prevailing attitude disgusting. They used every avenue possible to capitalize on the grieving and charge exorbitant fees.
bad,"The products and services sold by the company are more expensive than other competitors offer, making if very difficult to close deals.  Other than that they have a decent approach except that a lack of a draw against commission tells us that they have high turnover and that others have had the same issues I had."
bad,The higher up management for SCI  succkkks! I absolutely loved my actual manager and everyone that I worked with..well besides one guy. But the higher up corporate guys ruined this job for me. I LOVED it there till corporate got involved
bad,Total Chaos most of the time. Constant shuffling of all personnel. Constantly changing pricing. Everything is a moving target. Almost zero cooperation between pre-need sales and funeral homes/cemeteries. Local locations treat pre-need sales as the competition.
bad,Why would you pay full price for a funeral so someone else can laugh all the way to the bank?  These people don't care about you.  You work hard all your life to scratch out a living and this place put you back in the poor house with all these outrageously overpriced fees.  Take back your financial freedom and go somewhere else
bad,This place will kill you...turn around now.  There is a small group of cherished employees who have no ethics and no one else matters.  Horrible quality of life.
bad,"This company only cares about sales, not the ability to retain qualified funeral directors to care for the people when the need arises. The embalmers are overworked and grossly underpaid. Upper management is extensive. Too many managers. Waste a lot of money rebranding."
bad,The most important thing about the company is its people. But I must admit the benefits and discounts to the associates and family are huge considering the price point of death care.
bad,"Lots of promises will be told to an Independent Sales Representative.  The leads you will be getting, the money you will be making, and the training you will be receiving.  Sadly, none of this is true. You will not get the leads promised or make any money because of the way they have it structured, this is a very part time job at best.  If you are looking to be a glorified telemarketer than this will work for you as they will put a lot of pressure on harassing people for appointments from cards they have sent in requesting information.  There is no management support and the structure is set up so that you really can never make your five sales per pay period to get the full commission.  Works out great for Neptune and terrible for an ISR."
bad,"What was explained to me in the interview process is not at all what I found once hired on. The manager that I had knew nothing about the contracts and how to write them. He spent 2 hours in the office on a good day, and the whole time he was there he just played on the internet. If you have a large network of people that could use these services you could do very well. The commissions are very good, but if you hae no funnel to get leads from it is a very hard and stressful job."
bad,This is a wealthy organization that is cheap and doesn't invest in a person. Stay away.
bad,"Need more time to focus on outside sales. Instead you are left hunting and pecking for old burial cards that might contain a current phone and not one from 1942. The sales people should be ale to focus on sales. Instead, they are to attend to other duties like finding graves and flagging them, helping families find their loved ones. And, on and on and on. Take complaints as well."
bad,"Stressful environment. Poor management. Low pay, no raises. No job security. Persuade elderly people to buy burial plots.  High interest rates. Up charge for everything."
bad,"other sales is hostile if you make big sale or trying to steal from you."
bad,I learned a great deal about the cemetary & mortuary business and how to pre-plan a funeral. This was an ideal position in that it was helping people at a difficult time however it was very competitive and management was not supportive when a difficult situation occured. Typically they wanted female employees to knock on doors which I personally found unadvisable and was not told when I was hired.
bad,"Not a great place to work if you have no skills in terms of sales. This place relies heavily on prospecting."
bad,"Terrible company, horrible management and incredibly low pay. They claim to hire from within but the last several managers that were hire came from outside sources."
bad,"People don’t buy the product /service on a regular basis. It takes years to generate a consistent pay from month to month.  Very long sales cycle."
bad,"Management is subpar."
bad,"the job is fun but the compensation is low, a lot of marketing very little help with leads. training is almost non existent, very hard to get help from management when help is needed immediately."
bad,"Basically worked for free.  Sat with families who lost love ones to arrange for the graveside services. Did not get paid for those hours with them. Only got paid according to sales in insurance. So again, no pay Get in for a mandatory time in the arrangement rooms with families to discuss graveside services. That was not a sales service… That was a service families paid for at the time, called at-need."
bad,"The manager doesn't care about hourly wage workers. People went years without any raises while sales people were making alot of money for the company. "
bad,Company focus is on sales - no work life balance. Commission pay structure is unfair and you are required to work all major national holidays which means you are unable to spend quality time with your family.
bad,"Sell, sell and sell some more is the mentality. Little to no support as far as outreach/marketing. Call people from files that are decades old, have been called for years and usually already own property and products with us.  Work every weekend (mandatory) unless you've met your almost unattainable sales quota. For most people there is no future in this. Lots of work with little compensation."
bad,I did not get any training in the time I was with the company. I think because of the structure of the way the company is set up it is everyone for them selves. I do not want to work in a company like that. It is alright for some people but not for me.
bad,"A typical day at SCI was persons coming into the office for burial services, but had no idea of the extent that the services required. Most persons that came into the office did not have an idea of what the cost or the details needed for burials at this facility."
bad,I really did enjoy helping families but the in place management was lazy and unable or unwilling to give any training for in-house processes or procedure.  Osmosis was the term I heard for gaining information. Other Sales Reps were not inclined to groom their competition in the Sales dept and in many situations were hostile and threatening.  Sales Mgr was a super nice guy but too busy with his personal life and sports talk with the other male rep to develop new employees.
bad,"look elsewhere- high stress low pay-terrible management- not interested in changing processes only personnel, everyone works in different directions no team efforts."
bad,"Very high pressure job.  Unfortunately management has no desire to help their families, its all about money. My typical day at work was to take care of families who have often times lost a loved one. It was gratifying to know you have done your best for the family. My co-workers were the best, they all cared. The worst part is the pressure to make a ridiculously high quota or be let go."
bad,"A necessity of life and death."
bad,"If you literally want to ruin your marriage, relationship, individual self being, etc. Then definitely come to work here. Just about everyone that works there is divorced or single or an alcoholic because its such a demanding job and they could give two craps about you if you have an emergency. They expect you to work. And be ready to work 60+ hours a week day and night and get no sleep yet still get in trouble if you're late to work. Have fun ruining your life."
bad,They do not have a good training program or a mentoring program and they’re not a veteran friendly company I thought they should’ve had weekly sales meetings and work more one on one with you to learn the business and to do more in the communities with the veterans with the hospitals and churches within our community
bad,A stressful environment as a result of management's mistreatment of the employee. The treatment of the employee is not pleasant and there is a great lack of respect on the part of management.
bad,"The management played favorites. Usually preferred employees who would go drinking after work. Didn't trust employees who wouldn't socialize after hours.  I was a woman in a male dominated department.  I was there almost 11 years starting as a receptionist and working up to IT analyst. I was laid off with about 16 other IT employees for no particular reason but corporate office said they had to cut the IT budget.  But the highest paying, least working men stayed. Did not even get a decent severance package."
bad,"The job was very depressing. Most funeral homes i went visit, the employees were very unhappy with their jobs because of the company. There was no balance between work and home."
bad,"They expect you to fix every call, and do so in 8 minutes. Which means 32 calls per day, and then on top of doing calls you are expected to take chats at the same time. These chats are done through LogMeIn.com, but... the description of the issue doesn't always match to what the issue actually is, and then you end up with a huge issue on your phone and a huge issue in the chat, and management doesn't care. LogMeIn.com always had issues and if I would reboot the computer, it wouldn't let me back in, and I would have to start another session. I told management and they blamed me.  If you have to call the person that's on the chat then management gets on your butt, and says something like that defeats the purpose of chats... At first it was a minimum of 1 chat a day, and then it was 2 chats a day or more. If you have ever done helpdesk support, you know that it's not easy just doing calls, but when you mix a web chat in the mix wanting you to devote your time to them too, it's to much. Also, the customers call IT support, and treat you like you are a secretary. ""Transfer me to HR, Transfer me to payroll"" Nobody there knows anything about their own company. It's very stressful. I was a contractor there for over 2 years and the company was NEVER planning on hiring me. I got tired of feeling like I couldn't please anyone, and I am really glad that this job is over."
bad,"As an office manager i was only making $12 an hour. With high stress and demands, and the lack of willing to hire much needed office help. They prefer to over load a few employees then to hire an extra hand."
bad,"Management is unqualified and poorly trained. They are constantly playing a game of stabbing each other in the back and if you aren't willing to play along you get less than favorable treatment. The death care industry should always be about putting the families we serve first, but they make it near impossible to do the right thing while also supporting yourself."
bad,"I loved what I did. Don't get me wrong. Working with the families that came in became the highlight of my job. Helping them through the difficulties. "
bad,Management is just money hungry and can care less about  employees .The Higher ups are worried about bonuses and making sure checks are being deposited daily this is there main concern. They  do not really care about employees they hire and fire on the go. Very negative work environment
bad,"Impossibe if you rely completely on the company's marketing and leads, possible if you have a strong network.  Commission sales, flexible schedule, fantastic company to represent but long history of shuffling sales people in and out and seeing what works.  Great training but lacking in technique of selling something few want to think about or buy."
bad,"Great co-workers who strive to service families at the time of need.  However, this is a 100% pure sales job with quotas on funeral sale and cemetery property.  Only 2 weekends off a month and no holidays off.  Typical work days are 10-12 hours.  No overtime pay.  Hourly wage is below minimum wage.  Commissions are paid for funeral and cemetery sales."
bad,The branch is poorly managed. Intimadation and many hours try to replace professional management.
bad,For a job that requires compassion this comoany and the managmnet have zero. The company is about the botton line and the management needs to up grade their skills in communication and compassion.
bad,"I work at a cemetery only location. I don't feel the Corporation really cares about anything other than it's Funeral Home industry. The cemetery is completely different from the funeral home they refuse to acknowledged it. They need to remember this is a new era. They have to help there FSC by advertising radio, tv, YouTube adds."
bad,"Unless you are management (with a title) or in sales you are nobody to this company. You have to do all the work for the above mentioned ""titled"" employees but you will receive no recognition for your work. The pay is barely above minimum wage."
bad,"Expected to work extra hours two days a week. Expected to run operations of office with the ""benefit"" of being exposed to families who could purchase. This is more of a sales job than counselor job. Mangers chosen to supervise are brow beaten by upper management. Those managers are difficult and usually micro-manage along with putting pressure on you about quota. You get vacation time, but when and if you take it you are reminded that you are not on quota. when you return you still have to make quota for the month. The pay is awful. Minimum wage if you don't make quota and after your health benefits are taken out you come home with checks under a couple of hundred dollars for two weeks. Then, if they pay you the minimum wage, as a draw they take it back when you do write contracts And speaking of contracts, if one cancels you pay for it. Not just for say 6 months...but forever. So if you return to the company and a contract you wrote 5 years ago cancels, you get the cancellation just like you never left the company. If you like standing in the elements, working on call for services, and up-selling families at the worse time of their lives...this job is for you. You will not be appreciated for the talent you bring to the company or any ideas you may have to improve your local operation. And be ready to memorize scripts. They continue to recycle has-been, wanna- be- salesmen between front line sales and front line managers. So if you enjoy being told that you can ""get another job"" at every sales meeting...this job is for you.What needs to change: Better pay and restructure of"
bad,Unfortunately when it comes to top tier management there's no diversity at all.  When it comes to promotions you definitely have to be apart of the club.  Tons of top producers being management by sales managers with little to none experience in the funeral home or cemetery industry.
bad,"GM avoids confrontation at all cost. Will not deal with or provide resources to deal with unacceptable employees. Was fired and given 3 reasons as to the cause of termination in a letter, all 3 were a lie to try and avoid paying unemployment benefits. Family service sales staff sheduke services without consideration or discussion with maintenance staff. Work long hours and weekends. Equipment was junk and impossible to get replaced. Cut the maintenance staff down to skeleton crew. Refused to hire enough staff. Over all the place was a joke. It’s a job but definitely not a career."
bad,Really wished being a funeral director paid more but it pays less than most retail jobs. Working for the largest corporation is really about sales and its like any other corporate sales environment.
bad,Little training accompanied by high expectations.  A tremendous amount of travel out of pocket with no reimbursement. The concept of what is provided is overall good however the benefit to the employees is poor.
bad,"Dealing with people who have lost someone and now they are forced to spend a pile of money on frivolous things the funeral industry has created and made traditional to use, fancy expensive caskets and more..."
bad,"This is sales. If you can work on your own and even sell ice to an Eskimo than this is the job for you. You can't count on management really even though they may say they are for you. Everyone is looking out for their numbers and to get paid. Also, tough business. You become the reminder that we all die someday and may even come across greedy trying to make a sale off of that or someone's loss. It can become overwhelming."
bad,"Company benefits went up, quotas for sales skyrocketed over my time and my income decreased by 15% a year! Change of management was created due to longevity for some and politics for most of the younger people being recruited! No loyalty to the older and seasoned sales professionals! They only looked at the bottom line for Wall Street!"
bad,Manager gave leads/appts to other counselors that had been inputted in sales force. Drive for quota but no assistance or guidance to get there. Purely self generated leads.
bad,Extremely and difficult position working with families when a loved one passes.Managment always have you under the gun to produce numbers.Especially Calvary Hill location. Their motto is compassion caring.But it's more bout Commission caring.Fellow employees great to work with.Long hours
bad,"Typical day would  be meeting with sales people and managing activity. This is not an organization that has any sales management development to offer its managers. Upper management is not interested in creating a culture that is conducive for a foundation for growth or success. Co-workers are great people who really want to make a good living. the hardest part of the job is dealing with working in an environment that does not support its sales leaders. it is a sales environment that is led by operations people who lack knowledge or desire to invest in their own business. they want high results with little or no investment in their markets future."
bad,"The hours of the day could be long, past 10 to 12 hours or more to complete the work. Short lunch breaks usually. In my location no overtime allowed only comp time and was hard to make up. Co-workers were friendly, but mostly only did their own tasks. The Staff in most locations has been cut back to keep the ""bottom line"". So there was some ""severe multi tasking"" needed by the Director. This was becoming the norm from years gone by. "
bad,Nothing good or bad to say about this company. Company is all about profits. Not a fair playing field for earning a good income. The local sales managers are overworked and constantly worry about their job security.
bad,"No room for advancement"
bad,"Corporate management is poor.  Mid-level management is poor.  Management at the local funeral homes is great.  Upper managment is not very supportive.  They write you off very quickly and do not give much coaching.  They value the types of people that run people off.  They do not value loyalty.  "
bad,"Care center management is focused on numbers and saving money, rather than care and quality. "
bad,I have been in this business a long time but they were the worst. It was ethic reasons. I was never paid as promised. They did not provide the training needed for that territory.
bad,This company has so much to offer and I believe in some markets may actually be a good place to work. It is not in central Florida.  Area manager is out of touch and promotes a poor culture that breeds dissension and poor workplace atmosphere.
bad,not happy with company.  Management is very disrespectful and negative.  Creates a very negative work environment.  Talks down to employees and treats them like a number not a person.  Turnover in the sales area is 70%
bad,"The work schedule was not properly detailed in the interview."
bad,"We worked with 3 managers in less than a year. Our team as it was 6 years ago does not exist. One by one members kept leaving, mostly because of lack of good leadership and no management. "
bad,"Neptune has a great product, and it is something that many people should have. With that said, the company is misguided in helping the ISRs with sales leads, organizing ways to create business, and overall support."
bad,"I am in a 100% commission sales position.  It is incredibly stressful.  Management is constantly badgering us about hitting quota because if WE don't, then THEY don't get bonused."
bad,"The job was only challenging due to use of sub par accounting systems and unrealistic deadlines resulting in errors. These errors were historical and could not be corrected. Example, after filing 10k a 2mm error was found in stock option compensation and it was pushed to the following year even though it was a material error affecting equity. As a CPA I cannot agree with these types of behaviors. When upper management found out our department was blamed. In addition, we were very cash flow statement oriented which was rarely correct due to the volume of non-cash transactions erroneously classified to bury an error that would take too much time to research and present correctly."
bad,You really don't have a work life balance. They expect you to bend over backwards and they pay you the bare minimum. Unless you plan on NOT having children or a life outside of work. This is not the place for you!
bad,"This company will chew you up and spit you out.  High pressure sales  to grieving families, random shopper calls grading you on your performance...be sure not to mention any prices until you get throught the entire barage of questions that need to be asked and telling them every little thing there is to offer and then trying to get them to come in, still before any prices are offered.  JD Powers surveys that your employment rides on,that shouldn't soley apply to the director who helped the family, but, your personal score, is reflected by how the funeral home looks/is decorated, how their loved one looks, when the embalmers at another location are the ones who actually prepare the body...  Always be on your toes, because you never know when you will be transferred, demoted or terminated for not selling enough ""packages"".  And beware of the continuous training on how to get families to buy packages. "
bad,The culture and the management ruin everything SCI offers its employees. This is a big corporation and if you can get past the cult like management and the numerous amount of people who do nothing then you will be fine here. Be careful as to what you are sold in the job that is offered and what you really get. People are transferred and job titles and duties change without notice. This also goes for schedules and compensation.
bad,"I started as part- time and stayed as part-time even after the 90 day probation period. There are no benefits for part timers. The new management has no intentions of making anyone full time unless maybe you are a funeral director or the general office manager. Management is horrible; there is a lot of favoritism and discrimination in the company. They seem to hire more friends than more qualified individuals. They have no respect for their hard working employees. The place can become very hostile; coworkers and managers are very mean to each other, including families. Many families go in there very upset and try and put blame on anyone they come in contact with and will try and get you fired. There is no set schedule and they are always cutting hours. The manager only cares about his/her friends that are employed at the location, no matter how rude they are with you. Also, there are several smokers who constantly take smoke breaks leaving you to answers the phones all by yourself and families coming in at the same time. Work becomes delayed and they are very disorganized. Everyone is about their own gain and no team work."
bad,"Long hours that can't be sustained with the work load.  Not given the man power to obtain the expected environment levels.  No official training, learn as you go.  Insufficient leaders at all levels!"
bad,Management needs some help. They either micro manage or are absent. Some high pressure from management and to customers.
bad,"The mid-low level employees were great, but management rarely held a comprehensive grasp on how their actions affected morale and thereby customer service."
bad,"I love working in a funeral home ad helping people through this losing my father at a critical age. I was unlike an Funeral Home I have worked for. I take the families and the work very seriously, I am warm and get to know them instead of just pushing for things I knew they could not afford. I worked with them to find something that did make them happy and they could afford. Back when I started that was how it was done. Not anymore, I am ethical and honest and I will help them any way,,,start to finish. I just like where this was going and I was not happy,"
bad,"Produce high, they love you; don't reach quotas every month, they tell you to ""do better"". Inadequate training - no additional learning classes offered to get better, just energetic ""try-to-motivate-you"" talks. They only care about numbers and just want you to build relationships with families to acquire referrals. "
bad,A typical day entails meeting with families and going to cemetery graveside services. Most enjoyable part is getting to help families find peace and bringing joy to them in time of sorrow.
bad,"Having worked in a management position with SCI in both Metro market and Main street.  The difference can be striking.  This company consist of three selling markets. Major, Metro, Main street."
bad,Ok company - not a very stable income. Wish there was a better way to pay my bills andf stay with thisa company.
bad,Working here was depressing and it was hard to stay focused because the lack of technology available to become successful.
bad,"The company has good products but your life is dictated by local management.  They are permitted to interpret corporate rules with little oversight.  The focus of this company is SALES.  Nothing else matters and unless you are #1, you won’t matter."
bad,"I don't recommend working at SCI Incorporated due to their competitive environment, unprofessional mannerism and the hours.  There are other funeral services organizations that are far worthy of your business."
bad,"Worked for a little bit as a funeral services assistant. Prior to working services, the company does not provide training on funeral customs and traditions to employees. On more than one occasion, this has led to mistakes in services for a few employees. As the company says, they only get one chance to get it right. "
bad,"The management at the location I worked at “Gotha Fl” was horrible, felt like working with mean school girls back in high school. Very Sad because administration team was great and I really liked what I did. Had to walk out as did all the other co- workers that would not play the games of new management. I wish Corporate would care more about their hard working, loyal people."
bad,"Come face to face with corporate greed disguised as service excellence. Work with other sad people who feel they have no other choice than to accept the grim reality of corporate greed, middle man management, and working hard for the proverbial man. Turn a blind eye! Manipulate grieving people and feel bad doing it! Paid vacations."
bad,I was very well respected in my field with s c i for 26 years and unfortunately they made the decision to let go any 1 with over 20 years of service to allow new lower-paid people take their positions and to potentially compromise the Integrity of the organization
bad,The company has alot of good benefits for its employees. But do you rarely get compensated for all your effort. You really have to be a managers pet to be noticed. Unfortunately it's a sells driven company and administration never gets noticed.
bad,"Hard to get customers to buy, hard to find leads, not competitive in prices verse competition."
bad,"Long hours, but a good people. They could be a little more truthful during the hiring process. I would STRONGLY recommend that one has an alternate income source before going to work there.  The hardest part for me was dealing with the deaths of children. If you are sensitive to that sort of thing, then you probably want to stay away. The most enjoyable part was helping people. Management style was difficult to comprehend sometime."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting families and counseling the families on at need basis.  I do not like the sales part cold calling and trying to get them to buy property/funerals
bad,"Stay away! Management lies and lies and lies.  They are a bunch of promises and no action.  I was told by a manager to make a family feel guilty about not spending more money!!!  This is a company that only cares about dollar signs, not the family.  "
bad,This was an okay place to work.  I worked well with my co-workers. I believe that a more effective management team would have been beneficial to the betterment of this company
bad,"A typical work day with Service Corporation International(SCI) consist in lead calling, cold calling, scheduling appointments, presentations, emailing, and prospecting. "
bad,It's all about the politics not talent! They throw people to the wolves and could care less if they stay or go. Upper management is a joke and everyone knows it.
bad,"What I didn't like about SCI is that the rewards for bonuses would often ""shift"" and become a moving target.  Moving the goal posts after hard work is wrong.  I recall ""winning"" a trip to Vegas once, but when I was the only winner, I was given a cheap gift card instead.  I call foul on that."
bad,"Very cut throat environment; days went fast due to heavy workload; expectations way too high for pay; no room to grow or advance; inconsistent management; revolving door as far as employees staying; great co-workers, misleading managers"
bad,Very sales intensive environment that depends on the death of people or the fear of death to drive sales.  Company strongly stresses service and compassion for families and it is genuine.  At the same time SCI is very sales oriented.  If you don't sell you are out.
bad,It was a case of mismatched personality and skillset combined with a corporate takeover that simply made this a bad fit.
bad,"Selling Prearranged cremation plans, comforting those who are upset that you didn't call fast enough and their loved one has passed, asked to call people over and over since multiple papers were printed out and you aren't allowed to go through and alphabetized and organize to assure multiple calls aren't being made to one person."
bad,"100% commission so if you're not selling you're not getting paid, overall good company but the lack of management and all the culture driven drama it wasn't for me."
bad,You'll spend the vast amount of your time chasing signatures for burials and standing at gravesides for no reason at minimum wage with no time to do the job you were told you were hired to do.
bad,"I have said many times that they squeeze pennies and nickels out of the hourly employees so that the managers can get bigger bonuses. They could care less about you personally and you are expendable. It is very much a ""What have you done for me lately"" attitude."
bad,"Long hours, no work life balance.  You are working to make 15 people very rich.  If you are 21 years old, it is a good place to start your career.  Be ready to sell your soul for quota."
bad,"Service Corporation International is the largest American provider of crematory, funeral, and cemetery products.  It takes a special person to help others in need, possibly the worst day in their lives with the passing of a relative. The most difficult part of the job is convincing the populace to take action now in lieu of waiting.  Massive warm calling and community contact is essential for success. The ability to help another is the most rewarding part of the job."
bad,"Extremely flexible position and I was able to set my hours to meet my families needs. I worked 45-60 hours per week door knocking, cold calling, networking, and working tradeshows. "
bad,Dealing with funerals and deaths was hard enough but asking the family for the money was worse. Selling the plots and products was educational but i could not do it.
good,"You did not know what to expect from day to day.  Poor management and the lack of training the ""SCI"" way. Your client base was not secured. The most enjoyable part of the job was to get out and meet with people and share information on final arrangements."
good,Stressful high pressured from upper management.  Started out good but has taken all benefits from sales people.  More concerned about tracking information .
good,"not very sales oriented . hired and trained sales people, sat with people who just experienced a death. Held sales meetings, coached sales people every day."
good,"It can be a good place to work, the pay was good when sales were good. Benefits for sales people were not an option at the time, rewarding but difficult to sell. Not the best job culture."
good,The idea of Dignity is nice but it is very difficult to make the money they say we can make.  The leads they receive are given to those who have been their long term and the new people are basically retired or have some other source of income.  A couple managers are old car salesmen and have no compassion just on a money making scheme rather than compassionately wanting whats best for the families.
good,"People are in roles they shouldn't be in. There is poor leadership at the bottom, and you can trace it all the way back to the top. So nothing will change until the upper management changes. This business is ripe for the taking from another better and smarter company."
good,my day was like i go in at 7am start work while the the rest came in when they wanted when they did come in they watched me work
good,"Company pretends to care about your development.  Will not invest in tools (always out or short of media tools), hours are beyond extensive, quotas are unrealistic given the limitations.  Only care about the bottom line.  Not worth the sacrifice you make taking away from your family.  Average day 9am-9pm.  Weekends are almost always necessary.  No guidance or structure followed."
good,"Finding leads isn't easy.  Its a 24/7 job.  If you slack off or take a weekend off you don't make the money you need to survive. Smart, highly motivated people would be good."
good,"Service Corporation International is a company that holds a lot of promise for people who are passionate about caring for the client families in the community. "
good,Although I received adequate support from my regional sales manager my local management team did nothing to help with the team success at our locations and often seemed to purposely work against us.  The properties were in utterly poor condition as was the chapels and the cemeteries were an embarrassment to show on a sales tour.
good,"Management is supportive, but numbers & production driven. It's a sales position which offers an extremely valuable product. They could use some help in the marketing dept. They change course on a whim & often will not allow a marketing campaign to take root."
good,This was the hardest sales job I have ever had to do.  They worked us a lot of hours and expected a great deal of sales every month. Great job if you have no family.
good,Management brought in Staffing from Out of State and laid off over 30 local employees.
good,"Lack of advancement. Boring, part-time job with minimal interaction with people. It can be a sad place to work, people have lost loved ones. The pay is not great. Make it work."
good,It's voted one of the Best Places to work... but only for those who have BEEN there. New Employees would not vote the same. There is a lot of Diversity within the company but weak leadership. You will be expected to do your job and that of others and KEEP QUIET about it. Few opportunities for advancement. Pay does not reflect cost of living.
good,"I worked hard for this location, most managers have a heart this location the GM is a nightmare. Controlling and seemed to be confuse about what it means to distroye a employees family over his own pleasure of being what a boss is in the workplace."
good,"Report to office gather prospect info. start calling for appt. After scheduling appt. head out to meet with prospects. Management has high expectations  on selling."
good,"long hours, high turnover, low commissions, not enough time for personal life. most enjoyable part of the position was helping families at their time of need."
good,Very stressful and poor management.  Commission sales only but required to work long hours in the office.  No time to prospect for new leads.
good,The industry needs a better standard of care for client families
good,"I went to work there to try to help families pre plan for cemetery, and funeral needs. Unfortunately, it was not a good fit for me. I was spending 40 to 50 hours a week (commission only) trying to encourage families to pre plan."
good,"In business, there comes a time when enough is enough and people start to turn away from you. SCI is interested in the bottom line everyday in every way. What I had built up in the community over a 3-4 year span was destroyed by them within one hour. Then they wonder why they went from making $2.5 Million a year to under $1 Million the next year. I tried to help rebuild community and my life with SCI. When my personal life interfered with my job (surgery), they could not wait to replace me with another employee."
good,"Everyone in a PPA position has a story and a purpose. The people you work with are intriguing. However, the amount of time spent on dead end leads is counterproductive"
good,"For this to be the most profitable company in this market they pay their employees the least. They switch your time around so you won’t get overtime. They lowered the yearly raise, they took away the “5, 10 etc years employed rewards. They took away the yearly Christmas party. They raised the health insurance this coming year by 15% it was already high enough. All while lining the folks at the top pocket. Oh and they hire their friends and family for management positions"
good,drove around with ground manager looking for trash and or anyone who needed help. prepare graves for burials like digging the hole or setting up chairs and adding shade.
good,Field service desk is what its called but its really just a call center. 8 hours a day glued to a phone talked down to and ordered around by peers who work for the same company. Corporate management who always increases work load.
good,"Learned the process of death certificates. Constant follow-up with medical professionals, and dealing with family members for availability and funeral arrangements."
good,"This job is for someone with no personal goals because of the time scheduling with the company. You have no time left over and no real need for consistent income if you understand the world of commissions ( it can feel like working for free) however, it is a great learning experience and  can be very knowledgeable and useful in your personal and business life."
good,if you play the game you will do well.  If you are an independent thinker it will be a bumpy road.  Company is sales driven and does not respect a work life balance.
good,"I would perfer not to say more then I already have.  I feel as this is getting personal and irrelevant to me looking for a new career. This company has many positive and negative attributes, as all company's do. I however well not be the one to point these out."
good,"There is very little training, and a lot of work to be done. "
good,"Be prepared to work 10 days on with 4 days off and no overtime for working 80 hours in a row. Not to mention you are on call (as an arranger) no less than 3 times a week, which means you can receive phone calls at 2am, 3am, 4am... and you have to wake up and speak with a family and still need to be at work on time the same morning. It is DIFFICULT and the little pay makes it hard to survive."
good,"Come in to the office, sit all day at desk and answer phone calls. 85 % of people out in the field are really nice. Ive learned that SCI HMIS system is not reliable at all... I enjoy my manager, but he gets controlled by the supervisor and a few other people at the help desk. very high turn over rate... Gets very stressful at times. And now we have to work on saturday and sunday.."
good,managers do not know how to encourage people - they cut down at every opportunity. Everyone is worried about their jobs and many are let go encouraging more worry and frustration. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping families in their time of need.
good,"A typical day a work involved helping families park, help with any questions etc.  The hardest part of the job was setting up for funerals that were  large without  additional employees."
good,Corporate expectations were demanding based on the hours put in and the low commissions / pay.    Lack good training in product knowledge with a system hard to navigate.  Local employees good to work with.  Greedy corporate level. Liked helping people and developing relationships but hard to survive on the income not provided.  Many tasks expected took away from time to earn/sale.
good,"Neptune Society supplies leads generated by mailer response card and internet inquiries.  Management could provide more training regarding laws and regulations in the state.   Leads are updated when potential client is reached.  A lot of travel time, call time, and record keeping time."
good,"End of life environment, mentally though, much respect for death and families in need."
good,"would not recommend due extremely stressful environment with unstable management, work day hours are not guaranteed, high turn over rate, no benefits, no room for advancement, and hostile work environment"
good,"Do not accept a contract to hire position with this company unless it states in writing when they will make you permanent!  I have been working here 6 months and have no idea if or when they will be hiring me on.  In the meanwhile they just hired a full-time permanent employee and so I am wondering why I was looked over.  I am not disgruntled just being honest.  Otherwise it is a good company, Large, and from what I hear have good benefits, and perks, but I wouldn't know about any of that..."
good,Its always inspiring serving the families but the work culture is poor. The pay is confusing. Not a comfortable or caring place to work. Expectations are very high and very difficult to achieve.
good,The workplace culture is dealing with grieving families on a daily basis as well as customer complaints.   The communication is a must with Funeral Directors and Management.  Being on commission can be difficult and work culture does not seem to support family life at this level.
good,"Almost 10 years there; but this was not the Company when I left. The sales counselor compensation changed five times in my nine years, but never for the better. The sales Management  compensation changed three times, but always down. When I started, the emphasis was taking care of the families that we served and making the team feel important and valued. Over the years, my impression is that the emphasis became all about numbers!"
good,"Sales culture, only paid off of commissions but there are many other aspects of job that you must fulfill. No sense of camaraderie amongst sales representatives."
good,"Company meeting in the morning."
good,Getting clients to talk about funeral arrangements is difficult if not impossible. Must be comfortable to about death on a regular basis. Cold Calling and door knocking are common practice for clientele.
good,"Maybe I just had bad luck, but we went through five managers in two months. I felt the company was unstable. A typical day requires being self-motivated and speaking withp otential customers. Making phone calls, knocking on doors, and finding leads."
good,"Company is going in a different direction that will make them lose customers and employees in the long run, employees have left due to not receiving compensation."
good,"Fast paced, challenging work environment. Never a dull moment with plenty of work to go around. Willingness to get hands dirty is a must!"
good,I enjoy my position for what it is. There are a lot of freedoms but a lot of time spent away from home. I manage top line revenue and promote sales. I interact with my counselors daily and work on managing the sales process. Bottom line operational profit is the key to growing the business and that is obtained through sales and margins. I train staff on sales and behavior based methods of interaction. Plan and preform group presentations and seminars. I price and plan new developments for sales and products based on changes in our operation.
good,The company doesn't pay as well with or without your Life Insurance License. Have to create your own leads and can be rewarding if you can sell enough business to compensate your income. Problem is that it takes some time to build up your listings of potential business for pre-planning cemetery space or Memorial Services. The consumers are not always willing to do there pre-planning for their memorial Service even thou it can be benedictory to the families of the passing.
good,A typical day at work is stressful due to lack of personnel to meet workload.
good,"understanding the product/ service to market, the community contacts and targeted recipients are a combination of reluctance, denial, affordability and a very slow pace to respond. Therefore my commitment to reach the sales quota was a complete disappoinment."
good,"I enjoyed working alongside my co-workers, GM and Office Mgr.  However, the compensation plan needs to be adjusted.  There were times that my weeks were filled with services for families but because of how the plan is structured, I would not be adequately compensated."
good,"You can’t raise a family on the pay they offer you. If you need a job, this will work. Management is nice. Co-Workers are great but no way to advance and no way to make any money. You do get discounts with the company. Are they setting me up to die here? The pay around here is not even in the 50% Area Median Income. Not appropriate pay  for the hard work and high expectations. “You get what you pay for.” I have to take care of my family. Tried to negotiate pay. Cemetery mapping, burial, opening of the vaults, mausoleum openings is hard to understand and doesn’t come to everyone.  No luck so had to give up a year of working to support my family."
good,"Prestigious funeral home in Houston.  Was a part time job with multiple duties associated with memorial services, family assistance, chapel services, front desk duties, etc."
good,"The hardest part of the job is in sales; you are required to have at lease $27,000.00 in Board Volume. I put in at lease 49 hours in a week, and this became very stressful, especially when the sale manager made it mandatory. "
good,Sales is 100% commission but over 80% of job is administrative. Commission is very low and complicated. Not able to make a living wage at our location. Management is supportive but their hands are tied.
good,"Fast paced environment, multi tasking a priority, accuracy and detail extremely important, enjoyed working with families/public interaction which was rewarding."
good,"Overall great company when it comes to work/life balance. The work is not hard, but very pointless if you are an accountant in the trust department. Nothing you learn can be carried over to any meaningful position. The pay is decent and the company does a good job of hosting events for employees. There really is zero opportunity for advancement in the company unless you kiss the right behind. Most managers there are knowledgeable, but there are some that should not even be cleaning the restrooms. I happened to work under one of these and quit after a year. Overall the company is a good stepping stone in between jobs. Really nothing more."
good,I helped with clearing out invoices on hold as an invoice analyst and maintained vendor information and aged vendor invoices for account payables clearing.
good,Very stressful and cliqish work environment. Poor training and high work expectations. No room for errors even on entry level. Poor communication between HR Director and staff. Lost of office politics and favoritism.
good,"I started with this company a year ago with high hopes.  This job is not for everyone.  You are dealing with people who either experienced a death or preparing for it.  That being said, its very rewarding helping people.  Most of the families are really nice.  The problem is that the pay is horrible.  You can sell a property and think you are making money, but you are not.  There is a lot of running around and working pretty much for free.  They pay you minimum wage or commission.  As an insurance agent, you sometimes only take home $300 a week if you do not sell enough.  This job is for someone who has an income already.  You will not pay your bills working here.  Also, the management is awful.  They turnover a lot of people because of the culture.  The people who have been with the company a long time are so stuck in their ways that they hinder any new blood coming in. If they paid the counselors more money (i.e. salary) then there would be less turnover because people need to pay bills.  Also, they need to get rid of some of the old people who are not helpful or friendly to the new people."
good,"The Company was great to work for when it was a small publicly owned and even when it went private. But when it went to the National Company it is today. the price went way up, and the stress started. Managers having to make goals that were hard to do so they really put the stress on their people to sell a product that was really pricey. I didn't like the direction they were going so I left."
good,"As a Pre Planning Advisor you spend 90% of your time prospecting and the remaining 10% presenting to families and writing contracts. The sales aspect is like any other, make your numbers or you will not get paid or guidance from management. The opportunity to help families is awesome, but unless your in a funeral home all day your focus is only on sales. The initial training and thereafter is well below the standard of any other corporate organization and the old school methods from the training staff do not prepare a person for success. They barely teach you the industry which knowing your product is essential, yet instead they focus on reciting a script that has little value to the full sales process."
good,"Rewarding way to serve families and meet great people/families, but very emotionally draining.  It was a  high pressure sales environment, which is tough when you are dealing with grieving families on top of things.  Hard to sell in such a competitive and saturated market.  We had to price match often.  The majority of management did not take responsibility for their mistakes, including customer and pricing issues.  Poor training and support, at least at local level.  A lot of busy work that could have been taken care of by admin or someone not on commission.  An attitude of, ""not my job"" oriented office environment.  Worked on draw/commission.  Felt that if you were not a top writer, you were just a number.  The co-workers were great..."
good,"Typical day at work is reports, sales meetings, recruiting and training sales staff, and closing sales. I Learned alot from SCI about effective management skills to produce high results. The hardest part of the job is assisting families with final arrangements after the loss of a loved one. The most enjoyable part is assiting the sales staff in attaining their goals and being successful."
good,Good for those who can do high pressure sales to grieving families.  Not goof for providing great customer service to families.  Family Service Counselors can struggle to meet quota.
good,Manager will send you out so he can make the sales and then make you finish his work. They use night shift as a punishment. They will check if client has a Pre Need before deciding if they will take it or pass it to someone else. The favorites rarely go out and they always make the commission sales.
good,"very rewarding job when it comes to clients who are grateful to have someone like you to walk them through the worst time of their lives."
good,"Great company to work for, meet a lot of great people. A lot of opportunities to grow within the company. Management was the only down fall for me, they were never on the same page."
good,"A Crematory Operator is the last line of defense, so to speak, before the irreversible process of cremation.  You must make sure the all paperwork is correct and that the decedent is accompanied by documented personal effects.  You must make sure that the Funeral Director has done their job correctly. (which is not always the case) You must have complete knowledge of how the cremators (the machines you use to cremate) work, and how to manipulate them to function properly depending on size and composition of the decedent.  All this must be done in a timely manner to properly serve the family clients.  This job is grossly underpaid.  The climate in which you operate is hot and dangerous.  Not to mention the fact the working with the dead isn't exactly glamorous.  On top of that you must be the watchdog for funeral director mistakes.  All of this adds up to a hard and physical job that deserves much more pay than is given. "
good,"Many people come and go from SCI, especially in the Talent Acquisition Dept.  This makes it difficult to grow because new managers and directors come in often and each one has a different vision as to how the department should be run."
good,Main issue with the company is work/life balance and pay. Commission structure has been reworked causing many employees to lose thousands that they depend on annually.
good,"The majority of people employed at SCI are caring, loving, and professional. However, there are a few exceptions, as with any place of employment. "
good,"Commission only so you must hustle everyday. Not easy to take vacations or time off. Can be highly stressful but also rewarding."
good,"Incredibly difficult to make any money at this, especially when they keep adding additional counselors to each location, so everyone gets fewer interactions with families we serve.  However, it is incredibly rewarding work.  There really needs to be a base salary plus sales incentives, not just straight commission, if they're going to retain top talent.  NOTE: They will tell you there is a ""base"" of minimum wage, but even that isn't true, since it isn't minimum wage plus commission, it's just minimum wage if your commission doesn't cover it.  If it does, it's 100% commission."
good,"It is a tough job, but can be very rewarding. You must spend a great deal of time at the funeral home to make sure you see your customers when they come in. That is the only way to ensure you do not lose commissions."
good,"Strict on policy and procedures for certain employees. And repercussions for some but not all. Mangers are excellent and trusting,but some managers are extremely loyal others aren't."
good,"Being in a commission only position can be super stressful. You need to have tenacity and you must stay at it constantly, CONSTANTLY. You can take off the time that you need (usually) but if you don't sell you don't get paid, simple as that."
good,"Too big of corporation, the field employees tend to be misogynistic and ignorant regardless of education, unfortunately. The corporate employees seem to be on a different plane altogether."
good,"Very laid back place to work. The culture is great. Set hours, no more no less. Your task are delivered clearly and thoroughly with clear expectations and time frame."
good,My coworkers were great to work with. Always busy trying to find the next sale to meet very high quotas. Very little training and the work environment was something I couldn't never really get used to having dead bodies everywhere.
good,learned a lot that made me want to go to school to become a funeral director. great feeling being able to help a family when they need it most.
good,Average day and average co workers intense stressful environment
good,"It was a difficult industry to work in, then my mother became ill and I left to move back home.  I felt great satisfaction helping families plan their loved ones services.  But dealing with a death myself made it to difficult."
good,"Good opportunity to harness outside sales skills in “pre-need” Sales. Very niche market. Tough sale in California, but very beneficial products to all who become customers!"
good,"Many changes are taking place which has mad it a less desirable work environment. For the most part it is a decent company to work for, it's a heavy work load but worth it, mainly because you get to help many people."
good,"The experience was ok. I feel like any corporate job, there are always favorites and this was definitely a “click” job. I am happy for the experience yet I could not survive the politics."
good,"Employees that works there are great.   You do work hard to make a paycheck.   If you don't meet sales goals you make minimum wage $12.  Goals are high but achievable.   You have to do a lot of cold calling and follow up to keep booking appointments 2-4 a day required.  The best part of the job is helping families which is very rewarding, the worst is you have to be really organized and they have terrible computer systems and slow internet that make your job difficult.  Management is constantly asking you were your at and checking up on your productivity numerous times a day, there is tons of over site.  As a sales person you have to field a lot of customer complaints regarding grounds and how long things take to get completed.  You also required to stay and work late several times a month and make phone calls."
good,Very numbers focused company- little support for managers. There was an immense amount of pressure to hit sales every month. It was a very stressful environment.
good,there are many locations for the company.  The corporate office is located in Houston Texas and it is difficult to get an administrative job unless you live in Houston.
good,When I began training I learned that I was not actually going to be working in position for which I was hired. Caught by surprise. Training was not as I thought.
good,I learned many things working for this company.  I got along with all my coworkers.  I had good managers.  I loved working with families and families loved working with me.
good,In this position and industry it is vital to have the ability to re-prioritize and complete tasks often quickly for those you are serving. Details are critical.
good,The hardest part of this job was trying to balance what is morally right and what you have to do for yourself in order to make the quota requirements. It is hard to help a family out when you are the salesperson that has to push a sale because this is a 100% commission position.
good,"Employees were friendly and open to new people starting. Middle management were good to work with and shared knowledge. Not too sure about upper management, you didn't see them often."
good,Providing a resource and helping families keep the dignity of their loved ones while helping them celebrate a life well lived through the services of designing a memorial for their loved one is what a Family Service Counselor does with every family they help.
good,"SCI is a very fast pace work environment. Although I love what I do, there has been some holes within the company as a whole. Like poor management, low compensation (but great benefits)"
good,"Neptune was a wonderful place to work with an exceptional plan for end-of-life cremation pre-arrangement for members. Reps could set their own pace and pursue as many leads, hours and commissions as we were willing to work and pursue other interests as well. September 2018 Regional Manager left and replacement initiated termination of any rep not willing and able to bring in 10-30 contracts monthly."
good,This company went out of business.  The office in St. Louis was closed and bought out by my next employer.  One other employee and I were hired as part of the negotiation.
good,The job place a person a lot of pressure to earn your pay. The job did not provide a good work and family  balance.Management  expected you to be on the job all day and half the night.
good,Fine place to work.  especially for a family person .  Long hours but good management.  I really have no complaints.  I got my insurance license and learned a lot about funerals.
good,not a job to grow in. I would look for something else. one could definitely find somewhere better for sure. comment was not the best either. spent so much time in traffic.
good,There is a lack of training and support for Sales Staff who depend on commission. The turnover is the highest I have ever witnessed. Dealing with death and all of the things that death entails can be a bit depressing.
good,This job is satisfactory but does not provide enough work hours. Working with families in such a heartfelt situations motivated me toward providing excellent customer satisfaction.
good,"SCI was a good stable job, management was ok nothing hard about it.  The workplace culture was good so many different personalities to work with most enjoyable part was you got the chance to work in different areas to learn different jobs."
good,The job is rewarding in helping people to plan their final arrangements. Very good people to work with but the home and work life balance can be difficult.
good,"Really enjoyed my time working with families who lost loved ones and those who wanted to pre-plan funeral arrangements. Beautiful environment, good working conditions but could use better sales management. Convenient location."
good,Working here is can be rewarding but very hard. You work on commission. You have good months and you have bad months. Worked with a lot of good people.
good,"Compensation was not based on performance, however, I was offered a raise and a promotion when I tendered my resignation.  The atmosphere was friendly and the office accomodations were acceptable."
good,"This job was hard at first, but I picked it up in a week. My supervisor was amazing. I learned how to call doctor's office and get the causes of death worksheet on patients, learned how to verify benefits for clients."
good,Was not quite what I thought it would be. Staff is generally very friendly and helpful with other employees. Offers to provide long term employment. Must like funerals.
good,SCI is a comfortable setting/enviroment. There is always opportunities to learn new things and projects. I enhanced my HR knowledge and learn Payroll fundamentals.
good,Employers is a very employee-friendly company that provides a great work life balance and flexible work hours. Culture is very conservative and status quo can be strong.
good,"Corporate culture and the cemetery funeral industry does not always blend well.  It can more easily with stand-alone funeral homes, but with newly acquired cemeteries, they are not well managed."
good,"I worked for SCI very briefly so I cannot say all that much.  What I can say is this: basically you do it all - yourself.  It's like having your own business within the business.  You take full responsibility for your own incorporation, your own travel,marketing and all business expenses. You pay out of pocket for your own health insurance as well.  The company does not reimburse for driving even though it is outside sales.  It is 100% commission.  I did see people in the office making money though.  For me, it was just too much (you do it all just like your own business).  Why not start my own business then??"
good,"Enjoyed Helping families during the most difficult time in there lives."
good,I learned a great deal about the industry. I learned that people need guidance and counsel during one of the most difficult times of their lives and that I could offer them that guidance. It was a very demanding and fast paced position. The position requires organizational skills and self-motivation. The hardest part of the job was also the most rewarding…..guiding people through the process of losing a loved one.
good,Friendly and compassionate environment assisting customers with pre-need services through presentations and electronic communications.
good,a very difficult job if you don't have a network of people to sell to. Lots of great incentives and I enjoyed the team that I worked with.
good,"helping families make funeral arrangements"
good,"must have state license to sell funeral the state takes forever to process. outside sales, set own schedle"
good,"Excellent opportunity to interact with people in such a devastating time.  Dealing with people at a time of death can be rewarding when offering comfort and security.  Compassion is one of my strong suits so I felt a since of joy doing a job I enjoyed as well as helping others in their time of need.  I also felt honored to be depended upon from my staff, as I assisted in all aspects of the job.  This provided my staff the knowledge to do their job as well."
good,My family owner was sold to SCI.  Everything changed. Management was horrid.  They placed me in unreasonable situations several times.  Their work ethic rated a -0- ! Employees left often.
good,"I had a difficult time equating mission of corporate with the reality of the location management."
good,You spend your days digging graves and setting up funerals. The shop was also part of the crematory so they were bringing in people every day for that. You worked in all weather no matter what
good,I would recommend this company for any experienced sales professional with a fairly large network.
good,"Prospecting, cold calling, networking and appointment setting is the main job duties. Lots of learning available, but poor upper leadership causes too many changes and instability in the workplace. 100% commission is not for everyone."
good,The razor wire between what people need during a time of loss and your corporate responsibility to make profit can be hard to navigate. It is a delicate balance and takes both skill and compassion to be successful.
good,Due to the nature of this industry this job is good for those wanting to expand on their Sales and various Sales Strategies. Finding customers is definitely a challenge that is rewarding to both parties.
good,"If you can deal with meeting with families who just lost a loved one, attend cemetery services, fill out paperwork and cold call all day, all the while meeting a monthly quota, then you will like this job."
good,SCI gave me many opportunities to learn management skills.  The day to day operations are extremely paperwork top heavy.  Employees and client families could be better served if the process was streamlined.
good,"This type of industry is best suited for certain individuals. Being surrounded by grieving families and death tends to take a toll over time. For me, it wasn't worth the stress."
good,Being in any sales type of position will NOT ALWAYS be an up and up trend in achieving goals - BUT for the ones that have the determination will prevail.  It is said work life balance is what is important to their families meaning the sales people [some home visits with determination could be up to 6 times].  Hats off to the ones that are in Managing and in sales.
good,"I was terminated after having worked for four years covering the entire state of Tennessee.  On numerous occasions I asked for help, but was never given any assistance.  When the company moved a new location manager from Florida to take my place, he was given an assistant and a automobile.  I don't thing that the company appreciated the hard work that I did for the company under extremely bad conditions."
good,"Fast pace environment, once you achieve a goal, start again with new cuota, bonus excelent, but have to work on weekends,"
good,As an employee of service corporation international I enjoyed serving the families grieving  families I was able to help them in their selection of cemetery property set a lot of goals and accomplished those while helping the cemetery and funeral home achieve their sales quotas and I was recognized multiple times for my achievements
good,"Only with SCI for 6 months, had the great people and management team seems to really care about the business and their employees. They offered an excellent serverance package and have great company benefits!  Wish I could have stayed"
good,"Assisted families in the most volnurable time of need. Assisted making arrangements, arranging clergy, assisted family service with the cemetery."
good,"The job was ok. Maybe a better pay structure would work better. Management could be better and a little bit more experienced. I would recommend working there part time, if you need some extra money."
good,"It is a very fast paced job with little room for advancement. There was very little training provided due to the high volume of calls. Higher then normal stress level of management made it very difficult to work and learn. Working with families was a very rewarding experience for me because it gave me the chance to help support, comfort and share in the memories of the lives that meant so much to families, friends and our community"
good,"Good work-life balance, good management, limited opportunities for advancement. Health insurance is expensive for a company of this size, even high deductible options."
good,It is overall a fantastic company that always helped the employees feel appreciated for doing what they had to do for the families that came in needing help during difficult moments. They always were motivating. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Although I love the industry that I work in, I feel it is time to move forward and utilize my education. SCI has given me the opportunity to work with customs at a very difficult time I their lives. This has helped prepare for other industries."
good,"I am able to bring my professional experience and energies which in hand benefits all parties involved.  I learn everyday to treat both my internal and external customers with dignity and respect. "
good,"There really isn't a blanket statement I can give regarding SCI.  The working environment depends largely on the location manager, coworkers, the demographic of the client families and the volume of the location.  I worked at seven locations and they were all different experiences.  Some were pleasant, some were hectic and stressful, but they were all challenging in their own way.  The one consistent item is the paperwork.  Lots and lots of it and much of it redundant.  I will say that I never really had a coworker that I didn't get along with."
good,Ability to work from home on chosen day of the week. Full fitness gym on campus saving time away from family. Restaurant on campus also allowing for better work/life balance and production.
good,"Great place to be but working on commission was tough. Also, it was a great product. Everyone needs it. The training program could have been better. It was tough to pick up everything. It was either you understood it, or you did not. But the people were super nice."
good,A Company that cares. Clients needs are the primary focus for at need families.  Co workers are genuine. Hardest part is dealing with grief that families go through loosing a loved one.
good,Finance has a lot of smart people working there. The new guys not so much.
good,"This was a sales job, but you are required to do a lot of non-paid customer service duties and also non-paid operational duties for the right to get leads."
good,"SCI was a great place to work. I was employed for eight years with the company. This is a cemetery funeral home company and while employed there I was thought everything about accounting and bookkeeping. This was the only company that I haved worked for that didnt feel like a job, it felt like a family. The company was real involved with the community."
good,"You have to dedicate a lot of hours in order to make money.  There is a big learning curve if you choose to work in the cemeteries.  However, once you learn everything (usually around 3-4 months) then it becomes a lot easier and you can start to make money."
good,I like the place. Just tired from commission base. I am fond of it. Learned a lot and helped a lot too. The hardest part is prospecting. The managers are so friendly.
good,"I enjoy helping my families during one of the most difficult times. I do strive to make things as easy and informative as possible, be available and answer questions."
good,"Too many people invilved with others making my job hard due to nepotism.  The first direct manager was nice and fair regarding how thkngs were run, but the new manager helped people and not others make sales.  "
good,"The company is forever changing and updating policies but it is easy to cope with if you are adaptable! "
good,I learned a ton about funerals and cemeteries. It is a bit hard but it does pay off. You have your own schedule as long as you make sales.
good,"Great benefits, management issues from the bottom up. Workplace culture is extremely corporate so if you are not accustomed to that type of work setting, working here will not be a great fit."
good,"The area I was within, needed a lot of management intensified training on how to communicate with employees. The days were not long but could have been more challenging."
good,"I've worked as a Family Service Counselor (sales) for about 8 months. Out of the 8 months, 2 months were really bad slow months. You have to make calls and try to set appointments and hit a certain amount in board volume each month. It can be a lot of pressure at times trying to get people in the door. Its 100% commission and if you don't sell anything you get minimum wage. I like the values and what the company is about. The hours were great (8:30-5) and most weekends off. It may have been better if I would've been able to get some more leads. They expect you to prospect leads and do file reviews to try and get sales. It was a bit too much pressure for me. The pay is great IF you're making sales. The training was all over the place too."
good,"The location I worked at was great. The GM and Sales manager were the best. Loving and caring and very supportive. It's the upper management that is the hard thing to get around at times.  SCI, sudden change imminent. Policies would change month to month, and they wouldn't adjust monthly goals. The location I worked at was at one time a very high volume location. However, SCI does not advertise in any way. Our competitor down the road offered the same packages and cemetery estates as we did at half the cost. Also, they did radio, TV and billboard advertisement. We lost several deals to them because families simply just drove down the road. The DM product is amazing and has a lot of great features. I found a job that paid me 5x the commission to sell the same Dignity Memorial Products with no corporate politics."
good,"The Houston Market is exceptional. I loved my jobs at Garden Oaks/ForestPark Westheimer/ Chapel of Eternal Peace. There was alway something to do, and the families were great. Then, foolishly I transferred to Denver where things were the exact opposite."
good,Management is great but tons of red tape. Things moved very slowly and lots was kind of stuck in certain ways. Everyone was friendly for the most part and management were true leaders not just bosses.
good,"I loved working at Neptune. The people were wonderful and the families I helped were loving and kind and treated me with the upmost respect, like a family member."
good,Very stressful place  Push their people  Do not care how long you work it is never enough  People never got to spend time away from work  Always at work
good,Typical day at work starts off opening the doors and unforwarding the phones.  Making phone calls and daily morning meetings discuss logistics about burials. Great to gain experience and knowledge.  Expect to deal with many families who have a loss in their life.
good,"Not sure what to say here. Rewarding job because you're helping people during the worst times of their lives. The pay and management however, aren't great."
good,"Company is top heavy with lower staff doing too much without a thank you.  If you are part of the buddy club, you are Teflon.  Too many corporate suits telling you how to do the job (that they haven't done in years)."
good,"Company pays well, however not a great environment to work in.  Management does not listen to the employees.  Job security is not the greatest."
good,The most enjoyable part of this position is that you have the ability to assist and guide emotionally charged people through the funeral and burial/disposition process
good,I wouldn't refer anyone to work for this company. Its a very stressful company to work for with minimal pay.
good,"if you just got hierd my advise is stay positive selling the product will take time but note if you can sell a casket you can sell anything"
good,"SCI offers a broad spectrum of training and support for its employees. Assisting families with completing their funeral plans and purchasing cemetery property in advance of the time of need is greatly rewarding. Management is constantly motivating the sales teams to excel and keep their standards high, as well as promoting a common bond of teamwork within the organization to provide the highest level of service to its families."
good,"Enjoyed working with the funeral directors and assisting with visitation and funerals."
good,"I love the job, but some parts of management did not honor the core value.  If this particular location would train the manager better then this would be a fantastic place to work.  During the time I was employed there  was not enough training to do my job as I would have expected. When I reached out for help no one knew what was to be done other than sell sell sell no incentive from the manager or encouragement.  The money was great but he could not create his own idea they all came from the agents"
good,"As a funeral arranger or director, you are SERIOUSLY overlooked and under appreciated while the sales staff get all of the perks. You receive good benefits and plenty of them, however you are seriously underpaid and do not feel like your effort is ever enough."
good,"There is a specifically required culture that all are expected to follow but I am not really sure what that culture is. Great Company, Good Pay, Expensive Benefits."
good,"Moved from the Ft. Worth,TX market to the Lexington, SC market probably the biggest mistake I made.  Was making good money there, going broke here. The management is awful here compared to Texas."
good,"Overall good place to work for. Clearwater location is my favorite. Good management, great coworkers. Chances for advancement are few."
good,"It's a very profitable business to be in and you do make great connections with the people you work with. However, everything is not explained up front. I believe that if the recruiters and the trainers were more clear on the job itself then this company would have a much lower turn over rate."
good,This was a position that helped me to build a strong demeanor and work with upper management. I learned many different jobs and learned to multitask extremely well. I developed skills that made me better at working under stress and working under tight time constraints. This was a very good job that made me a better employee and even better boss.
good,"I performed as a buyer for urns, granite and bronze. SCI owns all Dignity Funeral homes and cemeteries in the nation. I was new to this industry and learned a lot about it in the time I worked there. "
good,"The position I was hired for was a sales position.  I has never worked in sales before. Although after interviewing, I thought it would be something that I could do, with proper training and mentoring.  However, with the spanish language barrier, it proved to be more of a roadblock.  I honestly felt as though I could not be successful learning a new skill when I couldn't really understand what they were saying."
good,Family service counselors in funeral homes provide advice to bereaved families and help them make burial arrangements for their departed loved ones. They maintain positive communications with client families to answer questions regarding the burial process and often use their counseling expertise to help overwhelmed members cope with the loss. Family service counselors also protect the confidentiality of clients' information.
good,"It is not a fast placed work environment, staff is young and inexperienced. Past management is lacking in much needed skills to keep staff operating efficiently."
good,"no comment.. I have good things and bad things to say about this company, but overall, I'm happy to have been given a second chance and I love what we do for families"
good,"This was very difficult work as I was dealing with people experiencing one of the worst events during their lives. In the funeral home it was less stressful as I could get advice/support from other members of staff. However when I was on call there was no support if the circumstances were difficult. "
good,Compassion for customers is hard to maintain due to stress of mainly commission oriented pay. Great training program and opportunity to earn life insurance license (which is required). Management works hard to help sell pre-planned funeral arrangements (higher commission) and at-need funeral arrangements (lower commissions). Up and down cycle of earnings very difficult to adjust and budget for.
good,This industry is beautiful.  I work with great people. I am given the opportunity to meet great people in their time of need.  I am honored to be given this opportunity.
good,"Service Corporation International owns over 2,000 funeral homes and cemeteries. It is a large company but each individual location is operated as if it is a small company. This allows for the benefits to be pretty good but it also means that the culture at each location is vastly different due to the area that its in and the manager. The General Manager or Location Manager depending on the size of the location has a substantial effect on the culture. For instance, in my market there are two locations that are similar in size but the management is poor at one and great at the other. While the corporation management structure doesn't effect how they are ran nor seem to care how it is ran as long as money is made."
good,"I like my job but its really the people that make it hard to want to stay. My General manager is great, I love her but my office manager is very lacking. My benefits are good but we are under paid compared to others."
good,"SCI is the ""McDonald's"" of the funeral business. While it was a good opportunity for  temporary work, and was a good experience, the low pay scale for this level of demanding work was ""ridiculous."""
good,"Typical days at work include "
good,"I learned how to recruit, train and motivate 1099 sales reps while also overseeing multiple offices across the country selling pre need cremations to seniors. As VP of Sales, I was responsible for hitting my monthly sales goals at all offices. Learned the challenges and priority of hiring the right people and also learned what type of person we needed to be successful in our company. That you cannot motivate a person that doesnt have the drive, compassion or work ethic to WANT TO be successful. Amazing learning experience for me. "
good,"It depends who you work for in this industry.  I am blessed to have a great manager and general manager.  Very ""corporate"" business as far as policies and procedures go.  Some things come down the pipeline from people who don't understand the challenges of working in a cemetery day in and day out (long days, short staffed, schedules that change due to the nature of the business, people grieving who take more of your time, ect.)."
good,It was a depressing environment because everyone coming into the office was grieving a lost loved whom had just passed.  I logged remains from the St. Paul facility and answered phone calls for the entire office with little help from the Funeral Director or Sales Manager.  This didn't feel like an Office Manager Position. I felt like a receptionist and accounts receivable and payables person.
good,"Working for SCI is a very rewarding company to work for, working with the familes through difficult transitional experiences. I can see myself as making this the last company I will every work for."
good,"My role was as a SCI counselor and supporting families who had loved ones that just passed.  Also, supporting in pre arrangements for those who want to be ready for if/when their passing happens."
good,"I've been working for SCI for about two years and it has been such a great place to be. There's plenty of room for growth, great benefits, and also great atmosphere to be in."
good,I enjoyed the working at seminars and meeting new families. My previous direct manager did not offer the support that I was expecting being new to the business. Once I was assigned to a locations with continuous access to funeral director I gained more knowledge.
good,SCI was wonderful and great to work for. The company had a great network of support. This is a great place to learn about the funeral business. The staff is very compassionate and helpful  to the bereaved.
good,I wish to remain positive as I absolutely love what I do and the families I serve. I was making 15 an hour for the same exact position for the same company in Michigan but make significantly less money being 12 an hour with a college education and many years experience and training... this is not enough to support myself. I do a great deal and am frustrated with the lack of mobility.
good,"I am a Pre-Planning advisor.  I meet with families to preplan their burial, cremation, or funeral services. Everyone should consider this but many people have a difficult time having this discussion among their families."
good,"Unless you're single I wouldn't advise you to work here. To make money you'll be working 6 days a week to say the least. You must put in 6 months of dedication to developing solid leads but even then your closing date may be subpart. The potential to make money is there but as a PrePlanning Advisor you'll have weeks you will be spinning tires with no pay. Being paid biweekly it's not fun. The market is finicky. Unless they are elderly or the passing of a loved one really stressed them they won't close when you need them to. Prepare to speak with a family for at least a month before they close. As a salesperson there are no ""Now Factors"" no true incentives that'll immediately benefit the family."
good,SCI are leaders in the funeral and mortuary industry.  They provide families/individuals with the services & care needed to address their loved one's final preparations.  The conversations needed to aid the grieving families during their moments of loss can be very difficult at times.
good,"Sales driven - sales first "
good,Understand exactly what you are getting into.  It is sink or swim and there is a huge learning curve without a lot of training.  If you do come out the other side it can very a very lucrative and rewarding career.
good,"Big corporate environment. SCI expects its employees to perform three job titles and pay you for one, they do not want you to work overtime but expect that the job gets done.  Everyone I worked for was great, the company structure was not so great."
good,"Bad Management, people do the least amount of work here and expect a good amount of pay for it, there is a lot of blame shifting and the IT department is very military structured. The general will bump you if needed be."
good,Highly sales focused atmosphere. Can earn a good living but will sacrifice personal and family time. Spend a lot of time in the community making and building relationships to gain leads and seminars.
good,"Depending on the staff you are surrounded by and the leadership chain above you, the majority of SCI careers are secure and financially sound. Taking the time to learn the position, content, vendors, sales structure, and community MUST be a priority."
good,I did the dressing makeup and casketing for ruffly 6000 cases a year for 5 years. reconstruction using wax is one of my strong points.
good,"Great learning opportunity."
good,"I like my supervisors and coworkers, the pay is very low.  Working with grieving customers can be wearing at time, but there is job fulfillment in being able to help people."
good,Administration and contract processing. Working with professional managers.
good,"The staff I work with here is very helpful and very caring. "
good,"Proactive sales manager focused on achieving quota, recruiting, training and coaching Counselors. Assisting to appointments with Counselors and realize the strengths and weakness to increase performance. Various reports to management,    "
good,"No two days are ever alike. Every funeral is different;  cemeteries, churches, funeral directors, funeral homes, and of course, the families, all different experiences.  It takes a while to get familiar with most of the variables.  I have developed several friendships among my peers.  Despite the shortcomings, the pay is much better than other part-time work.  One other huge advantage is that you can take time off without penalty, When the dispatcher calls, say ""No"". No hard feelings, unless you do it too frequently."
good,Compensation should be increased. Overall a decent funeral company to work for. Culture at Oakdale Memorial was fair. Accountability was lacking after the initial training period of 8 weeks.
good,Certain jobs at SCI are better than others. The overall culture is one of support for the clients and employees but some local markets are overworked and underpaid.  Pre-Planning Advisors are paid on a commission basis and expected to work almost non-stop.  There is great potential for income under certain circumstances but for the vast majority of people in this position it is difficult to make a living.
good,Great place to work because you have a clear understanding of how you are affecting the business and the lives of others. There's not much room for advancement for the corporate employees.
good,"SCI is not for every Funeral employee. There's the good and the bad, and I find that it depends on your stage in life that determines the outcome of your experience. "
good,"Very long days, lots of grief and attending funerals and services. 100% commission following up on grieving families. Pay structure is not reasonable and feels preying on families."
good,"The position is sales and you need to meet your goals each month.  If you do not, your work life can become challenging.  For the most part, I met monthly goals and often made quarterly bonuses.  For top producers, income is high."
good,"I enjoyed my job which many cannot understand when your dealing with death. There of course are very sad moments and also very rewarding moments. Because of a job well done either as a pre need service or an at need service brings you referrals.  You have to be a very compassionate person and be able to do what is right for the family. You can't look at your position with dollar signs.Yes you want to make a good living but if your looking thru your eyes with dollar signs, family's can feel that, which will give you a negative review."
good,"was able to uplift families of the loved ones in our care, as well as being able to fix and repair the buildings and families memorials.  This was a prt time job to suppliment the income while working for Dowjones. Dowjones closed down our printing press and I am looking for another full time job as SCI was just to suppliment my income.  This is not a career job for me."
good,"SCI is a unique business.  The culture is mostly family/friendly, but the work is not for the faint at heart.  A typical day could start out as an 8 hour day, yet end up being 12+."
good,"I was the on-call representative for 3 different funeral homes, and my employer worked for the dispatch service. I would be on-call Thursday-Monday from 5:00 pm-9:00 am."
good,"There had been issues with some employees being hostile, but management takes it very seriously and absolutely listens. Very comfortable place to work"
good,"A typical day is meeting with families to finalize the funeral arrangements for their love one, embalming the human remains,  completing any loose ends for the Service and Funeral Directing."
good,Great Job but is not for everyone. Its a sales job. if you sell you get paid but if you don't sell you don't get pay anything... Managers are great. This job gives you a lot of flexibility.
good,"Stable company with long term goals."
good,I enjoyed working there and met some very important people that played a valued role in my life. Very supportive of its employees and look for each person to advance and move on.
good,"work environment is great but some form of management is weak, they very emotional , they full of  racism, they make you sell persons things that don't need to meet there goals"
good,"A typical day for me was spent in the cremated remains, or ""cremains"" room.  There I would keep all the cremains we had to deliver/ store until either they were picked up, a delivery order was sent, or a request that they be mailed was received.  Occasionally I would have to repackage a container of cremains into another decorative urn or a piece of jewelry for the deceased's loved one to wear."
good,"You will spend most of your day's at the office. It's rare to have a completely off day, between clients and work you will always be busy. "
good,"I worked for SCI for 20 yrs and can say they were very good to me ,I received excellent training and support and had many opportunities to advance .I had the privilege to work with many great managers and colleagues over the years ,it was overall a great experience that I don't regret."
good,"In my last job I was entrusted with a variety of responsibilities including coordinating and setting up the office for the opening of a new market in Atlanta, GA. Having worked for the company for a period of six months in Miami, I was transferred to Georgia to be the main point of contact at the new location for everything related to the company policies and regulations, sales team training and contract processing and to welcome the new managers. "
good,Interesting work with dealing with families and local organizations.
good,"I handled filing for applications to open new locations and daily licensing updates. I created and maintained all the forms used by both the Sales and Service Divisions."
good,"Extremely diverse in serving the community.  Great ongoing training, trips etc. The job is very intense and requires work long hours. It is  very rewarding being able to inform, educate and protect families through seminars as well as one on one meetings. The passion behind what we do makes this job rewarding.  Need for more  diversity in management"
good,"I had many jobs at SCI. A switchboard operator which I did until the company was sold, typing projects, mass mailings, keeping files up to date, worked in the mailroom."
good,Strong company in Sales technique. Depends on management to train while still selling and setting appointments. Management is highly qualified in the sales area. Very difficult to not put in 60 to 70 hours per week. Believe very strongly in the products and enjoy meeting with the customers in their homes. Very rewarding to see the relief customers experienced when they purchased. High potential earnings once you have your pipeline built and continue daily prospecting.
good,"Fun and exciting career in sales, opportunity for career advancement. Difficult management style can sometimes. Opportunity learn and develop selling skills including salesforce, prospecting and leadership."
good,"Over 7 years, and I'm still with the company. If you just ""work it"", then you'll be compensated well. When you're struggling, talk to your manager and ask for help. Be your own advocate if things aren't working out for you."
good,I believe the newly created position didn't have clear cut responsibilities. Frequently management would meet with me to discuss job duties and responsibilities. The management was still shaping the position.
good,"-It's not a 9-5 job. Some evenings and weekends are required."
good,"SCI is a fine place to work at. Much of it depends on where you work and under what ladder. Your manager and team are probably awesome. The higher ups tend to... Well, some won’t even tell you hello if you pass them in the halls. They’ll send emails at all hours and the culture tends to make you think you should be replying. Life/work balance at times can feel like they like to talk about t and less follow it. Generalizing of course and focusing a little too much of the harsh. I’d dare even say it’s more mid-management t on the business side and not the field. "
good,"intense data entry"
good,"The overall company itself is great to work for.  I wasn't pleased with departmental favoritism at times.  That made the position I was in uncomfortable to work in daily.  Never felt as part of the team, only when it was necessary."
good,"I really love working here. It is probably one of my most favorite jobs. I rarely dread going to work and they are always willing to work around my schedule. Unfortunately, the pay is very little. It would not be enough to to live on."
good,In a day you could meet with several families in need for a loved one that has passed. Or you may stand for a funeral or cremation. A very different industry. I learned that there is a lot of legal knowledge needed to do the job right. The management was great and supportive but also expected you to get your job done right. The workplace culture is fun and informal behind the scene. Nothing but professional when we are with families.The hardest part of the job is seeing families in so much pain. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping those families through their hardest time.
good,"The company is amazing, it just sucks that they pay below the industry standard. I enjoyed my time working for the company, and I hope to work higher up in the company later in life after I get more experience and then hopefully will be eligible for better pay."
good,"Overall, I've found Dignity Memorial to be a good company. The employees are very nice. In some positions, there is a lack of personal time and time off. Employees are forced to work more than they should because they need to hire more employees in some positions. Sales can be good, but it is commission only. For the amount of support yo provide to the rest of the team, I think this is unfair. It is a corporation so there is a demand to sell more and more. This puts stress on managers who put stress on employees."
good,Days were routine in nature. Presenting value options to families concerning final arrangements is challenging in that no 2 families or members hold absolute parallels concerning the death of loves and how final arrangements for memorialization should be conducted.  The overall environment was pleasant and welcoming on a daily basis. The most difficult portion of the job was to actually engage with families concerning the short sighted approach we as a society have in regards to preparing for our eventual end of days.  Management was highly support and provided necessary training and after augments and assistance to provide sufficient training for success.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is very satisfying help families to be protected and avoid them the burden at the time of loss. I met a lot of wonderful families and learned a lot of them. "
good,"A typical day at work involves focus, energy, efficiency and being able to handle multiple work loads. I took care of all the granite and bronze memorial orders and making sure they were properly installed in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was speaking with family members who lost a loved one. The best part of the job was making sure their loved one was memorialized in a special way that brought them peace and closure."
good,"Good company to work for, the hardest part of the job is the constant changes to procedures.  Training is excellent at the start of employment, it's a bit more fragmented as time goes one, too much time required at the office attending meeting for jobs that are 100% commission."
good,a great place to work and gain knowledge about the industry. However I was offered an opportunity at a advanced management level with increased benefits and pay.
good,"Easy, but busy."
good,Legal Dept Management was very good.  Corporate culture was hard to gauge at times.  Company was going thru some high profile legal issues when I was there that it has since resolved and moved on from them.
good,My manager was good at listening.  Was fair in work assignments.  Product lines are extremely difficult to learn as there is little standardization.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company but felt like I would've been more successful if I had my insurance license as well as a better lead source.  Many people had the same issues.  "
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is helping families to find ways to honor their loved ones after death. This is a very stressful and emotionally taxing position, which requires you to be able to make fast decisions and find innovative solutions with very little time. The work environment is wonderful, since all my co-workers have a true vocation to service and helping the families that we serve."
good,This job was interesting getting to help families deal with the lost of a loved one. Preparing the final arrangements and typing up the death certificates.
good,Rewarding client relationships during personal difficult times for families facing death of a beloved. I enjoyed the role as a counselor.
good,"GOOD PATH FOR FUNERAL BUSINESS"
good,"Great place to work, great benefits and open communication with management. Work environment was very nice. Enjoyed helping families and celebrating their loved ones life."
good,"Working weekends only, I don't get invited to their luncheons or holiday events and I'm really not recognized for anything. I just go in and do my job and go home and there's really not much to my job most days."
good,Data entry on funeral package plans. I learned to work with an office staff. Great manager and office personnel.  I worked in a n environment that really seemed to care about employees. There really wasn't a hard part of the job and just working there was enjoyable. Everyone seemed honest and worked together well.
good,I enjoyed the idea of advancement.  SCI is large enough to be able to advance.  I had a great manager and great co-workers and that's what made it fun to go to work.  The downside is that they are way too expensive for people who are grieving and don't have a lot of money.
good,"I really don't have much to say. I love the job, I respect the folks I work for and have some really good salespeople working for me. Its fun and challenging. Its rewarding and I enjoy the atmosphere. If something else came my way, it would have to be really good."
good,"A typical day at work would include event planning, setting up booths, interacting with customers, and marketing our services. This job helped my advance my career in marketing and customer service."
good,"Due to the industry, family time is not so easily obtained. Sales people had a high turnover because compensation plan was constantly changed.  Only top producers benefited from compensation.  Average sales people made below average wages."
good,As a performance driven and motivated individual I experienced a lot of success from the beginning. Minimal supervision or formal training. Some leads provided based on your closing ratios. Great commission and bonus compensation plan.
good,"The program is one big write off for the company. The cemetery itself has their ""in-crowd"" The manager is great! He's funny and keeps the ball rolling. The bottom line - they will send you to Baltimore for a few days and you will have a great time while you get the ""RA-RA-SISBOOM-BA"" speech. You will get to visit the crematorium and see some awesome crypts and Memorials. After that you will get a handsome salary for 4 weeks then the cord is cut and you are doing the door to door dance. For single people or parents who are in a jam. I love the cemetery biz and funeral home biz but only the very few at the top make the cash. Go for the experience for a few weeks get the quick cash then start looking for a job...quick! It won't last!"
good,"It was a good company, and very professionally run. There was some confusion between different departments. The Lead Generation Program could be improved."
good,As with all big companies they can be a bit scattered but GREAT people! A lot of time on the phone.  You need to be comfortable with cold calls and families that are grieving.
good,"Despite the hours that can accompany this business, the environment is absolutely supportive and your coworkers feel like family.  You see people on their worst days, and it can be emotional, however, it is also fulfilling to be able to assist someone in a hard time. Additionally, the benefits are nice with the position and the retirement contribution increases with tenure."
good,"A typical day at work starts by mowing the lawn, trimming the roses if  it is summer time, and using a leaf blower to clear the side walk. I take a stroll outside the complex to see if any thing needs to be cleaned, For example, trash and weeds. Afterwards, I begin doing janitorial work inside the building to make it appeasing to the employees and customers. what I have learned from this job is that a lot of work is needed to make an appearance of a building nice to attract clients. It is a very enjoyable place to work and and  it easy work. if I could choose the hardest part of this job it would be the commute of having to drive all the way to Mojave. Management has a lot of trust on the employees and may call if a problem is spotted and needs to be fixed."
good,"Lots of good people work here. Depending on the area, the hours can be long."
good,It is a stimulating and challenging position. It is a an honor to help families in their time of need. It is an important job.
good,"The funeral industry is one that demands my full attention 100% of the time.  Each detail of every service, arrangement and phone call is vital to both the family and to me.  "
good,"handled the burial desk.... which is a lot of pressure because if you make a mistake and cause the company money, they let you go."
good,Great compensation and the ability to help people plan for the inevitable. Strong leadership with great opportunity for advancement.
good,"When I started I had no experience in HR, or as a Recruiting Coordinator. It meant so much to me that they looked past my experience and believed in my abilities to become a great employee. After being promoted from Appointment Setter to make 16 an hour at the corporate office I was  beyond excited; It felt like I was finally getting what I deserved for the hard work I put in at my jobs. "
good,"As a sales person, I listened, studied the products and presentation until it was part of me, which provided a good income."
good,I felt like the management team wasn't suppportive when it came down to the employees ideas and concerns about situations that would arise with customers and or company duties. We weren't acknowledged as having a valid opinion. We weren't often listened to or our ideas ever put to use. I think management needs more training on how to hire people for a particular position. And not leave it up to the workers to train them. I would say that was the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable was working with the families.
good,"Working at SCI was an overall positive experience that taught me a lot about the funeral industry. The pay could have been a bit better considering the responsibilities the job entailed; however, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there."
good,The job culture was positive. It provided me the opportunity to help families in my community. It was a contract position at 100% in commission although I was a 1042 employees because taxes and social security were deducted. The management was positive. Although I was paid in commissions only I worked as if it was a 9-5 job.
good,"Locally, our funeral directors and managerial staff can be considered outstanding. They took genuine interest in each and every member of their team. As with many larger companies, the message/treatment from upper management did not always mesh with the local level, because individuals had their own ""agendas"". This is not always a bad thing. Sales management varied over my five years with the company. My original manager was a shining example of how to mentor employees from new hires to established veterans. Following that, sales managers seemed to have a great deal less depth in their focus. They were more like cheerleaders with pom poms when we did well, and did not or could not truly train or counsel. Since the time of my departure, new sales management is now in place. My hopes are that they have hired a nurturer of the mentorship variety. This is not a typical sales position, and it needs to be taught that way."
good,The workplace culture was very good. SCI believes that family is important and supports you when you need to alter your daily schedule to allow you time to work your required hours around a family activity if needed.
good,"Overall my experience was positive. Definitely lots of Pros and Cons but I will not get into that. For the most part, on the sales side of the business people are given the tools to be successful."
good,Review paperwork for cremations.  Talk with directors/arrangers with any questions regarding paperwork..  Hardest part is knowing all the laws to different states.
good,"they had one good manager and one bad  but that was my failing as I trained them both I think"
good,it was a good training program the people there was really friendly it was a good work experience i really enjoyed my job i would recommend anyone to work there for job skills
good,"SCI is very flexible and accommodating with your schedule if needed. They also have great work environments and offer discounts on employee purchases such as car rentals, vehicle purchases, etc. I have found career advancement to be slightly challenging, but they do offer annual raises, 401k, tuition reimbursement, etc."
good,"Great career opportunity both financially and emotionally. A successful counselor earns a commission on cemetery and funeral preened sales, while also meeting with families who have had a loss to help with some of the arrangments."
good,They give you all the tools anyone needs to become successful and make money. There's a wide variety of positions and is a great way to enter the funeral home industry.
good,Gained great experience; it challenged me in some areas and allowed for vocational growth.  Would have considered continuing with the company but relocated out of state.
good,"Everybody will die but very few are willing to talk about it. Out of the few willing to talk about it, you need to get sales out of it. It's not an easy sales job where your product could sell by itself. A typical day consist of conference calls, weekly meeting, presentation, park tours and phone night. "
good,"Other employees are generally nice and supportive, and work together well. The work is infrequently strenuous, and typically fairly slow paced. It can also be surprisingly fun, as there are many company and community events that the funeral homes participate it."
good,I was able to learn many aspects of the funeral and cemetery business. I have felt good about the job I have done helping the people that are in need of assistance during a trying time in there lives.
good,"My ministry is to do what I love and that is serving families. My company  trained me to be an embalmer, funeral director and celebrant/ulogist for home going ceremonies.  The management provided me with tuition reimbursement benefits as well as paid vacations and valuable training.  The location I worked for was very face paced with many interruptions and distractions,  which was the hardest part of the job.  My most valued experiences was to serve families and see them celebrate the  home-going services of their  loved ones  and finally reach the last stage of grieving which is acceptance."
good,Fast paced work environment taking care of the needs of field management/staff and consumers.  Climate can be very political at times.  Projects and goals are often too compartmentalized.
good,great place to work I love my job everyone is great I have a wonderful boss i'm able to make decisions within my job scope. The company promotes within
good,Great place to gain skills. Fast paced working environment. Staff is kept to a minimum at each location. Employees can be stretched very thin in some markets.
good,"Great company to work with."
good,"The prearranged funeral business isn't for everyone.  I worked with very nice people, and enjoyed meeting the families, however, I realized that this was too depressing of an environment for me."
good,"Be prepared to have no life."
good,"I loved the people I worked with - management was hit or miss but mostly I loved it. Overall it was a good experience and people genuinely care about each other."
good,"associated due to merger.The two largest companies in U.S. merged. SCI being the larger, already had personnel in place that did our jobs. Therefore we were phased out in merger."
good,A large company. Many opportunities to move to other locations and jobs.
good,"Work hard, stay focused, and be a professional in all situations.  You will be given all the tools to succeed and be successful, but you will have to keep learning and building your brand.  The more that you practice and study, the more stronger you will be with your presentations and closings."
good,SCI is has over 3500 locations (funeral homes and cemetery's) all over the United States. SCI has 4 locations is Tucson AZ. SCI is very well respected and treat families with dignity respect. SCI offers many benefits to families that prearrange for their services such as child and grandchild protection. Family protection for anyone that pre purchases cemetery property (cemetery paid in full if balance is still owed if purchased before age 65).
good,"The people I work with directly on my team are some the most amazing women and men I have ever met.  These people are kind, hard working and serve our families well.  Management is willing to listen to your ideas or concerns, whether they can act on your comments or not.  The hardest part would be having to work long days and some weekends through the year."
good,I enjoyed my time at Neptune Society. I learned a lot about the industry and was able to contribute to the sales department as the Office Manager. It was a great team environment
good,good place to work if you are a sales closer. must have a strong stomach. You will be working with funeral directors have to work with dead peoples family
good,I got to wear many hats. I still keep in touch with my former employees. People are very compassionate in their work. Great benefits and company events.
good,This is a very taxing emotional job due to the nature of the business. The management team was very helpful and supportive. There is a lot to learn due to state and federal laws. Very supportive atmosphere. This is a job that takes a while to build up your pipeline. People were very supportive and understanding.
good,"Good place to work, lots of different people and different cultures. Very sales driven, sales meetings every morning by phone. Manager very willing to go on sales calls to help close difficult or big sales."
good,Great company to make money and get perks on funeral and burial. Very demanding schedule including weekends all based on meeting or exceeding quota. Very stressful environment.
good,Good place to work if you like that kind of work. The management of the company was good at training you for the job. The co-workers was very helpful in teaching you the system.
good,This was a good place to work at the managers were excellent and the training was amazing. I learned a lot and everyone was always open to help.The hours were up to me i could put in as many hrs as i wanted.
good,"Very easy layed back,professional environment and learned a lot. It was a nice place to work everyone was very welcoming and helped me out when i had questions."
good,"Fast pace and nice place to work.  Learned most of my computer skills.  Management is fair.  Workplace culture is friendly. "
good,"Benefits, pay and management were awesome when I first started working at Dignity. Towards the end of my employment commissions were reduced drastically, commission employees were placed on a quota. It made it impossible to make any money. Also, family service employees constantly sold to families that community service counselors had reached out too."
good,I got the feeling the new supervisior hep his friends than others.. The area manager play favorites with the females. They always recieved awards. He Died after I left so I do not know how it is now.
good,"SCI is a nice place to work for work-life balance.  The pay is low, however, and I am currently working an extra job to make ends meet.  The employees all seem very nice."
good,A great place to work with room for advancement. You work hard and play hard. There's never a dull moment and you have to go with the flow when it comes to sales. Great benefits and they treat you like family.
good,"How do you integrate technology into a non-technological culture? Slowly, with an emphasis on cost/benefit analysis, and selling efficiencies as good, not as job killers."
good,Not all locations will be the same however even though I had to leave due to life complications my experience with the locations I was at was great both have great things they can learn from one another. I do like the services that company provides to families. I believe the company can pay better to their people though and allow for time off. other then that it is a good company.
good,Unless it's personal the supervisor will purchase work equipment such as boots coveralls most things to deal with outside weather & good work will reward with free scheduled lunches from time to time
good,"Working for this company, one must maintain a careful sense of understanding since you are dealing with families who have lost their loved ones.  This company supports the funeral and cemetery needs for families."
good,"It was a challenge to please the company.  My profit margins were excellent but they always wanted more.  I focused on customer service which they want, but they had so many meetings it was hard to do.  Had to make choices between clients and meetings.  I always chose the clients."
good,"Working in the funeral industry is surprisingly rewarding and even enjoyable. Meeting with families and helping them during the most difficult time in their lives is an experience that I am so glad that I was able to participate in. The work itself was very difficult at times,as one must handle dead bodies but I enjoyed making our ""customer"" look their very best and helping families with the final details."
good,"Removing and transporting the deceased to and from place of death to the care center/mortuary/coroners. I learned lots of new things and found myself being more comfortable talking to management, driving larger vehicles and speaking to families. My coworkers were always good people for the most part. My supervisor was by far the best one I have ever had as far as being approachable. The hardest part of the job was remembering certain rules and laws that came with the job as well as some procedures. Another hard thing was dealing with some coworkers in which management did nothing about. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to provide some closure to families in the final moments with a loved one."
good,"SCI was a great company to work, I learned few things, the co-workers were friendly in a positive environment. The job position was under pressure."
good,I learned compassion from dealing with grieving families. Spent five years working and learned many skills in the funeral business.
good,This is a very good company to work for. Outside of local management and the politics that's go on.
good,"SCI Direct otherwise known as Neptune Society, is a sister company of Service Corporation International. In December they will officially become SCI Direct. I worked in a small office upstairs the main office where people would come to pick up their families cremains, and meet to sign up for our services. When my grandmother passed it was an awful experience for our family, and I felt like this job was an opportunity for me stress the importance of pre-planning with others who thought it was important too. We would receive mailers, and email requests for more information in Volocify as warm leads. The leads would contain their name, address, city, state, and if they were a veteran. I made over a 100 calls daily to set appointments for 5 Independent Sales Reps. My goal was to set up 3 appointments for each of the ISR's. "
good,"project manager"
good,"•	Perform routine skin puncture and venous blood samples"
good,"I injoyed my position at the Neptune Society, my expertise is Customer Service/working with people making sure that all aspects"
good,"very goal minded onrieted, be prepared ahead of time on what you have for the day ahead of you and tomorrows, I learned sales and how it works, Management are there 100% for advice or extra training, I learned alot from them, even though co-workers are busy, their still there to help you for any advice and very friendly, the hardest part of the Job is the loss of a loved one, and do your best to comfort the families, the most enjoyable part of the job, is meeting your goal"
good,I learned a vast amount during my time at SCI. I enjoyed working with the other counselors and management in my division. Everyone is extremely helpful.
good,"A typical day at work is meeting with a family to finalize their love ones funeral arrangements.  Our management team members are calm and laid back.  They do not place a lot of pressure on the employees.  The hardest part of the job is making sure the consumer gets the clothing, photos, the Obituary etc... to me in a timely manner.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure the families have a beautiful celebration for their love one,"
good,"A typical day includes lots of prospecting and meeting with clients. Preplanning and giving needed information was the most enjoyable part of the job; and I learned that a good plan goes a long way. I enjoyed going to work and helping all those that came before me. The hardest part was helping those who had no plan and left things to chance and their loved ones to take care of. all in all a great place to learn about diversity, and many different cultures."
good,It's more structured for those who need the assistance and less for those who are excelling at their job! Lots of incentives and recognition. They are also pretty encouraging and give sales counselors the tools and knowledge to advance their career.
good,You can look at your job as a ministry.  Serving the families in their most difficult time can definitely be rewarding not just financially but spiritually.
good,"I enjoyed working at SCI but there was not a defined plan for advancement and my manager didn't seem at all invested in my success.  BUT, that was not the case throughout the company.  I would go back."
good,"Directly coming on board, management was fantastic. I made more money than I ever have in my life and I got so much time to see my family. After some adjusting and loss of key members of management it's a totally different company. On the local level everyone was great to work with. Upper management however has no concern for office dynamics, they just want results and it comes off as feeling like just another company instead of a local funeral home"
good,"I came into the job knowing it was a sales job, however, I decided to just service as many families as I could instead of seeing them as dollar signs.  It paid off!  The base is minimum wage.... but you don't have to make that.  I made minimum wage for the first 6 weeks... that's because I was in training and getting to know the park.  After that, I tried to help families I knew, and families I would get to know, and it has paid off.  I was meant for this."
good,"SCI is comprised of some of the nicest, most compassionate people I have ever met.  While this is beneficial to our client families, these individuals do not necessarily make the best business people."
good,"Great company to work for. "
good,overall great company to work for and very rewarding careers
good,Great services to sell and great management but no benefits at all. 
good,Great place to work. Managers are supportive and provide an excellent work-life balance. Pay is a bit below the market and diversity at the Executive level is lacking.
good,"This place is for a certain kind of people. If interested in this work place there's some qulities one must posses, for example a positive outlook, motivated and with the need to help others."
good,"The company offers many opportunities to contribute to the industry.  By working for this company you are able to learn so much about the ""business side"" of funeral service."
good,You will like working here if you have a passions for people. There management was the only con. They are all young and inexperienced. Overall not bad.
good,SCI is a great company to be apart of. They offer a variety of different career paths in the death care industry and will help you gain the necessary certifications to help you advance within the company
good,"To succeed as a Family Service Counselor will require long hours, nights and weekends - but the pay was exceptional.  The pay is commission driven, so the annual pay varied year by year.  Nevertheless the largest pay-stubs I ever earned was from this company.  The local and immediate management was exceptional."
good,"A typical day at work involve logging data into SAP. I learned the importance of keeping information accurate throughout all systems. Management was extremely helpful, everyone was treated as a team member not an employee. My co-workers were extremely knowledgable and helpful.

good,Recommended to those looking to succeed both in building relationships and growing personally thru the opportunities and benefits and tools provided by SCI.

good,Everything was great while working for the Service Corporation International. My General Manger was a positive influence on me always. Everyone from the regional manager to a receptionist always treated me with respect and made me feel like part of the team.
good,"So far, it has been a good work experience. I would really prefer getting an annual raise, if I get a good review. It is working hard to keep the place running smoothly. There are always things to do. I maintain the office with making sure that we have the supplies needed, ordering coffee supplies, and other supplies. The dress code is pretty casual. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the scattering calendar. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with people in person and over the phone."
good,"All members of the team work together to help our families in need, during their loss and into the future."
good,Great company with very dedicated long-term employees. Management focuses on teamwork and enabling everyone to perform their best. The company invests in the development of their team members.

good,"A typical day at work was filing, running daily reports, tracking orders in my spreadsheet, ordering, taking payments & helping others with a question about their ordering stats. I learned how to fill out deposit slips & code invoices when necessary. The people I worked with were very nice & helped me whenever I needed a hand."
good,"Have enjoyed working with the company for 13 years.  Have always helped me advance further and grow with the company.  "
good,"Work was not fulfilling, typical cube life counting down the moments to go home. Found there to be too many meetings to solidify more meetings, each day was the same as the last for the most part, although having wonderful people surrounding you all day."
good,"SCI, provides employees that opportunity to assist families in the one thing we all dread and try to avoid, but we all must face."
good,"You need to be an independent contributor even though you are part of a team.  Your income is dependent on your activity.  If you are in sales, you will probably learn more from your teammates than management."
good,"Reception work, staff assistant, daily interaction with people.  Enjoyed the people I worked with, my manager was very understanding. The nature of the business was to help people in every way you can."
good,Requires attention to detail and compassionate demeanor. This line of work is humbling and very rewarding. I enjoyed going into work every day knowing I would be joining others who share the same desire to help families heal.
good,"As part of the team for each company and position that I held was an opportunity to exercise my integrity, skills and experience."
good,"Being able to help families in need was a great experience to be a part of. The wide spectrum of people coming together to make one's last wishes come true was amazing. I did a little bit of everything during my time there, and I don't think I could say anything negative about the company."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company.  Training was provided. The only possible down side to this company would be having to work strictly for commission.  You have to put in the time to make the money.
good,"SCI has a great career opportunity in their Family Services Counselor  role.  This work is soooo important, makes an incredible difference to the families you meet along the way.  No question--this is a sales job.  Be prepared for consistent application of your 'I can help you--let's get you signed up' talk track.  "
good,"I spent 10 years altogether in this great company. I recommend it to anyone. The industry is fascinating, presents technical challenges for the accounting finance profession."
good,"Good company pay is not to level with the amount of responsability required from their Family counselors, the pay scale must be re adjusted to justify the 40 plus hours a week."
good,This is an excellent company to work for. The managers are awesome and always available for you. I can trust any of them to be there for me whenever I need them. The time you put in is mostly on your own schedule. I just realize total commission sales is not for me. I am more customer service and not just a sales person.
good,"It was  nice working at SCI, but had to leave got a better offer. "
good,What I liked most about the job was being able to educate families on the importance of pre-planning. It felt like a meaningful career being able to help families on one of the worst days of their lives
good,Need more support emotionally and less hardships. Not all people are kind enough to take time check on others to make sure they are okay. We are humans too.
good,"The Good: 1st class benefits, 401k matching.  Incentive trips and alternative pay plan for top performers.  Strong management team committed to support and success of team."
good,The people working at SCI are the best example of family.  They are dedicated to supporting each other and their community.  I learned that working within proven guidelines and structures are important to the responsibility of all.  The hardest part was determining the difference with responsibility and accountability.  What I want from my employer was not necessarily what my employer wanted to provide.  I enjoyed working for a system that asked little from the customer and allows me to take on the burden of handling their needs so they experience freedom and ease in the passing of their loved one and they are free to acknowledge and respect the life they lived.
good,Very laid back work environment with  Independent work. There is no chance for advancement. Several attempts at advancement were blocked by direct supervisor.
good,"It was an ideal job to help people in need.  Compassion, understanding and helpfulness all used during the course of a day."
good,I set up appointments as well as an office assistant. Including setting up and braking down seminaries and made all packages and gift bag's given to families. Answered all incoming and performed out going calls as well. On a daily basis i would set up all the paper work and refreshments for the meetings as well as greeting and welcoming and directing customers.
good,"Great place to work, Management helped you move up and explore more opportunities within company.  Good Company Culture."
good,Great spot to work.  The SR leaders are some of the best.  The company has always thought of the members of the staff as family.  100% recommend it.  Through out my time I have enjoyed it.
good,If you are looking to enter into the funeral service industry it is a great place to start. You can attend classes and get a hands on experience here.
good,You have to have a passion to do this work. It's not just a job. Meeting people who are grieving is who you will meet. You have to be empathetic.  You must also be flexible to do any job in the company.
good,"Great company to work for. They offer many benefits. Great atmosphere, great team work. Plenty of incentives well trained and professional management."
good,"Would definitely work for them again had a wonderful experience."
good,"Day were long at times but fulfilling, the company allow me to connect with the community. Support Community Events.  To help people to prepare for death so that the family would not have to suffer and not know what they would have wanted their final wishes to have been."

good,"I look at my position at the Neptune Society as a ministry or caring for the deceased and their families.  I have been there only a few months but I really enjoy the work, and the management and people I work with are outstanding."
good,Enjoyed working there.  Comradery.  Flexible.  Position of Preneed Counselor (outside sales) very demanding and can be 24/7 when starting out.  Good benefits.
good,"Working with this company was like being with family...entire staff was awesome, loving and great. We worked well together as a team.I learned from them and they learned from me. I went from Receptionist to Admin. Assist to Funeral Counselor in 8+ years."
good,"Heavy phone coverage was an all-time event. I learned some of the responsibilities of my co-workers when I would volunteer to assist them when I had some down-time. Management was professional, but was lenient when necessary. My co-workers and I all worked well together and there were never any cat-fights or discrepancies in the office with so many females, due to the maturity of those employed. The hardest part of the job was depending upon other departments to provide time-sensitive documents that were needed to meet subpoena deadlines. When others don't take the same approach towards promptness as you do; it has a tendency to reflect upon you. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting my goals before time and helping those in distress"
good,"Loved working with my families."
good,"i learned a lot about working cemetary grounds and maintaining professionalism within the work place, as well as time management for projects. Hardest part of the job is the physical labor required day to day, but most enjoyable part is helping families."
good,SCI is a great place to work with a great atmosphere for employees with team building.  Awesome opportunities for growth.  The company offers good benefits to top it off.
good,Working here was very systematical and orderly and I have no complaints. I just wish that we would've gotten paid more for a job that no one else performs.
good,"Nice company, people are very friendly.Late nights sometimes and work on the weekend.  No benefits and a lot of the pay is commission based.  Managers are very nice and respectful"
good,This job is very easy you learn to do different things. You learn to care for others in their time of grief. You’ll learn to look out for others in case the other individual is busy you learn to be a team.
good,"A typical day at work here is spent along side the families we serve, and ensuring to our best abilities that every one of their needs is met. I learned about applying compassion and dignity to the work place , and really taking time to listen to our guests. Management is very considerate to our families, and they try their best to ensure that their employees are taken care of as well."
good,"A typical day is very busy we see a lot of families, Everyday you learn something new and your team is right there to help you through whatever you need. "
good,"I have worked for SCI for a little over fifteen years both as a full-time Funeral Director/Embalmer and as an Embalmer only.  My time has been both challenging and rewarding.  Overall, I have enjoyed my time with the company.  The ones that complain are probably the ones that are not willing to abide by the company policies and procedures.  While the pay could be a little better for seasoned employees, the benefits compensate for the  lower pay scale. Basically, you get out of any job what you are willing to put into it."
good,Worked for this company for 15 years.  Very good working environment and learned a lot working in various positions within the company.  Work life balance is very good as well.
good,I enjoyed my time there.  Many hours spent working weekends to accommodate the services was the only drawback.  Good supervisors that were willing to train and teach to help staff advance.
good,"Very professional setting with staff and management willing to help with growth for all employees. Management that gives the extra push on employees to make sure they progress, making sure they know how to make families feel welcome and at ease. My job was to make sure that I educate and inform families on about the benefits of preplanning so they can make a well informed decision."
good,Wonderful company to work within. Working in this industry teaches you to be more compassionate and to humble yourself. It's rewarding to know you are helping someone during the worst days of their lives.

good,"Service Corp. International is the largest death care company in the nation.  It is a public traded company on the stock exchange listed as SCI.  Great people, great company"
good,"What I learned:"
good,I would do sales for Cemetery and Funeral. I would go to families homes and consult them about every different package that Dignity memorial offers. I would have to go door knocking and get customers on my own.I really enjoyed that job but it was kind of difficult to sell cemetery lots to people no one like to take about death especially about our own .Also getting paid by commission was difficult at times.
good,Service families at a devastating time in there lives. Assist with all of the preparations for the final resting.
good,"This is a great company to work for.  I met so many interesting people and learned a great deal about management and being a team leader.  I was groomed by one of the best men in the business along with his boss.  They saw my potential took me under their wing and showed me the path to success.  In just a short time I was thriving and was lecturing in other markets all over the United States and our market had thrived after I was brought on board and implemented certain procedural and new ideas.  The actual job of Market Administrator was created especially for me in our market and had never been done before.  It is my understanding that at this time every market (about 45) with the exception of 4 now have a Market Administrator, which makes me very proud to have been a part of this."
good,"Loved working there, was fast paced and flexible yet gave many opporunities to be very prosperous in sales"
good,"Provided you want to learn and grow, this is an EXCELLENT company.  They don't have time for slackers, and really appreciate a hard-working, dedicated employee.  The management team is fair and approachable.  The staff is diverse, kind, and knowledgeable."
good,Keep busy for 8 hours. The more production you have the more families you're able to help. Talk to your friends and families. Use personal experiences and asked them if they've ever had to make final decisions for their loved one.
good,"the training was great awesome industry the only reason i left was medically related...money was awesome would consider going back if i had the chance,but right now on to other things."
good,"Worked their for four years. Made great friends, both management as well as co workers. Work at times became difficult standing for three to six hours at a time. My neuropathy became tuff to deal with."
good,"So far it looks like a great company managers are very helpful and training was very easy you get all the tool to start working, no micromanage just do your job and you will be ok"
good,"Was a great place, but they went out of business. I start at $9 per Hr and finished at $15 in a year. I was very happy with my job there, worked 4 days, 10 hrs but get Friday, Saturdays and Sundays off, love my managment, and my coworkers. miss this place."
good,"Busy environment. Family service Counselor. Demonstration of cross-functional knowledge with proven operational success. Proactive planner with the ability to nurture credibility and confidence with management and plant personnel.

good,I really enjoyed my time At SCI. I had worked for the company several years prior to 2016 and decided to returned based on may initial positive experience. The training that I received for the position was effective and invaluable. I was always received well at whatever location I was assigned.
good,"A typical day consists of prospecting, sales presentations and closings.  I have learned about the Funeral Industry.  Management is motivating, provide extensive training and support.  The culture is competitive but very supportive, everyone is willing to cover for one another and provide assistance when needed.  The hardest part lead generation and the most enjoyable is getting to know the incredible families we serve and knowing that we have helped them protect their loved ones."
good,It is a fast paced office with a large workload. I was a very enjoyable workplace most of the time. You must be able to work independently and take charge when needed. I would recommend this company to anyone who would be interested. The only reason I left was to relocate back to my home state. If they had an opening near me I would have continued my employment with this company.
good,"SCI is a wonderful industry for the most part. Based off of my experience I have gained I would not change a thing. I only wish that the compensation is where people say it should be. We provide a tremendous service to the families we serve. However, by doing so it does take a toll on the body in both professional and private life. In all cases funeral directors go above and beyond for our families and although there are areas that will benefit us in compensation (Bonuses) it isn't enough to successfully make a comfortable living single therefore the same if one were wanting to support a family on one salary."
good,Great company to work for.  Awesome benefits and Pay!!  This company provides excellent time off as well as many perks other funeral providers can not.
good,"Company is fair and advancement opportunities are excellent. Great Benefits and many options for both sales and operations. Great culture, winning attitude, and company does the right thing for its families."
good,A great company that cares for its customers and its employees.  What I enjoy most is that we help families through the worst time of their lives. As a manager I can say that the company treats us well. They spare no expense in the annual convention. They offer full benefits such as health insurance and employer matching retirement plan. SCI Diect is also the largest provider of pre-need cremation services in the US and Canada. Since this is a fast growing industry the comany is also growing which offers job security.
good,my was th difrentjob e best working experience  i ever had in all my  years of working very diferent job situations  every day of the week.the team work was a plus at this company..
good,I only worked for this place for a short amount of time. I was a driver for funeral home and was responsible for picking up deceased persons and taking them to their destination. I assisted with dressing and casketing. I loved this job and the hardest part was when they put me on funeral assisting. I didn't like that very much because I cried at every funeral.
good,"This company is great to work for and an employee can trust what they promise"
good,I thought gravedigging was going to be a lot harder than it actually was and my co-workers were great. A lot of opportunity to learn skills as grounds and building maintenance.

good,"Muy buena empresa, oportunidad de crecimiento y ambiente sano de trabajo"
good,"As a Pre-planning Advisor, you are trained well. The effort that you put into it definitely will pay off... but you must be self-motivated and keep at it. It's not always easy."
good,"Not for the faint of heart but you learn to love what you do. Helping people is a trait that not everyone has, you have to have it in you. It can be emotional and stressful, but as long as you’re goal is to make sure the families are happy, you’ll be fine."
good,"No problems. "
good,"This job changed my life.  I am more than proud of the work I did while working for SCI.  It's definitely all about the location.  Sunset Hills in Bellevue has an amazing team and it was an honor to be a part of it.  The pay was very good, but the job isn't for everyone.  "
good,"I learned lots, had fun, and met lots of dedicated people. Each person working there were a wealth of information, and more than willing to teach  me the ropes."
good,"I started door knocking in Florida as PAF counselor..In 3 short months was promoted to Sales Manager of the Moss Feaster group . That was the true beginning of the great mentor ship I received . I grew into larger roles and responsibilities within the Florida region as high as Regional Vice President . The growth and learning led me into the largest Cemetery Region in the company as a Senior Vice President of Sales in the Mid Atlantic Region . I than became the Market Director to the Territory Director ."
good,I learned a lot from working in this delicate environment. I acquired vast experience in an administrative role and working in a busy workplace that requires strict attention to detail.
good,"They are a powerful company, I learned a lot, did not care for the manager, but the company was great.  I made good money with them, they make sure of offering many trainings and opportunities for advancement.  I just wanted to go a different directions for a career."
good,"Very busy is a typical day at work. I have learned many different areas of accounting and management. "
good,"Depending on your location, it can be quite busy and fast paced. I enjoyed my time there and there are multiple opportunities to make more money. It's up to you and how motivated you are and the goals you set. I made many great friends in the funeral business while working for SCI. I'm a money driven person, so I enjoyed the possibility of making more than my base pay with incentives, and overtime."
good,"It was an honor to work at Palm Mortuary and Cemeteries.  The people make it great.  Las Vegas is lucky to have such a well established “family business” taking care of its community. "
good,"Everything about this company is great. You would be fortunate to be part. It is very pro active and cares about the employee. Although I have rated high, the location is seriously understaffed."
good,"I work in the corporate sector for a company whose primary line of work centers around providing compassionate care and service excellence.  Being behind the scenes, I have seen how much the managers and directors care about doing a good job and maintaining ethical integrity.  This integrity is seen on all levels within the company and, as a result, they demand a high standard of support and response from the corporate support services. The job can be stressful at times because whatever you do directly affects someone who is suffering a great loss.  There is a lot of pressure, but the company supports its staff with whatever they need to succeed."
good,"SCI has proven to be a company that takes care of its employees, especially with the recent hurricanes that heavily affected the Houston area and Puerto Rico. The company had locations and corporate headquarters that were damaged but still took the time and funds to help provide for associates in need. The amount of compassion that senior leadership showed in this time of need was greatly appreciated and did not go unnoticed. The atmosphere of teamwork was also proven as associates rallied together and helped one another with whatever was needed. As an employer, SCI looks to grow its people and promote from within when possible. They offer a friendly PTO allowance and a culture that promotes work life balance."
good,"I have learned to be very efficient, to work with little to no supervision and how to manage when working on a strict deadline. Not only that I also gained the ability of calculating time and leave by hand. The management was wonderful, worked right along with us when things started to pile up."
good,"Dignity Memorial is the largest provider of funeral and cemetery needs.  There is a lot of room for advancement. For the most part, management is easy to work with and very helpful to new employees. Most of my fellow employees were great to work with and I have made some friends that I will have for years to come.  Getting people to realize the importance of taking care of their end of life needs can be very difficult, most people don't want to talk about it."
good,"Took care of the administrative duties for the General Manager and Location Manager. Answered phones, sorted and delivered mail.  Trained receptionist on Microsoft Word, Excel, Workday (Timesheet info). Prepared files for SOC Audit."
good,"This is a great place to work. I left SCI when I was approached by another company that was offering a really good opportunity, but had I never been approached, I would have never left. Leadership is awesome here  and they believe in making the workplace a best-in-class environment. All employees of SCI are dedicated to making a family's worst day one of their best days. The people I worked with were like family and I miss them every day. If you are looking for a great place to work, this is where you should start looking first."

good,Excellent industry to work in. I learned that each day you must be willing to increase your efforts as well as profitablity. I was very fortunate to work with a great group of managers that were committed to thier jobs. I believe that my direct reports were some of the best group of people I have ever worked with. The most difficult part of my job wasn't the emotions that many if not all of the families I was previledge to service. However what I enjoyed the most was when a customer informed me and the staff that we were able to meet and exceed thier expectations.
good,Good company enjoy the work culture and work life balance. The employees are family to each other and our customers. If you love people and helping families during the worst moment if their lives then SCI is the company for you.

good,Enjoyed my job completely. Opportunity for advancement was truly a plus. Community involvement was encouraged and esprit d'corps between coworkers and departments was awesome.
good,Secure appointments to consult families on their options for the final funeral and cemetery arrangements. Management was very helpful and would assist with any field assignments. Co-workers were very helpful everyday infact it was recommended you help in in way possible. The hardest part of the job was the subject.......death and getting ready for the final day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relief you could feel from the families knowing they had done the right thing and not leave that burden to their loved ones.
good,"typical day has very busy calls"

good,"The work I did at SCI was commission based, I did very well breaking quotas all the time and that is why I was so happy there. If you do not do well on commissions it will not be he place for you. I was at 312% above commission quota in 2005, so I was honored at the millio0naire's club, I was given incentives and bonuses, Christmas catalogs to pick which gifts I wanted, cruises and vacations, basically I was treated like royalty...but I did not only beat my quotas, I was beating them with numbers like 312% above, which is not the norm, not everyone does that well. Looking back my percentages on the commissions probably should have been higher. I think my average commission was about 7% and later other carriers were happily paying me a much better rate; that being said, I would do it all over again in a heart beat!"
